                "body": "Opinion | As the US dollar weakens, all that glitters is gold\nThe world must choose between believing in the authority of central banks to decide the worth of fiat currencies or trusting in gold as a store of value\nAmid these crises, gold prices are now over US$5,500 per ounce, up over 27 per cent from the price on January 1. This comes after the price of gold jumped by 65 per cent in 2025 after soaring by 27 per cent in 2024.\nAt such returns, why should one even consider bonds that yield 4 per cent per annum with possible foreign exchange depreciation or fiscal default?\nThe foreign exchange reserves of all central banks stood at around US$13 trillion in 2025, with official gold holdings at 36,000 tonnes. At the current gold price of US$5,500 per ounce, central banks\u2019 gold value would be US$6.37 trillion, which would bring central bank reserves (including gold) to US$19.37 trillion. Thus, gold represents nearly 33 per cent of total reserves which in turn would be 16.5 per cent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s policy gyrations and high levels of fiscal debt have caused major investors to reduce their dollar weighting in key portfolios, with the US dollar depreciating at least 6.4 per cent in real effective exchange rate terms in 2025. An example of high dollar exposure with no gold holdings is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, Norges Bank Investment Management, with US$2.1 trillion in assets, which held 53 per cent of its portfolio in US equities, bonds and real estate combined at the end of 2025. Norway is next door to Greenland.\nTrump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which front-loaded tax cuts and increased spending, was estimated by the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget to raise federal debt by US$15 trillion, or as much as US$31 trillion if tax cuts are made permanent, increasing the debt-to-GDP to an eye-popping 172-190 per cent of GDP."

                "body": "Across the Middle East, oil and gas operators are acquiring larger, denser and more complex seismic datasets to unlock increasingly subtle geological targets\nBut as data volumes grow into the hundreds of billions of traces, the real challenge is no longer just acquisition. It is how quickly and confidently those datasets can be turned into actionable insight.\nWhen growing data volumes are coupled with modern processing and imaging algorithms, such as elastic multi-parameter full waveform inversion, and the continued rise of artificial intelligence (AI) based workflows, the result is that high performance computing (HPC) systems are being pushed harder than ever. This of course intensifies demands on power, cooling and scalability. For energy giants, a key challenge is ensuring their HPC infrastructure remains fit-for-purpose to keep pace with modern geoscience.\nGlobal technology company DUG is known for its state-of-the-art software and its network of some of the largest supercomputers on Earth. Against a constantly evolving hardware landscape, the Australian-born company is keeping its edge with the deployment of 82 new NVIDIA H200 machines, adding 41 petaflops of compute power to its global data-centre capacity. Each machine delivers an order-of-magnitude performance uplift over DUG\u2019s fastest CPU-only hardware, further reducing the company\u2019s turnaround times across both testing and production workflows.\nThe operational realities of a modern HPC facility also present significant opportunities for reducing both cost and environmental footprint. One way that DUG has maximised the energy efficiency of its HPC ecosystem is through the use of immersion cooling \u2013 where servers are submerged directly into a fluid that removes heat far more effectively than air. The technology supports significantly higher compute density, reduces power consumption and creates a stable environment without hot spots, dust or oxidation. Immersion allows operation at higher temperatures compared to air-cooling, thereby also reducing reliance on evaporative cooling, allowing hybrid or dry-cooling configurations that lower water use. This ultimately makes efficiency and sustainability part of the same design.\n\u201cOur data-centre upgrade significantly increases our total compute power,\u201d said Harry McHugh, chief information officer at DUG. \u201cThis translates to even faster delivery of huge datasets and more computationally intensive workloads, from AI-inference applications, to advanced seismic processing and imaging workflows, including our revolutionary DUG Elastic MP-FWI Imaging technology\u201d,\n\u201cDesigning and operating at this scale gives us intimate knowledge of what modern HPC demands in practice \u2013 and this expertise drives the solutions we build and operate for our clients.\u201d\nWith its new Abu Dhabi office supporting large-scale projects across the region, and a technology stack built around energy-efficient HPC and advanced imaging algorithms, DUG is primed to power the next wave of discovery in the Middle East, delivering faster, clearer and more reliable subsurface insights."

Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) merger announcement will likely make big changes in the entertainment world, pending anti-trust scrutiny, a competing bid from Skydance, and an April 2026 shareholder vote. The merger could potentially impact not only film and tv media (franchises like Batman, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Dune), but also areas where Netflix has no current foothold, such as in news (CNN), theme parks, printed media (books, magazines and comics), and other sectors.\nOther industry shaking mergers in defense and aerospace (United Technologies and Raytheon) and financial (JP Morgan Chase acquiring Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and Wachovia in the wake of the 2008 banking meltdown) mergers are still being felt today.\nUpstart Indies\nDevon Energy and Coterra Energy are both large independent shale oil producers in the Permian Basin region. At the time of this writing:\n- Cotera has a $21.4 billion market cap and a 3.14% yield.\n- Devon has a $25 billion market cap and a 2.4% yield.\n- Devon produced 853,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in Q3 2025, with 390,000 bpd of oil.\n- Coterra produced 785,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in Q3 2025, with 166,800 bpd of oil.\n- Coterra was formed in 2021 through the merger of Cabot Oil and Gas and Cimarex Energy but has struggled ever since.\n- Although discussions with Devon have advanced to a near completion, Coterra may have other suitors in the wings, just like Skydance is still also interested in Warner Bros. Discovery.\nWhy An Indie Merger Is a Big Deal\nAlthough both Devon and Coterra are dwarfed by large multinational rivals like ExxonMobile, Diamondback Energy, and Occidental Petroleum, they hold several advantages in the Permian Basin region:\n- The deal could combine Devon\u2019s extensive Permian (Delaware Basin) 400,000 acreage with Coterra\u2019s 346,000 acres of strong assets in the Permian, Marcellus Shale, and Anadarko Basin.\n- Diamondback Energy\u2019s $26 billion acquisition of Endeavor Energy is the largest shale oil industry deal to date; A Devon and Coterra merger would wind up between $57-$60 billion, thus the largest ever in the industry.\n- Greater economies of scale and cost cutting measures have grown to paramount importance in the oil industry as prices have fallen below $75 per barrel and are now approaching $60 per barrel. The merger of DVN\u2019s and CTRA\u2019s adjacent properties would considerably reduce drilling, pipeline, and other operations much cheaper.\n- The merger would put the consolidated company in a much stronger position to challenge its multinational rivals in the shale oil industry.\nThe glut of oil now in the market, thanks to the US control of Venezuelan oil after the arrest of Dictator Nicholas Maduro, is putting pressure on shale oil producers to continue output, despite prices falling. A Devon and Coterra merger will allow both companies to continue to bear the brunt of oil price volatility in the interim.\nIf You have $500,000 Saved, Retirement Could Be Closer Than You Think (sponsor)\nRetirement can be daunting, but it doesn\u2019t need to be.\nImagine having an expert in your corner to help you with your financial goals.

                "body": "(World Oil) \u2013 Coterra Energy Inc. and Devon Energy Corp. are in advanced talks about a combination, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be one of the largest oil and gas deals in years.\nThe companies could announce a deal in the coming days, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the talks are private. No final decision has been made, and the timing could change or talks could fall through, the people added.\nCoterra rose 2.9% to $28.60 at 1:12 p.m. in New York trading Thursday, giving the company a market value of about $21.8 billion. Devon rose 1.6% to $40.47, for a market value of about $25.4 billion.\nRepresentatives for Coterra and Devon didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe talks illustrate how big oil and gas players are eager to ramp up consolidation after a relatively slow 2025. The deal would strengthen their positions in Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the country\u2019s largest and most productive oil field, giving them more scale to better compete with rivals such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Diamondback Energy Inc.\nDevon has about 400,000 net acres in a fast-growing swathe of the Permian known as the Delaware basin, where Coterra also has a 346,000-acre position. Coterra also has a large position in a gassy patch of Pennsylvania in the Marcellus shale.\nKimmeridge Energy Management Co., an outspoken oil and gas investor with stakes in both companies, has voiced support for the potential tie-up."

At the time of writing, the pair traded at 1.1882 down from daily highs of 1.1974.\nEuro sinks below 1.19 as hawkish Fed leadership signals and sticky inflation crush rate-cut hopes\nKevin Warsh is Trump\u2019s election to be the next Fed Chairman of the Federal Reserve, confirming rumors that leaked late on Thursday. The financial markets sent precious metals tumbling, while the Dollar nearly 1% according to the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the buck\u2019s performance against six peers.\nThe DXY is poised to end the day past the 97.00 figure. US Treasury yields rose with the 10-year yield rose nearly one basis points at 4.25%.\nIn addition to Warsh naming, US inflation in the producer side edged higher, distancing from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% goal, justifying the Fed\u2019s decision. Aside from the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) figures for December, speeches by Federal Reserve officials grabbed the headlines.\nBreaking news revealed that the US Senate reached a deal to get the government funding package through chamber tonight, averting a shutdown, according to Politico.\nUS Treasury yields are rising in a sign that speculators see fewer odds that Warsh could cut rates \u201cindiscriminately\u201d to please the White House. The US 10-year Treasury note yield is up one and a half basis points at 4.247% as of writing.\nIn Europe, the German economy rose by 0.4% YoY exceeding estimates. Better-than-expected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures in Germany and the Eurozone, and the uptick in German inflation, have failed to provide any significant support to the pair.\nNext week, the US economic docket will feature a tranche of US jobs data, speeches by Fed officials and the ISM Manufacturing and Services PMIs for January. In Europe, HCOB Flash PMIs for the bloc and for Germany and France, and the European Central Bank monetary policy meeting, could trigger some volatility in the EUR/USD pair.\nEuro Price This Month\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies this month. Euro was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily market movers: The Dollar\u2019s comeback, tumbles the Euro\n- St. Louis Federal President Alberto Musalem stated that the central bank does not need to cut interest rates further at this time, as the current 3.50%-3.75% policy rate range is roughly at a neutral level. He said further reductions would only be justified if the labor market deteriorates sharply or inflation drops materially\n- Fed Governor Stephen Miran said Kevin Warsh would be an excellent choice for the Fed, adding that the recent rise in producer prices has been driven mainly by housing costs and portfolio management fees.\n- Meanwhile, Christopher Waller noted that the labor market remains weak despite steady economic growth. He argued that inflation would be close to 2% were it not for tariffs, which he said kept price growth near 3%, and added that monetary policy should be closer to neutral, around 3%.\n- Atlanta Fed President Raphael B"

It retreated to a low of 1.1925, down from the year-to-date high of 1.2077 ahead of the upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) decision.\nKevin Warsh to become next Fed Chair\nThe EUR/USD pair retreated as the US Dollar Index (DXY) rebounded after the media confirmed that Donald Trump would nominate Kevin Warsh, an economist at the Hoover Institution, to become the next Federal Reserve Chair.\nTrump and his officials met with Warsh on Thursday. He also confirmed that he will make his Fed Chair on Friday morning, with odds on Polymarket rising to 95%.\nThe dollar rose, and American equities surged because of the view that Warsh will be less enthusiastic to cut rates than the other contenders, like Kevin Hassett, Christopher Waller, and Rick Rieder.\nThe announcement comes a day after Trump called Jerome Powell a moron for not cutting interest rates in the last meeting. Trump advocated for cutting rates to as low as 1% despite his constant talk of the economy firing on all cylinders.\nRecent data showed that the economy was doing well, with inflation being contained below 3% and the economy expanding by 4.4% in the third quarter of last year.\nStill, there is a likelihood that Trump will get frustrated by his Fed nominee because he will be a member of the FOMC committee that is made up of 12 voting members. To cut rates, Warsh will need to convince the other committee members to do that.\nECB interest rate decision ahead\nThe next major catalyst for the EUR/USD pair will be the upcoming interest rates decision, which will happen on Thursday next week.\nIn theory, such a decision should be a big deal for the pair as the ECB is one of the most important central banks globally.\nHowever, the pair will likely react mildly to this decision as officials will likely leave interest rates unchanged.\nA Bloomberg poll published today shows that most economists expect the bank to leave interest rates unchanged for the remainder of the year and then start hiking next week.\nThe European economy is doing well, with most countries experiencing some growth. At the same time, inflation has moved to the target of 2.0%, meaning that the bank has no urgency to cut rates. A top analyst told Bloomberg:\n\u201cWhile a rapid US dollar depreciation remains a fat-tail event, the ECB would need to reconsider the balance of risks regarding euro-area inflation assuming further increases in the value of the euro.\u201d\nEUR/USD technical analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the EUR/USD exchange rate has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months. It jumped to a high of 1.2077 this week and then pulled back to 1.1917.\nThe pair has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and the Supertrend indicator.\nIt has retested the key support level at 1.1917, the upper side of the ascending triangle pattern.\nTherefore, the pair will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at 1.2100. This view will be confirmed if it moved above the year-to-date high of 1.2077.\nThe post EUR/USD forecast: recoils as Kevin Warsh odds jump appeared first on Invezz\nEUR/USD forecast: recoils as Kevin Warsh odds jump\nShare:\nThe EUR/USD exchange rate retreated sharply as market participants reacted to the rising odds that Kevin Warsh will become the next Federal Reserve Chair.

Meanwhile, the US dollar slipped to four-year lows amid concerns about geopolitics and the Fed\u2019s independence before finding a mild footing.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about Bitcoin price prediction? Check our detailed guide-\nThe pair marked fresh highs since October 2021 near 1.3860 before correcting down below mid-1.3700. The downtick triggered on Thursday and Friday was attributed to the deal struck between President Trump and the US Senate to avoid a US government shutdown. Moreover, Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Chair of the Federal Reserve, which further weakened the dollar.\nOn the data front, the UK economic calendar was light with no major releases, while the US FOMC meeting was the highlight of the week. As broadly expected, the central bank held rates unchanged, while Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference brought no clarity to the markets, reiterating a data-dependent approach.\nThe US PPI data on Friday beat the forecast with monthly Core PPI and PPI coming at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. This shows a sticky inflation, further cementing the odds of late cuts.\nMeanwhile, geopolitical developments surrounding Iran and the Russia-Ukraine conflict continue to deteriorate the risk sentiment, making the upside path for GBP/USD bumpy.\nGBP/USD Major Events Next Week:\nMoving ahead, the following major events could significantly impact the pair\u2019s volatility:\n- Bank of England Policy Rate and Statement\n- US ISM Manufacturing/Services PMI\n- JOLTs Job Openings\n- ADP Non-Farm Employment Change\n- Average Hourly Earnings m/m\n- Unemployment Rate\n- Prelim Uom Consumer Sentiment\n- Prelim Uom Inflation Expectations\nWith several high-impact events on the list, market participants will be keen to watch the BoE\u2019s policy rate, which is widely expected to remain on hold. However, the MPC vote split could be decisive in gauging sentiment regarding the next rate cut.\nOn the other hand, the US labor market data remains a vital factor for the Fed to shape up its monetary policy. The NFP numbers are expected to jump from 50k to 75k, while the unemployment rate could remain at 4.4%. Any significant deviation from these forecasts could trigger a sharp move.\nGBP/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Correction Amid Profit-Taking\nThe GBP/USD daily chart shows a corrective downside after briefly breaking the supply zone above 1.3850. The pair lost more than 100 pips, with the RSI retreating below 50.0, suggesting further losses on the card. However, the 1.3700 level could pause the downside ahead of the next support at 1.3600 (round number) and then supply-tuned demand zone near 1.3500.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about scalping forex brokers?

                "body": "GBP/USD Weekly Forecast: Pound Sterling eyes more upside, with Golden Cross in play\n- Pound Sterling hits four-year highs above 1.3850 on relentless US Dollar selling.\n- GBP/USD appears bullish, positioning for the BoE verdict and US Nonfarm Payrolls.\n- Technically, a Golden Cross on the daily chart suggests more upside for GBP/USD.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) accelerated its bullish momentum against the US Dollar (USD), with GBP/USD recording its highest level in four years near 1.3870 before experiencing a late pullback.\nPound Sterling rejoiced USD meltdown\nOnce again, it was all about the USD\u2019s performance and GBP/USD dancing to its tune. Investors\u2019 confidence in the US assets, such as the Greenback, US Treasury bonds, etc. continued to diminish amid US President Donald Trump\u2019s erratic international policies and attacks on the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) independence.\nMarkets also remained wary and moved away from the USD ahead of the Fed policy announcement.\nTrump threatened over the weekend that he would impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it follows through on a trade deal with China. Moreover, the US currency faced headwinds from a weak Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence data released on Tuesday. US consumer confidence slumped to the lowest level in more than 11.5 years in January, to 84.5.\nAdding to the woes surrounding the Greenback, Russia drew a hard red line in peace negotiations with Ukraine during the US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi last week. The trilateral talks ended without a deal on Saturday as Ukraine outright rejected Russia's demand to cede all of the Donbas region to end the nearly four-year war.\nBy midweek, Trump\u2019s comments broke the camel\u2019s back, smashing the USD to its lowest level in four years against its six major currency rivals. Trump said on Tuesday the value of the dollar was \"great\", when asked if he thought it had declined too much.\nHowever, the Fed monetary policy outcome somewhat helped pause the US Dollar downtrend, lifting the buck from the dumps. The Fed on Wednesday kept the fed funds rates unchanged, as widely expected, but Chairman Jerome Powell struck a less dovish tone, noting that \u201cthe US economy expanded at a solid pace last year and is coming into 2026 on a firm footing.\u201d\nLater that day, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a CNBC interview that the US has always had a \"strong dollar\" policy and that they are \"absolutely not\" intervening in the Japanese currency markets. Bessent\u2019s comments also provided the much-needed relief to USD buyers.\nIn light of this, GBP/USD embarked on a corrective decline and targeted the 1.3700 level. The pullback extended on Friday, with the Greenback building its recovery momentum amid profit-taking ahead of Trump\u2019s announcement of his Fed Chair pick.\nThe Trump administration finally nominated former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh as Powell's replacement. His decision still needs to pass through the Senate, yet the USD ticked lower with the announcement that puts a hawk in Fed's Chair\nMeanwhile, a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report that President Trump and Senate Democrats struck a deal to avert a government shutdown also bolstered the USD upswing across the board.\nThe BoE, US Nonfarm Payrolls and geopolitics in focus\nPound Sterling traders brace for a critical week as the Bank of England (BoE) is expected to announce its monetary policy decision on \u2018Super Thursday\u2019. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s press conference will follow, providing fresh insights on the central bank\u2019s path forward on interest rates.\nGBP/USD is set to experience intense volatility on the BoE policy announcements and updated economic forecasts. But the reaction could remain short-lived as traders would shift their attention toward Friday\u2019s US labor market data.\nThe headline Nonfarm Payrolls figure will be closely scrutinized alongside the Unemployment Rate for fresh signs on the state of the US labor market, which could significantly impact the direction of the Fed\u2019s interest "

                "body": "AUD/USD corrects from three-year high amid US Dollar recovery\n- The AUD/USD pair corrects after reaching a three-year high, amid profit-taking.\n- Australian producer price data confirm stable inflation at the end of the year.\n- The US Dollar regains some ground, supported by political and budget-related developments in the US.\nAUD/USD trades around 0.7000 on Friday at the time of writing, down 0.60% on the day, after retreating from a three-year high reached earlier this week. The pair thus snaps a three-day winning streak, amid a technical correction and a modest recovery in support for the US Dollar (USD).\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) remains under pressure following the release of Australia\u2019s Producer Price Index (PPI), which rose 3.5% YoY in the fourth quarter of 2025, unchanged from the previous quarter. These figures point to stable upstream inflation, with no further acceleration, limiting immediate enthusiasm for the Australian currency. Nevertheless, the Australian Dollar retains underlying support after hotter-than-expected consumer inflation data released earlier this week strengthened expectations of near-term monetary tightening.\nMarkets now price in more than a 70% probability of a 25-basis-point rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) at its next meeting, from a current cash rate of 3.6%. Rate expectations also point to levels near 3.85% by May and around 4.10% by September, which could eventually limit the extent of the AUD/USD pullback.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar (USD) manages to recover part of its recent losses. The announcement of Kevin Warsh\u2019s appointment as head of the Federal Reserve (Fed), replacing Jerome Powell, has reassured investors about the central bank\u2019s independence. In addition, reports suggesting that a budget agreement between Democrats and Republicans in Congress remains possible have revived hopes of avoiding another government shutdown, providing additional support to the Greenback.\nIn the background, the latest US producer price data show inflation remaining firm. The Producer Price Index rose 3% YoY in December, above market expectations, while the core component also accelerated to 3.3% YoY. This combination of factors contributes to a temporary rebalancing in favor of the US Dollar, weighing on AUD/USD in the short term despite still-supportive monetary policy prospects in Australia.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today. Australian Dollar was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Australian Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent AUD (base)/USD (quote).\nAuthor\nGhiles Guezout\nFXStreet\nGhiles Guezout is a Market Analyst with a strong background in stock market investments, trading, and cryptocurrencies.

Given that, the focus is shifting to the RBA\u2019s stance...\nOur spot flows data suggest AUD/USD net buying remained subdued despite the recent rally. CFTC noncommercial net positioning also remains net negative, though asset managers have reduced their short positions in recent weeks,\" ANZ notes.\nFrom a technical perspective, AUD/USD has tested the key 0.7000 hurdle this week, but momentum indicators flag near-term caution. RSI is in overbought territory, increasing the risk of a correction in response to any AUD-negative event. Overall, we remain modestly positive on AUD/USD in the near term. A sustained break above 0.70 would open the door to upside near 0.714, while initial support sits near 0.69,\" ANZ adds."

The pair remains supported by yield differentials. US Treasury yields remain higher than those on Japanese government bonds. This keeps carry trades attractive.\nMarkets have scaled back aggressive expectations of Fed rate cuts. Stronger-than-expected US data and sticky services inflation have delayed the timing of meaningful easing. Futures now imply a slower and shallower path of rate cuts. This supports the USD side of the pair. Furthermore, a deal between President Trump and the US Senate has been reached to prevent a shutdown, giving the bulls more room to maneuver.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about ETF brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nOn the Japanese side, the Bank of Japan has shifted away from strict yield curve control. However, policy is still highly accommodative. Short-term Japanese rates remain near zero.\nCompared with the US, Japan\u2019s real yields are low and unappealing. This makes it harder for the JPY to keep rallying. However, the risk of verbal intervention from Japanese authorities remains significant. Officials have reiterated that they will react if the yen loses too much value.\nSharp moves above key psychological levels have prompted the BoJ to act in the past. This can cause abrupt, short-term pullbacks in USD/JPY. But intervention alone may not be enough to change the trend for good unless policy divergence is narrowed.\nPositioning is another factor that drives the pair. Many investors are long USD/JPY through carry structures. When risk sentiment changes, this can make moves bigger. Lower US yields, equity corrections, or rising fears of a recession could prompt investors to pare back their positions. That would support the yen for a short time.\nMoving ahead, USD/JPY is likely to track the US PPI data today. Upside risks persist if US yields rise again and the Fed signals \u201chigher for longer.\u201d Downside risks arise if US growth slows, inflation falls faster, or markets reprice earlier cuts. Any hint of a more decisive BoJ normalization would also favor JPY.\nUSD/JPY Technical Price Analysis: W Pattern\nThe USD/JPY 4-hour chart shows a bullish reversal, forming a \u201cW Pattern\u201d. The pair has moved above the 20-period MA, while the RSI has also risen to 50.0.

                "body": "USD/JPY jumps as US Dollar strengthens on hawkish signals, Warsh nomination\n- USD/JPY rises sharply as the US Dollar rebounds after signals perceived as more restrictive on monetary policy.\n- Kevin Warsh\u2019s nomination reassures markets about the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy direction and independence.\n- Stronger-than-expected US producer inflation supports the Greenback, while Japanese data argue for patience from the BoJ.\nUSD/JPY rebounds around 154.50 on Friday at the time of writing, up 0.90% on the day, supported by a renewed recovery in the US Dollar (USD) after several weeks of weakness. The move comes as markets reassess the monetary policy outlook in the United States (US) and Japan.\nThe US Dollar strengthened after US President Donald Trump expressed his support for Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve (Fed). If confirmed by the Senate, Kevin Warsh would succeed Jerome Powell, whose term is set to expire in May. Investors, who initially feared a highly dovish nomination given the president\u2019s repeated calls for lower interest rates, are instead viewing Warsh as a relatively hawkish choice. A former Fed Governor, he is seen as an institutional figure, which has helped ease recent concerns about the central bank\u2019s independence.\nThe US Dollar also draws support from firmer-than-expected inflation data. The US Producer Price Index (PPI) rose by 0.5% MoM in December, following a 0.2% increase in November, while the annual rate stands at 3.0%, above expectations. The core measure surprised even more, with a 0.7% monthly increase and a 3.3% annual rate, signaling that upstream inflationary pressures remain strong.\nComments from Federal Reserve officials remain mixed, however. Governor Christopher Waller said he favored a 25-basis-point rate cut at the last meeting, arguing that monetary policy remains too restrictive relative to a neutral level near 3%. By contrast, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic called for patience, stressing the need to see clear progress toward the 2% inflation target.\nIn Japan, recent data reinforce the contrast with US dynamics. Tokyo CPI figures showed inflation cooling in January. Headline inflation rose 1.5% YoY after 2% in December, while underlying measures eased to 2%, below forecasts. This moderation in price pressures reduces the urgency for the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to raise interest rates.\nAccording to a note from BBH, the Bank of Japan can afford to remain patient before resuming its tightening cycle. Rate markets have trimmed the probability of a March hike, now favoring a rate increase in April. Weaker activity indicators, including a MoM decline in Retail Sales, support this cautious stance.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "US stock futures came under selling pressure early in the Asian market session on Friday, January 30, as concerns about AI-related spending and Fed monetary policy weighed on sentiment.\nSofter-than-expected Japanese economic data cushioned the downside, with Tokyo inflation cooling in January and Japanese retail sales unexpectedly falling in December. USD/JPY advanced 0.52% to 153.881 in morning trading on easing expectations of an April Bank of Japan rate hike.\nDespite the morning pullback, a less hawkish BoJ and expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026 continue to support a bullish outlook for the US index futures.\nMeanwhile, US inflation-related data, Fed rhetoric, and earnings will influence market sentiment later in the session.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) plunged 10% on Thursday, January 29, after reporting slower cloud growth. The slower cloud growth reignited jitters about AI-linked spending and concerns about returns on investment, sending tech stocks sharply lower. The negative sentiment from Thursday spilled over to the Friday session, leaving Asian equity markets and US index futures in the red.\nThe Nikkei joined US stock futures in the red, dropping 0.85% despite softer economic data from Japan tempering bets on an April BoJ rate hike, weighing on the yen.\nTokyo\u2019s so-called core-core inflation fell from 2.3% in December to 2.0% in January, while headline inflation dropped to 1.5% (December: 2%). Softer national inflation could delay a Bank of Japan rate hike, boosting demand for export-focused Japanese stocks. An unexpected fall in retail sales also suggested a less hawkish BoJ policy stance. However, the weaker yen failed to drive buying interest in Japanese stocks, underscoring market risk sentiment.\nUS futures posted losses during the Asian session on January 30. The Dow Jones E-mini fell 259 points, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini dropped 217 points and 40 points, respectively.\nLater on Friday, US producer prices will influence sentiment toward the Fed\u2019s policy outlook. Economists expect producer prices to rise 2.7% year-on-year in December, down from 3% in November. Lower producer prices would support a softer inflation outlook and signal a more dovish Fed rate path. Rising bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut would boost demand for risk assets.\nBeyond the data, corporate earnings will also influence sentiment. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), American Express (AXP), and Verizon Communications (VZ) are big names scheduled to release earnings results.\nStrong earnings and softer producer prices would support a rebound in US index futures, supporting the bullish medium-term outlook.\nDespite the morning pullback, the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini remained above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs indicated a bullish bias, aligning with favorable fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on geopolitical risks, earnings, US economic data, Fed rhetoric, and the BoJ\u2019s rate path. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook remains bullish. Existing bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and market optimism over Q4 earnings reaffirm the bullish outlook. These favorable fundamentals align with technicals for US index futures.\nHowever, several factors would challenge the bullish medium-term outlook, including:\nIn summary, the robust US economy, a dovish Fed rate path, upbeat earnings, and a cautious BoJ reaffirm the bullish short- and medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nHowever, traders should monitor BoJ commentary, threats of yen intervention, and USD/JPY trends. Hawkish BoJ rhetoric, a dovish Fed, and more intervention warnings could send USD/JPY sharply lower, potentially triggering an unwind of yen carry trades.\nDespite risks of a yen carry trade unwind, new all-time highs for US stock futures rem"

In its new Monetary Policy Report, the Bank kept its 2026 GDP growth forecast at 1.1% while lowering end-2026 inflation projections to 1.9% (headline) and 2.1% (core). That looks dovish, yet RBC argues it could still leave room for the next \u201creal\u201d move to be a hike, just further out. Market pricing..\nhasn\u2019t fully reflected that possibility, even as Canada\u2013US long-bond yields have moved largely in sync and the 10-year spread barely changed.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Trade rules could drive the next surprise.\nRBC\u2019s medium-term bearish view on USD/CAD rests partly on Canadian exports staying largely duty-free into the US. If the USMCA review tightens trade terms, that could hit growth, lift certain prices, and change how the BoC reacts \u2013 potentially pushing rates higher than investors expect. Meanwhile, a fast USD/CAD drop has made RBC cautious near term, even if it still expects the pair to trend lower over time.\nZooming out: Central banks are living with more \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d.\nLower inflation forecasts don\u2019t remove hike risk if supply is disrupted or tariffs raise costs. With domestic data light, Canada\u2019s next jobs report and Governor Tiff Macklem\u2019s speech on forces reshaping the economy will matter mainly for what they signal about resilience \u2013 and how much uncertainty the BoC is willing to look through before moving again.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "GBP/JPY steady near weekly highs as Yen weakens on softer Tokyo inflation\n- GBP/JPY edges higher as softer Tokyo CPI weighs on the Yen.\n- Cooling inflation and weaker retail data reinforce expectations that the BoJ can afford to stay patient.\n- Attention turns to the BoE\u2019s interest rate decision amid still-elevated UK inflation.\nThe British Pound (GBP) trades firmer against the Japanese Yen (JPY) on Friday, as softer-than-expected Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) data weigh on the Yen and revive doubts over the pace of policy normalisation by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is trading around 212.16, hovering near the upper end of this week\u2019s trading range.\nData released by the Statistics Bureau of Japan showed that inflation slowed in January. The Tokyo CPI rose 1.5% YoY, down from 2.0% in December, while both the CPI excluding fresh food and energy and the CPI excluding fresh food decelerated to 2.0% YoY, missing market forecasts of 2.3% and slowing from 2.2% in the prior month.\nFollowing the data, a report published by BHH noted that the BoJ can afford to remain patient before resuming its rate-hiking cycle. The note added that the swaps market has trimmed the probability of a March rate hike to around 13%, from about 20% earlier this week, and now implies just over a 60% chance of a rate increase in April. BHH said its base case remains for the BoJ to deliver its next rate hike at the April 28 meeting.\nTraders also digested a mixed batch of Japanese labour and consumption data released earlier in the day. Japan\u2019s Unemployment Rate held steady at 2.6% in December.\nLarge Retailer Sales rose 2.0% YoY, slowing sharply from 5.0% in the previous month, while Retail Sales fell 0.9% YoY, missing expectations for a 0.7% increase and easing from 1.0% in the prior month.\nOn a monthly basis, seasonally adjusted Retail Sales dropped 2.0%, reversing the 0.6% rise seen in November.\nLooking ahead, focus turns to the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) interest rate decision scheduled for February 5. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at 3.75% as UK inflation remains well above the 2% target. Data released earlier this month showed headline CPI rose to 3.4% YoY from 3.2%, while core inflation held steady at 3.2%.\nBoE FAQs\nThe Bank of England (BoE) decides monetary policy for the United Kingdom. Its primary goal is to achieve \u2018price stability\u2019, or a steady inflation rate of 2%. Its tool for achieving this is via the adjustment of base lending rates. The BoE sets the rate at which it lends to commercial banks and banks lend to each other, determining the level of interest rates in the economy overall. This also impacts the value of the Pound Sterling (GBP).\nWhen inflation is above the Bank of England\u2019s target it responds by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is positive for the Pound Sterling because higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls below target, it is a sign economic growth is slowing, and the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit in the hope businesses will borrow to invest in growth-generating projects \u2013 a negative for the Pound Sterling.\nIn extreme situations, the Bank of England can enact a policy called Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the BoE substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. QE is a last resort policy when lowering interest rates will not achieve the necessary result. The process of QE involves the BoE printing money to buy assets \u2013 usually government or AAA-rated corporate bonds \u2013 from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Pound Sterling.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE, enacted when the economy is strengthening and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the Bank of England (BoE) purchases government and corporate bonds "

Therefore, investors who have held ETFs since their launch were down by about 8.5%.\nIs BTC rebound still on the cards?\nIn late 2025, BTC ETF inflows dropped sharply and continued to fluctuate into the new year. This decline further weakened prospects for a strong rebound.\nHowever, the correlation between the BTC ETF\u2019s Average Cost Basis and price revealed an important insight. For instance, in September 2024, when the price fell below the ETF\u2019s average purchase level, BTC consolidated around that point before staging a strong recovery.\nA similar pattern emerged in early 2025 during the tariff\u2011driven market dump, when BTC once again bounced off the ETF average cost basis.\nIf the current trend mirrors Q3 2024, another rebound could be possible, with a potential bottom forming below $90K.\nThis thesis is supported by Bianco Research data, which shows the combined average purchase price for Strategy and spot BTC ETFs currently sits at $84.5K.\nThroughout this cycle, major drawdowns have consistently eased at this level. As a result, defending $84.5K appears crucial to maintaining the broader bullish market structure.\nIn other words, a sustained dip below $84.5K and a crack below this key support may signal a deeper drawdown, eventually invalidating the broader bullish market structure.\nMapping BTC\u2019s mid-term headwinds\nBut do other data sets support such a recovery outlook?\nAccording to the 30-day average of BTC demand growth, it flipped negative for the first time since mid-2025. Given the recoveries in 2024 and 2025, a similar move is only possible if ETFs return to being net buyers.\nBut according to Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee, the market will stabilize only after the new Fed chair pick has been confirmed and tested.\nAlready, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to announce the new Fed chair pick later today has stirred the markets, underscoring a turbulent 2026, as previously projected by Lee.\nFinal Thoughts\n- If BTC decisively reclaims the combined Strategy and spot BTC ETFs\u2019 average purchase price of $84.5K.\n- Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee projected a deeper drawdown as markets test the new Fed chair."

The company sits on roughly $8,000 profit per coin, or about 12% gain.\nTogether, Strategy and the Bitcoin ETFs control roughly 10% of all Bitcoin in circulation.\nHowever, Bianco\u2019s data shows they now have no unrealized profits collectively.\nThe $84,500 Defense Line\nHistorical patterns suggest the average cost basis acts as critical support.\nIn September 2024, when BTC fell below the ETF\u2019s average purchase level, the token consolidated before staging a strong recovery.\nA similar pattern emerged in early 2025 during the tariff-driven selloff.\nBianco Research calculates the combined average purchase price for Strategy and spot BTC ETFs currently sits at $84,500.\nThroughout this cycle, major drawdowns have consistently eased at this level, making it crucial to maintaining the broader bullish market structure.\nA sustained dip below $84,500 signals a deeper drawdown that could invalidate the bullish thesis entirely.\nTechnical Breakdown Confirms Weakness\nBitcoin is down 2.5% on the day and nearly 8% from recent highs, with the technical setup showing critical weakness.\nBTC broke below a rising wedge pattern formed by converging trendlines.\nThe wedge compressed price action for several weeks, and the breakdown is a classic bearish signal that typically leads to further downside.\nBitcoin trades below all four key EMAs in bearish formation: 20 EMA at $89,056, 50 EMA at $90,665, 100 EMA at $94,244, and 200 EMA at $98,135.\nThe 20 EMA sits nearly $5,000 above current price, showing the extent of the momentum shift.\nThe Supertrend indicator at $91,180 flipped bearish and positions well above price, confirming the downtrend.\nSupport Levels And Downside Targets\nImmediate support sits around $82,500-$83,000, representing the measured target from the wedge breakdown.\nBelow that, major support sits at $80,000, a psychologically important level that acted as support in previous corrections.\nA break below $80,000 triggers panic selling and opens the door to the $75,000-$78,000 range.\nFor any bullish recovery, Bitcoin needs to reclaim the wedge breakdown level around $87,000-$88,000 and push back above the 20 EMA.\nUntil that happens, rallies represent opportunities to reduce risk rather than add exposure.\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2026 Benzinga.com.

                "body": "- Nearly 10 years after it was hacked, TheDAO has returned.\n- Roughly 75,000 in unclaimed Ether will be staked to fund security initiatives.\nFade, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto market maker Wintermute, was eight years old when TheDAO was hacked, almost killing a nascent blockchain known as Ethereum.\nNearly 10 years later, his sleuthing has inspired a proposal to fund initiatives that make Ethereum safer to use. And the funds would come from an enormous amount of idle crypto that was recovered after the hack.\nThis week, people charged with distributing that crypto said about 75,000 Ether had gone unclaimed by its original owners. As discussed nearly 10 years ago, that Ether, now worth more than $220 million, will be put to use.\n\u201cTheDAO Security Fund will activate more than 75,000 ETH (over $220M) to strengthen Ethereum\u2019s security, ensuring it is ready to become the backbone of the world\u2019s financial infrastructure,\u201d crypto entrepreneur Griff Green wrote in a blog post explaining the decision.\nThe hack\nIn 2016, TheDAO, a cooperatively-managed venture fund, became one of the largest crowdfunding initiatives in world history, attracting more than $150 million in Ether.\nBut it was promptly hacked, setting off a contentious debate over whether to \u201cfork\u201d Ethereum, effectively turning the clock back to the point just before the hack. While that would recover the stolen Ether, it would also undermine the notion the blockchain was tamper-proof and fit to serve as a neutral foundation for a new, decentralised internet.\nThe pro-fork camp won, and the Ether was recovered. While most of that Ether was easily claimed by its original owners, there were \u201cedge cases,\u201d Green wrote. A crypto wallet holding hard-to-claim Ether was created, with control distributed among a select group of people, including Green.\nAfter January 31, 2017, any unclaimed funds would be used to fund a nonprofit \u201cto support smart contract security,\u201d according to a blog post that was published shortly after the hack. Apparently, this commitment was all but forgotten \u2014 until now.\nForgotten but not lost\nFade recently found the 10-year-old blog post \u201cwhile looking through old contracts,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\u201cI made the proposal to put these funds to use,\u201d he added, a claim that Green confirmed in the more recent post.\nGreen said TheDAO, resurrected as a security-focused grant making organisation, would be guided, in part, by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Trillion Dollar Security initiative, which identified six priorities for security-focused software developers.\nBut TheDAO will also be guided by Ethereum users, who will be given opportunities to vote on how to allocate the funding over multiple rounds.\nThe vast majority of the roughly 75,000 Ether available can still be claimed. Rather than distributing that Ether to fund security work, TheDAO will stake it, with the resulting yield used to fund security initiatives on an ongoing basis.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Metamask security researcher Taylor Monahan, and four others will lead the TheDAO Security Fund, according to Green.\n\u201cTheDAO Security Fund marks the start of a new phase for Ethereum\u2019s security story,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe world is ready for our tech, we want to ensure our tech is ready for the world.\u201d\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": "Four major AI models have projected 2026 price targets for Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and XRP (CRYPTO: XRP). The forecasts range from conservative consolidation to triple-digit percentage gains, with each asset showing different upside potential based on adoption trends, network activity, and market positioning.\nEthereum anchors institutional DeFi with mature Layer 2 networks, Solana leads on speed and retail engagement, while XRP waits on full regulatory clarity to unlock its next move. This comparison breaks down what ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and Copilot project for each asset and identifies which altcoin offers the biggest upside this year.\nWhat AI Models Predict for Ethereum\nThe Ethereum price prediction from major AI models clusters between $3,000 and $18,000, with the spread reflecting uncertainty about ETF flows and Layer 2 adoption. Below are the Ethereum price forecast from the four AI models.\n- ChatGPT: $3,000-$9,000 (conservative and macro-weighted)\n- Gemini: $7,000-$18,000 (bullish on scaling upgrades)\n- Grok: $4,000-$12,000 (based on staking demand growth)\n- Copilot: $8,200-$10,200 (most conservative range)\nThe bull case puts ETH at $18,000\u2014roughly 480% upside from current levels near $3,000. That scenario requires strong macro liquidity, sustained ETF inflows, and further expansion on Layer 2 networks. Tom Lee\u2019s \u201csupercycle\u201d thesis and BlackRock\u2019s continued ETHA accumulation support the upper ranges.\nA more balanced Ethereum price prediction sits in the $8,000 range, representing 170% if usage increases steadily without a speculative surge.\nSolana Forecasts Show Highest Upside\nThe Solana forecast draws the widest range from AI models\u2014$120 to $800\u2014reflecting both growth potential and volatility risk.\n- ChatGPT: $120-$350 (based on improving network stability and DeFi recovery)\n- Gemini: $300-$800 (most optimistic based on Firedancer upgrades)\n- Grok: $200-$600 (based on increasing venture capital and adoption growth)\n- Copilot: $150-$300 (conservative based on consistent but restrained growth)\nThe bull case targets $800\u2014representing roughly 500% upside from current prices. The optimistic Solana forecast depends on ETF inflows, higher transaction volume, and expanded use in payments and gaming. The base forecast of $300 offers 120% upside with more moderate assumptions.\nSolana\u2019s 27.1 million active addresses and Alpenglow upgrade rolling out in early 2026 support the bullish forecasts. The 150ms finality upgrade could attract high-frequency trading institutions. Among the three assets, Solana\u2019s ceiling is the highest in percentage terms.\nXRP Predictions Tied to Regulatory Progress\nThe XRP price projections stay tighter than competitors, with most AI models capping upside at $3-$6 unless major regulatory catalysts materialize.\n- ChatGPT: $0.80-$3.00 (based on steady payment usage growth)\n- Gemini: $1.00-$3.00 (similar conservative range to ChatGPT)\n- Grok: $1.50-$6.00 (based on increasing banking adoption and regulatory clarity)\n- Copilot: $1.80-$3.20 (based on ETF demand)\nThe bull case points to $6.00\u2014representing roughly 200% upside from current levels\u2014depending on multiple ETF approvals, expanding Ripple Payments volume, and broader institutional settlement use. The base case of $3.00 offers 60% upside.\nXRP\u2019s 57% exchange balance decline and $1.3B ETF inflows provide fundamental support. However, the AI altcoin predictions show XRP offers measured upside compared to higher-beta assets, with stability tied closely to legal progress and real transaction growth.\nUpside Comparison Across All Three Altcoins\nHere\u2019s how the AI altcoin predictions for Ethereum, Solana, and XRP compare across all the bull, base, and bear scenarios:\nSolana leads raw upside with roughly 500% bull projection, driven by scalability demand and strong speculative momentum. Ethereum price prediction offers more stability, cushioned by solid liquidity and institutional flows. The XRP forecast carries the greatest catalyst depende"

                "body": "February 2026 brings a mix of established giants and fresh opportunities. Bitcoin holds strong as digital gold, Ethereum powers thousands of dApps, Solana delivers lightning-fast DeFi, and XRP handles cross-border payments in seconds. But here\u2019s the thing: these blue chips already had their explosive growth phases. Smart money is hunting for the next 50\u00d7 opportunity.\n- Bitcoin: The Original Crypto Still Holds Weight\nBitcoin launched in January 2009 from Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s revolutionary 2008 whitepaper. It introduced peer-to-peer digital cash without banks or intermediaries. Today, Bitcoin dominates as the market\u2019s primary store of value with its fixed 21 million coin supply earning it the \u201cdigital gold\u201d nickname.\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralized network and proof-of-work security make it crypto\u2019s foundation. But at its current price point, 50\u00d7 gains would require an unrealistic market cap. Bitcoin offers stability and legitimacy, not life-changing percentage returns. That ship sailed years ago for retail investors with limited capital.\n- Ethereum: Smart Contract King With Mature Returns\nEthereum launched in 2015 after Vitalik Buterin\u2019s 2013 vision and a 2014 crowd sale at $0.311. Those early investors saw 270% annualized returns, essentially quadrupling money yearly. Ethereum powers thousands of tokens and dApps through smart contracts that execute without middlemen.\nETH remains the backbone of DeFi and NFTs. Developers flock here for established infrastructure. But Ethereum\u2019s maturity means modest gains ahead, not the explosive multiples that defined its early days. It\u2019s a solid hold, not a moonshot.\n- Solana: Speed Demon for DeFi Applications\nSolana went live in March 2020 after development starting in 2017. The Switzerland-based Solana Foundation manages this open-source blockchain built for high-throughput DeFi applications. Solana\u2019s architecture handles transactions faster than older chains, attracting developers seeking performance.\nThe permissionless network enables DeFi apps without traditional gatekeepers. Solana carved out a significant market share competing with Ethereum. Still, as an established Layer 1, its explosive growth phase is behind it. Solid project, moderate upside ahead.\n- XRP: Cross-Border Payment Specialist With Institutional Appeal\nXRP launched in 2012 on the XRP Ledger with impressive specs: $0.0002 transaction costs, 3-5 second settlements, 1,500 transactions per second. The ledger\u2019s processed over 70 million transactions reliably while staying carbon-neutral. It pioneered the first built-in decentralized exchange.\nXRP targets cross-border payments and remittances with near-instant finality and minimal fees. Banks and institutions appreciate the regulatory clarity. But XRP\u2019s established position and circulating supply limit explosive percentage gains. It\u2019s practical, not revolutionary at this stage."

                "body": "Solana Controls 7.7% of DeFi With $9.1B Locked Despite SOL Pullback\nShare:\nSolana ranks as the second-largest blockchain by DeFi total value locked at $9.1 billion, significantly outpacing its overall market cap. Despite a recent price decline, with SOL trading around $116.54, daily trading volume remains strong at $7.3 billion, indicating ongoing participation and interest in the DeFi space. Analysts note a critical resistance at $120, with potential for recovery towards $130 if reclaimed.\nSolana continues to stand out across decentralized finance despite recent price pressure. The network now ranks as the second-largest blockchain by DeFi total value locked, holding about $9.1 billion. That figure represents more than 7.7% of total DeFi capital across all chains. However, Solana accounts for only about 2.32% of the overall crypto market value.\nConsequently, the chain commands over three times more DeFi share than its market cap share. This imbalance highlights deep usage, active capital deployment, and strong on-chain demand.\nAt the time of writing, SOL trades near $116.54 after slipping 1.08% over 24 hours. The token has dropped more than 9% over the past week. Daily trading volume remains elevated above $7.3 billion, signaling continued market participation.\nWith roughly 570 million SOL in circulation, Solana\u2019s market value stands near $66.1 billion. Hence, the current decline reflects price adjustment rather than fading interest.\nSOL Price Structure Faces Short-Term Pressure\nShort-term charts show a bearish structure after SOL lost the $120 range floor. Price slid into the $115\u2013$113 demand zone, where buyers now defend key levels.\nAccording to Crypto Tony, the $120 area remains critical for momentum. A clean reclaim above that level would mark a range-low recovery. Additionally, such a move could unlock a rebound toward $130, followed by $14\nHowever, sellers still control price below former resistance. SOL previously rejected the $145\u2013$150 range, confirming supply strength overhead.\nMoreover, recent bounces show limited follow-through, with lower highs forming. Immediate support rests at $113. A breakdown could expose deeper demand near $108 if downside pressure accelerates.\nLong-Term Base Suggests Accumulation Phase\nBATMAN offered a broader perspective focused on patience and structure. He described Solana as forming a large multi-month base. Price continues oscillating between $120 to $130 support and $220 to $240 resistance.\nEach defense of the lower range confirms ongoing accumulation. Rejections from higher levels remain corrective, not trend-breaking.\nSource: X\nMoreover, this structure aligns with long-term market behavior that rewards discipline. A decisive move above $240 could confirm a breakout. Such a move may open paths toward $300, then $450 to $600. Until then, consolidation favors patient positioning over short-term reactions.\nSolana Controls 7.7% of DeFi With $9.1B Locked Despite SOL Pullback\nShare:\nSolana ranks as the second-largest blockchain by DeFi total value locked at $9.1 billion, significantly outpacing its overall market cap.

                "body": "Solana has posted strong metrics in the first 30 days of 2026, according to on-chain analytics Nansen, carried by DEXs and its DeFi sector.\nAccording to a recent post from Nansen, the first 30 days of 2026 for Solana saw active addresses double to over 5 million, daily transactions jump from 52 million to 87 million and daily fee revenue cracked the $1.1 million level.\nNansen claims that DEXs and DeFi remain the main contributors, which is unsurprising, as the Solana chain boasts high throughput, low-cost transactions that allow for significant volume in trading.\nSolana\u2019s strong start to 2026\nAs far as raw transaction counts and user activity are concerned, Solana has always been a leader among major chains, a merit often driven by its thriving DeFi sector and consumer apps.\nNansen acknowledged that while DEXs and DeFi are currently its best-performing areas, other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and infra have been quietly ramping up as well.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a one-sector chain, it\u2019s a full-on ecosystem expansion,\u201d Nansen claims.\nThe numbers from this past 30 days have proven that Solana has scaling advantages. Experts believe it is a strong signal of renewed momentum in the Solana ecosystem, even if some users continue to troll the chain as only usable and functional where memecoin trading is concerned.\nMore tokens are moving to DEX trading after a general revival of the Solana meme space. According to a January 29 Cryptopolitan report, over 1% of all created tokens on the token launchpad graduated for the day. The graduation rate is the highest since the summer of 2025, when 0.92% of tokens graduated.\nHow other L1s fared in the first 30 days of 2026\nCompared to Solana, in the first 30 days of 2026, Ethereum and other major L1 blockchains showed varying performance. High-throughput chains like Solana dominated raw activity, and the slower chains like Ethereum experienced a notable but nuanced resurgence of momentum.\nEthereum, especially, has been pulling some activity back to its L1 from the L2s that used to be deemed parasites because of how they drew activity away from the mainnet. This is all thanks to the upgrades it underwent in 2025, like the Fusaka upgrade, which significantly lowered fees to below $1, attracting more users and causing the L1 to witness a strong rebound in on-chain metrics.\nAccording to analytics, Ethereum\u2019s daily transactions hit all-time highs mid-January, peaking at over 2 million while active addresses briefly exceeded 1.3 million, which was temporarily higher than many L2s.\nAside from the cheaper fees attracting activities and new users, the mainnet also benefited from broader ecosystem momentum, like the expansion of its stablecoin and RWA sectors.\nOther L1s like BNB and Tron led in sheer scale and daily users. BNB saw its daily users triple to over 3 million while Tron emerged as the undisputed stablecoin king, with most of its daily users also peaking above 3 million.\nBoth chains captured not only speculation but also daily usage, while Ethereum was more focused on positioning as the secure settlement layer, leaving its L2s to handle much day-to-day.\nIn terms of speed, Base is the closest to Solana, and it has also done well in the first 30 days of 2026. Its daily transactions were considerably lower than Solana\u2019s but higher than Ethereum\u2019s, while its daily users continue to hover under 1 million.\nIt has lower raw activity compared to Solana, but its viral apps, Coinbase backing, and Ethereum ties make it a serious rival in the long term.\nClaim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members."

(Reuters)\nThe initial reaction came after Trump nominated former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as chair. Traders suggested this could alter discussions on interest rates and the Fed\u2019s autonomy. (Reuters)\nWarsh\u2019s appointment wraps up months of speculation but sparks fresh questions about how much freedom the Fed has to navigate policy amid political pressure. Lloyds FX strategist Nick Kennedy described Warsh\u2019s past as \u201cmore on the hawkish side,\u201d while Spartan Capital\u2019s Peter Cardillo noted that markets remain cautious, waiting to see if Warsh will be swayed by the White House. (Reuters)\nPowell\u2019s chairmanship wraps up in May, but Warsh still requires Senate approval. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, has made clear he\u2019ll block any Fed nominee until the Justice Department finishes its investigation into Powell, Reuters reports. (Reuters)\nThe Dow\u2019s moves often seem exaggerated because a handful of expensive stocks can swing the index significantly. Since it\u2019s price-weighted, the costlier shares have more sway; MarketWatch pointed out that a $1 change in any Dow stock nudges the index by about 6.16 points. (MarketWatch)\nThursday\u2019s close revealed the tug of war in the market. The Dow rose 55.96 points, or 0.11%, to 49,071.56, despite the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slipping amid a tech selloff led by Microsoft. \u201cMicrosoft disappointed,\u201d said John Praveen, managing director and co-CIO at Paleo Leon, citing worries that returns on AI investments might take longer than expected. (Reuters)\nInvestors enter February with little tolerance for surprises. \u201cFor those companies where expectations have become very, very lofty, the onus is going to be on them to deliver,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, in a Reuters interview. Alphabet and Amazon\u2019s upcoming earnings will be key markers, while the U.S. jobs report on Feb. 6 is also in focus; a Reuters poll projects payrolls rising by 70,000. (Reuters)\nBut the setup remains delicate. Should Warsh\u2019s confirmation stall or stir fresh doubts over Fed independence, markets leaning on steady policy could swiftly adjust. A payrolls miss or another round of earnings casting shadows on heavy AI investment might strike the most crowded market sectors first.\nFriday\u2019s headlines on the Fed pick will grab traders\u2019 attention before they shift focus to next week\u2019s megacap earnings and the Feb. 6 jobs report as the next major catalysts."

                "body": "Global markets experienced a divergent trading day on Friday, January 30, 2026. In the United States, major indices closed in negative territory as investors digested the nomination of a new Federal Reserve chair and a fresh batch of corporate earnings. Ahead of the Union Budget presentation this weekend, investors became cautious, and Indian benchmark indices ended a three-day winning streak by ending down.\nU.S. Market Snapshot (as of Jan 30)\nDow Jones: Broad-Based Decline Led by Financials\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.85%, signaling a broad market pullback. The fall was steeper than the S&P 500, driven by sharp losses in financial stocks after news of the Federal Reserve chair nomination. The move shows investors focusing on possible changes in monetary policy leadership and their impact on banking and industrial shares. Overall, the day reflected a move away from risk as policy uncertainty returned.\nS&P 500: Mixed Earnings and Sector Rotation\nThe S&P 500 index declined 0.52%, pulling back from recent levels. The index\u2019s movement was characterized by sector rotation, with materials, communication services, and technology acting as the primary drags. This weakness was somewhat mitigated by relative strength in the healthcare sector. The overall decline was caused by the fragmented environment generated by the varied company earnings reports, which included high-profile gains and misses. This precluded a united market direction.\nNasdaq: Tech Stumbles Amid Hawkish Fed Sentiment\nThe Nasdaq Composite fell 0.66%, extending its recent period of volatility. Although the loss was less severe than the previous session\u2019s tech-driven plunge, sentiment remained cautious. The nomination of a perceived hawkish candidate for Federal Reserve chair firmed the U.S. dollar and generally weighed on growth-oriented technology stocks. Investor appetite for high-valuation sectors cooled as the market reassessed the future interest rate environment under new leadership.\nNYSE: Broad Market Weakness Evident\nThe NYSE Composite index dropped 1.11%, underperforming its U.S. peers. Since it tracks all common stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, the deeper fall shows that selling was broad-based rather than focused on big technology names that drive the Nasdaq. The performance points to a general risk-off sentiment across the market during the session.\nDid the Gold and Silver Crash Impact Stocks?\nYes\u2014but indirectly.\nGold and silver prices fell steeply, but the decline was not the direct reason behind the equity sell-off. Both markets instead reacted to expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy.\nSpeculation around a more hawkish Federal Reserve under new leadership strengthened the U.S. dollar, prompting profit-taking across equities as well as precious metals. Rising interest rate expectations tend to make yield-bearing assets more appealing, which tends to lessen the appeal of gold and silver, which are generally regarded as safe havens amid market instability.\nThe impact was most visible in precious metal mining stocks. Shares of Newmont Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest gold producers, fell more than 6.6% following the metals\u2019 decline.\nOverall, the fall in gold and silver was not the cause of the stock market weakness. Both moves reflected broader investor caution and uncertainty surrounding the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, with capital moving away from both risk assets and non-yielding commodities at the same time.\nIndian Markets: Rally Snaps on Budget Eve Caution\nIndian markets ended their three-session rally, closing lower as investors secured profits and adopted a wait-and-see approach ahead of the Union Budget.\nIndex Performance Summary (as of Market Close, Jan 30)"

This sharp fall came after Donald Trump revealed his intention to nominate Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair, easing concerns about rising US inflation.\nOn Friday, silver prices plummeted by up to 30%, the largest single-day loss on record, following the President\u2019s announcement. By 7:30pm London time, silver was trading at approximately $83.81 per troy ounce, down around 26%.\nThe previous day, silver had soared to a historic high above $121, fueled by speculation that Trump might appoint a compliant Fed chair willing to lower interest rates. However, Warsh is widely viewed as a credible and market-oriented candidate, known for supporting higher rates and defending the central bank\u2019s independence.\nGold was not immune to the volatility, tumbling nearly 10% to $4,850 per ounce\u2014its most significant intraday loss since the 2008 financial crisis. Earlier in the week, gold had surged past $5,000 for the first time and reached almost $5,600 on Thursday.\nWhile precious metals suffered, the US dollar rebounded, strengthening just days after hitting a four-year low. Meanwhile, US equities declined as investors reassessed the likelihood of future rate cuts. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, the Dow Jones fell 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7%.\n07:31pm\nThank you for following our coverage today. To recap: Donald Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh, seen as a moderate and market-friendly figure, to lead the Federal Reserve. US stocks fell as traders digested the news, and silver suffered its largest-ever intraday drop, falling over 25% to $85.31 an ounce after hitting record highs earlier in the week. Gold also saw its biggest single-day loss since 2008.\n06:31pm\nAll major US stock indexes deepened their declines as the market reacted to Warsh\u2019s nomination. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1% to 23,438 points, the Dow Jones fell nearly 1% to 48,582, and the S&P 500 lost 0.8% to 6,913.\n06:12pm\nRepublican Senator Thom Tillis reiterated his intention to block Warsh\u2019s confirmation as Fed chair until the ongoing criminal investigation into current chair Jerome Powell is resolved.\n05:52pm\nSilver experienced its largest intraday decline since 2008, falling 26% to $85.31 an ounce and erasing gains from the previous two weeks. The drop followed Trump\u2019s announcement of Warsh as his Fed pick, which also sent gold and copper prices lower.\n05:41pm\nPresident Trump stated it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to ask Warsh about his stance on interest rate cuts, though he added that Warsh is inclined to lower rates.\n05:34pm\nThe US dollar continued to gain following Trump\u2019s nomination of Warsh. The dollar index rose 0.8% to 96.95, with analysts generally viewing Warsh as a moderate and market-friendly choice.\n05:28pm\nBitcoin declined 2.3% as investors processed the Fed news and tech stock sell-offs, extending its year-over-year losses to over 20%. Solana also dropped about 2%, and is down 50% compared to last year.\n05:04pm\nUK and European stocks edged up at the close after Trump\u2019s announcement. The FTSE 100 gained 0.5% to 10,224, while Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.9% and France\u2019s Cac increased 0.7%.\n04:57pm\nKevin Hassett, Trump\u2019s economic adviser, called Warsh\u2019s nomination a \u201cgreat choice,\u201d expressing satisfaction with his own current role as director of the National Economic Council.\n04:42pm\nSilver dropped 18% to $93.83 an ounce after the Fed announcement, having reached a new high of $121.65 the previous day. Gold also fell nearly 7% to $4,976 an ounce, though both metals remain significantly higher than a month ago.\n04:28pm\nWall Street continued its downward trend, with the Dow Jones down 1% to 48,628, the Nasdaq Composite off 0.7% to 23,516, and the S&P 500 down 0.4% to 6,943. Analysts see Warsh as a moderate, but note he may align with Trump\u2019s desire for aggressive rate cuts.\n04:15pm\nThough Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh for Fed chair, the Bank of England previo"

                "body": "Silver prices have fallen by the most on record after Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the next Federal Reserve chairman eased fears about US inflation.\nThe precious metal fell by as much as 30pc on Friday, its biggest single day fall in history, after the President announced Kevin Warsh as his nomination to lead the central bank.\nAs of 7.30pm in London, silver was down around 26pc at $83.81 per Troy ounce.\nSilver reached a record high of more than $121 on Thursday amid concerns that Trump was preparing to install a pliant candidate at the Fed who would cut interest rates for him.\nMr Warsh is widely regarded as a credible, market-friendly candidate who has advocated for higher interest rates in the past and defended the Fed\u2019s independence.\nGold was also rocked by the news of his nomination, falling by almost 10pc to $4,850 an ounce, its largest intraday drop since the 2008 financial crisis.\nBullion surged to nearly $5,600 on Thursday, after surpassing $5,000 for the first time on Monday and rising above the $4,000 threshold in a record first in October.\nWhile precious metals plunged, the dollar strengthened just days after the US currency sank to a four-year low.\nUS stocks fell as investors judged that interest rate cuts were now less likely. The benchmark S&P 500 was down 0.3pc, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4pc and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.7pc."

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is grinding through a classic tug-of-war phase \u2013 not a euphoric melt-up, not a panic crash, but a disciplined, nervous market where every headline about the ECB, inflation, and German industry triggers sharp intraday swings. Think cautious optimism mixed with constant risk-checking: dips are being tested by buyers, but every bounce is shadowed by profit-taking from traders who still remember the last brutal drawdowns in European equities.\nPrice action reflects this mood: the index has been hovering around an important cluster of resistance and support, with rallies frequently stalling and pullbacks getting defended. That is exactly the kind of environment where patient traders can build positions, while emotional traders get chopped up by sideways volatility.\nThe Story: The DAX 40 does not move in a vacuum. Right now the narrative is shaped by three forces: the ECB\u2019s next moves, the health of Germany\u2019s real economy, and global risk appetite driven by the U.S. and China.\n1. ECB & Interest-Rate Game:\nThe European Central Bank remains the main puppet master for European assets. Markets are locked on every hint about future rate cuts after the aggressive hiking cycle that squeezed growth and equity valuations. Inflation in the eurozone has been cooling from its peaks, but the ECB is still walking a tightrope: cut too slowly, and recession risks stay elevated; cut too fast, and the euro could weaken sharply against the dollar, re-importing inflation through higher import and energy costs.\nFor the DAX 40, a more dovish ECB tone is generally bullish: cheaper money supports valuations, helps heavily indebted companies, and boosts risk-on sentiment. But if the ECB sounds too nervous about growth, that can flip the script and spark renewed fear about European stagnation. Traders are basically betting on a sweet spot: inflation under control, rates creeping lower, growth not collapsing.\n2. German Macro: Factory Floor vs. Trading Floor\nGermany\u2019s reputation as the industrial powerhouse of Europe has been under pressure. Manufacturing indicators and PMI data have been flashing warning signals for months, with weak orders and cautious corporate guidance from key export sectors. The auto giants \u2013 think the big names in the DAX \u2013 are still facing a triple challenge: EV transition costs, fierce competition from U.S. and Chinese players, and cyclical demand that reacts sensitively to global rates and consumer confidence.\nEnergy prices remain a structural risk. While the acute gas crisis headlines have calmed down compared to the peak shock, German industry still operates with a higher structural cost base than before, which compresses margins and weighs on long-term investment decisions. That is why manufacturing data, export numbers, and business confidence surveys remain key catalysts for the index.\nYet, the market is forward-looking. A lot of the bad news has already been priced in over the past years. Whenever data is \u201cless bad than feared\u201d, the DAX tends to respond with relief rallies, as bears scramble to cover shorts and long-only money quietly rotates back into European blue chips.\n3. Global Risk-On vs. Risk-Off\nThe DAX 40 is highly cyclical and export-oriented. That means it is extremely sensitive to U.S. tech sentiment, Chinese growth headlines, and the global bond market. When the dollar strengthens aggressively against the euro, it can support German exporters but simultaneously signal broader risk-off flows. When Wall Street rallies on soft-landing hopes and peak-rate narratives, European indices often catch a secondary bid.\nRight now, "

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic suspense mode \u2013 not a euphoric melt-up, not a panic crash, but a tense, grinding phase where every candle feels like a vote on Europe\u2019s future. German blue chips are oscillating near important zones, with sharp swings as traders react to every ECB hint, energy headline, and macro data print. No clean trend, just a choppy battlefield where intraday rallies get faded and sudden selloffs get bought back up.\nGerman bulls are still in the game, but bears are absolutely not gone. The market is rotating: exporters vs. domestic names, autos vs. tech, industrials vs. defensives. This is the kind of environment where lazy buy-and-hold gets punished and active traders who respect risk management can shine.\nThe Story: To understand this DAX setup, you have to zoom out to the European macro mix: monetary policy, energy, currency, and growth.\n1. ECB & rates \u2013 the big puppeteer\nThe European Central Bank is still walking the tightrope between fighting inflation and not killing what\u2019s left of growth. Recent commentary from ECB officials and Christine Lagarde has kept markets on edge: inflation has cooled from the brutal peaks, but core price pressure and wage dynamics remain a concern. That means the ECB cannot pivot aggressively without risking credibility.\nEquity traders are watching three things:\n\u2013 Any signal of rate cuts coming sooner than expected (bullish for DAX risk assets).\n\u2013 Any hawkish surprise that revives the \"higher for longer\" narrative (bearish, especially for growth-heavy exporters and rate-sensitive sectors like real estate and tech).\n\u2013 ECB language around growth and financial stability \u2013 if they start sounding genuinely worried about recession, that can flip from bad to good for stocks, because the market will front-run future easing.\n2. Euro vs. Dollar \u2013 FX is quietly steering the ship\nThe euro\u2019s battle with the dollar is critical for the DAX because many of Germany\u2019s heavyweights are export machines: autos, chemicals, machinery, industrial tech. When the euro weakens against the dollar, German exporters become more competitive globally, and their overseas earnings translate more favorably back into euros. Strong dollar phases often act like a hidden tailwind for the DAX export story.\nBut a stronger euro? That can pressure margins and earnings guidance, especially if global demand is already cooling. Right now, the FX market is basically the shadow referee: every shift in Fed vs. ECB expectations, every US data surprise, can spill directly into DAX corporate earnings sentiment.\n3. Energy prices \u2013 Germany\u2019s structural headache\nGerman industry is still adapting to the new energy reality. After the shock spikes in gas and power prices, the situation has calmed, but energy remains structurally more expensive and more uncertain than in the pre-crisis era. For chemical giants, steel, manufacturing and heavy industry, this is not just a short-term cost issue; it is a strategic competitiveness problem.\nIf energy prices stay relatively contained, the market can price in margin stabilization and maybe mild expansion. But any renewed tension in global energy markets, supply disruptions or geopolitical stress can quickly revive fears that German industry is operating on thinner and more fragile margins. That\u2019s the kind of narrative that can hit the DAX hard, even if the headline index looks calm for a while.\n4. Industrial output & recession chatter\nGerman economic data has been mixed: some improvement in sentiment surveys, but industrial output and manufacturing orders still show that Europe\u2019"

                "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday that the company would begin phasing out its Model S and Model X electric vehicles this year and retool a California factory to produce humanoid robots instead.\nThe announcement signals an end of an era. The two vehicles \u2014 introduced in 2012 and 2015, respectively \u2014 helped to move electric cars from the consumer fringe into the mainstream. They also fueled Tesla\u2019s rise from a startup into the world\u2019s most valuable automaker.\nMusk announced the phase-out on a call with investors and Wall Street analysts, saying it was part of his effort to overhaul Tesla\u2019s operations to focus on robotaxis and humanoid robots.\n\u201cWe expect to wind down S and X production next quarter and basically stop production,\u201d he said, adding that the company would continue to support the vehicles for as long as people have them.\n\u201cThat is slightly sad, but it\u2019s time to bring the S and X programs to an end, and it\u2019s part of our overall shift to an autonomous future,\u201d he said.\nMusk announced the change as Tesla released its financial results for the final three months of last year. The company topped analysts\u2019 expectations for earnings but showed signs of weakness as total revenue for last year was down 3% from its 2024 revenue.\nIts share price was up about 2% in after-hours trading.\nTesla vehicles' sales have suffered overall in the past year, as customers reacted to Musk\u2019s involvement in right-wing politics and as competitors from China and elsewhere have given global drivers more choices.\nMusk said that Tesla would convert its factory in Fremont, California, from an auto plant into the manufacturing site for the planned Optimus line of robots. Those robots are not yet on the market.\nThe Model S arrived at a time when electric cars were a tiny niche in the vehicle market, with many industry analysts doubting whether there was enough demand to sustain an electric-only automaker. But the Model S soon topped owner satisfaction surveys and developed a loyal following. The Model X, a crossover SUV, followed a few years later and initially received poor reviews for reliability.\nIn 2023, Tesla cut prices for both the Model S and the Model X in an effort to generate more demand."

                "body": "Profit-taking in chip-linked heavyweights dragged the Nikkei, but most Tokyo stocks gained as upbeat earnings news lifted names like Casio and Fujitsu while the weaker yen mattered less than usual.\nabout 23 hours ago \u2022 1 min\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nJapan\u2019s stocks ended the week with mixed signals \u2013 the Nikkei 225 dipped while the broader Topix rose, even though most Tokyo shares finished higher.\nWhat does this mean?\nThe Nikkei\u2019s small drop hid a narrow selloff: roughly 7 in 10 prime-market stocks gained, and the index swung from up to down during the session. The drag came from profit-taking in chip-linked giants, led by testing-equipment maker Advantest, which fell 5% after a seven-day run and did outsized damage to the price-weighted Nikkei. Meanwhile, upbeat earnings guidance lifted other names \u2013 Casio surged after saying annual net profit could double, and Fujitsu jumped after raising its profit out..\nlook. The yen also weakened to about 153.55 per US dollar, but investors are paying more attention to company forecasts than FX moves lately.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: The headline index can mislead.\nPrice-weighted indexes like the Nikkei can be dominated by a handful of high-priced stocks, so one sharp move can swamp broad strength. That\u2019s why the Topix \u2013 which\u2019s market-cap weighted and more diversified \u2013 can give a clearer read on how \u201cJapan equities\u201d are really doing. When the two diverge, it\u2019s a cue to look under the hood at sector leadership, not just the headline print.\nZooming out: Guidance is moving the market again.\nWith big forecast upgrades grabbing attention, Japan\u2019s next leg may hinge more on profit momentum than on macro narratives. If more companies follow with confident outlooks, that can broaden gains beyond chip-related winners \u2013 and make the market less vulnerable to one crowded trade unwinding. A softer yen still helps exporters, but for now, earnings are setting the tone.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
