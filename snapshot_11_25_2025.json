                "body": "Gold prices surged to the upper bound of their recent trading range on Monday, reaching as high as $4,126 per ounce amid growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting. The precious metal has been trading within a range of $4,000 to $4,125 in recent sessions, and renewed speculation about monetary easing has pushed prices toward the top of that band.\nWith 16 days remaining until the Federal Reserve's final policy meeting of the year, market participants are increasingly confident that the central bank will lower the federal funds rate from its current target range of 3.75% to 4.00% down to 3.50% to 3.75%. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, traders are now pricing in an 80.9% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut. This represents a substantial increase from Friday's reading of 71% and a dramatic shift from just one week ago, when the tool indicated only a 42.4% likelihood of a rate reduction.\nThe coming days are expected to provide critical insight into the Fed's likely policy direction, with key economic data releases scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. September retail sales figures and the Producer Price Index will be published on Tuesday, followed by weekly jobless claims and the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index on Wednesday. These reports, which were delayed due to an extended government shutdown, should offer some perspective on the U.S. economy heading into December. However, the absence of comprehensive data for October means the Federal Reserve will be making its final policy decision of the year with limited visibility into recent economic conditions.\nMuch of the recent shift in rate cut expectations stems from commentary by Fed officials late last week. Markets significantly increased their projections for a December rate reduction after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams indicated on Friday that the central bank retained justification for trimming rates next month. Williams pointed to potential vulnerabilities in the labor market while also observing that upside risks to inflation had diminished.\nIn Monday trading, gold futures settled at $4,120 per ounce, representing a gain of $58, or 1.42%, for the session. Silver also posted strong gains, not only reclaiming the $50 threshold but advancing beyond the $51 level to trade at $51.05 after rising $1.15, or 2.32%.\nThis marked silver's largest single-day advance since November 12. Year-to-date, silver has appreciated by $21.355, or 73.79%, substantially outperforming most other asset classes.\nFor those who would like more information about our services click here.\nWishing you as always good trading,"

                "body": "Two conferences in the Middle East this month opened insights on energy and sustainability from a Middle Eastern perspective.\nThe enormous ADIPEC event in Abu Dhabi brought together hundreds of speakers in 10 different strategic areas and numerous technical sessions across four days.\nDiscussion of sustainability occurred within the context of an imperative for investment to sustain growth in all forms of energy and especially oil and gas. The spotlight was also on AI which received praise for already providing remarkable efficiency gains in petroleum operations and planning.\nA much smaller but equally vibrant event opened in Dubai, where a Dii Desert Energy summit gathered some of the same OEMs and EPCs but wearing very different glasses, seeing a new energy future for the Middle East.\nTogether they shed light on what\u2019s known, and what\u2019s unknown, about the world\u2019s energy future.\nWords and phrases\nDr. Sultan Al Jaber, ADNOC Managing Director and Group CEO, who is also UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, set the tone for ADIPEC in his opening remarks.\n\u201cTune out the noise, track the signal,\u201d he said. \u201cNear-term uncertainty is real, while long-term demand remains strong.\u201d\n\u201cThe long-term outlook shows demand growth for every form of energy across every market.\n\u201cRenewables will more than double by 2040, LNG will grow 50 percent, jet fuel will grow more than 30 percent and oil will stay above 100 million barrels per day beyond 2040,\u201d he said.\nAl Jaber noted that petroleum will be increasingly used for materials as well as for mobility. He noted that electricity demand will surge as power for data centers grows four-fold, 1.5 billion people locate to cities, and 2 billion air conditioners are added worldwide by 2040. In aviation, the global airline fleet will double by the same year.\nHe highlighted another major theme, voicing a pervasive concern for investment capital, saying, \u201cWe need to free up dormant capital that is tied up in existing energy infrastructure assets.\u201d\nHis address was followed by remarks from Doug Burgum, US Secretary of the Interior and Chairman of National Energy Dominance Council.\nRelated: US Drillers Pick Up The Pace\n\u201cToday is the day to announce that there is no energy transition, there is only energy addition and that we need to have more power,\u201d he said.\nThe term \u2018energy addition\u2019 was deployed frequently during the four days with others including \u2018energy abundance\u2019, \u2018energy realism\u2019, and \u2018energy pragmatism\u2019. One phrase notably absent from Dr. Al Jaber\u2019s address, and from almost the entire event, was \u2018climate change\u2019.\nThis might not be surprising except for the fact that Al Jaber served as president of the COP28 conclave in Dubai two years ago, which was the first UN climate summit to explicitly recognize fossil fuels as a cause of climate change and to call for a transition away from them.\nThe phrase was used, however, by Bill Gates, who appeared prerecorded on-screen at one technology discussion, where he stated his optimism about innovation to enable decarbonization. He said that lowering carbon emissions is necessary to maximize human welfare and he called for leadership in deploying key technologies.\nNo oil glut\nOPEC used the event to present highlights of its World Oil Outlook 2025 report, which combines certainty about long-term demand growth with great concern for investment. The report foresees global energy demand expanding by 23% to 2050, in part from energy-intensive industries including AI. It sees oil demand reaching 123 million barrels per day in 2050, requiring $18.2 trillion in oil-related investment during the period 2025-50, most of that being upstream investment.\nAs for short-term forecasts, the CEOs, industry reps, and high-level ministers at ADIPEC saw little sign of oversupply in 2026. But they were more interested in looking long-term and their consensus was that capital investment has been deficient, especially in the oil sector.\n\u201cI don't think there's going to be glut,\u201d "

                "body": "Oil prices saw a modest decline on Tuesday amid persistent concerns about oversupply and heightened market caution as investors closely monitored ongoing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Brent crude oil traded at $62.42 per barrel, showing a 0.49 percent dip from recent levels, pressured primarily by a growing glut in the global market. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased 33 cents, or 0.56 percent, to $58.59 per barrel.\nAlongside geopolitical factors influencing supply outlooks, the market\u2019s mood was tempered by signals from major oil producers and economic forecasts pointing to a continued surplus that outweighs demand growth.\nOversupply pressures\nThe overriding theme shaping oil prices in late 2025 remains the substantial oversupply across global markets. Despite some production discipline attempts by OPEC+ groups, aggregate oil output continues to outpace demand growth. Latest data indicates a supply surplus of approximately 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025, with production gains coming from a variety of sources, including OPEC members raising output, as well as non-OPEC producers like the United States, Brazil, and Canada expanding their drilling activities. Offshore projects in Brazil and Guyana have contributed ahead-of-schedule supply increases, further saturating the market.\nMarket analysts point out that while global oil demand is expected to grow modestly by about 1.0 to 1.3 million barrels per day in 2025, this uptick is insufficient to absorb the rising inventories. The non-OECD countries largely drive demand increases, with growth in nations such as China, Nigeria, and other emerging markets. In contrast, OECD demand remains flat or slightly declining, reflecting energy efficiency gains and shifts towards alternative energy sources.\nTechnical trading patterns for Brent crude signal a cautious outlook, with prices repeatedly testing resistance near $63 per barrel but failing to sustain upward momentum due to supply overhang. The futures market echoes this sentiment, projecting potential price drops toward the mid to high $50s if production targets are maintained or increased. Analysts suggest a breakthrough above $66 per barrel would be necessary to catalyze a bullish reversal. Downward price pressure is further reinforced by global inventory builds, including substantial crude storage in floating tankers offshore.\nNegotiations impacting energy supply\nGeopolitical uncertainty adds complexity to this supply-demand imbalance. The ongoing negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have drawn intensive investor focus, with the hope that a peace agreement could stabilize or reshape regional energy market dynamics. A framework for peace could lead to a relaxation or lifting of the stringent sanctions currently imposed on key Russian oil producers such as Rosneft and Lukoil, potentially unleashing additional volumes of Russian crude onto the global market.\nSuch a development would exacerbate oversupply concerns, further weighing on prices. However, until concrete progress is made, markets are navigating a delicate landscape where sanctions remain in place restricting some flows, while diplomatic efforts reduce fears of abrupt supply shocks caused by intensified conflict or retaliatory measures.\nRecent U.S. initiatives led by the Biden administration have aimed at balancing support for Ukraine with strategic considerations for global energy stability. These delicate diplomatic moves have injected volatility, with energy traders adjusting positions based on perceived shifts in sanction regimes and potential new Russian export routes bypassing Western restrictions.\nSupply growth and production outlook\nThe supply side remains robust with OPEC+ and other major producers confirming plans to hold or moderately increase production through the end of 2025 into early 2026. OPEC+ has officially raised output quotas multiple times during 2025, though with moderated increases expected following recent decis"

The company is benefiting from lessons the industry has learned developing hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in US shale fields, said Musabbeh Al Kaabi, chief executive for upstream.\n\u201cWe are making a remarkable progress with the unconventional resources,\u201d Al Kaabi said in an interview at the Adipec conference in Abu Dhabi. \u201cThe results we see so far are very promising, in some areas exceeding what we see in the US.\u201d\nThe UAE and other Middle Eastern states are ramping up gas projects, seeing the fuel as a key source of energy for the power-hungry data center boom. In addition to building the multibillion-dollar Ruwais liquefied natural gas project, Adnoc has stakes in export facilities in the US and Africa. Ruwais will add 9.6 million tons of annual gas export capacity, more than doubling Adnoc\u2019s production capability.\n\u201cThe story of the unconventionals in the US inspired a lot of people around the world,\u201d Al Kaabi said. \u201cThe lessons learned, the technology deployment, the capabilities developed in the US and other places put us in a very strong position to capitalize on these capabilities and deliver a successful story.\u201d\nThe shale revolution has transformed energy production in the US, turning it from one of the world\u2019s biggest importers of oil and gas to a major exporter. Yet other countries have struggled to replicate the success for a variety of issues \u2014 access to water for fracking, local opposition to drilling activity, challenging geology.\nThe UAE is working with Houston-based EOG Resources Inc. to develop its oil and gas reserves. France\u2019s TotalEnergies SE and Malaysia\u2019s Petroliam Nasional Bhd also operate in the country.\nThe UAE aims to be self sufficient in gas supply by the end of this decade, leaving excess volumes for export. Adnoc is also building up its LNG trading as producers such as the US ramp up export capacity to supply regions like Asia, where demand is set to grow for decades. The company\u2019s international investment unit is targeting supplies globally, including a deal announced this week to potentially join a project in Argentina.\nThe Abu Dhabi firm is now trading three times more LNG than the company produces itself, Ahmed Bin Thalith, the head of Adnoc Global Trading, said in an interview on Wednesday.\nShare This:"

These projects are set to boost the U.S. Gulf Coast region\u2019s capacity to transport natural gas by 13%, per data compiled by Bloomberg on the basis of EIA estimates.\nThat would be the biggest expansion of pipeline capacity in one year since the dawn of the shale gas boom in 2008.\nThere has never been a better time to be in the business of building natural gas pipelines in the United States, executives at pipeline giants say.\nU.S. natural gas supply is rising, domestic and export demand is soaring, and the U.S. federal regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically in favor of new oil and gas infrastructure projects.\nCompanies have committed $50 billion worth of investments in new gas pipelines that would add 8,800 miles of new pipeline in the United States, energy consultants Wood Mackenzie say.\nUnlike in previous cycles of massive gas pipeline expansions, when producers led pipeline investment to reach demand markets, this time the buildout is being led by LNG exporters, utilities, and data centers, WoodMac noted.\nIn the past, \u201cPipeline development was the unsung hero connecting low-cost resources to markets,\u201d the energy consulting firm says.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing a fundamental shift: demand pull from LNG exporters and power companies is driving new pipeline investment, moving away from the traditional producer-led model.\u201d\nU.S. LNG exports are surging to record highs, with more export projects expected to start up by the end of the decade.\nAmerica\u2019s electricity demand is also soaring, thanks to the onshoring of manufacturing and the sky-high energy consumption of data centers.\nAt the same time, the booming oil production in the Permian is boosting the supply of natural gas as a by-product, too. And producers struggle to make use of the gas with limited available spare pipeline capacity.\nIn recent months, prices at the Waha gas hub in West Texas have crashed into negative territory multiple times, and flaring has soared as producers have been forced to pay offtakers to get rid of the natural gas. All because operational pipelines are not enough to ship the gas to places where it\u2019s needed\u2014power plants and LNG export facilities.\nNew pipelines are set to address part of the bottleneck problem and send the gas to demand centers\u2014be it data centers, manufacturing, chemicals production, or LNG exports.\nEarlier this week, ExxonMobil agreed to buy 40% in the new Bahia natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline from Enterprise Products Partners as producers and pipeline operators expand gas takeaway capacity in the Permian basin.\nThe expanded pipeline, Cowboy Connector Pipeline, will connect Exxon\u2019s growing production in the Permian to U.S. Gulf Coast refining and chemical facilities and enable access to export logistics to serve markets around the world, the supermajor said.\nCanada-based pipeline giant TC Energy early this month said it expects North American natural gas demand to surge in the medium to long term, thanks to soaring U.S. LNG exports and \u201cunprecedented power demand\u201d from data centers and coal-to-gas conversions.\nTC Energy has "

The sixth-month WTI contract averaged a 62 cents/b premium to front-month during the week to Nov. 21, a Platts analysis showed, up from a 16 cent/b premium the week prior. Platts is part of S&P Global Energy, Total refinery utilization likely climbed around 0.7 percentage point to 90.7% of capacity, analysts said, putting runs around 2.5% above normal for this time of year. Surging distillate cracks have underpinned a significant rally in whole barrel margins this month. The US Gulf Coast WTI MEH cracking margin has averaged $18.86/b to date in November, Platts data showed, up from $14.65/b in October. The USGC ULSD crack versus WTI MEH surged 28% to $40.17/b this month from $31.45/b in October, Commodity Insights data showed, while the same crack for unleaded 87 gasoline was up 17% at $22.55/gal in November versus $19.25/b in October. Nationwide gasoline stocks likely climbed 500,000 barrels to around 207.9 million barrels, analysts said, while distillate stocks were seen 1.2 million barrels higher at 112.3 million barrels. The expected distillate build was directionally seasonal, but well shy of the roughly 3-million-barrel uptick averaged during the same period in recent years, widening the deficit to the five-year average to 7.6% from 6.4% the week prior. \u2014 Christopher Vanmoessner, christopher.vanmoessner@spglobal.com-- Edited by Gary Gentile, newsdesk@spglobal.com--Platts Electricity Alert--"

                "body": "Bitcoin price today: rate cut cheer spurs recovery to $88k, but caution persists\nThe EUR/USD exchange rate is being pulled in two different directions by the current macroeconomic backdrop. On one side, the United States continues to maintain a clear interest rate and real-rate advantage. On the other, the Eurozone\u2019s external sector (trade and current account surpluses) remains a powerful structural support for the euro. The result is a currency pair supported by fundamentals on both sides, but without a decisive catalyst for a strong breakout in either direction.\nThe policy rate gap remains firmly in the dollar\u2019s favour. With the Federal Reserve at 4.09% and the ECB at 2.00%, the euro faces a negative carry of \u20132.09%. Real rates tell the same story: U.S. real policy rates sit at roughly +1.07%, while Europe\u2019s real rate is closer to +0.90%, producing a real-rate differential of \u20131.17% for the euro. Historically, such a setup favours USD strength, particularly in periods when markets prioritise yield over growth drivers.\nSource: FXMacroData\nInflation differentials continue to lean modestly toward the United States. Eurozone inflation stands at 2.10%, while U.S. inflation is 3.02%, leaving a \u20130.92% inflation differential. According to purchasing-power-parity logic, this suggests slight euro undervaluation over the long run. However, PPP is a slow force (not a short-term trading signal) so its influence remains secondary to the dominant yield gap.\nSource: FXMacroData\nLabour-market conditions show a similar split. U.S. unemployment at 4.30% is lower than the Eurozone\u2019s 6.34%, supporting the narrative of relatively stronger U.S. economic momentum. Yet this advantage is not translating into a stronger external sector. The Eurozone records a substantial trade surplus of \u20ac42.3B and a current account surplus of \u20ac23.1B.\nThe United States, by contrast, runs a trade deficit of \u2013$59.5B and a current account deficit of \u2013$251B. These structural gaps historically anchor long-run euro strength by ensuring net foreign demand for European assets and goods.\nSource: FXMacroData\nBond-market spreads continue to favour the U.S. dollar. The EUR\u2013USD 10-year yield differential is \u20130.94%, reflecting higher long-term returns in U.S. government debt. At the same time, the euro yield curve is slightly steeper than the U.S. curve, driven more by lower front-end rates than higher long-end yields. Yield-curve shape matters less than level: the dollar\u2019s yield premium remains the decisive factor for global investors.\nSource: FXMacroData\nSource: FXMacroData\nOverall, the EUR/USD pair sits at the intersection of two competing fundamentals, leaving neither side with enough macro strength to force a clear direction. With yield spreads favouring the dollar and Europe\u2019s external surpluses anchoring the euro, the most reasonable stance is a cautious hold until one of these forces finally breaks the stalemate.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

                "body": "EUR/USD trades with mild positive bias around 1.1525-30 as Fed rate cut bets undermine USD\n- EUR/USD attracts some buyers for the second straight day amid subdued USD price action.\n- The divergent Fed-ECB policy expectations turn out to be a key factor supporting the pair.\n- Traders now look to the final German Q3 GDP print and US macro data for a fresh impetus.\nThe EUR/USD pair edges higher for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, though it lacks follow-through buying and remains confined in the previous day's broader range. Spot prices currently trade around the 1.1525-1.1530 region, up less than 0.10% for the day.\nThe recent comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials lifted market bets for another rate cut in December, which keeps the US Dollar (USD) depressed below its highest level since late May and acts as a tailwind for the EUR/USD pair. New York Fed President John Williams described the current policy as modestly restrictive and told reporters last Friday that the central bank can still cut interest rates in the near term.\nAdding to this, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Monday that available data showed the US job market remains weak enough to warrant another quarter-point rate cut at the December policy meeting. Traders were quick to react and are now pricing in around 80% chances that the Fed will lower borrowing costs next month, which, along with a generally positive risk tone, undermines the safe-haven buck.\nThe shared currency, on the other hand, seems to draw support from bets that the European Central Bank (ECB) is done cutting interest rates. In fact, a majority of economists expect that the ECB will hold its deposit rate this year and see no change by the end of next year. This turns out to be another factor supporting the EUR/USD pair and backs the case for some meaningful appreciating move in the near term.\nTraders now look forward to the release of the final German Q3 GDP for some impetus. Meanwhile, the US economic docket features the delayed release of the US Producer Price Index (PPI) and monthly Retail Sales data, along with Pending Home Sales and Richmond Manufacturing Index. This might influence the USD price dynamics and produce some short-term trading opportunities around the EUR/USD pair.\nEconomic Indicator\nGross Domestic Product (QoQ)\nThe Gross Domestic Product released by the Statistisches Bundesamt Deutschland is a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced by Germany. The GDP is considered as a broad measure of the German economic activity and health. A high reading or a better than expected number has a positive effect on the EUR, while a falling trend is seen as negative (or bearish).\nRead more.Next release: Tue Nov 25, 2025 07:00\nFrequency: Quarterly\nConsensus: 0%\nPrevious: 0%\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar Hovers at 1.1540 as Fed Cut Bets Rise\nThe euro steadies near 1.1540 after bouncing from 1.1490, buoyed by dovish Fed comments and a weaker U.S. dollar | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Rebounds Toward 1.1550 as Fed Dovish Signals Clash With Weak Eurozone Data\nThe EUR/USD pair is trading near 1.1540, gaining momentum after rebounding from 1.1490 on Friday. The recovery followed a volatile week dominated by risk repricing in global assets and renewed optimism that the Federal Reserve could deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut in December. The probability of such a move has risen to 69%, up from 44% a week earlier, as U.S. yields softened and the Dollar Index (DXY) pulled back to 100.15 from last week\u2019s highs. The catalyst came from dovish comments by New York Fed President John Williams, who said policymakers have \u201croom to adjust\u201d monetary policy in the near term without jeopardizing the inflation target. His remarks reversed part of the prior week\u2019s dollar strength triggered by tighter rhetoric from officials like Boston Fed President Susan Collins and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, both of whom cautioned against premature easing.\nU.S. Data Strengthens Fed Cut Bets but Mixed Signals Keep Dollar Defensive\nDespite a more optimistic tone on policy, U.S. macro data remains uneven. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index improved to 51 in November from 50.3, while inflation expectations for one year ahead eased to 4.5% from 4.7%. The five-year outlook also slipped to 3.4%, indicating mild disinflationary sentiment. Meanwhile, the S&P Global Services PMI rose to 55.0, surpassing expectations of 54.8, whereas the Manufacturing PMI slowed to 51.9 from 52.5. These releases show the U.S. economy holding above recessionary thresholds but decelerating enough to justify policy flexibility. The combination has capped dollar gains and given the euro space to stabilize above the 1.15 threshold.\nEurozone Weakness Persists: German IFO, PMI Data Reinforce Growth Concerns\nThe euro\u2019s recovery has occurred despite weak European fundamentals. The German IFO Business Climate Index fell to 88.1 in November from 88.4, missing consensus forecasts of 88.5. Economic expectations deteriorated to 90.6, down from 91.6, signaling continued pessimism among firms. The Eurozone HCOB Manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.7 from 50.0, missing the expected improvement to 50.2, confirming renewed contraction in the industrial sector. The Services PMI edged slightly higher to 53.1 from 53.0, but the Composite Index eased to 52.4, underscoring slow expansion. In Germany, manufacturing activity contracted to 48.4, while services cooled sharply to 52.7 from 54.6, far below the forecast of 53.9. These readings underline that the Eurozone\u2019s largest economy remains fragile despite mild stabilization in southern Europe.\nECB Policy Stability Offers Limited Cushion for the Euro\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) continues to signal policy patience rather than pivoting toward cuts. President Christine Lagarde emphasized vigilance against inflation and confirmed that no rate changes are expected before late 2025. ECB members remain aligned in maintaining the deposit rate at 4%, contrasting sharply with the Fed\u2019s potential easing bias. This divergence has narrowed rate differentials temporarily in favor of the euro, allowing EUR/USD to defend its 1.147\u20131.150 support area. However, the single currency\u2019s resilience is largely reactive to U.S. weakness rather than evidence of Eurozone strength.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD Rebounds from Support but Faces Heavy Resistance at 1.1550\nFrom a technical perspective, EUR/USD remains under short-term bearish pressure despite recent stabilization. The pair trades below both the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (1.1553 and 1.1600), confirming a capped structure. A sustained break above 1.1539 is required to neutralize the downside bias. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recovered from over"

A firm dollar amid safe-haven flows keeps the GBP/USD upside in check ahead of the budget.\n-Are you looking for the best AI Trading Brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nMarkets are keenly focusing on the estimated \u00a320 billion structural deficit. The gap demands politically difficult decisions. UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has reportedly stepped back from an income tax hike and instead expects to rely on a mix of stealth taxes, including an extended threshold freeze, tighter rules on salary, higher asset and property taxes, and selective sector-based levies.\nThis approach respects the manifesto pledge to safeguard the working class from additional taxes. However, the patchwork has triggered skepticism in the market. Gilt yields have already swung sharply after reports of a shift in tax plans, increasing the doubts over credibility.\nInvestors are also awaiting an updated forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Weaker growth leaves little room for optimism, and any downgrade in the outlook would result in weaker tax collection and a greater need for consolidation. Political uncertainty also compounds risk, with policy U-turns and soft polling.\nAcross the Atlantic, dovish remarks from Christopher Waller, a Fed official, have strengthened expectations of a December rate cut, with the labor market being the key concern, not inflation. Futures imply an 81% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut now, compared to 31% last week. However, the Fed will be forced to act without the fresh labor data, which will be available near mid-December.\nGBP/USD Key Events Ahead\nWith the US entering Thanksgiving week and liquidity thinning, Cable could stay in a tight range. However, Wednesday\u2019s budget is expected to set the tone for the year-end. Today, markets will be watching the US PPI data, which could lead to short-term market volatility.\nGBP/USD Technical Price Analysis: Bulls Need a 50-MA Breakout\nThe GBP/USD 4-hour chart shows a mild upside momentum during the earlier London session. The price has jumped up to the 50-period MA near 1.3125.

The ADP Employment Change, Retail Sales, and Producer Price Index (PPI) are due later today.

                "body": "AUD/USD hits lows below 0.6450 with the China-Japan tensions weighing\n- The Aussie Dollar dips below 0.6450 against the USD on growing geopolitical frictions\u00a1.\n- Comments of Japanese Takaichi hinting at a response to an attack on Taiwan have raised tensions with China.\n- The US Dollar remains soft as hopes of immediate Fed cuts grow.\nThe Australian Dollar is failing to draw any significant support from the positive market sentiment on Monday. The pair retreated to session lows at 0.644 during the European Morning trading session, down from the 0.6465 highs seen in Asia, leaving price action close to the three-month lows at 0.6429 hit on Friday.\nThe Aussie Dollar is among the worst performers on Monday amid escalating tensions between Japan and China, Australia's largest trading partners. China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi affirmed earlier on Monday that Japanese PM Takaichi \u201ccrossed a red line\u201d when she suggested that a Chinese action against Taiwan would trigger a military response from Japan.\nThe rising tensions in an already volatile area have offset the impact of the positive Australian data seen last week. Preliminary PMI data revealed that Australian manufacturing activity returned to growth levels in November, after October\u2019s contraction, and that services activity accelerated for the second consecutive month, which reaffirms the RBA\u2019s hawkish stance.\nIn the US, the positive USD impact of the S&P Global PMIs and the improvement in the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index were offset by dovish comments from Fed\u2019s Williams, who hinted at further interest rate cuts in the coming months.\nWilliams, the President of the New York Fed and vice chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), affirmed on Friday that the central bank has leeway to lower interest rates without risking its inflation target. Chances of a 25 basis points cut in December jumped to 75% from around 45% earlier in the week, according to the CME Group's Fed Watch Tool, which sent the US Dollar retreating against its main peers.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the pric"

The Australian Dollar (AUD) holds steady but struggles to attract fresh buying interest amid a cautious market backdrop.\nGeopolitical concerns continue to weigh on risk appetite. Tensions escalated after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that a Chinese military action against Taiwan could trigger a response from Japan, comments that China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi described as crossing a \u201cred line.\u201d With China and Japan being Australia\u2019s two largest trading partners, this flare-up keeps investors on the defensive and limits Aussie upside potential.\nThe stabilizing tone of the AUD contrasts with the broadly supportive domestic backdrop. Preliminary Australian Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data last week showed Manufacturing activity returning to growth in November, while Services activity accelerated for a second consecutive month, reinforcing the restrictive stance of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). However, these positive signs are overshadowed for now by renewed geopolitical uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific region.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar (USD) remains under pressure. The impact of stronger S&P Global PMIs and the improvement in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index was offset by dovish comments from John Williams, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Vice Chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Williams noted that the central bank has room to lower interest rates without jeopardizing progress on inflation.\nAccording to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool, markets now assign a 75% chance to a 25-basis-point rate cut in December, sharply higher than the 45% priced a week earlier. This shift continues to soften the USD and helps AUD/USD maintain its current consolidation phase.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

Yen finally saw a mild relief after weeks of depreciation when government officials issued a strong verbal warning.\n-Are you looking for the best AI Trading Brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nSatsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s Finance Minister, delivered a forceful statement on Friday, cautioning that authorities \u201cwill not hesitate to act if markets show disorderly behavior\u201d. This was more restrained language than the previous, showing that Tokyo is actively monitoring the situation.\nThe pressure increased further when Takuji Aida, a member of the government advisory panel, noted that Japan could intervene without delay to safeguard the economy from excessive yen weakening. His comments reinforced expectations that the government could resort to a yen-buying operation if speculative pressure increases.\nPolitical developments have also contributed to the yen\u2019s weakness, as the new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, is pro-stimulus, introducing a $135 billion package. Markets worry that the increased debt load could delay the Bank of Japan\u2019s monetary tightening, prolonging structural weakness. The yen has fallen 6% since she took office.\nMeanwhile, central bank divergence also remains a tailwind for the USD/JPY as the Bank of Japan maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve remains significantly tighter. Widening rate differentials encourage outflows from Japan. However, the recent Fed commentary from New York President Williams, pointing to labor weakness as a key concern, brought back the odds of a rate cut in December, weighing on the dollar.\nUSD/JPY Key Events Ahead\nA significant event on Tuesday is the US PPI data, which will reveal wholesale inflation and also reflect business activity. A downtick could reinforce the odds of a rate cut, providing room for the yen to strengthen against the dollar.\nUSD/JPY Technical Outlook: Sellers Looking at 155.90\nThe 4-hour chart shows a building bearish pressure, forming small candles under the 20-period MA. The pressure is mounting slowly to test the 50-period MA near 155.90.

                "body": "USD/JPY bounces up and nears 157.00 with BoJ intervention looming\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\n- The US Dollar picks up against a weaker Yen and reaches session highs at above 156.90.\n- Concerns about the Japanese cabinet's fiscal largesse keep weighing on the Yen.\n- Growing hopes of Fed cuts are keeping the US Dollar from rallying further\nThe US Dollar retraces some of Friday\u2019s losses and trades at 155.85 in the European midday, up from Friday\u2019s low at 156.20. The positive risk sentiment and ongoing concerns about Japanese PM Takaichi\u2019s expansive policies keep weighing on the Yen, which has depreciated about 7% since early October.\nNews that Japan\u2019s cabinet approved a 21 trillion Yen (USD 135 billion) stimulus package on Friday reactivated fears about the country\u2019s already strained public finances.\nThe pair, however, retreated on Friday after the Japanese Finance Minister Takayama reiterated her concern about excessive volatility and speculative movements on FX markets, and warned that Japanese authorities will take \u201cappropriate action\u201d, the most clear intervention threat so far this year.\nThe BoJ might step in to stem JPY weakness\nInvestors remain selling the Yen on Monday, hopeful that the Bank of Japan will wait until the end of the week to intervene in FX markets. The central bank usually acts at moments of low market liquidity to optimise the impact of its actions, and this week, the US Thanksgiving festivity offers a great opportunity.\nThe US Dollar, in turn, remains soft amid the combination of renewed hopes of Federal Reserve monetary easing and the brighter market sentiment.\nNew York Fed President John Williams boosted investors\u2019 optimism on Friday, affirming that the central bank has some margin to ease monetary policy further without putting its inflation goals at risk, which prompted investors to ramp up expectations of a 25 basis points cut in December. The comments added pressure on the US Dollar on Friday.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and copywriter in diverse Forex-related firms, like FXStreet and Kantox."

Moreover, spot prices remain close to an over two-week top touched last Friday and seem poised to appreciate further amid a supportive fundamental backdrop.\nCrude Oil prices struggle to capitalize on the previous day's bounce from a one-month low and meet with a fresh supply amid concerns that supply will exceed demand next year.

The pair may depreciate as the US Dollar (USD) retreats as growing expectations of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in December intensify, driven by recent dovish remarks from Fed policymakers.\nThe CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in an 81% chance that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, up from 71% probability that markets priced a day ago.\nFed Governor Christopher Waller told Fox Business on Monday that his primary concern is the weakening labour market, stating that inflation is \u201cnot a big problem\u201d in light of recent softness in employment. Waller also suggested that the September payrolls figure is likely to be revised lower and cautioned that concentrated hiring is \u201cnot a good sign,\u201d signalling his support for a near-term rate cut.\nFed Waller\u2019s remarks reinforced comments made on Friday by New York Fed President John Williams, which also contributed to shifting expectations toward earlier rate cuts.

Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest ra"

The currency is still hovering close to a seven-month low despite Wall Street\u2019s upbeat momentum and oil climbing 1.3% to $58.84 a barrel. Recent economic data hasn\u2019t helped: factory sales slid 1.1%, especially in chemicals and wood products, and the economy likely grew just 0.5% last quarter, barely dodging another contraction. Trade talks with the US remain stalled, adding to investor caution. Canadian bond yields keep dropping alongside US ones, suggesting markets are nervous ahead of the GDP update. The loonie\u2019s typical bounce in risk-on markets just isn\u2019t kicking in this time.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Investors are pressing pause on the loonie\u2019s comeback.\nEven with optimism in global markets and hopes for a US rate cut, the Canadian dollar isn\u2019t gaining ground. The familiar playbook of risk-on sentiment and firmer oil usually gives the loonie a lift, but lukewarm Canadian data and ongoing economic questions have investors sitting on the sidelines. They\u2019re watching to see if Canada can avoid recession and if demand for exports and factory goods can pick up again.\nThe bigger picture: Domestic hurdles are muddying the global view.\nCanada\u2019s economic story is being shaped by more than just local trends. Slow factory sales, modest GDP growth, and uncertain trade relations with the US are feeding into a global narrative, especially with both US and Canadian bond yields drifting lower. The loonie\u2019s muted reaction in the face of positive global moves underlines how much local economic struggles and trade uncertainties are now steering broader market expectations and policy thinking into 2025.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

Once surpassed, the next stop is the 20-day SMA at 203.30.\nGBP/JPY Price Chart \u2013 Daily\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "GBP/JPY steadies above 205.00 with all eyes on UK budget\n- The Pound stalls below 205.50 against a weak Japanese Yen.\n- Investors remain wary of placing large GBP longs with the UK budget in focus.\n- The JPY remains offered despite growing speculation of a BoJ intervention.\nThe Pound has ticked up from Friday\u2019s lows at 204.30, but it is struggling to find significant acceptance above the 205.00 level on Monday, despite the positive risk sentiment. Investors\u2019 cautiousness ahead of the release of the UK budget and growing speculation of a BoJ intervention have left the pair looking for direction.\nIn the UK, all eyes are on the Autumn Budget, which will be released next Wednesday. Chancellor Rachel Reaves hinted at increasing the Income Tax rises weeks ago before stepping back. Wednesday\u2019s budget, however, is highly likely to deliver significant tax rises to tackle the country\u2019s increasing fiscal deficit.\nThis has boosted the Bank of England, which will be forced to ease interest rates in the coming months ot offsett the economic impact of higher taxes. Beyond that, recent UK macroeconomic figures have shown figures consistent with a steep economic slowdown, strengthening the case for an upcoming BoE rate cut.\nTakaichi's fiscal largesse weighs on the Yen\nThe Japanese Yen, in turn, has been unable to draw significant support from the Pound\u2019s weakness, weighed by flaws of its own. Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s cabinet approved last week a 21 trillion Yen (USD 135 billion) stimulus program, which has boosted concerns about the already strained public finances.\nYen weakness prompted Japanese authorities to ramp up their rhetoric against excessive FX volatility, issuing a rather explicit intervention warning last Friday. Investors, however, remain selling the JPY on Monday, hopeful that the BoJ will wait until the end of the week to step in. The bank normally intervenes when trading volumes are light, aiming to trigger the maximum impact, and the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, due on Thursday, offers a great opportunity.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and c"

The US spot Bitcoin ETFs just recorded a shocking $145.4 million net outflow, reversing the previous day\u2019s gains and sending ripples through the digital asset market. This significant shift in investor sentiment demands immediate attention from anyone involved in Bitcoin ETFs.\nWhat Caused the Bitcoin ETFs Outflow Surge?\nAccording to data from TraderT, the outflow pattern reveals crucial insights about institutional behavior. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT experienced the largest withdrawal at $143.48 million, representing the majority of the total outflow. This massive movement from one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers signals potential concerns about short-term Bitcoin ETF performance.\nOther major players also contributed to the outflow trend. Ark Investment\u2019s ARKB saw $11.65 million exit, while Bitwise\u2019s BITB recorded a $5.79 million withdrawal. The coordinated nature of these outflows suggests broader market forces at play rather than isolated investor decisions.\nIs There Any Positive News for Bitcoin ETFs?\nDespite the overwhelming outflow trend, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC emerged as the lone bright spot. The fund attracted $15.49 million in net inflows, demonstrating that some investors remain confident in specific Bitcoin ETFs. This divergence in performance highlights the importance of fund selection even within the same asset class.\nThe market for Bitcoin ETFs continues to show volatility as investors weigh various factors:\n- Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency\n- Broader market conditions and risk appetite\n- Specific fund management strategies and track records\n- Short-term price movements in underlying Bitcoin assets\nWhat Do These Bitcoin ETFs Movements Mean for Investors?\nThe sudden return to outflows after just one day of net inflows indicates ongoing uncertainty in the Bitcoin ETF space. This volatility pattern suggests that investors are actively rebalancing their positions rather than making long-term commitments to these Bitcoin ETFs.\nFor current investors in Bitcoin ETFs, this development serves as a crucial reminder to monitor fund flows regularly. The concentration of outflows in specific funds like BlackRock\u2019s IBIT underscores the need for diversified exposure across multiple Bitcoin ETFs to mitigate single-fund risk.\nHow Should You Approach Bitcoin ETFs Now?\nThe recent $145.4 million outflow from Bitcoin ETFs doesn\u2019t necessarily signal a long-term trend reversal. However, it does emphasize the importance of understanding fund-specific dynamics within the broader Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. Smart investors should consider both the quantitative data and qualitative factors when evaluating their Bitcoin ETF positions.\nKey considerations for Bitcoin ETF investors include:\n- Track fund flow patterns over multiple periods\n- Analyze fund manager reputation and strategy\n- Monitor overall market sentiment toward Bitcoin\n- Consider dollar-cost averaging to manage volatility\nFinal Thoughts on Bitcoin ETFs Market Movement\nThe $145.4 million net outflow from US spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency investments. While short-term fluctuations can be concerning, they also present opportunities for informed investors who understand the underlying market mechanics of Bitcoin ETFs.\nThe divergence between Fidelity\u2019s inflows and other funds\u2019 outflows suggests that selective investment strategies may outperform broad market approaches in the volatile Bitcoin ETF space. As always, thorough research and careful position sizing remain essential for navigating these digital asset waters successfully.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are Bitcoin ETFs?\nBitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain expos"

                "body": "Binance's Aster attack on Hyperliquid's open interest and trading volume, along with the subsequent attacks on HLP by $JELLYJELLY and $POPCAT, are merely minor ailments.\nAmidst the booming HIP-3 growth mode, the rumored BLP (lending protocol), and the positive news of $USDH actively staking 1 million $HYPE tokens to become aligned quote assets, Hyperliquid has revealed its own cracks\u2014the HyperEVM ecosystem and $HYPE are not yet aligned.\nAlignment is not complicated. Under normal circumstances, the HyperEVM ecosystem consumes $HYPE, and $HYPE will also support the development of the HyperEVM ecosystem.\nThis is an abnormal situation. The Hyperliquid Foundation's focus remains on the use of $HYPE in the spot, contract, and HIP-3 markets of HyperCore, while the development of the HyperEVM ecosystem remains a second-class citizen.\nEarlier, a third party proposed the HIP-5 proposal, hoping to allocate some funds from the $HYPE buyback fund to support ecosystem project tokens. However, this proposal was met with overall rejection and skepticism from the community. This points to a harsh reality: the current price of $HYPE is entirely supported by HyperCore market buybacks and has no spare capacity to support the HyperEVM ecosystem.\nLessons from Others: Ethereum's Successes and Failures in Scaling\nL2 switching to Rollup does not satisfy ETH, and third-party sorters are almost absurd.\nThe development of a blockchain involves three main entities: the main token (BTC/ETH/HYPE), the foundation (DAO, spiritual leader, company), and ecosystem project teams.\nThe future of the blockchain hinges on the interaction model between the main token and ecosystem projects.\n- Main token \u21d4 Ecosystem: Two-way interaction is the healthiest approach. Ecosystem development requires the main token, and the main token empowers ecosystem projects. SOL is currently doing the best in this regard.\n- Main token -> ecosystem; the main token empowers the ecosystem in one direction; after the main token TGE, everyone disperses, as is typical of Monad or Story.\n- Ecosystem -> Main Token, the main token drains ecosystem projects, and the ecosystem is in a state of competition and cooperation with the main token.\nThe evolution of the relationship between Ethereum, its DeFi projects, and L2 is the most direct and can reflect the current state of HyperEVM and its potential for future breakthroughs.\nAccording to 1kx research, the top 20 DeFi protocols account for about 70% of on-chain revenue, but their valuations are far lower than those of underlying public chains. The theory of fat protocols still holds sway, and people trust Uniswap and stablecoins on Ethereum more than Hyperliquid and USDe alone.\nNot to mention that Vitalik has long \"hated\" DeFi but can't live without it, and eventually awkwardly came up with the theory of low-risk DeFi. Many DeFi protocols have tried to build their own portals, from dYdX V4 to MakerDAO's EndGame plan in 2023, with technology choices spanning AltVM systems such as Cosmos and Solana.\nThen came Vitalik's public sale of $MKR. Beyond the interaction between the main token and the ecosystem, people have long underestimated the \"official\" legitimacy of public chains, especially the role of spiritual leaders.\nVitalik's Ethereum Foundation (EF) has long been laissez-faire towards DeFi, focusing instead on metaphysical philosophical concepts. This approach, where the two sides fight like the snipe and the clam, allows the fisherman to profit, and the rise of the Solana DeFi ecosystem is not unrelated to this. Ultimately, Hyperliquid, with its exchange + public chain model, has entered a new phase of competition among public chains.\nSolana's impact on Ethereum has drawn criticism of Vitalik and EF, but beyond DeFi, the gains and losses of L2 Scaling are more intriguing. The L2/Rollup route has not failed technically, but the diversion of L1 revenue has put ETH into a downward cycle.\nImage caption: ETH Dream: L2 Scaling -> L1 Scaling\nImage sour"

A 300% jump in long-term holder selling, ETF outflows of $1.9B | That's TradingNEWS\nEthereum (ETH-USD) Struggles Below $2,900 as Hodler Selling Surges 300% and a Death Cross Forms\nETH-USD Price Overview and Current Market Context\nEthereum (ETH-USD) trades near $2,850, up roughly +1.0% in the past 24 hours but still down \u20139.4% over the past week. Its market capitalization sits at $344 billion, with a daily trading volume of $26.1 billion and circulating supply at 120.7 million ETH. The token has retreated 42% below its all-time high of $4,946.05 from August 2025.\nETH remains trapped inside a steep descending channel, bouncing from a $2,525 low reached last week, but sellers continue to dominate every test of the upper boundary near $3,050\u2013$3,120. RSI levels hover near 33, signaling that momentum remains heavily bearish despite short rebounds.\nTechnical Breakdown: Death Cross Near Completion and Weak EMA Structure\nA looming death cross now defines Ethereum\u2019s structure \u2014 the 50-day EMA is on the verge of crossing below the 200-day EMA, confirming persistent downside momentum. The 2-hour and 4-hour charts show price compressing between $2,815 and $2,947, with all short-term EMAs stacked above spot levels.\nEvery attempt to push above the $2,947 intraday resistance has been met with rejection wicks, revealing seller strength. A failure to clear this barrier risks reopening the $2,710 \u2192 $2,450 support range, exposing a further 13\u201315% downside.\nVolume structure confirms this: the visible-range profile shows heavy participation between $2,500\u2013$2,600, where buyers previously stepped in. Below that shelf, liquidity thins rapidly until $2,050\u2013$2,200, meaning a breakdown could accelerate losses.\nOn-Chain Metrics: Exchange Outflows and Hodler Liquidations Paint Conflicted Picture\nData from on-chain trackers show a massive 300% surge in long-term holder selling. Between November 22\u201323, net sales from wallets holding ETH for over 155 days jumped from 334,600 ETH to 1,027,240 ETH, injecting over $2.9 billion in supply pressure.\nThis selling coincides exactly with the death-cross setup, compounding bearish momentum. Large outflows from exchanges \u2014 one of the biggest negative netflows in recent years \u2014 indicate that whales are moving funds to cold storage. While this reduces immediate exchange supply, it also reflects fear of further volatility.\nMeanwhile, derivatives positioning shows muted confidence: open interest dropped from $45 billion to $35.5 billion month-over-month, confirming weaker speculative appetite.\nDerivatives and Liquidity Dynamics: Risk Concentration Among Longs\nDespite the broader decline, short-term traders are attempting to front-run a potential bounce. Open interest rose +2.3% day-on-day to $34.57 billion, while trading volume spiked +25.6% to $73.14 billion, showing rising leverage exposure.\nBinance\u2019s long/short ratio = 2.85, and OKX\u2019s = 1.81, signaling crowding on the long side. This creates asymmetric risk: if ETH-USD is rejected again near $2,947 or $3,000, long liquidations could accelerate declines. Total 24-hour liquidations remain moderate ($49.57 million, balanced between longs $25.8 million and shorts $23.7 million**), but a volatility spike could double those figures.\nMacro Setup and ETF Outflows Intensify Pressure\nThe macro backdrop is worsening for digital assets. Spot Ethereum ETFs have lost $1.9 billion in assets this month, while Bitcoin (BTC-USD) stabilized only near $86,000\u2013$88,000 amid shifting Fed-cut expectations.\nU.S. yields remain sticky, and risk sentiment is fragile after the strong employment data and the AI-bubble correction. ETH\u2019s correlation with equity indices continues above 0.73, meaning any equity selloff directly drags crypto.\nFractal Pattern Resembling 2022\u2019s Breakdown\nAnalysts identify a recur"

The initiative aims to establish Solana as the primary destination for new assets. It provides instant liquidity and a smooth integration into Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, enhancing the user experience.\nSeamless Cross-Chain Token Transfers\nHistorically, bringing non-native assets onto Solana required multiple bridges and wrapped token solutions, leading to fragmented liquidity. Sunrise DeFi addresses this issue by utilizing Wormhole\u2019s Native Token Transfer (NTT) framework. This framework allows tokens from external chains to enter Solana natively, requiring just a single click for users and issuers.\nThe NTT framework ensures tokens are instantly available for trading on major Solana decentralized exchanges, such as Jupiter. This removes previous barriers such as delays, slippage, and technical risks typically associated with cross-chain launches. As a result, users can seamlessly manage tokens in wallets and apps without interruptions.\n.@Sunrise_DeFi is back!\nFollow them to stay updated on MONday\u2019s launch.\nAny asset, from any chain, tradable on Solana on day one with liquidity \ud83c\udf05 https://t.co/s5sTKxgu1v\n\u2014 Wormhole Labs (@wormhole_labs) November 24, 2025\nWormhole\u2019s Sunrise DeFi Streamlines Cross-Chain Integration\nSunrise DeFi enables liquidity providers to pre-seed pools, ensuring full trading functionality as soon as tokens arrive from other chains. This advanced preparation guarantees that trading liquidity is available immediately upon launch. The integration also extends to block explorers and swap tools, offering a seamless experience for both builders and traders from day one.\nThe platform\u2019s debut coincided with the Monad\u2019s MON token mainnet launch. Monad used Sunrise to bridge its tokens to Solana, achieving deep liquidity instantly without needing manual pool creation or third-party wrapping.\nSunrise DeFi is poised to attract both established and new DeFi projects through its streamlined, one-day listing process. Wormhole Labs envisions further expanding supported asset types and enhancing automation for compliance, KYC, and institutional functionality. This progress is expected to unfold by 2026, further cementing Sunrise DeFi\u2019s role as a core platform in Solana\u2019s ecosystem."

                "body": "- Solana developer suggests reducing staking rewards.\n- It's not the first such proposal this year.\n- Those who oppose reducing token inflation say it could hurt Solana\u2019s decentralisation.\nA Solana developer has proposed accelerating the rate the blockchain reduces staking rewards in a bid to cut the number of new tokens entering circulation.\nThe proposal, posted to developer platform Github on November 21, advocates for doubling Solana\u2019s programmed staking reward decline from 15% per year to 30%. If implemented, the measure will prevent almost $3 billion worth of new SOL tokens being created.\n\u201cHigh token inflation increases sell pressure, as some stakers treat staking rewards as ordinary income and need to sell a portion to cover taxes,\u201d Lostintime101, a pseudonymous Solana technical writer and researcher at Helius, a Solana developer platform, said in the proposal.\nNeedlessly high\nSolana pays staking rewards to those who lock up their tokens to help process transactions on the network. Those rewards are programmed to decline until they reach a terminal rate of 1.5%.\nYet many proponents argue that the current rewards are needlessly high, and should be reduced ahead of schedule. The network currently pays out around 6% annually in kind to those who stake SOL tokens. Staking rewards on Ethereum, Solana\u2019s main competitor, are around 3%.\nIt\u2019s not the first attempt by Solana developers to reduce token inflation.\nIn March, Solana\u2019s validators, entities running the blockchain\u2019s distributed network, voted on a multifaceted proposal that aimed to reduce staking rewards by around 66% \u2014 around $3.5 billion worth of new tokens each year at the time.\nThat vote garnered over 61% of votes in favour, falling short of the 66.67% supermajority needed for it to pass.\n\u201cPrevious governance discussions on modifying the inflation schedule became unusually heated and divisive,\u201d Lostintime101 said. \u201cWith this proposal, we aim to avoid repeating those missteps and promote a more focused governance process.\u201d\nTricky issue\nIt\u2019s a tricky issue to navigate. Blockchains like Ethereum and Solana have spawned a $152 billion DeFi ecosystem.\nYet they are still struggling to balance the fees users must pay to transact on them with the incentives given out to those who run the blockchains and secure transactions.\nIt\u2019s not just Solana looking to reduce the tokens it gives out. The Ethereum, Celestia, and Near blockchains have all looked at ways to reduce the inflation of their own tokens this year.\nThose who oppose reducing token inflation say it could hurt Solana\u2019s decentralisation by making validators unprofitable, forcing them to switch off or lose money.\n\u201cAs staking rewards decline, a subset of validators may find it challenging to remain economically sustainable, potentially impacting validator diversity,\u201d Lostintime101 said in the proposal.\nThe number of Solana validators has fallen from a peak of around 2,500 in early 2023 to less than 900 today \u2014 a 64% drop.\nSeveral Solana stakeholders previously told DL News they consider the drop a good thing as it removed underperforming and malicious validators from the network.\nLostintime101 said they estimate the rewards reduction will have a limited impact, with only 84 validators becoming unprofitable after three years.\n\u201cAny adjustment to the inflation schedule must be significant enough to materially reduce emissions, yet moderate enough to avoid introducing shocks to the system,\u201d Lostintime101 said.\n\u201cDoubling the disinflation rate is a straightforward, balanced way to achieve these goals.\u201d\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": "Solana\u2019s ecosystem prepares for a major shift as Wormhole introduces Sunrise DeFi, a platform built to give new assets instant liquidity on their first trading day. The launch marks a structural move for Solana because it keeps capital inside the network during new listings.\nSunrise arrives as Solana seeks deeper liquidity, broader asset coverage, and stronger user retention during high-demand token launches. The platform goes live with MON, the native asset of Monad, which starts trading across Solana\u2019s DeFi markets on Monday.\nPlatform Offers Direct Solana Access to New Assets\nSunrise aims to fix a long-standing issue on Solana. Traders usually move liquidity to other networks before major launches. Capital often leaves early and returns late.\nThe cycle affects liquidity depth during critical listing windows. Sunrise changes this pattern. It creates a unified entry point for new assets while keeping liquidity within Solana.\nAdditionally, Sunrise enables MON holders on Monad to move their tokens to Solana without external detours. The design lets users add liquidity directly to pools that pair MON with USDC, SOL, and other assets.\nHence, Solana\u2019s liquidity providers gain early access to a broader set of trading pairs. The launch also signals Solana\u2019s intention to compete for day-one trading activity, a category that usually favors other ecosystems.\nMoreover, Wormhole\u2019s infrastructure supports the system behind Sunrise. The protocol routes new asset listings to Solana\u2019s major AMMs and aggregators. The design removes fragmentation and presents a single, clear path for users seeking fresh market entries.\nSolana Positions Sunrise as a Gateway for Multi-Asset Expansion\nSunrise also opens a route for future on-chain products that extend beyond traditional crypto tokens. The team expects listings that include tokenized stocks, commodities, and other financial instruments.\nThe platform positions Solana as a hub for diverse digital markets. Consequently, users may treat Solana as a primary venue for new asset launches instead of a secondary stop.\nBesides new listings, Sunrise strengthens Solana\u2019s liquidity profile. Deep day-one liquidity often attracts more sophisticated traders. It also supports fairer price discovery. MON\u2019s arrival tests this structure and may help show the platform\u2019s long-term value.\nSignificantly, Solana users no longer need external networks to access high-profile launches. Sunrise brings those assets directly into Solana\u2019s trading layer. The launch signals a new approach where capital stays within Solana\u2019s markets and supports broader ecosystem growth."

                "body": "When U.S. markets close, the story doesn\u2019t stop. Across the globe, traders keep their eyes on one signal that never really sleeps: Dow Jones futures. These contracts often set the tone for how investors perceive what\u2019s to come, not just in New York but in markets ranging from London to Hong Kong.\nThe Global Mood That Starts in the U.S.\nDow Jones futures are tied to the 30-company index that represents the backbone of the U.S. economy. It\u2019s not just numbers; it\u2019s sentiment in motion. When those futures tick higher overnight, it sends a quiet message that confidence is alive. Markets in Asia may open stronger, and European traders could start the day with a little more optimism.\nThe opposite can happen just as fast. If Dow Jones futures fall after a weak earnings report or an unexpected geopolitical headline, that negativity can sweep across continents before the sun rises over Wall Street. Traders in Tokyo or Frankfurt often react instantly, trimming exposure or shifting toward safer assets.\nThis is how the global market stays connected. A move in one place ripples everywhere else. Yet not every tick in the futures market tells the full story. During quiet hours, trading volumes are thin, and prices can swing more than they should. That is why experienced investors treat those moves as hints, not hard predictions.\nWhat Futures Reveal About Sentiment?\nWatching Dow Jones futures can tell you a lot more than whether stocks will open higher or lower. It is about reading the message behind the numbers. When futures rise while Treasury yields also increase, investors are betting that growth and profits can withstand higher rates. When futures drop but bond yields stay flat, fear might be creeping in about slowing demand or tighter credit.\nThe relationships between different indices also matter. If Dow futures strengthen but Nasdaq futures lag, that often signals rotation into safer, value-oriented names. If it is the other way around, investors might again be chasing risk and growth. These small shifts indicate where the market\u2019s confidence is shifting, something charts alone cannot reveal.\nProfessional traders mix these signals with others. They examine currencies, oil prices, and gold to determine if the story lines up. A stronger dollar might amplify the move. Falling oil can calm inflation worries. It is never about a single market; it is about how all of them talk to each other before the day begins.\nHow Traders Around the World React?\nInstitutional investors rely on Dow futures to manage exposure and protect positions. A European fund that holds U.S. stocks may adjust its futures overnight, hedging against sudden drops before the American session starts. In Asia, traders check the futures data before their own open to gauge if risk appetite is improving or fading.\nEven everyday investors take cues from it. They might not trade futures directly, but they know what it means when futures are green before dawn. It signals calm and optimism. When they are red, it often prompts hesitation, leading to a shift toward gold or cash.\nThe futures market is also where new ideas are first tested. Before analysts publish reports or headlines hit financial news, futures traders are already reacting. They price in the world\u2019s collective anticipation of economic reports, central bank meetings, or corporate results.\nThe Early Pulse of the Market\nDow Jones futures are not fortune-telling tools. They reflect mood, momentum, and human behavior. Every uptick or drop is a mix of fear, hope, and calculation playing out before most traders wake up.\nIf you learn to listen carefully, those early moves reveal something deeper than direction. They show emotion. They capture the moment when confidence begins to build or fade. For anyone following global markets, that whisper from the futures screen often tells the story before the rest of the world has even started watching."

After the announcement on Monday, shares of the computer storage maker surged by more than 9% in after-hours trading.\nThis milestone signals SanDisk\u2019s rapid rise, while Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) faces another setback, remaining excluded from the S&P 500 despite holding more than 640,000 Bitcoin.\nSanDisk\u2019s Rapid Ascent to the S&P 500\nSanDisk\u2019s move from the S&P SmallCap 600 to the S&P 500 reflects its strong market performance over the past few months. Driven by demand from artificial intelligence applications, the company\u2019s market capitalization has reached approximately $33 billion. This surpassed typical small-cap index thresholds, making the switch to the S&P 500 a logical step.\nThe announcement arrived just before the Thanksgiving holiday trading session, highlighting the urgency of the rebalancing. The replacement is occurring outside the usual quarterly rebalance, suggesting strong market momentum. The stock closed up 13.33% on the day of the announcement before the after-hours surge.\nJoining the S&P 500 usually attracts significant passive inflows, as index-tracking funds buy shares to maintain their weightings. This change boosts SanDisk\u2019s institutional investment appeal and liquidity. It also raises the company\u2019s profile among investors focused on large-cap equities in the index.\nSanDisk\u2019s rise is fueled by optimism around AI infrastructure. As businesses use more advanced machine learning models, storage solutions are increasingly critical\u2014driving investor enthusiasm and boosting SanDisk\u2019s valuation over the past year.\nStrategy\u2019s Continued S&P 500 Challenge\nWhile SanDisk celebrates, Strategy remains on the outside looking in, even after meeting several technical requirements. The company, led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, holds 640,808 BTC, valued at around $72.3 billion, making it the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. However, this asset concentration is seen as a liability by index decision makers.\nStrategy was not included in the S&P 500\u2019s September reshuffle, which selected Robinhood, AppLovin, and Emcor. Analysts put the company\u2019s chances of inclusion in December at 70% following strong Q3 results. The firm reported $3.8 billion in Q3 earnings, showing profitability tied to Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\nYet, earnings volatility remains the main hurdle. Strategy\u2019s results fluctuate each quarter with Bitcoin\u2019s price, creating inconsistency with S&P 500 requirements. For instance, Q2 2024 delivered $10 billion in revenue and $14 billion in unrealized gains, while Q1 saw a $4.2 billion loss. The index requires four straight quarters of positive earnings\u2014a threshold that has eluded Strategy due to its Bitcoin-heavy approach.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices gave Strategy a \u2018B-\u2018 credit rating, citing high Bitcoin exposure, low USD liquidity, and a narrow business model. These contribute to traditional finance skepticism about digital asset treasury companies. The rating shows the committee sees Bitcoin-based volatility as incompatible with the stability expected in S&P 500 members.\nEven if Strategy meets the criteria for market capitalization and liquidity, the committee also considers business model diversity, financial stability, and sector representation. While some advocate for evolving index methodologies to include innovative treasury approaches, traditionalists insist on consistent, proven earnings, especially for benchmarks like the S&P 500.\nTraditional Finance Meets Digital Asset Reality\nThe paths of SanDisk and Strategy highlight a broader divide between traditional finance and digital asset business models. Some crypto-exposed companies like Robinhood have entered the S&P 500, yet Strategy\u2019s concentrated Bitcoin position poses unique challenges. The company\u2019s stock is down 35% from its July high of $434"

                "body": "Dow Jones Forecast: The DJIA Attempts to Recover Amid Expectations of an Interest Rate Cut\nOver the last two trading sessions, the Dow Jones Index has gained nearly 1.3%, opening the week with a moderately bullish bias. This rebound follows comments from several Federal Reserve officials suggesting the possibility of an interest rate cut in December\u2019s policy meeting. For now, this has supported buying pressure in the short term. As new confirmations emerge indicating that the Fed may be considering a more consistent rate reduction, a sustained demand for equities could continue to support the index in the coming sessions.\nCould Lower Rates Be Coming by Year-End?\nAt the end of last week, John Williams, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, stated that monetary policy is currently moderately restrictive and that there is room for adjustment in the short term, possibly in favor of lower interest rates. Williams noted that the unemployment rate, which remains above 4%, continues to be a concern, suggesting that the central bank may need to act to prevent a further slowdown in employment. He also mentioned that inflation continues to moderate, making an overly restrictive stance unnecessary.\nWhile other Fed members have emphasized that inflation is not yet fully under control and have avoided explicitly endorsing a rate cut, Williams\u2019s recent comments were welcomed by the market, boosting expectations for lower rates. According to CME Group, the probability of a 25-basis-point (0.25%) rate cut at the December 10 meeting stands at 77.7%, while for January 28 it is 61.8%, suggesting that the current benchmark rate of 4.00% could be reduced to 3.75% within the next two months.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nLower interest rates could provide relief to the equity market, as they would result in lower borrowing costs and make consumption and investment more accessible in the U.S. economy. This could lead to greater corporate income stability and a more positive outlook for the Dow Jones in the short term.\nThis positive sentiment is already reflected in the Top 5 index components, with Goldman Sachs up 0.58%, Caterpillar up 0.44%, Microsoft gaining 0.27%, American Express rising 0.42%, and Home Depot up 0.19% at the start of the week. The major index constituents are maintaining steady buying momentum, reflecting an increase in short-term confidence.\nSource: Slickcharts\nThus, the shift in Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations appears to be acting as a key catalyst for renewed confidence in the Dow Jones. If the outlook for a more flexible monetary policy persists, buying pressure could remain strong in the coming sessions.\nLong-Term Perspective\nDespite the recent rebound in short-term confidence, the long-term outlook remains uncertain. According to the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, market sentiment currently shows 32.6% bullish, 23.9% neutral, and 43.6% bearish expectations regarding equity market performance over the next six months. This indicates that pessimism continues to dominate among long-term investors.\nSource: AAII\nWithout structural catalysts to sustain equity demand, confidence may remain cautious. Although there is optimism in the short term, it could fade quickly if negative sentiment persists. In this scenario, a lack of structural confidence could limit steady demand for indices such as the Dow Jones, potentially triggering stronger selling pressure in the coming months.\nDow Jones Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend Yet to Reestablish: In recent sessions, Dow Jones downward movements have broken the bullish trendline that had held since early April 2025. Although the index has shown some short-term recovery, buying momentum remains insufficient to restore the broader uptrend that dominated most of the year. If the price fails to break above the 50-period moving average, a sideways range could develop, maintaining indecisive behavior in the short term.\n- RSI: The RSI indicator shows a neutral slope, w"

Banking stocks provided significant support, benefiting from expectations of prolonged higher interest rates and improved sentiment around the sector's profitability outlook.\nMining stocks also rallied strongly, with copper producers particularly well-supported. The ongoing theme of supply constraints in key industrial metals continues to underpin valuations, even as broader economic uncertainty persists. Anglo American remained in focus after BHP walked away from fresh merger talks.\nEuropean markets mirrored this positive momentum, helped by dovish commentary from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials. New York Fed President John Williams signalled that rate cuts could arrive \"in the near term\", providing a boost to risk appetite across global equity markets.\nThe recovery marks a significant turnaround from last week's volatility, though traders remain cautious about sustainability. Key economic data releases and the UK budget later this week will test whether this rebound has legs or represents merely a temporary reprieve from selling pressure.\nSterling steadies ahead of budget announcement\nThe British pound held firm against major currencies as traders positioned themselves ahead of Wednesday's much-anticipated UK budget. Sterling has outperformed most major currencies this month despite ongoing fiscal uncertainty and speculation about potential tax rises and spending cuts from the government.\nCurrency markets appear relatively sanguine about the budget's potential impact, with the pound trading in a narrow range. This stability suggests traders are either confident in the government's fiscal management or have already priced in expected measures. The contrast with previous budget periods is notable.\nMarket participants will scrutinise the budget for its implications on growth, inflation and public finances. Any surprises on tax policy or spending plans could trigger significant moves in both sterling and UK assets. The chancellor's balancing act between fiscal responsibility and growth support will be critical.\nAdvertising sector faces headwinds\nThe advertising industry is encountering significant challenges, with multiple companies issuing profit warnings. M&C Saatchi warned that profits would be hit by the US government shutdown, highlighting the sector's vulnerability to broader economic and political developments.\nS4Capital compounded concerns by issuing its own profit warning, citing cautious client spending patterns. The convergence of these downgrades suggests widespread pressure across the advertising industry rather than company-specific issues. Brands are clearly tightening marketing budgets amid economic uncertainty.\nJobs market shows signs of cooling\nUK employment data revealed further softening, with job vacancies falling below 800,000 for the first time since 2021 according to Adzuna. This decline marks a significant shift from the tight labour market conditions that characterised much of the post-pandemic period.\nGraduate roles have fallen particularly sharply, suggesting companies are becoming more selective about hiring at entry level. This trend could have implications for wage inflation and consumer spending patterns as the labour market loses some of its previous tightness.\nThe cooling jobs market provides the Bank of England (BoE) with additional evidence that inflationary pressures are easing. However, it also raises concerns about economic growth and consumer confidence. The central bank faces a delicate balancing act between controlling inflation and supporting employment.\nBitcoin on track for worst month since "

                "body": "Big tech gains and growing Fed rate cut expectations pushed US stocks higher, while upbeat earnings and forecasts added fuel to investor optimism despite lingering concerns over valuations and retail strength.\nabout 11 hours ago \u2022 2 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nUS stocks climbed this week, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite leading the way as investors cheered the prospect of lower interest rates by year-end.\nWhat does this mean?\nThe major tech rally was powered by strong showings from the 'Magnificent Seven' \u2013 including Nvidia \u2013 helping the Nasdaq outpace other indices. Hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut soared after softer economic data hinted the job market and inflation are cooling, fueling dovish signals from policymakers. According to CME Group, futures now price in an 85% chance of a December rate cut, up sharply from last week. Meanwhile, S&P 500 companies delivered standout third-quarter results: 83% topped profit forecasts, with earnings growth clocking in at nearly 15%. Even so, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still on track for monthly declines, despite Deutsche Bank\u2019s upbeat 2026 outlook.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Tech optimism faces valuation questions.\nTech and artificial intelligence stocks are fueling market gains, but lofty valuations keep some investors cautious \u2013 especially as both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 look set for monthly losses, even after Nvidia\u2019s strong forecast. Deutsche Bank\u2019s bullish S&P 500 target for 2026 has set a positive tone, yet investors will be watching for signs of overstretched prices. Meanwhile, upbeat drug trial results at Bristol Myers and policy moves benefiting healthcare firms like Centene and Oscar Health are making healthcare a sector to watch.\nThe bigger picture: Rate cut hopes could boost spending.\nA potential Fed rate cut may lower borrowing costs and spur more investment, but upcoming retail data will offer key clues about consumer strength. The National Retail Federation expects holiday spending to top $1 trillion, putting this week\u2019s Black Friday sales and upcoming Best Buy results in the spotlight for market sentiment. Strong corporate earnings offer some cushion for the market, but lasting momentum will depend on both Fed decisions and real-world consumer spending.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "RFK Jr.\u2019s poems to Olivia Nuzzi are peak cringe \u2014 so were King Solomon\u2019s\nIn biblical times and, apparently, in our current era, erotica is in the eye of the beholder\nImagine receiving a love poem that reads: \u201cYour breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, browsing among the lilies,\u201d going on to say that they are a \u201cmount\u201d that the author wishes to \u201cbetake\u201d himself to.\nThat particular line is from the Song of Songs, the sexiest book in the bible. But it doesn\u2019t sound all that different from the poetry that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. allegedly wrote to journalist Olivia Nuzzi during what she claims was a purely \u201cdigital\u201d affair between the two of them.\n\u201cYr open mouth awaiting my harvest,\u201d the former presidential candidate and current Secretary of Health and Human Services texted Nuzzi according to Ryan Lizza, her ex-fianc\u00e9; he released the \u201cpoetry\u201d in a series of tell-all Substack posts about the affair.\nThe nature metaphors go on, as he allegedly instructs Nuzzi to \u201cdrink\u201d from him: \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t spill a drop,\u2019\u201d he exhorts Nuzzi. \u201cI am a river. You are my canyon. I mean to flow through you.\u201d\nThis thinly-veiled description of a blow job is going viral online, where people cannot stop making fun of RFK\u2019s literary stylings. \u201cThis is why we need better education in the humanities,\u201d joked one post.\nBut the quality of love poems \u2014 or sexts, or erotica \u2014 is often in the eye of the beholder. (Though there are a few timeless classics, like The Book of O.) From inside the relationship, already dizzied by lust or love, the sexual descriptions can read as head-spinningly romantic even if, from the outside, they\u2019re painfully awkward to read.\nPerhaps this is also why the Song of Songs is usually interpreted allegorically, as a description of God\u2019s love for the people of Israel, in Judaism. Later, Christians interpreted the book as a paean to the love between Jesus and the church. If it means what it seems to mean \u2014 if the breasts the author is lusting after are literally breasts \u2014 it\u2019s just too racy. And, perhaps more importantly, too cringe.\nThe book is traditionally believed to be by King Solomon, one of the most venerated kings of ancient Israel, known for his wisdom. (Not incidentally, he is also known for his hundreds of wives and concubines.) And, of course, it\u2019s included in the Bible, a holy text. And yet it is full of both open discussion of breasts and beauty, as well as metaphors that are about as subtle as RFK Jr.\u2019s.\n\u201cHis fruit is sweet to my mouth,\u201d goes one line in the Song of Songs. \u201cHe brought me to the banquet room and his banner of love was over me.\u201d Interpret that how you will, but eating sweet fruit seems thematically similar to opening one\u2019s mouth to receive the bounty of a harvest.\nErotic texts were, in the era the Song of Songs was likely written, often part of the religious ceremonies of other traditions, particularly in fertility cults in the area. Still, how do you justify a great wise king discussing his lover\u2019s breasts and dreaming of how her \u201crounded thighs are like jewels\u201d \u2014 especially a king that was supposedly a titan of monotheism? Well, Rashi \u2014 one of the most famous Jewish textual commentators \u2014 interprets the breasts in the line \u201cMy beloved to me is a bag of myrhh, lodged between my breasts\u201d as referring to \u201cthe two staves of the Ark.\u201d Which seems like a stretch.\nOf course, no one is trying to interpret RFK Jr.\u2019s alleged poetry to be about God; he is nowhere near as venerated as King Solomon, and some of the other lines are less metaphorical. Plus, hundreds of years haven\u2019t passed to blur the meaning of his words. But even with the centuries of interpretations, Solomon\u2019s meaning is as clear as a freshwater stream. Or a river."

The cabinet on Friday approved a 21.3 trillion yen ($135.95 billion) spending package, significantly larger than the previous year's.\n\"The rise in interest rates reflects persistent concerns about fiscal expansion and weak supply-demand dynamics,\" Mizuho Securities chief bond strategist Noriatsu Tanji wrote in a note.\n\"However, in the 40-year zone, where many participants prioritise absolute interest rate levels, the high interest rate level itself should be positive.\"\nTakaichi said in a speech on Friday that her spending plan would be funded with new bond issuance if tax revenue is not sufficient, and overall JGB issuance is expected to be smaller than last year's.\nThe Ministry of Finance is due to sell about 400 billion yen in 40-year JGBs on Wednesday. Demand at the sale may be weak due to many unknowns about the government's financing plans, said Naoya Hasegawa, chief bond strategist at Okasan Securities.\n\"The yield level is attractive, but it is not the time to hurry up and buy bonds, with the market awaiting government plans for JGB issuance for next year,\" Hasegawa said.\nThe BOJ is \"nearing\" a decision to raise interest rates, board member Kazuyuki Masu was quoted as saying in a Nikkei newspaper report over the weekend.\nThe remark follows those by Governor Kazuo Ueda on Friday signalling the chance of a December rate hike.\nThe two-year JGB yield (JP2YTN=JBTC) rose 1 bp to 0.96%, and the five-year yield (JP5YTN=JBTC) rose 1.5 bp to 1.325%, both the highest since June 2008."
