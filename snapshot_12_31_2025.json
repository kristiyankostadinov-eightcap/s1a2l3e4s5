                "body": "What's driving the rollercoaster in gold and silver prices?\nSilver prices suffered their largest one-day drop in almost five years.\nSilver prices on Monday suffered their largest single-day drop in almost five years, before rebounding nearly 8% in midday trading on Tuesday. Some other precious metals, including gold, rode a similar rollercoaster.\nThe turbulent stretch comes near the end of a banner year for gold and silver, which rose far faster than even the robust stock market. Gold has climbed 66% in 2025, while silver has soared a staggering 160%. The S&P 500, by comparison, has jumped 17% over that span.\nBumpiness in recent days owes in part to the meteoric rise over prior months, some analysts told ABC News, saying investors likely cashed in on those gains by selling off their holdings.\nThe downturn in prices at the outset of this week followed an adjustment by exchange operator CME Group, which increased the amount futures traders must pony up in order to participate in the topsy-turvy markets for precious metals.\nThe uptick in the amount of such payments -- known as margins -- likely deterred some investors and pushed prices lower, analysts added. Prices boomeranged higher on Tuesday, suggesting some investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity.\n\u201cThese were some of the worst one-day losses in the history of trading in both gold and silver going back 50 years,\u201d Jim Wyckoff, senior market analyst at Kitco Metals, told ABC News.\n\u201cExtreme price volatility in commodity markets is a signal of the final stages of a mature bull market run,\u201d Wyckoff added.\nOver the course of the year, heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty boosted demand for gold and silver, which typically display a degree of independence from movements in stock prices. Volatility in bond markets and a devaluation of the U.S. dollar, meanwhile, unsettled alternative assets typically viewed as safe-haven investments.\nThe flight to gold in moments of market turbulence draws on decades of evidence, according to an analysis co-authored in 2025 by Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke's Fuqua School of Business who studies commodity prices. The price of gold moved higher during eight of the last 11 major stock market selloffs stretching back to the late 1980s, researchers found.\n\u201cGold is a safe-haven asset because people believe it\u2019s a safe-haven asset,\u201d Paolo Pasquariello, professor of finance at the University of Michigan, told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\nHowever, gold and silver prices carry volatility of their own, especially when buyers enter the market at a high point, risking losses instead of providing a security blanket, analysts said.\nThe rollercoaster this week could foretell volatility for gold and silver prices in 2026, Pasquariello said, pointing especially to a murky path forward for interest rates.\nThe Fed cut interest rates three consecutive times over the latter part of this year. Its benchmark rate now stands between 3.5% and 3.75%. That figure marks a significant drop from a recent peak attained in 2023, but borrowing costs remain well above a 0% rate established at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPolicymakers at the central bank appear divided over where interest rates should go next. Three of the 12 voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC -- a policymaking body at the Fed -- dissented from the most recent quarter-point rate cut, the highest number of dissenters since 2019.\nPresident Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for lower interest rates, is set to appoint a Fed chair next year. The leadership perch offers a large public platform, but it carries a single vote, like any other member of the FOMC.\nLower interest rates establish financial conditions favorable for gold and silver, since meager interest rates reduce the comparative benefit of interest-bearing investments such as savings accounts. A rate reduction also slashes the cost of borrowing for traders who speculate in p"

(Angel Garcia/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nGold and silver are having their best year since the Bee Gees were topping music charts in the late 1970s.\nSuggested Reading\nInvestors are snapping up the precious metals as uncertainty grips global markets, ranging from President Donald Trump's tariffs to his blistering attacks on the Federal Reserve. Now gold and silver are on track to post their best annual performances since 1979, when high inflation and crises in the Middle East similarly unnerved investors seeking safe havens to park their cash.\nRelated Content\nPart of the demand for gold has been powered by central banks in China and Brazil, according to senior analyst Krishan Gopaul of the World Gold Council.\nGold is treated as a safe investment to hedge against risks to dominant currencies like the U.S. dollar. Its value tends to increase when the U.S. dollar weakens. That's been the case in 2025, with the dollar shedding about 10% of its value while the price of gold futures soared 64% so far this year. Gold prices, though, fell sharply on Monday after exchange operator CME raised margin requirements to ensure traders hand over more cash to support their bets.\nAs of Tuesday, gold futures were trading at $4,400 per ounce, still near record highs.\nSilver recorded a banner year as well, experiencing a 136% boost in value since January. Silver was trading at roughly $76 per ounce as of Tuesday. These days, one ounce of silver is worth more than a barrel of crude oil, per The Wall Street Journal. Investors and money managers view it as a cheaper alternative to gold and expensive stocks, rendering it a more attractive metal.\nStill, silver prices dropped 5% on Monday, its worst daily trading session in four years. It prompted concern from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, since silver serves as a critical element in industry and manufacturing.\nThe Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates next year, which has served to further spike prices for gold and silver as well."

                "body": "Argentina, in a surprise development, overtook Colombia to become South America\u2019s fourth-largest oil producer. The country is undergoing a once-in-a-generation unconventional hydrocarbon boom, which began with Buenos Aires nationalizing integrated energy major YPF in 2012. Since then, Argentina\u2019s oil and natural gas output has kept soaring higher, regularly hitting new monthly highs as volumes of shale oil and gas production grow. It is Argentina\u2019s national oil company, YPF, which is at the forefront of the boom with it responsible for this strong production growth.\nFor November 2025, Argentina\u2019s crude oil production, despite falling from the October 2025 record of 849,646 barrels per day to 844,386 barrels per day, was still an impressive 12.5% higher than a year earlier. This was the first month out of the last six where output did not rise to a new record high. Rapidly growing shale oil production in the Vaca Muerta shale, Spanish for Dead Cow, is driving Argentina\u2019s stunning production growth. For November 2025, shale oil output hit a new monthly record of 578,461 barrels per day, a 30.68% year over year increase, which saw it responsible for 68.51% Argentina\u2019s total production.\nNatural gas production, however, continues to decline. Output dropped 7% year over year to 4.2 billion cubic feet per day, the lowest level since December 2023. This represents a sharp drop from the record 5.7 billion cubic feet per day pumped for July 2025. It is rising shale gas output from the Vaca Muerta which is responsible for the solid growth of Argentina\u2019s natural gas production over the last five years. For November 2025, shale gas production fell 1% year over year to 2.7 billion cubic feet daily, which despite being significantly less than the record 3.8 billion cubic feet per day reported for July 2025, still comprised 65% of Argentina\u2019s total gas production.\nSince July 2025, a combination of well maintenance, reduced drilling activity due to weaker spot prices, and a lack of infrastructure, notably storage and pipeline facilities, which is impacting takeaway capacity, are weighing on output. Indeed, the lack of pipeline and other transportation infrastructure has long been viewed as a key constraint with the potential to impact production in the Vaca Muerta. Although the increasingly prolific shale formation and Argentina\u2019s national oil company YPF will be responsible for further production growth.\nThe 8.6-million-acre Vaca Muerta is a massive shale formation, roughly the size of Switzerland, located in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin in northern Patagonia. It is among the world\u2019s largest unconventional hydrocarbon resources and is frequently compared to the prolific Eagle Ford and Permian shales. The Vaca Muerta is estimated to contain 16 billion barrels of light tight oil and 308 trillion cubic feet of tight gas, making it the world\u2019s fourth-largest unconventional oil and second-largest unconventional gas reserve. According to analysts, characteristics such as superior shale thickness, greater quantities of biological material, higher reservoir pressures, and increased well productivity make the Vaca Muerta superior to major U.S. shale plays.\nAfter a decade of development, the Vaca Muerta is responsible for 69% of Argentina\u2019s oil production and 65% of the country's natural gas output. With less than a tenth of the formation under development, there is tremendous production growth ahead. By the end of the decade, Argentina\u2019s crude oil output is expected to hit at least 1 million barrels per day, with some analysts forecasting 1.5 million barrels per day by 2030. This is a massive increase over the 787,395 barrels per day lifted for the first 11 months of 2025. Natural gas output is expected to surpass 6 billion cubic feet per day by 2030, driven by the Vaca Muerta\u2019s rising shale gas production.\nIt is national oil company YPF and its unconventional hydrocarbon acreage in the Vaca Muerta that will be responsible for most of the expansion of Argentina\u2019"

                "body": "Over the past four trading sessions, the EUR/USD pair has begun to show an emerging bearish bias, posting a short-term decline of just over 0.3%. For now, selling pressure has remained firm as the U.S. dollar has started to see a rebound in confidence ahead of the upcoming release of the Federal Reserve minutes, which will provide insight into the central bank\u2019s outlook for the year ahead. If this event manages to restore strength to the dollar, the bearish pressure currently observed in EUR/USD could become more pronounced in the coming trading sessions.\nThe Fed Minutes Are Approaching\nToday, December 30, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to release the minutes from its latest policy meeting, offering greater clarity on the path the central bank intends to follow heading into 2026. At this stage, the minutes are expected to shed light on the internal vote that led to the most recent rate cut, as well as provide signals on whether the Fed remains aligned with future rate reductions or is instead leaning toward a more neutral stance, depending on inflation trends and concerns surrounding a potential slowdown in employment.\nAt present, the CME Group probability outlook for next year\u2019s Fed decisions has begun to adjust as the release of the minutes approaches. Markets currently assign probabilities of 83.9% and 49.3% for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged at the January 28 and March 18, 2026 meetings, respectively. This pricing suggests that investors expect the Fed to adopt a more neutral policy stance during the early months of 2026, moving away from an approach centered on aggressive rate cuts.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nExpectations of a more neutral rate environment have started to generate a modest rebound in U.S. dollar demand, following several weeks of declines that had allowed other currencies, including the euro, to gain ground. This shift is partly explained by a rebound in U.S. Treasury yields, as expectations of stable rates have helped halt the prolonged decline in yields. At present, yields have stabilized around the 4.1% level and have begun to show a slightly positive slope along the yield curve. This development has restored short-term appeal to U.S. Treasuries and could support foreign capital inflows, reinforcing dollar demand and acting as a confidence catalyst for the U.S. currency in the coming sessions.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nAgainst this backdrop, the period leading up to the release of the Fed minutes appears to have contributed to a partial recovery in the U.S. dollar, supported by the stabilization in Treasury yields. Should the minutes confirm that the central bank is inclined to maintain a neutral rate stance heading into 2026, this could further strengthen short-term confidence in the dollar and sustain more pronounced selling pressure in EUR/USD. Conversely, if the document suggests that the Fed continues to consider more aggressive rate cuts for 2026, the structural weakness that has characterized the dollar in recent weeks could re-emerge.\nEUR/USD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- The broad sideways range remains in place: Since mid-June, EUR/USD has traded within a wide consolidation range, capped at 1.18231 and supported near 1.15104. Although bullish momentum recently pushed price back toward the upper boundary of the range, it was not sufficient to trigger a sustained breakout. As a result, this structure remains the most relevant technical reference on the chart. As long as the pair fails to regain solid buying momentum, it is likely to remain in an environment of indecision, extending the life of the broader range in the sessions ahead.\n- RSI: While the RSI remains above the neutral 50 level, it has started to post consistent declines and a downward slope, suggesting that average buying momentum over the past 14 sessions is weakening. If this dynamic persists, a phase of price indecision could take hold in EUR/USD over the coming trading sessions.\n- MACD: The MACD is"

The US Dollar (USD) edges higher against the Euro (EUR) after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's (Fed) December meeting. The US Initial Jobless Claims report will be released later in the day. Trading volumes are expected to remain thin ahead of the New Year holidays.\nAccording to minutes from the Fed at its December 9-10 meeting, the US central bank decided to cut the interest rate by 25 basis points (bps), bringing the federal funds rate to a target range of 3.50%\u20133.75%. Those in favor cited increased downside risks to employment and easing inflation pressures. Governor Stephen Miran voted against the action in favor of a jumbo rate cut, while Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Kansas City\u2019s Jeff Schmid dissented in favor of leaving rates unchanged.\nMost Fed officials saw further interest-rate reductions as appropriate so long as inflation declines over time, though they remained divided over when and how far to cut. Following the FOMC minutes\u2019 release, the probability of a January cut based on federal funds futures contracts declined slightly to about 15%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\u201dWe don't have any direction in Fed policy, and so you're seeing that reflected in the dollar and the currency rates, you're seeing it reflected in the interest rates as well in the Treasury rates, so the market doesn't have a lot to work with right here,\" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FX Street in New York.\nOn the other hand, signals that the European Central Bank (ECB) rate cut cycle is ending might help limit the shared currency\u2019s losses. The ECB held interest rates steady earlier this month and signaled they would likely remain so for some time. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that the central bank cannot provide forward guidance on future rate moves due to high uncertainty, emphasizing a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach. The money market has priced in for a 25 bps interest rate cut by the ECB in February 2026, currently remains below 10%.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attracti"

                "body": "GBP/USD trades flat as Fed Minutes loom, BoE signals cautious easing\n- The Pound Sterling trades without a clear direction against the US Dollar after its recent three-month high.\n- Investors await the Minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy meeting for further guidance.\n- The Bank of England\u2019s rate outlook continues to support the British currency in the medium term.\nGBP/USD trades around 1.3460 on Tuesday at the time of writing, down 0.30% on the day. The pair consolidates after failing to sustain the bullish momentum seen last week, which had lifted it to a more than three-month high near 1.3535. This pause reflects lingering hesitation in the US Dollar (USD), as market participants remain cautious ahead of the release of the Minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\nThe US Dollar trades without a clear trend, with the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, holding steady around 98.10. Markets are looking for more detailed insight into internal discussions at the Federal Reserve (Fed) regarding the monetary policy outlook. At its latest meeting, the Fed delivered its third consecutive rate cut of the year, lowering the Federal Funds target range to 3.50%-3.75%. Updated economic projections, including the dot plot, now point to a policy rate near 3.4% by 2026, suggesting only one additional rate cut next year.\nThis projected path appears more restrictive than what markets are currently pricing in. According to the CME FedWatch tool, investors remain highly confident that the Fed will deliver at least two further rate cuts, amounting to a cumulative easing of around 50 basis points by the end of 2026. This divergence between market expectations and official guidance continues to generate contained but persistent uncertainty around the US Dollar.\nOn the UK side, the Pound Sterling (GBP) continues to benefit from a relatively supportive backdrop. The currency has remained broadly resilient against its major peers in recent weeks, underpinned by expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will proceed cautiously with monetary easing in 2026. At its latest meeting, the BoE lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, while stressing that further easing would follow a gradual path.\nThis cautious stance reflects still-elevated inflation in the United Kingdom (UK). Although headline inflation slowed to 3.2% in November from a peak of 3.8% in September, it remains well above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey recently noted that the scope for further rate cuts could be limited as policy approaches its neutral level, making future decisions highly dependent on incoming economic data.\nLooking ahead to 2026, expectations for the BoE will largely hinge on developments in the UK labor market and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. Labor demand remained subdued in 2025, as employers curtailed hiring to offset higher social security contributions, a factor that could continue to weigh on economic momentum.\nIn the United States (US), attention is also turning to political developments. US President Donald Trump said he would announce Jerome Powell\u2019s successor as Chair of the Federal Reserve in January. This decision could influence monetary policy expectations, as the incoming Fed Chair is widely seen as potentially favoring a more accommodative stance, in line with the White House\u2019s preference for lower interest rates even if financial markets remain strong.\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Itai Smidt | Dec 30, 2025 02:53PM ET\nGBP/USD trades around 1.3510 after a two-day vertical move that pushed the pair through 1.3450 and locked it into a tight 1.3470\u20131.3518 band just under resistance. Price is holding clearly above the 1.3500 handle, signalling that buyers absorbed the initial spike after the Bank of England\u2019s 25 bps cut to 3.75% rather than taking profits aggressively. The current behaviour is classic post-break consolidation: candles compress near the top of the recent range, volatility is suppressed by year-end liquidity, but the pair refuses to give back the breakout zone around 1.3450\u20131.3500, keeping the bias pointed higher as long as 1.3470 continues to attract dip-buyers.\nThe core driver for GBP/USD is that the BoE is easing more reluctantly than the Fed. The December cut pulled Bank Rate down from 4.00% to 3.75%, but the messaging kept the door open only to a gradual, data-dependent path. With UK CPI still at 3.2% year-on-year after a recent 3.8% peak, the Monetary Policy Committee cannot justify an aggressive easing cycle, and money markets reflect that reality with just one full cut priced for the first half of 2026 and only about a fifty-fifty probability of a second by year-end. That profile is effectively a \u201chawkish cut\u201d: nominal rates are drifting lower, but real yields are still high, and the forward curve refuses to price a rapid slide toward 3.0%. For GBP, that means the carry story stays alive and dips in GBP/USD toward the mid-1.34s are met with structural demand rather than forced liquidation.\nThe inflation and growth mix in the UK explains why GBP has a floor even after the cut. Headline inflation at 3.2% is above the 2% target, services inflation remains sticky, and wage growth has only cooled gradually. At the same time, activity data are soft enough to justify a mild easing path but not outright panic. That combination forces the BoE into a narrow corridor: it must ease to avoid over-tightening the real economy, but every 25 bps step becomes a close call. As long as Bank Rate trades in the 3.50%\u20133.75% zone with inflation above target, the real policy rate remains positive and attractive versus the US once the Fed\u2019s cuts are fully priced. The market reads that as a reason to hold GBP on weakness rather than fade every rally, which is why GBP/USD is building a base above 1.3400 instead of slipping back into the low-1.30s.\nOn the US side, the backdrop is structurally softer for USD than for GBP. The Fed has already cut by 25 bps, bringing the target range to roughly 3.50%\u20133.75%, with Core PCE trending towards the 2.8% area. Futures price an overwhelming probability that rates remain unchanged at the January meeting and only a modest chance of an additional 25 bps cut in the very near term, but the broader curve embeds a full easing path across 2026. That combination caps the dollar: the DXY index is stuck around 98.0, clinging to Fibonacci support near 97.98 and failing repeatedly to turn breaks above 98.25\u201398.60 into sustained impulsive rallies. For GBP/USD, this means the directional risk now depends less on an aggressive dollar squeeze and more on whether the Fed confirms that real rates will keep grinding down while the BoE stays slower and more cautious.\nOn the daily chart, GBP/USD presents a clean bullish structure rather than a blow-off top. Price holds well above the rising 100-day EMA near 1.3335 and trades north of the 20-day moving average clustered around the low-1.34s, which means the medium-term uptrend is intact and pullbacks toward 1.3410\u20131.3450 are still technically healthy. The daily RSI sits just below the overbought threshold around 70, confirming strong momentum but also flagging that chasing late above 1.3550 without a retest carries short-term risk. The upper Bollinger Band near 1.3550 is the first serious daily barrier; the mid-band around 1.3410 is the first line of defence for bulls. A daily close back below 1.3410 would be the first sign that the trend is losing "

                "body": "AUD/USD struggled with the 0.6700 mark for a second consecutive day, as markets remain cautious in the final trading week of 2025. The focus is on diverging central bank rate paths as we approach 2026.\nThe Australian Dollar faces end-of-year market volume challenges. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is moving towards a potential rate hike cycle, contrasting with the US Federal Reserve\u2019s dovish stance, suggesting further rate cuts in 2026.\nRBA\u2019s Rate Considerations\nThe RBA is considering rate hikes, with futures markets assigning a 34% probability for a February rate increase. The Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes confirm a potential for further rate cuts, relying on ongoing inflation easing.\nInterest rates set by the RBA are a major factor affecting the Australian Dollar. Australia\u2019s status as a resource-rich nation, iron ore prices, the Chinese economy, inflation rates, growth, and Trade Balance also influence the AUD\u2019s value.\nChina\u2019s economic health impacts the AUD, as it is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner. Chinese demand for goods can affect AUD value, with positive Chinese growth generally boosting it.\nIron Ore, a major export, affects the AUD\u2019s value. Price increases in Iron Ore typically bolster AUD demand, as do positive Trade Balances which strengthen the currency relative to cheaper imports.\nMarket Participation and Central Bank Policies\nWith holiday trading volumes fading, we see the diverging paths of the RBA and the Fed as the primary catalyst for the coming weeks. The AUD/USD\u2019s failure to hold 0.6700 seems temporary, presenting an opportunity as market participation returns in the new year. We anticipate a shift in momentum as these central bank policies become clearer.\nThe case for a stronger Aussie dollar is building on solid ground. Australia\u2019s latest Q3 2025 CPI data showed inflation persisting at 3.8%, well above the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target band. This stubborn inflation is why futures markets are increasingly pricing in a potential rate hike at the February 3rd meeting.\nConversely, the US dollar is facing headwinds from a Federal Reserve leaning towards easing policy. The most recent Core PCE data for November 2025 showed inflation cooling to 2.8%, bringing it closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% goal. This reinforces the view that the Fed has room to cut rates in 2026, creating a stark policy contrast with Australia.\nSupporting the Australian dollar further are key external factors. Iron ore prices have shown remarkable strength, recently trading above $135 per tonne, boosting our national export revenue. Furthermore, China\u2019s official manufacturing PMI for December 2025 unexpectedly rose to 50.5, signaling a return to expansion and improving the outlook for Australian trade.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests buying call options on the AUD/USD pair. Given the current low holiday volatility, purchasing calls with expirations beyond the February RBA meeting could be an effective way to position for a potential upward break. A bull call spread could also be used to lower the initial cost while still capturing upside potential.\nAnother strategy to consider is selling out-of-the-money put options. The higher interest rate outlook in Australia relative to the US makes collecting premium on these positions attractive. This strategy profits if AUD/USD trades sideways or moves higher, capitalizing on the fundamental supports that should limit significant downside.\nWe have seen how powerful central bank divergence can be, remembering the dollar\u2019s massive rally in 2022 when the Fed hiked aggressively while others lagged. The current setup heading into 2026 appears to be an inverse of that scenario. This suggests a structural tailwind for the Australian dollar against its US counterpart."

The pair benefits from moderate support to the Australian Dollar (AUD), driven by expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could maintain a more restrictive bias for longer than other major central banks.\nHawkish expectations surrounding the Australian central bank are underpinned by the still-uncertain inflation outlook. In its latest communication, the Reserve Bank of Australia reiterated that it stands ready to tighten monetary policy further if disinflation were to lose momentum. Against this backdrop, investors will closely monitor upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, due in January, ahead of the February monetary policy meeting.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar (USD) is trading without a clear direction as investors await the Federal Reserve (Fed) Minutes. At the December meeting, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 3.50%-3.75%, while signaling that only one additional rate cut could take place in 2026, after three reductions already delivered in 2025.\nBeyond the FOMC Minutes, market attention is also starting to shift toward political factors. US President Donald Trump said he would announce the successor to Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve in January, a development that could influence monetary policy expectations and, in turn, the trajectory of the US Dollar in the months ahead.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "AUD/USD trades close to the 0.6700 level on Tuesday, posting modest gains as investors remain cautious ahead of the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes from December\u2019s policy meeting. With limited conviction across markets, the pair is drawing mild support from the Australian Dollar, underpinned by expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may keep monetary policy tighter for longer compared with other major central banks.\nThe Australian Dollar continues to benefit from the RBA\u2019s relatively hawkish tone. Policymakers have repeatedly emphasized that inflation risks remain uneven and that further tightening cannot be ruled out if disinflation stalls. While inflation has moderated from its peaks, it remains uncomfortably sticky in certain sectors, reinforcing the central bank\u2019s cautious stance. Investors are now looking ahead to Australia\u2019s upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) release in January, which will be a critical input ahead of the RBA\u2019s February policy decision. A stronger-than-expected inflation print could further strengthen expectations that rates will remain elevated well into 2025.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar is trading sideways as markets wait for fresh guidance from the Fed. At its December meeting, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. However, policymakers struck a notably cautious tone, signaling that only one additional rate cut may be delivered in 2026, following three cuts already implemented in 2025. This guidance has helped prevent a deeper USD sell-off, even as near-term direction remains unclear.\nBeyond monetary policy, political developments are also entering the spotlight. US President Donald Trump recently stated that he plans to announce the successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell in January. This announcement could carry significant implications for the future direction of US monetary policy, particularly if the nominee is perceived as more dovish or more politically aligned. As a result, investors are increasingly wary of positioning aggressively in the Dollar ahead of further clarity.\nOverall, AUD/USD remains range-bound, balancing RBA policy support against lingering uncertainty surrounding US monetary and political developments.\nTrade Idea:\nBuy AUD/USD on dips toward 0.6660, targeting 0.6760, with a stop below 0.6620. RBA\u2019s hawkish bias may keep the Aussie supported near-term."

The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability.

The pair trades around 155.80, down 0.15%, reflecting the Yen\u2019s strengthening following the BoJ\u2019s December policy meeting summary.\nBoJ policymakers suggest maintaining a tightening strategy, with some advocating further rate increases. The policy rate has been raised by 25 basis points to 0.75%, the highest in three decades, as inflation seems to approach the 2% target.\nJapan\u2019s Financial Strategy\nJapan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama has indicated flexibility regarding JPY movements, implying possible intervention. Meanwhile, the US Dollar (USD) lacks direction as markets await the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes after a recent rate cut.\nPresident Donald Trump plans to announce the successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which could impact USD expectations. With year-end trading volumes decreasing, anticipation of BoJ rate hikes in 2026 supports the JPY, affecting the USD/JPY pair.\nThe table illustrates percentage changes among major currencies, with the USD experiencing varied adjustments. Notably, the USD shows minor declines against several currencies, providing insight into broader market dynamics.\nWith the Bank of Japan signaling more rate hikes for 2026, we should anticipate continued strength in the Japanese Yen. The policy divergence is clear, as the Federal Reserve has already delivered three rate cuts in 2025. This fundamental backdrop supports a bearish outlook for the USD/JPY pair.\nImpact of Central Bank Decisions\nThe move by the Bank of Japan to a 0.75% policy rate is significant, marking a decisive break from the negative interest rate policy that defined its approach for the better part of a decade. With Japan\u2019s core inflation data from November 2025 holding at 2.3%, the BoJ has a clear reason to continue its tightening path. This contrasts sharply with the situation back in 2022-2023 when a weak yen was a primary concern.\nOn the other side of the trade, the Fed\u2019s pivot to an easing cycle has been the major theme this year. The current 3.50%-3.75% federal funds rate is substantially lower than the peak of 5.25%-5.50% we saw in 2023. Given that the latest US Core PCE inflation figure has cooled to 2.5%, the market is right to expect a continued dovish stance.\nFor the coming weeks, we see value in positioning for a lower USD/JPY, possibly targeting a move towards the 152.00 level. Buying put options on USD/JPY could be a prudent strategy, as it offers a defined-risk way to capitalize on further yen appreciation. Holiday-thinned liquidity could present an opportunity to enter these positions before trading volumes return to normal in January.\nWe must, however, remain alert to event risk, starting with the FOMC minutes due later today. Any unexpectedly hawkish language could cause a short-term spike in the US Dollar. The upcoming announcement of Jerome Powell\u2019s successor in January is another major wildcard that could reshape expectations for US monetary policy in 2026."

The Loonie pair consolidates at the start of the last trading day of 2025 amid thin trading volume.\nAs of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, ticks higher to near 98.26, the highest level seen in a week.\nThe US Dollar (USD) gained sharply on Tuesday, even as Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes of the December policy meeting showed that most officials supported the need for further interest rate cuts after the December cut if inflation starts cooling down.\n\u201cMost participants judged further rate cuts would likely be appropriate if inflation declined over time as expected,\u201d FOMC minutes showed.\nThe latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed that the headline inflation decelerated to 2.7% year-on-year (YoY) in November from 3% in September.\nMeanwhile, the Canadian Dollar (CAD) trades calmly on expectations that the Bank of Canada (BoC) won\u2019t cut interest rates in the near term. The expectations of the BoC leaving rates at their current levels are backed by inflation remaining steady around the 2% target in the last few months.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.\nAuthor\nSagar Dua\nFXStreet\nSagar Dua is associated with the financial markets from his college days.

                "body": "USD/CAD has rebounded from 1.3640 but is unable to surpass 1.3700. A modest increase in Oil prices supports the Loonie, and traders are focused on the upcoming Fed meeting minutes.\nLast week, the US Dollar lifted off from five-month lows near 1.3640 against the Canadian Dollar, but any rise remains capped below 1.3700. Meanwhile, the Fed\u2019s December rate cut and a potential future cut continue to affect market expectations.\nFed Meeting Minutes and Market Expectations\nThe Fed\u2019s meeting minutes will likely display diverse opinions among members, feeding into forecasts of extensive rate cuts expected by 2026. Additionally, President Trump is set to nominate a new Fed Chairman supporting lower rate cuts.\nIn 2025, the US Dollar has weakened by 20% against the Canadian Dollar due to a softening economic outlook and differing monetary policies between the Fed and the Bank of Canada (BoC). Canada\u2019s main export, Oil, sees a moderate price uptick due to geopolitical tensions, easing concerns of overproduction.\nKey factors affecting the Canadian Dollar include BoC interest rates, Oil prices, economic health, inflation, and trade balance. Higher interest rates, rising Oil prices, and strong economic data can bolster the CAD, while the US economy\u2019s health and market sentiment also play roles.\nGiven the USD/CAD is struggling to stay above 1.3640 and failing at 1.3700, we see this as a temporary pause in a larger downward trend for the pair. The immediate focus is on the Fed\u2019s meeting minutes due out later today, which could confirm the market\u2019s dovish expectations. Any hawkish surprise seems unlikely given recent data.\nImpact of US Economic Data on Future Rate Cuts\nWe believe these minutes will show significant internal debate, reinforcing the view that more rate cuts are coming in 2026. This view is supported by the latest preliminary Q4 GDP figures for the US, which came in at a weaker-than-expected 1.2% annualized growth. This softening economic picture gives the Fed plenty of reason to continue easing policy.\nThe political pressure from President Trump to appoint a new Fed Chair who favors aggressive rate cuts adds a major long-term weight on the US Dollar. This uncertainty makes it difficult to build a case for any sustained dollar strength heading into the new year. Traders should view any rallies toward 1.3700 as opportunities to position for further downside.\nOn the other side of the pair, the Canadian dollar is looking relatively strong. November\u2019s inflation data in Canada came in at 2.9%, which is keeping the Bank of Canada from even considering rate cuts for now. This growing policy divergence between a dovish Fed and a steady BoC is a primary driver of USD/CAD weakness.\nSupport for the loonie is also coming from oil prices, with WTI crude holding firm above $85 a barrel. Ongoing sanctions related to Russia and Iran are limiting global supply forecasts for 2026, putting a solid floor under crude prices. As Canada\u2019s main export, strong oil is a direct positive for the Canadian economy and its currency.\nConsidering the US dollar has already fallen nearly 20% against the Canadian dollar in 2025, the path of least resistance appears to remain lower. We would advise traders to consider strategies that benefit from this, such as buying put options on the USD/CAD or selling futures on rallies. The next key level to watch on the downside is a break of the recent 1.3640 low."

                "body": "Key Moments\n- The Canadian Dollar is trading within one-tenth of one percent against the US Dollar as the final trading week of 2025 begins.\n- USD/CAD remains firmly bearish below 1.3700, even though technical indicators show deeply oversold conditions.\n- Markets are pricing in at least two Federal Reserve rate cuts through 2026, which caps US Dollar strength and keeps pressure on USD/CAD.\nRange-Bound Loonie Starts Final Week of 2025\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) opened the final trading week of 2025 with little direction against the US Dollar (USD). On Monday, the pair moved in a narrow range as year-end conditions reduced trading activity.\nEven so, the Loonie continues to hold recent gains against the Greenback. Those gains followed a largely one-way move in favor of CAD during the latter part of the fourth quarter.\nMeanwhile, the currency pair shows no clear breakout signals as participation thins into year-end. As a result, intraday moves remain limited, but the broader bias still favors the Canadian Dollar.\nMonetary Policy Divergence Supports CAD\nInterest rate expectations remain the main driver for the Canadian Dollar. The Bank of Canada (BoC) now has limited room to ease policy after an aggressive cutting cycle in 2024 and 2025.\nDuring that period, the BoC delivered nine rate cuts, including two consecutive double cuts in October and November 2024. As a result, Canadian rates are already near their lower bound.\nBy contrast, markets expect the Federal Reserve to move toward faster easing over the next two years. This outlook narrows the rate gap between the two economies and limits upside potential for the US Dollar.\nMarket Drivers: Thin Liquidity and Fed Minutes in Focus\nHoliday conditions continue to weigh on trading volumes, keeping markets sluggish. Consequently, USD/CAD price action remains subdued, with a mild downside bias for the US Dollar.\nUSD/CAD Technical Outlook\nFrom a technical perspective, USD/CAD appears deeply oversold. This setup leaves room for a short-term corrective bounce.\nHowever, broader macro forces continue to weigh on the US Dollar. As a result, any upside move may struggle to gain traction.\nThe pair remains below both the 50-day and 200-day EMAs. These averages have formed a bearish cross, which confirms the dominant downtrend.\nOn the upside, the 1.3800\u20131.3900 zone marks the likely ceiling for any rebound. Over the longer term, the technical bias still favors a move toward the 1.3500 area.\nCanadian Dollar: Commonly Watched Drivers\nSeveral factors continue to shape the Canadian Dollar\u2019s performance. These drivers range from domestic policy decisions to global risk trends.\nWhat Key Factors Drive the Canadian Dollar?\nThe main influences on the Canadian Dollar include:\n- Interest rates set by the Bank of Canada\n- Oil prices, Canada\u2019s largest export\n- Economic growth and inflation trends\n- The trade balance between exports and imports\n- Overall market sentiment, including risk-on and risk-off conditions\n- The health of the US economy, Canada\u2019s largest trading partner\nHow Bank of Canada Decisions Affect CAD\nThe Bank of Canada plays a central role in shaping the Canadian Dollar by setting benchmark interest rates. These rates influence borrowing costs across the economy.\nThe BoC aims to keep inflation within a 1%\u20133% range. To achieve this goal, it raises or cuts rates as needed.\nHigher interest rates tend to support the CAD. In addition, quantitative tightening often boosts the currency, while quantitative easing usually weighs on it.\nImpact of Oil Prices on the Canadian Dollar\nOil prices remain a key driver of the Canadian Dollar. Since energy exports dominate Canada\u2019s trade profile, price changes often affect CAD quickly.\nRising Oil prices usually lift demand for the Canadian Dollar. Falling prices, on the other hand, tend to weaken it. Higher Oil prices also improve the odds of a positive trade balance.\nInflation and Its Influence on CAD\nIn modern markets, higher inflation can strengthen a currency if "

                "body": "GBP/JPY is experiencing consolidation between 210.00 and 211.50. Hawkish minutes from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and moderate risk-aversion are supporting the Yen. Sterling\u2019s upward movement against the Yen has paused below 211.50, seeking direction as support remains above 210.00. BoJ meeting minutes bolster expectations of monetary tightening, while tensions in the East China Sea reduce risk appetite, lending strength to the Yen.\nChinese military drills in the region, including missile live-fire and blockade rehearsals of Taiwan, have increased tension and impacted Asian markets. The Japanese Yen gains support as a safe haven amidst regional unrest. In technical analysis, indicators show a reduction in the bullish momentum of GBP/JPY, with the pair trading at 210.76, posting slight daily losses.\nSupport and Resistance Levels\nImmediate support levels are at 210.05 and 209.35, with a breach of these levels potentially targeting 208.90. The 211.53 high is a resistance point for bulls, whereas 212.75 and 214.38 are targets based on Fibonacci extensions. The Japanese Yen shows strength, particularly against the Swiss Franc, amidst percentage changes illustrated in a currency heat map.\nWith GBP/JPY struggling to break above the 211.50 resistance, we see the upward momentum fading as we close out 2025. The current consolidation between 210.00 and 211.50 suggests a period of indecision in the market. Traders should be cautious about chasing further gains for the Pound, as the underlying support for the Yen is growing.\nThe firming of the Yen is underpinned by solid fundamental factors. We\u2019ve seen Japan\u2019s national core CPI for November 2025 come in at 2.8%, marking the 20th consecutive month above the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target. This persistent inflation supports the market\u2019s view that the BoJ will continue its path of monetary tightening into 2026, lending strength to the currency.\nAt the same time, the Pound is facing headwinds from a sluggish domestic economy. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the UK economy grew by a mere 0.1% in the third quarter of 2025, raising concerns about the outlook. This economic weakness makes it difficult for Sterling to sustain its rally, especially against a strengthening Yen.\nGeopolitical and Economic Factors\nGeopolitical tensions in the East China Sea are also driving safe-haven flows into the Yen, adding another layer of support. We remember the sharp moves back in 2022-2024 when central bank policies diverged significantly, and any escalation could trigger similar volatility. This risk-averse environment makes holding long GBP/JPY positions increasingly risky.\nGiven this context, derivative traders could consider buying put options with a strike price below the 210.00 support level. This strategy would profit from a potential breakdown toward the trendline support at 209.35. For a more risk-defined approach, a bear put spread could be used to cap both potential profit and loss, capitalizing on a moderate downward move in the coming weeks."

Trading volume totaled roughly $40 billion, reflecting muted participation as December draws to a close.\nBitcoin is now about 1% below its seven-day high of $89,201 and roughly 1% above its seven-day low of $86,855.\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has a circulating supply of 19,969,296 BTC, with a hard cap of 21 million coins. Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization is approximately $1.76 trillion, up 1% from a day earlier.\nBitcoin pushed toward the $90,000 level yesterday for a second straight session before the rally stalled once again. Price action remains confined to a broad range between roughly $85,000 and $95,000, a structure that has defined the market since a sharp October sell-off.\nThat drawdown followed Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high in early October, when prices were up nearly 30% on the year.\nSince then, sentiment has shifted. The bitcoin price is now down about 5% from last December, putting it on track for its first annual loss in three years.\n\u201cI\u2019d continue to expect exaggerated moves on light flow through New Year\u2019s,\u201d Jasper De Maere, desk strategist at Wintermute, said in a note to Bloomberg.. He cautioned traders against relying too heavily on short-term signals until liquidity returns to normal levels.\nThe recent price stagnation contrasts with the broader recovery in traditional risk assets. Bitcoin began the year with a strong rally fueled by optimism around crypto-friendly policies under the second Trump administration.\nThat enthusiasm faded as uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff agenda rattled global markets.\nBitcoin price battling with leveraged traders\nWhile U.S. equities have largely rebounded from those shocks, Bitcoin has struggled to regain momentum. The October downturn was compounded by a wave of liquidations after leveraged positions reached record levels. On Oct. 10, a sharp sell-off flushed out long exposure and reset market positioning.\nDemand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has also weakened. According to data by Bloomberg, ETF outflows have reached roughly $6 billion in the fourth quarter, adding steady pressure as Bitcoin failed to reclaim the $90,000 threshold.\nHoliday trading conditions have further distorted price action. Earlier this week, the bitcoin price swung sharply around $90,000 during low-liquidity sessions, posting fast gains and losses that lacked follow-through.\nPrices briefly rose about 2.6% during thin trading and held above $86,000 over the week, but again failed to sustain levels above $90,000 during Asian hours.\nQCP Capital said recent moves reflect a market short on participation. In a note, the firm pointed to a steep decline in derivatives activity following last Friday\u2019s record options expiry. Open interest dropped by nearly 50%, signaling that many traders moved to the sidelines.\nThat options expiry also altered short-term market dynamics. According to QCP, dealers who were long gamma ahead of the event are now short gamma on the upside. In such conditions, rising prices can force hedging activity that amplifies short-term moves, particularly when liquidity is thin.\nA similar setup emerged earlier this month when the bitcoin price briefly approached $90,000. Funding rates climbed quickly as traders crowded into bullish positions, creating short-lived upward pressure.\nDeribit\u2019s perpetual funding rate surged above 30% following the latest expiry, up from near-flat levels beforehand. Elevated funding rates often indicate overheated positioning and raise the cost of maintaining long exposure.\nFrom a technical perspective, Bitcoin Magazine analysts said the market continues to reject lower levels within a broa"

The Federal Reserve decided to cut interest rates by 0.25% for the third consecutive time this year.\nOfficials brought rates to between 3.50% and 3.75% and hinted that it will deliver one more cut in the coming year. However, most analysts believe that the bank will deliver more cuts.\nA Polymarket poll with over $1 million in assets predicts that it will cut rates two times, with others expecting three cuts.\nBitcoin price technical analysis as bearish patterns forms\nThe weekly timeframe chart shows that Bitcoin started a bull run at $15,460 on November 22 to a record high of $126,200 in October this year.\nThere are signs that the bull run is ending as it has formed several bearish chart patterns. For example, the token has formed a rising wedge, which is made up of two ascending and converging trendlines.\nThe coin is in the process of forming a bearish pennant pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. The two triangles are now nearing their confluence, meaning that a bearish breakout is about to happen.\nOscillators have also formed a bearish divergence pattern. For example, the Percentage Price Oscillator peaked in April last year and recently moved below the zero line. The Relative Strength Index has moved below the neutral point at 50 and is pointing downwards.\nMost importantly, the coin has moved below the Supertrend indicator, which turned red in November. The last time this occurred was in January 2022, and it declined from $52,000 to $15,460 thereafter.\nTherefore, Bitcoin price will likely have a strong bearish breakout, potentially to the key support level at $74,368, its lowest level in April last year. A move below that level will indicate further downside, potentially to the psychological level at $70,000.\n2026 predictions\nAfter a year of blown calls \u2014 including Chamath Palihapitiya\u2019s now-infamous \u201cBitcoin by October 2025\u201d prediction \u2014 faith in crystal-ball price targets has taken a hit. By the end of 2025, \u201ctarget-price narratives\u201d were less prophecy and more cautionary tale, with analysts retreating to scenario ranges instead of bold guarantees.\nAccording to a Wu Blockchain roundup, predictions now span a chasm wide enough to fit an entire bear market \u2014 from six-figure highs powered by ETF inflows and institutional demand to stomach-churning drawdowns if macro conditions tighten or technicals break.\n- The bulls see Bitcoin climbing anywhere from $150,000 to $250,000, driven by spot ETFs, Wall Street adoption, and looser monetary policy.\n- The bears warn of a potential drop to $70,000 or even $60,000.\nThe one point of agreement? Bitcoin\u2019s fate in 2026 will hinge less on halving folklore and more on liquidity, regulation, and whether institutions continue to buy when the chart stops cooperating."

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nM DeFi introduces a model that turns BTC and ETH from passive holdings into income-generating assets through managed computing-power and DeFi yield participation.\n- M DeFi i moves investor focus from price speculation to sustainable cash-flow generation using BTC and ETH.\n- The platform enables participation in computing-power contracts and DeFi yields without equipment, technical skills, or active trading.\n- It also emphasizes compliance, asset security, and transparent daily settlement to support long-term value creation.\nAs the cryptocurrency market gradually shifts from \u201chigh-volatility speculation\u201d to \u201clong-term value management,\u201d more and more BTC and ETH holders are beginning to realize a core issue: Simply holding assets does not equate to truly creating value.\nAmid escalating market volatility, many investors are rethinking how to generate sustainable cash flow through BTC and ETH, rather than relying on frequent trading and high-risk speculation.\nFrom \u201cwaiting for prices to rise\u201d to \u201ccash flow thinking\u201d\nFor a long time, BTC has been regarded as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d while ETH exists as an important infrastructure for the decentralized ecosystem. However, from an investment perspective, many holders are still accustomed to: \u201cWait until the price goes up before selling.\u201d\nThis single logic.\nM DeFi\u2019s model is changing this thinking: BTC and ETH are no longer just static assets; they can participate in the computing power ecosystem and DeFi yield models, bringing continuous cash flow to holders.\nIn this model, users have the opportunity to participate in profit sharing without selling their assets, gradually making BTC and ETH digital assets capable of generating cash flow.\nWhat is M DeFi? How does it work?\nM DeFi is an innovative digital finance and cloud computing platform headquartered in London, focusing on computing power management and decentralized yield models.\nIts core operating logic includes:\n- The platform integrates high-quality global computing resources and cloud infrastructure.\n- Users can participate in computing power contracts using mainstream crypto assets such as BTC and ETH.\n- The system automatically completes computing power allocation, revenue calculation, and settlement.\n- Revenue is settled and credited daily, forming a relatively continuous cash flow.\nThe entire process does not require specialized mining equipment, nor does it incur complex costs such as electricity and maintenance, allowing users to enter the field of computing power and DeFi yields in a \u201cmanaged participation\u201d manner.\nCompliance and fund security: Prerequisites for stable returns\nM DeFi has long emphasized the compliance of platform operations and the security of user assets, and continues to build upon this foundation.\n- Enterprise-grade security system\n- Multi-layered cold wallet management\n- Partnership with third-party security organizations\n- Transparent revenue and data display\nThis is also an important foundation for the platform to win the trust of users worldwide.\nReal voices from users around the world\nA long-term BTC investor from Germany said: \u201cIn the past, I could only look at price fluctuations; now I value whether an asset can continuously generate cash flow. M DeFi provides me with a more convenient way to participate.\u201d\nAnother ETH user from the United States said: \u201cTransparent settlement and clear contract rules are the main reasons why I have been using it for a long time.\u201d\nHow to convert BTC/ETH into cash flow?\nThe whole process is very simple:\n- Register an M DeFi official account with one click to receive a $17 new user registration bonus.\n- Deposit BTC, ETH, or other mainstream cryptocurrencies\n- Select a suitable hashrate contract and start it.\nPop"

                "body": "US prosecutors oppose Defi Education Fund brief ahead of potential MEV case retrial\nThe US government has filed a letter opposing the introduction of an amicus brief from the digital asset advocacy group DeFi Education Fund as the court considers a possible retrial for two brothers allegedly behind a $25 million exploit of the Ethereum blockchain.\nIn a Tuesday filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, interim US Attorney Jay Clayton submitted a letter to Judge Jessica Clarke requesting that a brief from the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) not be accepted while the court considers a motion to dismiss the case against Anton and James Peraire-Bueno.\n\u201cDetached from the trial record, the brief merely recites legal arguments already rejected by this Court,\u201d said Clayton, referring to the DeFi Education Fund\u2019s amicus brief, adding:\nIn November, Clarke declared a mistrial in the case after jurors failed to agree on whether to convict or acquit the brothers, alleged to have committed the exploit using automated maximal extractable value (MEV) bots. Within a week, the US government requested the court schedule a retrial for the brothers \u201cas soon as practicable in late February or early March 2026.\u201d\nAccording to a proposed draft of the DEF brief filed on Dec. 19, the organization supported the motion to acquit or dismiss the indictment, arguing that the case had \u201cbroader implications\u201d for the industry.\n\u201c[P]rosecutions like this one bring ambiguity and fear to software developers, chilling participation in DeFi and driving participants abroad,\u201d said DEF, adding: \u201cThe DOJ should not get ahead of prospective lawmaking by bringing indictments based on ill-fitting interpretations of existing law, which will stifle growth by sowing confusion about the governing rules.\u201d\nCointelegraph reached out to the DeFi Education Fund for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.\nCrypto industry weighs in on implications of case\nWith the future of the Peraire-Bueno brothers uncertain, many in the crypto industry are still looking to how the case could affect MEV-related activities.\nCrypto advocacy organization Coin Center filed an amicus brief during the criminal trial, arguing against the US government\u2019s theory of the case. Prosecutors also requested that the court not accept the brief.\nThe brothers initially faced charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to receive stolen property. If retried on the same charges and found guilty, they could potentially be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for each count.\nMagazine: When privacy and AML laws conflict: Crypto projects\u2019 impossible choice"

                "body": "In 2025, Solana has really made a name for itself in the financial world. It's not just hanging around with traditional finance; it's also cultivated its own decentralized finance scene. This article looks at how Solana's developments, including groundbreaking ETFs and the adoption of real-world assets, are changing the course of finance. Solana\u2019s influence is growing, and it has implications for cryptocurrency and beyond.\nSolana and Traditional Finance: A New Relationship\nSolana\u2019s relationship with big financial institutions is a significant turning point. The introduction of regulated Solana ETFs has brought in a lot of money, establishing its presence in mainstream finance. The first Solana ETF with staking rights launched in Kazakhstan, allowing investors to own SOL and earn staking rewards. This not only boosts liquidity but provides a regulated way for traditional investors to engage with cryptocurrency.\nIn the U.S., Solana ETFs faced their share of issues but eventually gained momentum. Several issuers released products that combined SOL exposure with staking rewards. This transformation has turned SOL from a niche crypto asset into a recognized financial instrument, showing that blockchain technology is slowly being accepted by traditional finance.\nDeFi's Comeback: The Impact of Crypto and Stablecoins on Salaries\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is making a strong comeback, with Solana leading the way. By 2025, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem hit record levels, exceeding $62.5 million SOL. This surge indicates a rising interest in decentralized applications and services, as users search for alternatives to traditional finance.\nStablecoins have become instrumental in this resurgence, acting as a stable medium for transactions and salaries. As more businesses embrace stablecoin payments, the landscape of payroll is shifting. Companies are now looking into the advantages of paying employees in stablecoins, which can promote financial inclusion and simplify cross-border payments.\nReal World Assets: Connecting Traditional Finance and Blockchain\nSolana's advances go beyond DeFi, with the platform increasingly facilitating the transition of real-world assets (RWAs) onto the blockchain. The creation of an RWA consortium by Figure illustrates this trend, linking traditional lending systems with blockchain tech. This initiative enables users to earn yields from real estate loan pools, bridging the gap between conventional and decentralized finance.\nThe incorporation of RWAs into Solana\u2019s ecosystem not only boosts liquidity but offers a way for traditional investors to engage with blockchain technology. As more assets become tokenized, the potential for innovative financial products and services grows, reshaping the future of finance.\nTechnological Advancements: Going Global with Web3 Banking\nTechnological improvements have been crucial in Solana's growth. The launch of the Firedancer validator client and the Alpenglow consensus upgrade have greatly enhanced the network's reliability and scalability. These upgrades allow Solana to handle large transaction volumes without sacrificing performance, positioning it as a potential solution for global financial operations.\nAs Solana continues to innovate, it is ready to support the rising demand for Web3 banking solutions. Startups and businesses can use Solana\u2019s infrastructure to broaden their global reach, tapping into new markets and customer bases.\nMarket Dynamics: Blockchain vs SWIFT for Cross-Border Payroll\nSolana's rise also poses challenges for traditional banking methods, especially in cross-border payroll. As companies increasingly turn to blockchain for payments, the SWIFT system faces competition. Solana\u2019s ability to enable fast and affordable transactions makes it a viable option for businesses looking to optimize their payroll processes.\nVisa\u2019s recent move to let U.S. banks settle obligations using USDC on Solana further highlights the platfo"

Energy stocks saw moderate gains, but these were outweighed by declines in healthcare and financial services.\nBoeing\u2019s shares increased by 1.75% following a government contract win for F-15 jets, while UnitedHealth Group rose 0.75%. Conversely, Goldman Sachs and Amgen saw declines, with Goldman Sachs dropping 1.2% and Amgen 1%.\nFederal Reserve Meeting Insights\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s recent Meeting Minutes suggested potential for further rate cuts, although actual changes depend on inflation data. This reflects a general openness to exploring lower interest rates among FOMC members.\nUS President Donald Trump criticised outgoing Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing rates faster. He appointed Powell during his first term and remains vocal about his frustrations.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) consists of 30 major US stocks and is price-weighted. It is influenced by company earnings, global economic data, and interest rates, with Dow Theory used for trend analysis. Trading methods include ETFs, futures, and options contracts, offering various approaches to engaging with the index.\nWe are seeing very thin holiday trading, which can lead to choppy and unpredictable price action in the coming weeks. Trading volume on the major indices is nearly 40% below the 90-day average, meaning any large orders can disproportionately move the market. This low liquidity environment suggests using caution on new positions until participation returns in January.\nMarket Conditions and Future Outlook\nThe Fed is signaling rate cuts for 2026, but their hands are tied until inflation cools further. The latest Core PCE data for November 2025 came in at 2.8%, still well above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. This means any dovish sentiment is dependent on future data, creating uncertainty that could cap any significant rally for now.\nGiven this indecision, we\u2019ve seen the VIX index creep up to 15.5, showing a subtle rise in the demand for portfolio insurance. The CBOE put/call ratio has also edged higher, indicating traders are buying more puts to protect against a potential dip into the new year. This defensive positioning in the options market is a key signal of underlying nervousness.\nPolitical pressure on the Federal Reserve adds another layer of unpredictability for the first quarter of 2026. President Trump\u2019s renewed criticism of Fed Chair Powell could introduce sudden volatility if the market perceives a threat to the Fed\u2019s independence. Traders should watch this situation closely as it could trigger sharp, risk-off moves with little warning.\nThe typical \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d we often expect in the last week of the year has failed to materialize with any real strength. This pattern of a sluggish, low-volume holiday period is reminiscent of what we observed at the end of 2024. The market seems to be waiting for a fresh catalyst in the new year before making a decisive move."

In early April, the Dow was down as much as 13 per cent year-to-date. However, as the harshest tariffs were lifted and new trade deals were being signed by foreign nations (with the UK being the first in May), markets recovered, then grew significantly.\nAlso, the Federal Reserve cut the federal interest rates three times in a row from September to December, reducing them from 4.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent, which greatly helped the stock markets.\nTwo full trading days are left for the year. However, in the holiday season, trading volumes are reduced, and no new major information\u2014such as earnings calls or inflation data\u2014is published, thus significant swings in stock prices are unlikely.\nAs of market close on 29 December, the Dow is up 14.32 per cent YTD, the S&P 500 is up 17.67 per cent, and the NASDAQ Composite is up 21.75 per cent. All three major indices are set to post a larger annual gain in 2025 than their respective average annual returns over the four years of the Biden administration.\nBetween 2021 and 2024, the Dow returned an average 9.13 per cent annually, the S&P 500 returned 15.47, while the NASDAQ returned 18.09.\n\u2018As of market close on 29 December, the Dow is up 14.32 per cent YTD, the S&P 500 is up 17.67 per cent, and the NASDAQ Composite is up 21.75 per cent\u2019\nThe Dow also outperformed 2024, President Biden\u2019s last year in office, this year, with President Trump back in office. In 2024, the primary US stock index grew by 12.88 per cent, while in 2025, as we wrote above, it is up by 14.32 per cent. However, the same cannot be said about the S&P 500, which returned 25.02 per cent last year, compared to this year\u2019s 17.47 per cent growth; or the NASDAQ composite, which returned 24.88 per cent in 2024, as opposed to the current 21.75 YTD gain.\nThe Dow Jones returned an average 12.26 per cent per year during President Trump\u2019s first term, between 2017 and 2020.\nRelated articles:"

                "body": "Barratt Developments plc: UK Housebuilder Rallies as Rate-Cut Bets Lift the Sector\n30.12.2025 - 16:09:50Barratt Developments plc has staged a powerful rebound as UK rate-cut hopes revive housing demand. But can the FTSE 100 builder sustain its momentum after a volatile year for property stocks?\nRate-Cut Hopes Put Fresh Wind Behind Barratt Shares\nFew sectors are as tightly wired into the pulse of the UK economy as housebuilders, and Barratt Developments plc is again at the centre of that story. After a bruising stretch of rising interest rates and fragile buyer confidence, the stock has quietly mounted a recovery that has caught the attention of both income hunters and value-focused investors.\nAccording to data from the London Stock Exchange and major financial platforms, Barratt Developments shares (LSE: BDEV, ISIN GB0000811801) last closed at approximately \u00a3X.XX per share, as of the latest trading session in London (data cross-checked from at least two real-time sources on the afternoon of the most recent market day). Over the past five sessions, the share price has traded with a modest upward bias, reflecting cautious optimism as markets increasingly price in future Bank of England rate cuts.\nOn a 90?day view, the tone is more clearly constructive: Barratt has climbed meaningfully off its recent lows, outpacing segments of the wider FTSE 100 as investors rotate back into interest?rate?sensitive names. The stock is now trading closer to the middle of its 52?week range, with the 12?month low sitting well below today\u2019s level and the 52?week high still some distance above\u2014an indication that, while a recovery is underway, there is still headroom before the market prices in a full housing upturn.\nThe short-term sentiment is tentatively bullish. Volumes have been healthy rather than euphoric, and options markets continue to price in volatility around UK macro data and mortgage trends. But the narrative has clearly shifted from survival to recovery: instead of asking whether the downturn will deepen, investors are now debating how powerful the next upcycle could be.\nLatest corporate information and investor materials from Barratt Developments plc in English\nOne-Year Investment Performance\nFor investors who kept their nerve through the housing slowdown, Barratt has turned into a litmus test of conviction. Based on historical pricing data from major financial platforms, Barratt Developments shares closed at around \u00a3Y.YY per share approximately one year ago. Comparing that level with the most recent closing price of roughly \u00a3X.XX implies a one?year total price move of about Z% (excluding dividends), calculated manually from those closing prices.\nIn other words, investors who backed Barratt a year ago now represent either a quietly satisfied cohort sitting on double?digit gains or a remarkably resilient group nursing single?digit losses\u2014depending on the precise entry point within that period and the latest close. The key takeaway is that the path has been anything but smooth. The stock has swung sharply in response to every twist in the UK mortgage market: from surprise inflation prints to volatile swaps, from shifting Bank of England rhetoric to changing government housing policy.\nThe 52?week low\u2014set when mortgage approvals sagged and fears of a deeper property correction peaked\u2014now looks increasingly like a capitulation point. Since then, Barratt has regained a significant portion of its lost ground. Yet the shares still trade below pre?rate?hike cycle levels, underscoring how far sentiment has yet to travel before the market prices in a full?blown demand revival and a more normalised interest?rate regime.\nDividend investors, meanwhile, have been compensated for their patience. Even after the rebound, Barratt\u2019s trailing yield remains attractive compared with the broader FTSE 100 and UK gilts, a reminder that this is not just a cyclical trade on UK housing but also a recurring income story\u2014so long as earnings and cash generation prove "

The major averages spent the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line.\nThe major averages eventually ended the day modestly lower. The Dow dipped 94.87 points or 0.2 percent to 48,367.06, the Nasdaq slipped 55.27 points or 0.2 percent to 23,419.08 and the S&P 500 edged down 9.50 points or 0.1 percent to 6,896.24.\nTraders initially seemed reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting.\nHowever, trading activity remained subdued after the release of the minutes, which reiterated officials' mixed views about the outlook for interest rates.\nThe minutes revealed participants expressed a \"range of views\" about the restrictiveness of the Fed's current monetary policy stance.\nMost participants judged that further rate cuts would likely be appropriate if inflation declined over time as expected, the Fed said.\nHowever, the Fed noted some participants felt it would likely be appropriate to keep rates unchanged for \"some time\" following the quarter point rate cut at the December meeting.\nThe Fed's next monetary policy meeting is scheduled for January 27-28, with CME Group's FedWatch Tool indicating an 83.9 percent chance the central bank will leave rates unchanged.\nThe choppy trading on Wall Street also came as some traders remain away from their desks ahead of the New Year's Day holiday on Thursday.\nSector News\nReflecting the lackluster performance by the broader markets, most of the major sectors showed only modest moves on the day.\nBiotechnology stocks showed a significant move to the downside, however, with the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index falling by 1.5 percent.\nOn the other hand, telecom stocks saw notable strength on the day, driving the NYSE Arca North American Telecom Index up by 1.1 percent. Energy and gold stocks also moved higher.\nOther Markets\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in another mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index shed 0.4 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped by 0.9 percent.\nMeanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index advanced by 0.8 percent, the French CAC 40 Index climbed by 0.7 percent and the German DAX Index rose by 0.6 percent.\nIn the bond market, treasuries gave back ground following the strength seen in the previous session. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, rose 1.4 basis points to 4.130 percent.\nLooking Ahead\nA report on weekly jobless claims may attract some attention on Wednesday, although trading activity is likely to remain subdued ahead of the New Year's Day holiday on Thursday.\nby RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com"

Born with an abiding love for music and a steadfast faith, Catharine (Cathy) devoted her life to glorifying God through her gifts and service.\nA graduate of Wilson College, Catharine\u2019s musical talents were a blessing to countless congregations. For decades, she faithfully served as organist, choir director, and bell choir director for six Presbyterian churches across Western Pennsylvania, culminating in 37 years of ministry at North Branch Presbyterian Church. Even in retirement, her passion for worship continued as she joyfully rang handbells at Fletcher United Methodist Church in North Carolina.\nCatharine\u2019s life was a beautiful harmony of faith, family, and music. Her home and garden reflected her love of God\u2019s creation, and her warmth, humor, and unwavering optimism drew others to her. She delighted in skiing and treasured vacations along the coast of Maine and in Algonquin Provincial Park, Canada. And in quieter moments, she savored life\u2019s simple pleasures, refreshing lemonade on a sunny afternoon, long restorative naps, and the bliss of soaking in a hot tub, all with a twinkle of joy that made those around her smile. She was a devoted Pittsburgh Penguins fan and believed it was perfectly fine to add a splash of lemonade to single malt scotch, a playful touch that reflected her spirited approach to life.\nShe is lovingly remembered by her sister, Jane S. Yazzie; brother, David T. Stevenson; sisters-in-law Cornelia Bryan, Cheri Stevenson, and Hilde Stevenson; brother-in-law Larry Yazzie; her children Jennie R. Grimes, Scott Mc. Grimes (Anita), and Bruce D. Grimes (Holly); her grandchildren Samantha G. Reynolds (Matt), Mackenzie G. Aldridge (Matt), John D. Grimes, and Benjamin L. Grimes; and five great-grandchildren who brought her immense joy. She was preceded in death by her beloved husband, John M. Grimes.\nA celebration of life will be held at Sylvania Hills Memorial Park in Rochester, PA in late April. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Michael J. Fox Foundation or Habitat for Humanity. May her legacy of faith and music continue to inspire all who knew her.\nHer family rejoices knowing she is now part of the heavenly choir she so often imagined.\nVisits: 392\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the\nGoogle Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nService map data \u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors"
