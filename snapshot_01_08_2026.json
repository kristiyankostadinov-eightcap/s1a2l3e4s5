A cooler labor market can reduce wage pressure and, over time, inflation \u2013 which would give the Fed more room to lower interest rates. That\u2019s usually good for gold because the metal doesn\u2019t pay interest, so it looks relatively better when yields fall. But it\u2019s a tug-of-war..\nright now: the dollar is near a multi-week high and the 10-year yield has rebounded, both of which typically weigh on bullion. The next test is Friday\u2019s US nonfarm payrolls report, which could reset expectations for how quickly the Fed can cut.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Gold is trading the yield curve, not the jewelry counter.\nGold\u2019s short-term direction is being set by real yields and the dollar. If payrolls come in hot, investors may push yields higher and gold can struggle to hold gains; a weaker print can do the opposite by reviving rate-cut bets. The same logic spills into other precious metals, which often rise and fall with the market\u2019s view on growth, inflation, and financing conditions.\nThe bigger picture: Commodities are being pulled by policy risk and supply constraints.\nHard assets are getting extra attention as investors juggle rate uncertainty with supply and trade disruptions.

Venezuela is pumping around 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, down from a high three decades ago of around three million bpd.\nThe US Energy Department signalled on Wednesday that Trump's announcement was just the start and that all proceeds from Venezuelan oil sales will be settled in US-controlled accounts at globally recognised banks.\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\"We have engaged the world\u2019s leading commodity marketers and key banks to execute and provide financial support for these crude oil and crude products sales,\" the department said.\nBrent Crude, the international benchmark, was down 1.37 percent at $59.87 per barrel amid news of the announcement.\nUS Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Wednesday during a conference in Miami that the US would sell blockaded Venezuelan oil \u201cindefinitely\u201d.\n'Indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace'\n- US Energy Secretary Chris Wright\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela - first this backed up, stored oil, and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace,\u201d Wright said.\n\u201cWe need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\u201d he added.\nVenezuelan oil is heavy and especially well-suited for US refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the Gulf of America.\nIf Trump can sustain the flow of Venezuelan crude to the US, it would represent a boon to US refineries and potentially American consumers of gasoline and diesel, which are oil\u2019s refined products. Trump is battling sticky inflation in the US and growing concerns about \u201caffordability\u201d.\nTrump imposed a blockade on Venezuela\u2019s oil industry in the lead-up to the US\u2019s attack on the country and abduction of President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\nThe blockade crippled the oil industry, which had been suffering from blistering US sanctions and, before that, decades of mismanagement and underinvestment.\nVessel seized\nMillions of barrels of Venezuelan oil became stuck on ships and in land storage during the US blockade in the Caribbean.

He added that such leverage and control over oil sales are necessary to drive the changes that must take place in Venezuela.\nVenezuela is estimated to hold the world\u2019s largest proven crude oil reserves, totaling about 303 billion barrels. However, due to U.S. sanctions and systemic government corruption, its current production has lagged, placing it around 20th globally. Experts believe that if the U.S. successfully asserts control over these exports, American energy hegemony will be significantly strengthened.\nEarlier, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported that if the U.S. effectively takes control of Venezuelan oil, the biggest winner would be the U.S., while Canada, a major supplier of crude oil to the U.S. market, could suffer. OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, have traditionally maximized national interests by adjusting production to manage global oil prices, but that framework could be disrupted if the U.S. secures large volumes of crude oil. Russia would also face losses, as lower oil prices would reduce export revenues, while China is expected to be hit as well, given that it has imported about 80 percent of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports. However, Venezuelan crude accounts for only a small share of China\u2019s total oil imports, limiting the broader economic impact.\nFollowing Wright\u2019s remarks, international oil prices fell. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for February delivery dropped $1.14, or 1.99%, to settle at $55.99 a barrel.\nDespite the ambitious plan, analysts point to several major hurdles. Experts estimate that Venezuela would require a total investment of $100 billion, or about $10 billion annually over a decade, to restore production to its historical peak. In addition, U.S. corporate investment would be critical, but political uncertainty, including potential changes in the U.S. administration, raises the risk that Venezuela could again pursue abrupt nationalization of its oil industry, as it has in the past."

The ^DJI slide followed reports of a Trump housing ban proposal targeting institutional buyers of single-family homes, plus talk of Venezuela oil supply returning. Tech held up with Nvidia and Microsoft gaining, highlighting rotation risk. For Canadians, a weaker energy tape and housing uncertainty pulled the TSX lower as well. We break down drivers, sector moves, and how to position now.\nDow sinks as cyclicals wobble; TSX tracks lower\nDow Jones today lost 466 points, roughly 0.9 percent, as traders repriced policy risk across housing, financials, and energy. The move contrasted with firmer mega-cap tech, which steadied the broader tape. Volatility rose as investors rotated into defensives and cash-rich platforms. Breadth weakened, and intraday bounces faded into the close, a pattern consistent with headline-driven sessions and thin early-year liquidity.\nCanadian markets joined the pullback, with the S&P/TSX Composite down more than 270 points as energy and financials slipped, according to CP24. For Canadian investors, the Dow Jones today decline matters because TSX earnings leverage to commodities and banks can amplify US-led risk-off days. Currency stability helped, but sector mix kept the index heavy as crude weakened.\nPolicy risk watch: Trump housing ban and rotation\nReports of a Trump housing ban proposal aimed at institutional buyers hit US homebuilders, single-family rental operators, and private equity names tied to residential assets. Dow Jones today reflected that unwind as investors priced slower deal flow and tighter exit multiples. For Canada, listed North American landlords and lenders with US exposure faced sympathy selling amid fears of lower housing liquidity.\nWhile cyclicals slipped, Nvidia and Microsoft rose, underscoring a pivot toward secular growth and high cash margins. Dow Jones today still fell because value sectors carry heavy index weight, but the tech bid showed risk was selective, not wholesale. For Canadians, US tech resilience can offset TSX weakness via diversified ETFs, though concentration risk remains a key consideration.\nOil weakens on Venezuela oil supply talk\nTalk of increased Venezuela oil supply weighed on crude benchmarks, pressuring energy stocks on both sides of the border. Dow Jones today felt the drag through integrated majors and services names, while the TSX, with higher energy weight, underperformed. Sector ETFs saw outflows as traders marked down cash flow assumptions. Refining margins offered limited cushion given softer crack spreads.\nTraders are eyeing sanction pathways, actual export volumes, and OPEC-plus responses. For Canadians, balance sheets and dividends of producers remain key. The TSX joined a broader decline, per The Globe and Mail. If Venezuela barrels scale up, differentials and pipeline utilization could shift, affecting realized prices and capital plans.\nPositioning for Canadian investors\nWe favor a barbell: keep core exposure to broad US equities while trimming cyclical beta tied to housing and high-cost energy. Add quality tech and free-cash-flow defensives. Reassess position sizing in energy stocks with high breakevens. Use staggered limit orders on down days, and consider covered calls to harvest elevated implied volatility without overtrading headlines.\nWatch policy timelines around the Trump housing ban idea, weekly US inventory data, and updates on Venezuela export flows. Track sector breadth on Dow Jones today moves to gauge durability. For risk control, maintain cash buffers, diversify across TSX sectors, and set stop levels below recent swing lows. Keep currency exposure in mind when allocating between US and Canadian assets.\nFinal Thoughts\nDow Jones today fell 466 points as policy headlines cooled housing-related assets and oil weakness weighed on energy. Tech strength helped limit broader damage, "

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\nIn 2024 the country claimed more than 300 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, the highest of any nation. The runners up were Saudi Arabia, with more than 260 billion barrels, and Iran, with more than 200 billion barrels. The global total was 1,566 billion barrels.\nAnd the vast reserves are not a coincidence. Geology is very much in Venezuela\u2019s favor, says Luis Zerpa, a petroleum engineer at the Colorado School of Mines. \u201cFrom the geology side, it just has the perfect location,\u201d he says. And like all fossil fuels, the country\u2019s oil owes its existence to deep time\u2014and the planet\u2019s dynamic surface.\nThe story of oil begins when land is pushed up in one region, creating a low-lying basin nearby, Zerpa says. Rock is eroded from the higher-elevation land into the basin, which also fills with the organic remains of plants and animals. Over millions of years, enough material piles up above to raise the temperature and pressure to the point that sediments turn into rock and organic material becomes oil and gas.\nThe balance of oil and gas depends on two factors. The first is how much rock builds up above the material. The so-called oil window occurs at a depth of anywhere between 4,000 and 12,000 feet; below it, organic matter is more likely to turn into gas. The other factor is the origin of the organic material itself\u2014marine plants are more likely to become oil, whereas terrestrial plants are more likely to become gas.\nAs oil and gas form\u2014and as tectonic plates move\u2014the rock surrounding these deposits begins to fracture. This sets the hydrocarbons free from the source rock in which they formed and enables them to migrate up into more porous rock that then traps them in place.\nVenezuela is nestled between the Caribbean and South American plates. And the Nazca plate, which underlies the eastern Pacific Ocean, also shapes the area\u2019s tectonic scene. The jostling of all those plates lifted up the northern Andes and other highlands in the region\u2014while it simultaneously created three sedimentary basins that have produced oil and gas: the Eastern Venezuela Basin in the north, the Maracaibo basin in the northwest and the Barinas-Apure basin in the west.\nHence, Venezuela\u2019s more than 300 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves were formed. Here, \u201cproven\u201d means that engineers have drilled enough wells to accurately estimate the extent of oil and gas deposits in the country\u2019s territory.\nGetting that oil is a different matter. Venezuela\u2019s production of the fossil fuel peaked around 1970 at around 3.7 million barrels per day, before it fell steeply starting in the late 1970s and continued to drop during the 1980s. It recovered here and there in the mid-1990s and early 2010s. But in 2025 the nation produced only around 1.1 million barrels per day. Analysts expect that any political transition in the wake of Maduro\u2019s capture and arrest will barely raise that output for at least the next two years: aging infrastructure has severely constrained production, and fixing that will take billions of dollars in investment and several years, Reuters has reported."

                "body": "The capture of former Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by the US intelligence services and armed forces has resulted in a frenzy of speculation about its consequences. But there is no doubt that the events were closely linked to the oil riches of the country. While the political situation in Venezuela remains fluid, there is far more certainty about its position as an oil producer.\nFor a start, Venezuela has one of the highest proven oil reserves in the world. The number frequently thrown around is 300 billion barrels, more than any other country, including Saudi Arabia.\nBut it\u2019s important to be cautious about the numbers coming from the outside of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Statistics used within the OECD clearly distinguish between proved, probable, possible and contingent reserves and require consistency over time.\nProven reserves are defined as the oil in the ground that can be extracted economically, with the prevailing technology. It is a variable, not a constant \u2013 and the Venezuelan reserves estimate goes back to 2008.\nAs oil prices increase, the reserves increase too. This is because higher profits can justify the higher costs of extracting additional oil that would otherwise remain in the ground.\nInitial production is usually easy due to the natural gas pressure of the well. Over time, this pressure falls and additional measures such as gas and water injection may have to be used \u2013 and these are expensive.\nIn 2008, the international oil prices approached US$140 (\u00a3104) a barrel. Currently, most of the Venezuelan oil sells at a US$25 discount to the Brent benchmark, at around US$35 a barrel. All other things being equal, the current proven oil reserves may be well below 100 billion barrels \u2013 less than a third of the figure that\u2019s frequently cited.\nThe problem with Venezuela\u2019s oil\nMost Venezuelan oil is very heavy (tar-like) and contains a lot of sulphur. This makes production and transportation very expensive. Heavy oil needs to be diluted with naphtha (a liquid hydrocarbon) or gas oil first, and sulphur must be removed during the processing with expensive hydrogen.\nOnly very sophisticated refineries on the US Gulf Coast and some new refineries in India, the Middle East and China can process this kind of oil. It is no coincidence that Venezuelan oil is sold at huge discounts relative to other grades.\nAmerican oil companies started their activities in Venezuela almost a century ago, and by 1960s, the US was the largest foreign investor in the country. In line with most countries in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), the Venezuelan oil industry was nationalised in 1971 and turned into the country\u2019s oil monopoly, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA).\nThe Venezuelan oil industry then suffered from decades of political mismanagement, purges and US sanctions. Due to the lack of investment, production in the country has fallen from over three million barrels a day (mbd) in the early 2000s to below one mbd last year (see the graph below). This decline was particularly noticeable during the Maduro regime when the ruling party used PDVSA as a cash cow, investing little or nothing back into the industry.\nDue to the state of the oil sector, even a relatively small increase in oil production in Venezuela would require billions of dollars of investment. A significant increase would require years of massive funding \u2013 even with a stable political environment.\nIt is not clear that events in Venezuela will have any significant immediate impact on the global oil market. The initial reaction was for the oil price to fall. But the global oil market is oversupplied right now and even the total loss of Venezuelan exports (which is unlikely) would have only a minor impact on the prices.\nThe decline of Venezuelan oil production:\nIn the long term, the state of the industry can only improve (barring wars and civil strife). Additional barrels from Venezuela would only make life hard"

                "body": "EUR/USD holds steady as mixed US data reinforces cautious Fed outlook\n- EUR/USD trades flat as mixed US data fail to spark a fresh direction.\n- Strong ISM services activity contrasts with signs of labour-market softening.\n- Markets continue to price a cautious Fed easing path into the year ahead.\nThe Euro (EUR) trades little changed against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, as traders show a muted reaction to a mixed batch of US economic data. At the time of writing, EUR/USD is trading around 1.1691, consolidating after losing around 0.30% on Tuesday.\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that the US Services PMI rose to 54.4 in December, beating market expectations of 52.3 and improving from 52.6 in November. The report pointed to improving momentum in the US services sector, with business activity ending 2025 on its strongest footing of the year and remaining in expansion territory for a tenth straight month.\nThe Employment Index rose to 52 in December from 48.9, returning to expansion territory and indicating that hiring conditions stabilised toward year-end. New Orders strengthened notably, climbing to 57.9 from 52.9. Meanwhile, the Prices Paid Index slipped to 64.3 from 65.4.\nWhile the ISM survey pointed to resilient activity, labour-market indicators pointed to emerging softness. ADP data showed private payrolls rose by 41K in December, below expectations of 47K, though reversing November\u2019s decline of 32K, which was revised down to 29K.\nSeparately, the JOLTS survey revealed that job openings fell to 7.146 million in November from 7.449 million, undershooting market forecasts of 7.6 million.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, trades around 98.60.\nFrom a monetary policy perspective, the mixed data keep the Federal Reserve (Fed) in a wait-and-see mode ahead of its January 27-28 meeting. The pickup in services activity argues against any rush toward aggressive easing, but signs of labour-market softening continue to support the case for gradual rate cuts. Markets remain aligned with a cautious easing outlook, with traders currently pricing in around two interest-rate cuts in 2026.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal f"

The figure was in line with expectations and down from 2.1% recorded in November.\nThe data comes after the ECB left rates unchanged at 2% for the 4th consecutive meeting in December, with no further rate cuts expected from the central bank this year. The ECB forecast inflation will average at 1.9% this year, down from 2.1% in 2025. Meanwhile, growth is expected to be more resilient with the central bank expecting GDP growth of 1.2%, up from a previous estimate of 1%.\nMeanwhile, the US donor is trading quietly against its major peers as the FX markets have largely brushed off deepening geopolitical fractures around the world in quiet trade despite the US intervention in Venezuela and the capture of President Maduro.\nThe market is in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the US ADP private payrolls job openings data and ISM services PMI figures. These data points come ahead of Friday's nonfarm payroll report and could provide some clarity on the outlook for rates. Investors have struggled to get an accurate read of the world economy following the US government shutdown\nEUR/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nEUR/USD\u2019s recovery from 1.15 November low ran into resistance at 1.18 and has eased lower. The price is testing the 1.1650-1.1680 support zone.\nSellers supported by the RSI below 50 will look to break below the support zone and the 50 SMA at 1.1640, exposing the 200 SMA at 1.550. A break below here brings 1.15 and the November low back into focus.\nFTSE ends 4-day winning streak as oil prices drop\n- FTSE eases from record high\n- Oil majors track oil prices lower\n- Miners track precious metal prices lower\n- FTSE holds above 10,000\nThe FTSE 100 His falling on Wednesday following a record high yesterday and four consecutive days of gains. UK indexes are being dragged lower by heavyweight commodity stocks, amid a drop in oil and precious metal prices.\nOil majors such as Shell and BP are down more than 2% after President Trump said Venezuela would send up to 50 million barrels of oil to the market for sale. This is a bearish development for oil, with prices already 18% lower across 2025. The prospect of higher supply has pulled oil prices down a further 1%, with oil majors tracking the price lower.\nGold and silver prices were also easing lower, trimming recent gains for miners. Fresnillo is trading 3% lower, and Endeavour Mining is down just over 1%.\nThe market will continue to monitor developments in the US and Greenland following Trump's announcement of plans to acquire the territory. This is a move that European top leaders have voiced concerns about.\nLooking ahead, attention will be on US ADP payroll reports and the November JOLTS job reports, which precede Friday's nonfarm payrolls report.\nLooking at individual stocks, NatWest is lower after a downgrade, while most of Vodafone is topping the 5100 following an upgrade from Berenberg to buy from hold.\nFTSE forecast - technical analysis\nThe FTSE trades above its rising trendline dating back to April and rose to a record high of 10,160 in the previous session. The price has eased back slightly today but remains above the key 10,000 psychological level. The RSI is coming out of overbought territory.\nBuyers will look to extend gains beyond 10,160 towards 10,200 and 10,300 as the next logical levels.\nSupport is seen at 9920, the November high. Below here 9800, the rising trendline support comes into play. It would take a move below 9600, the December low to create a lower low.\n"

The strengthening of the US dollar is due to expectations of positive labour market statistics, a chance of another easing from the Fed in March fell to 45%, and demand for safe-haven assets in a changing world. Donald Trump does not rule out the seizure of Greenland by force, while Denmark and the rest of Europe are talking about the collapse of NATO, and the US may take control of about 30% of the world\u2019s oil reserves. This allows them to dictate rules to the market.\nOne way or another, Donald Trump wants to lower rates to 1%, which, given the rapid growth of GDP, contradicts economic theory. However, if the composition of the FOMC changes, everything would be possible. In this regard, the court\u2019s verdict in the Lisa Cook case is of fundamental importance. A precedent may be set that gives the president the power to dismiss members of the Federal Reserve.\nDonald Trump intends to achieve a further slowdown in inflation. Why not capture the president of Venezuela to accomplish this? Washington is now demanding that Caracas sell it 50 million barrels of oil and cut all ties with Beijing, Moscow, Tehran and Havana. Deglobalisation is intensifying, and the world is becoming increasingly bipolar. In the short term, the greenback can benefit from growing demand for safe-haven assets.\nThe fall in EUR/USD is also due to the vulnerability of the European economy. Following Italian and French inflation, consumer prices in Germany slowed in December from 2.6% to 2%. If the disinflation process gains momentum, the ECB may start to consider resuming its easing cycle, which is bearish for the euro.\nAccording to Chancellor Friedrich Merz, some sectors of the German economy are in critical condition, and the government has not done enough in the eight months since he took office. The French Ministry of Finance announced that the budget deficit would rise to 5.4% if parliament did not compromise. As a result, the risks of a credit rating downgrade increased, and EUR/USD moved south.\nThe strengthening of the US dollar caused gold to retreat. Nevertheless, the precious metal remains in a strong position. This is partly due to the likely increase in central bank activity in the bullion market in a bipolar world.\nThe FxPro Analyst Team\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

However, the fundamental backdrop warrants some caution for bearish traders and before positioning for an extension of the retracement slide from the 1.3565-1.3570 region, or the highest level since September 18, touched on Tuesday.\nA slight deterioration in the global risk sentiment offsets Wednesday's mixed US economic releases and assists the safe-haven US Dollar (USD) to preserve its weekly gains, which, in turn, caps the GBP/USD pair. In fact, the Institute for Supply Management reported that the business activity in the US services sector unexpectedly picked up in December and its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) increased to 54.4 from 52.6 in November. Separately, the ADP's national employment report showed that private payrolls rebounded less than expected in December.\nAdding to this, the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) revealed that US job openings fell more than expected in November, suggesting that demand for labor continued to ebb. The data reaffirms market expectations for more interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed), which might keep a lid on any further USD appreciation. Furthermore, the Bank of England (BoE) less dovish message, suggesting that rates are getting closer to neutral, might continue to act as a tailwind for the British Pound (GBP) and help limit the downside for the GBP/USD pair.\nMoving ahead, there isn't any relevant market-moving economic data due for release from the UK on Thursday, leaving spot prices at the mercy of the USD price dynamics. Later during the North American session, traders will look to the US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims for some impetus. The focus, however, will remain glued to the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday, which will influence expectations about the Fed's future rate-cut path. This, in turn, will drive the USD demand in the near-term and determine the next leg of a directional move for the GBP/USD pair.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling.

While the broader range structure remains intact, the near-term bias has shifted cautiously higher as the pound benefits from relative policy support versus the US dollar.\nTechnical Picture: Higher Lows Signal Improving Structure\nOn the daily chart, GBP/USD has formed a sequence of higher lows since rebounding from the 1.3100 area, indicating improving short-term structure after a corrective phase.\n- Price is holding above the 15-day and 20-day moving averages, both of which have begun to turn higher.\n- Recent pullbacks have been shallow, suggesting buying interest on dips rather than distribution.\n- The pair is now testing a key horizontal zone around 1.3500\u20131.3520, a level that has repeatedly acted as both support and resistance.\nKey Technical Levels\nResistance\n- 1.3520\u20131.3600: Major resistance zone and prior range highs\n- A daily close above 1.3600 would confirm a bullish breakout and expose 1.3720\u20131.3800\nSupport\n- 1.3450\u20131.3480: First dynamic support near short-term averages\n- 1.3320\u20131.3350: Stronger structural support\n- A break below 1.3320 would weaken the recovery narrative and shift focus back toward 1.3200\nMomentum Indicators\n- RSI (14) near 61 reflects strengthening bullish momentum without entering overbought territory\n- The indicator has remained above the 50 line during recent pullbacks \u2014 a classic bullish momentum signal\n- This supports the view that the current advance is corrective-to-constructive rather than purely technical noise\nFundamental Drivers: Sterling Finds Relative Support\nBank of England: Restrictive Bias Supports the Pound\nSterling has drawn support from the Bank of England\u2019s relatively hawkish tone, particularly when compared to other major central banks.\nKey factors supporting GBP:\n- UK inflation remains sticky, especially in services\n- Wage growth continues to run above levels consistent with the BoE\u2019s inflation target\n- As a result, policymakers have signalled caution around premature rate cuts\nMarkets now expect the BoE to move more gradually than previously anticipated, which has helped underpin GBP.\nFederal Reserve: Dollar Momentum Moderates\nOn the U.S. side, the dollar has shown signs of losing momentum as:\n- Inflation data shows gradual cooling\n- Growth remains solid but less surprising on the upside\n- Markets increasingly price in eventual Fed easing, even if timing remains uncertain\nThis has reduced the dollar\u2019s yield advantage at the margin, allowing GBP/USD to recover from oversold levels.\nRate Differentials: Less USD-Dominant Than Before\nWhile U.S. rates remain high in absolute terms, the relative policy gap between the Fed and BoE has narrowed, diminishing some of the structural pressure on sterling seen earlier in the year.\nAs long as UK data remains resilient, GBP/USD is less vulnerable to sustained downside driven purely by rate expectations.\nForward Scenarios\nBullish Continuation\n- Sustained trade above 1.3500, followed by a confirmed break of 1.3600\n- Would target 1.3720\u20131.3800\n- Likely supported by firm UK data or softer U.S. inflation prints\nRange / Pullback Scenario\n- Failure at resistance could keep the pair range-bound between 1.3320 and 1.3600\n- A pullback toward 1.3350\u20131.3400 would still be consistent with a constructive outlook\nGBP/USD has shifted from defensive to cautiously constructive, supported by improving technical momentum and a relatively restrictive Bank of England stance.

The pair is currently fluctuating within a tight range, just above the mid-1.3400s. Despite this pause, the overall market environment suggests that traders with a bearish outlook should proceed with caution before anticipating a continued pullback from the 1.3565-1.3570 area\u2014the highest point reached since mid-September on Tuesday.\nA modest dip in global risk appetite is helping the US Dollar (USD) maintain its recent gains, despite mixed economic indicators from the United States on Wednesday. This has put a cap on the GBP/USD pair's recovery. Notably, the Institute for Supply Management reported a surprise uptick in US services sector activity for December, with the Non-Manufacturing PMI climbing to 54.4 from November's 52.6. Meanwhile, the ADP employment report indicated that private sector job growth in December was weaker than anticipated.\nAdditionally, the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed a larger-than-expected drop in US job openings for November, pointing to a cooling labor market. This supports expectations that the US Federal Reserve may implement further interest rate reductions, potentially limiting additional USD strength. On the other hand, the Bank of England's (BoE) recent comments, which were less dovish and hinted that interest rates are nearing a neutral stance, could provide ongoing support for the British Pound and help cushion the GBP/USD pair from further declines.\nWith no significant UK economic releases scheduled for Thursday, the GBP/USD pair is likely to be influenced primarily by movements in the US Dollar. Later in the North American session, investors will turn their attention to the latest US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims for fresh trading cues. However, the spotlight remains on Friday\u2019s US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, which is expected to shape market expectations regarding the Fed\u2019s future rate decisions. The outcome of these events will play a crucial role in determining the short-term direction of the GBP/USD pair."

The shift in tone came after a softer inflation print, which sparked a rally in Australian government bonds and knocked the market\u2019s implied odds of a February hike down to about 28%. That re..\npricing pulled 10-year yields to around 4.66% and kept the Australia\u2013US yield gap stuck near 65 basis points, limiting any extra lift versus the greenback. RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser also called the inflation slowdown \u201chelpful\u201d, but the next key checkpoint is the Jan 28 CPI release.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: FX is following the data again.\nIf Jan 28 CPI reaccelerates, rate expectations could snap back and boost the aussie, especially against lower-yielding currencies. If inflation keeps cooling, falling yields could cap AUD/USD even if the currency stays strong on crosses. Commodity tailwinds still matter \u2013 firmer iron ore, copper, and gold typically support Australia\u2019s export income and, in turn, the currency.\nThe bigger picture: Policy gaps are doing the heavy lifting.\nCurrency moves are increasingly about central banks drifting apart. Australia\u2019s path is being compared directly with New Zealand\u2019s, where investors expect rates to stay on hold for months, helping push AUD/NZD to a 12-year high. Zoom out further and bond flows, plus sticky yield spreads like the Australia\u2013US gap, can keep exchange rates moving even when global risk sentiment is choppy.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

While Australian inflation has cooled modestly, CPI remains above the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s target band, keeping policy restrictive and limiting the scope for aggressive downside in the Aussie.\nView related analysis:\n- AUD/USD 2026 Outlook: Policy Divergence and a Shifting Dollar Trend\n- Trade to Watch 2026: Nasdaq 100 Correction Risk Before New Highs\n- EUR/JPY: 2025\u2019s Biggest Surprise \u2013 The Great Short That Wasn\u2019t\nAUD/USD Outlook: Pullback Risks Rise as USD Finds Support\nAustralian Inflation Cools, but CPI Still Above RBA Target\nMonthly inflation figures for November released on Wednesday showed that core CPI remains sticky, although price pressures have eased modestly. Trimmed mean CPI slowed to 3.2% y/y, while headline CPI fell to 3.4%, leaving both measures above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target band. Housing was again a key driver, contributing 1.1 percentage points to inflation and accounting for 21.4% of the total CPI basket.\nWhile this eases pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia to hike rates in Q1, it does nothing to justify rate cuts. Policymakers will want confirmation from the Q4 CPI figures due on 28 January before determining whether the February meeting is live\u2014a possibility Governor Bullock effectively flagged in December. Until then, inflation remains uncomfortably high and the policy bias stays restrictive.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)\nUS Dollar Finds Its Footing\nThe US dollar index rose in the first week of the year to hint at an interim swing low around 97.50, although I doubt bulls will manage to drive prices back above 100. Prices have broken above last week\u2019s bullish inside week and the prior week\u2019s bearish engulfing candle, pointing to further near-term upside.\nRegular readers will recall that I suspect a wave-C correction may have ended on the weekly chart, which keeps my broader bias tilted towards fading extended USD rallies. That, in turn, suggests AUD/USD bulls may look to buy dips rather than chase strength.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: TradingView / ICE\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe daily chart shows the Australian dollar briefly hitting a 15-month high on Wednesday, before a stronger US dollar drove a full intraday reversal into the close. This has left a shooting star candlestick on the AUD/USD daily chart, reinforced by bearish RSI divergence, warning of at least a near-term pullback.\nI\u2019m not looking for anything aggressive at this stage, but a break below the September high at 0.6707, or the 67c handle, could see AUD/USD retrace towards its 20-day SMA near 0.6675.\nA deeper pullback may require domestic data to undershoot expectations, particularly given current futures and options positioning. However, a decisive break below 0.6660 would open a run towards the 50-day SMA and prior swing highs and lows around 0.6592.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: TradingView\nAUD/USD Positioning: Australian Dollar Futures \u2013 COT Report\nWhile futures traders remain net short AUD/USD, long exposure continues to trend higher among large speculators and asset managers. Short interest has only edged modestly higher among large specs and has largely flattened among asset managers.\nWith no immediate signs of sentiment reaching an extreme, futures traders could flip net long AUD/USD in the coming weeks or months, assuming no fresh bearish catalyst emerges for the Australian dollar.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: TradingView / ICE\nView the full economic calendar\n-- Written by Matt Simpson\nFollow Matt on Twitter @cLeverEdge\nFrom time to time, StoneX Financial Pty Ltd (\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d) website may contain links to other sites and/or resources provided by third parties.

                "body": "AUD/USD Price Forecast: Overbought RSI flags pullback risk as uptrend holds\n- AUD/USD trades near flat after easing back from a data-driven jump following Australian inflation figures.\n- November CPI and trimmed mean inflation slowed but remained above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target range.\n- The technical outlook stays bullish, with prices holding near 15-month highs despite overbought signals.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) trades flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with AUD/USD easing back after an initial advance triggered by Australia\u2019s latest inflation data. At the time of writing, the pair is trading around 0.6738, holding near 15-month highs.\nAustralia inflation eased in November but remains above the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target range. Data released earlier showed the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged on the month after a flat reading in October. On an annual basis, CPI slowed to 3.4% in November from 3.8%.\nThe policy-relevant trimmed mean CPI rose 0.3% on the month in November, slowing from 0.4% in October, while the annual trimmed mean moderated to 3.2% from 3.3%.\nAUD/USD saw a muted reaction to the latest US economic releases. The ADP Employment Change report showed private payrolls rose by 41K in December, below expectations of 47K, but reversing the previous month\u2019s decline of 32K, which was downwardly revised to 29K. Meanwhile, the ISM Services PMI surprised to the upside, rising to 54.4 in December from 52.6 and beating forecasts of 52.3.\nJOLTS data showed job openings fell to 7.146 million in November from 7.449 million, undershooting expectations of 7.6 million.\nFrom a technical perspective, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 69, approaching overbought territory and raising the risk of a near-term pullback. That said, the broader technical structure remains firmly bullish after a decisive break above the former trendline resistance near 0.6550, with prices holding well above the 50-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).\nIf a pullback materialises, AUD/USD could find initial support near the 0.6660 area. A sustained break below this region would weaken the bullish structure and expose the 0.6590-0.6570 zone, where the 50-day and 100-day SMAs converge, making it a key technical support area.\nThe Average Directional Index (ADX) near 35.36 underscores strong trend strength. On the upside, a continuation of the uptrend could open the door toward the 0.6800 psychological level, with scope for a further extension toward the 2024 high above 0.6900.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Asia stocks slip tracking Wall St losses; KOSPI hits new peak on Samsung earnings\nShort-term USD/JPY price action and macro backdrop\nUSD/JPY is trading around 156.5\u2013156.7, retracing Monday\u2019s pullback as the US Dollar regains ground and US yields tick higher. The US Dollar Index is back near 98.4\u201398.5 after slipping earlier on risk-on flows, and that modest rebound is enough to lift the pair inside its existing up-channel rather than start a new trend leg. Price is grinding higher rather than exploding, which tells you that buyers are present but cautious at these elevated levels.\nThe immediate support for USD/JPY comes from the yield differential and from the fact that markets still accept the idea of a mildly easier Fed, not an aggressively dovish one. At the same time, the pair is trading not far from zones that previously triggered verbal intervention threats from Tokyo, which naturally caps enthusiasm to add fresh long exposure around the mid-150s. The result is a pair stuck in a tug of war: US rates and risk sentiment keep it supported; BoJ normalization risk and intervention fears keep a ceiling close overhead.\nFed path, US data and implications for USD/JPY\nUS data is not aligned with a strong-dollar story, it is aligned with a controlled slowdown. Services PMI has cooled from 54.1 to 52.5 and the composite gauge has dropped from 54.2 to 52.7, signalling decelerating but still expanding activity. That backdrop explains why markets still price roughly two Fed cuts for 2026 on top of the 75 bps already delivered last year, while treating the January 27\u201328 meeting as a high-probability hold.\nFor USD/JPY, that configuration matters in two ways. First, shorter-dated US yields can fall on any downside surprise in labour or services data, narrowing the rate advantage that has anchored the pair above 150 for months. Second, the dollar\u2019s latest bounce looks driven by position squaring and geopolitics rather than a fundamental shift in Fed expectations.\nThe upcoming Nonfarm Payrolls report, along with ADP, ISM services and JOLTS, is the core catalyst. A jobs gain clearly under consensus and softer wage growth would reinforce the narrative of a cooling labour market that Fed officials are already emphasising. In that scenario, the Dollar Index slipping away from 98 and US yields easing would likely drag USD/JPY back through 156 and toward the lower reaches of the recent band. Conversely, another solid labour print could keep yields elevated short term, but with the market already assuming only modest easing, the upside impulse for USD/JPY from a single report is limited compared with the downside risk if the data disappoints.\nBoJ tightening bias, yen fundamentals and intervention overhang\nOn the Japanese side, the story has flipped from ultra-dovish to cautiously hawkish. Governor Kazuo Ueda has repeated that the Bank of Japan is prepared to continue raising rates as long as the economy and inflation evolve in line with projections, and that policy adjustments are intended to secure \u201csustained growth and stable inflation\u201d. After years of negative rates and yield-curve control, that is a regime change.\nThis matters because persistent yen weakness around 155\u2013157 strengthens the case for additional tightening. A weak JPY imports inflation, and policymakers have made it clear that they do not want sharp currency slides to dominate the inflation profile. Repeated verbal warnings from Japanese officials in recent weeks underline the discomfort with abrupt moves in USD/JPY and keep the threat of direct intervention alive whenever the pair pushes higher in the channel.\nMedium term, the direction of travel is obvious: a Fed that has already cut 75 bps and is expected to ease further versus a BoJ that is signalling more hikes. That policy divergence argues against a sustained move much above current levels and favours a gradual revaluation of the yen over coming quarters. Any spike toward the high-150s would increasingly look like an opportu"

Momentum has obviously slowed, indicating growing uncertainty over the next directional move, even though the pair is still trading at high levels around the mid-156 area. The market is increasingly focused on the widening policy divergence between the Bank of Japan, which is cautiously tightening, and the Federal Reserve, which is edging closer to an easing cycle.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about forex indicators? Check our detailed guide-\nThe yen\u2019s recent resilience is largely driven by the growing acceptance that the BoJ\u2019s long-awaited normalization process is not a one-off move. Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s most recent remarks reaffirmed the likelihood of further interest rate hikes if inflation remains elevated. Rising wages, persistent pressure on service sector prices, and tighter labor conditions strengthen the argument for gradual tightening. This change has already caused yields on Japanese government bonds to reach multi-decade highs, reducing one of the main causes of yen weakness and closing the yield gap with the US.\nAt the same time, investors remain cautious about pushing the yen too aggressively higher. Uncertainty around Japan\u2019s fiscal outlook, highlighted by the approval of a record budget, and questions over the exact timing and pace of future BoJ hikes continue to temper bullish conviction. As a result, USD/JPY has avoided a sharp sell-off and instead is grinding lower in a controlled manner.\nGeopolitical risks add another level of complexity. The demand for safe havens has been boosted by growing tensions associated with Venezuela and other global flashpoints. However, the dollar\u2019s inflows during periods of high US yields have lessened the yen\u2019s influence. Even so, upside movements are still constrained, especially in the upper 150s, by the possibility of verbal intervention from Japanese authorities.\nOn the US side, the dollar is struggling to find sustained support. Markets are increasingly pricing in further Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year, with policymakers stressing the need to stay data-dependent as inflation cools and labour market conditions soften. This week\u2019s run of US data, including ADP employment figures, ISM Services PMI, and JOLTS, may influence short-term moves, but the main event remains Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report. A weaker-than-expected jobs reading would likely reinforce expectations of a dovish Fed and put renewed downside pressure on USD/JPY.\nUSD/JPY Technical Forecast: Consolidating Near Key MAs\nThe USD/JPY 4-hour chart shows consolidation between 20- and 50-period MAs, while the confluence of 100- and 200-period MAs supports the pair\u2019s upside bias. The RSI also remains flat under the 50.0 level, suggesting no clear bias in the short term.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about next cryptocurrency to explode?

                "body": "Japanese Yen Weakens Amid Sluggish Wage Growth and BoJ Uncertainty\nFor the third consecutive session, the Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to lose ground against the US Dollar (USD). This ongoing decline follows Thursday\u2019s report revealing that Japan\u2019s inflation-adjusted wages dropped in November at the fastest rate since January of last year. Persistent doubts about when the Bank of Japan (BoJ) might next raise interest rates are also weighing on the Yen. Meanwhile, the US Dollar maintains its recent gains, further supporting the USD/JPY exchange rate.\nDespite these headwinds, expectations that the BoJ will continue gradually normalizing its monetary policy, coupled with concerns about potential market intervention, may prevent traders from making large bearish bets against the Yen. Additionally, heightened geopolitical risks are prompting investors to seek safer assets, which could help limit further losses for the JPY. On top of this, the possibility of a more dovish stance from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) may restrain the Dollar\u2019s upside and lend some support to the Yen, potentially capping gains in the USD/JPY pair.\nKey Developments Impacting the Yen and Dollar\n- Recent government data showed that Japan\u2019s average nominal wages increased by just 0.5% year-on-year in November, the slowest growth since December 2021. At the same time, real wages\u2014adjusted for inflation\u2014fell for the eleventh month in a row, dropping 2.8%.\n- This persistent trend of inflation outpacing wage growth presents a challenge for the BoJ, which has indicated that further rate hikes are possible if economic and price trends align with forecasts. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda recently stated that both wages and prices are expected to rise together.\n- Despite these challenges, many investors remain convinced that the BoJ will continue tightening its monetary policy. This contrasts with growing speculation that the US Federal Reserve could cut interest rates as soon as March and possibly again later in the year, a scenario that could favor the lower-yielding Yen.\n- Mixed economic data from the US on Wednesday did little to change expectations of a dovish Fed, which may limit further advances in the US Dollar and keep the USD/JPY pair in check. Notably, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s Non-Manufacturing PMI rose to 54.4 in December from 52.6 the previous month.\n- While the US services sector showed unexpected strength, labor market data was less impressive. The ADP Research Institute reported a 41,000 increase in private-sector jobs in December, following a revised 29,000 decline in November and falling short of the 47,000 forecast.\n- Separately, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) indicated that job openings fell to 7.146 million at the end of November, down from 7.449 million in October and below the expected 7.6 million, suggesting continued softening in labor demand.\n- Traders appear cautious ahead of Friday\u2019s US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, which is expected to provide further insight into the Fed\u2019s potential rate-cut trajectory. The outcome will likely influence the direction of the USD and the USD/JPY pair in the near term.\nTechnical Outlook: USD/JPY Maintains Bullish Momentum Above Key Support\nOn the 4-hour chart, the USD/JPY pair remains above the rising 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), which currently sits at 156.22 and serves as dynamic support. The upward slope of this SMA highlights a prevailing bullish trend. A positive crossover on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, with the MACD line moving above the Signal line near zero, along with a slightly positive histogram, points to strengthening momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58, above the neutral 50 mark, reinforcing the bullish outlook.\nAn ascending trend line from 155.30 continues to support the pair\u2019s upward movement, with additional support near 156.36. As long as the price holds above this level and the 100-period SMA, buyers "

                "body": "Why The Canadian Dollar Is Poised to Climb Against the US Dollar\nEconomic recovery and a growing differential in monetary policy versus the US underpin the positive outlook for the loonie in 2026.\nKey Takeaways\n- Most analysts forecast the Canadian dollar to strengthen against the US dollar in 2026.\n- The loonie could find additional support from the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate.\n- Headwinds like the renewal of the USMCA trade agreement and lower oil prices could dampen the outlook.\n2026 looks bright for the Canadian dollar, as analysts widely expect it to strengthen against the US dollar. This contrasts with a volatile 2025, which ended with relative strength for the loonie. Barring any setbacks in the renewal of the US-Mexico-Canada continental free-trade agreement, the Canadian dollar is poised to maintain that strength.\nAnalysts say the US Federal Reserve\u2019s trend of lowering interest rates should reinforce the loonie. In contrast, trade-related risk and lower oil prices could stand to weaken the outlook. \u201cWe are looking for a stronger Canadian dollar in the year ahead,\u201d says Sarah Ying, head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.\nNick Rees, head of macro research at Monex Canada, expects the Bank of Canada\u2019s monetary policy to continue supporting the Canadian dollar this year, \u201cat least until the USMCA renegotiation comes into focus.\u201d\nThe Canadian currency rose 5% against the US dollar in 2025 to C$1.37, or 72 US cents, even after briefly plummeting in April to a years-long low of C$1.46 after the first wave of tariff announcements. The loonie\u2019s 2025 gains reversed a decline of 8% against the greenback in 2024.\nWhat Drove the Canadian Dollar\u2019s Surge?\nCurrency strategists point to the US dollar\u2019s weakness as the primary source of the loonie\u2019s rise last year. \u201cThe decline in the US dollar versus the Canadian dollar reflects the general weakness in the US dollar, mainly driven by a loss of confidence in US leadership following its imposition of import tariffs,\u201d explains Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group. He says that other trends, such as the resolution of political uncertainty and Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s pro-growth policies, also helped.\nCIBC\u2019s Ying divides the year into before and after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on April 2. \u201cBefore \u2018Liberation Day,\u2019 tariff uncertainty drove USD/CAD higher, especially in early February, when Trump did not specify whether his tariffs included or excluded USMCA-compliant goods,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter Liberation Day, we saw the greenback weaken, primarily due to de-dollarization concerns.\u201d\nThe Canadian dollar strengthened against the greenback in the second half of 2025, as \u201ctariff and trade concerns have not been as severe as many had feared entering 2025, helping to relieve much of the downside pressure on the Canadian dollar,\u201d Monex\u2019s Rees says. However, any deterioration in the US-Canada trade dispute this year could renew pressure on the loonie.\nA Growing Interest Rate Differential Should Benefit the Canadian Dollar\nLate last year, the Bank of Canada paused its rate cuts while the US Fed\u2019s easing cycle continued, helping to strengthen the loonie. In 2026, the Fed is expected to cut interest rates one or two more times. Should the Bank of Canada holds its overnight rate steady (as is broadly expected), that would widen the interest rate differential, providing additional heft for the Canadian dollar.\n\u201cWe should see the Fed cutting rates more often than the Bank of Canada \u2026 we could potentially see a more divergence in currency returns at the benefit of the CAD,\u201d says Sadiq Adatia, chief investment officer at BMO Global Asset Management. He highlights that \u201cwe expect CAD to appreciate in the first half, but in the second half, we could see USD bounce back a bit.\u201d\nTrade-Related Uncertainty Remains a Threat\nConditions remain supportive\u2014at least until the USMCA comes up for negotiation, according to Rees. He calls it \u201ct"

                "body": "USD/CAD extends gains above 1.3850 as concerns over Canadian Oil demand persist\n- USD/CAD strengthens as commodity-linked Canadian Dollar struggles amid rising concerns about Canadian Oil demand.\n- Canada\u2019s PM Mark Carney said Canadian crude would remain low risk and competitive even amid a rise in Venezuelan exports.\n- The US Dollar stays steady as fragile data ahead of Friday\u2019s jobs report keeps sentiment cautious.\nUSD/CAD continues its winning streak for the fifth consecutive day, trading around 1.3860 during the Asian hours on Thursday. The pair appreciates as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) faces challenges after US President Donald Trump signaled efforts to re-establish Venezuelan crude imports, raising concerns about added supply and heightened competition for Canadian Oil demand.\nHowever, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canadian crude remains low risk and competitive even if Venezuelan exports rise. His office said Carney will visit China from January 13\u201317 as he seeks to diversify Canada\u2019s exports away from the United States amid uncertainty over US trade policy.\nCanada\u2019s seasonally adjusted Ivey Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) climbed to 51.9 in December 2025 from 48.4 in November, surpassing expectations of 49.5 and signaling a return to expansion after one month of contraction. Canada's Trade Balance data for October is due on Thursday.\nThe US Dollar (USD) remains steady as data points to a fragile US economic backdrop ahead of Friday\u2019s crucial jobs report, tempering market sentiment. US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) is expected to show job gains of 55,000 in December, down from 64,000 in November.\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported on Wednesday that the US Services PMI rose to 54.4 in December from 52.6 in November. This figure came in stronger than the expectation of 52.3. The Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment Change showed an increase of 41,000 jobs in December, following a revised decline of 29,000 in November. The figure comes in slightly below market expectations of 47,000.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from g"

                "body": "GBP/JPY Price Forecast: Buyers remain in control despite near-term consolidation\n- GBP/JPY edges lower on Wednesday but holds near multi-year highs.\n- Price action continues to hold above rising moving averages on the daily chart.\n- Momentum cools from overbought levels, though buyers remain in control.\nThe British Pound (GBP) ticks lower against the Japanese Yen (JPY) on Wednesday, extending losses for a second straight day. At the time of writing, GBP/JPY trades around the 211.00 psychological mark, down nearly 0.20%.\nThe pullback has so far remained contained, with the wide UK\u2013Japan interest-rate differential continuing to underpin the cross near levels last seen in 2008. GBP/JPY climbed nearly 7% last year, underpinned by lingering fiscal concerns in Japan and the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) cautious approach to policy normalisation, which has kept the Yen on the defensive.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) gradual easing cycle has allowed the Pound to preserve its relative yield advantage, sustaining underlying demand for the cross.\nFrom a technical perspective, GBP/JPY continues to trade within a well-defined uptrend, with the daily chart showing a clear sequence of higher highs and higher lows, reinforcing the broader bullish structure.\nThe 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which also forms the middle Bollinger Band, continues to slope higher, with the pair holding above it and preserving a constructive near-term tone.\nMomentum remains supportive, though signs of moderation are emerging. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands near 63.7, holding well above the neutral 50 mark, suggesting buyers remain in control despite easing from overbought levels. The Average Directional Index (ADX) at 32.83 reflects a firm trend environment, suggesting dips could remain contained.\nOn the upside, immediate resistance aligns with the upper band near 212.90. A daily close above the upper band would open room for an extension of the rally.\nOn the downside, initial support is seen around the middle band near 210.15, with a deeper pullback likely to find interest closer to the lower band in the 207.40 region.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of exper"

Spot prices, however, lack follow-through selling and currently trade around the 211.20 area, down just over 0.10% for the day.\nAgainst the backdrop of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish outlook, rising geopolitical tensions benefit the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) amid fears about government intervention and act as a headwind for the GBP/JPY cross. In fact, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Monday that the central bank will continue raising rates if economic and price developments move in line with its forecasts.\nMeanwhile, geopolitical tensions escalated after the US launched land strikes on Venezuela. Adding to this, US President Donald Trump openly signaled that Colombia and Mexico could also face US military action as part of a widening campaign against criminal networks and regional instability. Moreover, the White House said on Tuesday that Trump is discussing options for acquiring Greenland.\nThe JPY bulls, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets amid the uncertainty over the likely timing of the next BoJ rate hike and concerns about Japan's fiscal situation. The British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, draws support from a softer US Dollar (USD) and reduced bets for more aggressive policy easing by the Bank of England (BoE) this year. This, in turn, could support the GBP/JPY cross.\nIn the absence of any relevant market-moving economic releases, the supportive fundamental backdrop backs the case for the emergence of dip-buying at lower levels and warrants caution for bearish traders. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling to confirm that the GBP/JPY cross have topped out in the near-term and positioning for any meaningful corrective slide."

In December, Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s cabinet approved an $118 extra budget to finance a stimulus plan, which is expected to add tensions to the country\u2019s already strained finances.\nRisk sentiment FAQs\nIn the world of financial jargon the two widely used terms \u201crisk-on\u201d and \u201crisk off'' refer to the level of risk that investors are willing to stomach during the period referenced. In a \u201crisk-on\u201d market, investors are optimistic about the future and more willing to buy risky assets. In a \u201crisk-off\u201d market investors start to \u2018play it safe\u2019 because they are worried about the future, and therefore buy less risky assets that are more certain of bringing a return, even if it is relatively modest.\nTypically, during periods of \u201crisk-on\u201d, stock markets will rise, most commodities \u2013 except Gold \u2013 will also gain in value, since they benefit from a positive growth outlook. The currencies of nations that are heavy commodity exporters strengthen because of increased demand, and Cryptocurrencies rise. In a \u201crisk-off\u201d market, Bonds go up \u2013 especially major government Bonds \u2013 Gold shines, and safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and US Dollar all benefit.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD), the Canadian Dollar (CAD), the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) and minor FX like the Ruble (RUB) and the South African Rand (ZAR), all tend to rise in markets that are \u201crisk-on\u201d. This is because the economies of these currencies are heavily reliant on commodity exports for growth, and commodities tend to rise in price during risk-on periods. This is because investors foresee greater demand for raw materials in the future due to heightened economic activity.\nThe major currencies that tend to rise during periods of \u201crisk-off\u201d are the US Dollar (USD), the Japanese Yen (JPY) and the Swiss Franc (CHF). The US Dollar, because it is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and because in times of crisis investors buy US government debt, which is seen as safe because the largest economy in the world is unlikely to default. The Yen, from increased demand for Japanese government bonds, because a high proportion are held by domestic investors who are unlikely to dump them \u2013 even in a crisis. The Swiss Franc, because strict Swiss banking laws offer investors enhanced capital protection.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterd"

                "body": "A day after submitting its filing for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs, banking giant Morgan Stanley has now moved to file for an Ethereum Trust, as per the recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nIt shows that established banking players are beginning to embrace crypto ETFs, which have received significant approvals under the Trump administration.\nMorgan Stanley Submits SEC Filing for Ethereum ETF\nMorgan Stanley has filed an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund. This shows further expansion of the firm\u2019s push into crypto investment products.\nAccording to the filing, the Morgan Stanley Ethereum Trust is designed to track the price of Ether, and provide a direct regulated exposure to the altcoin.\nThe filing comes just one day after Morgan Stanley submitted registration statements for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs.\nAs per the Ethereum ETF proposal from Morgan Stanley, the bank also seeks to participate in ETH staking.\nThis will allow the fund to generate yields on its ETH holdings. Earlier this week, asset manager Grayscale distributed the first staking rewards to investors of its Ether ETF (ETHE).\nThe demand for Ethereum staking has also spiked in recent weeks, with BiMine at the forefront of the recent staking boom.\nHowever, several important details remain undisclosed in the filing.\nMorgan Stanley has not yet specified the exchange on which the ETF would be listed, its ticker symbol, or the custodian responsible for holding the underlying ETH.\nThe move has drawn attention across the digital asset industry. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, called Morgan Stanley\u2019s entry into crypto ETFs \u201cpretty remarkable.\u201d\nHe added that the proposed Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana products would become the third, fourth, and fifth ETFs to carry the Morgan Stanley name.\nEther ETF Inflows Resume Again\nInflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have resumed after bleeding in December 2025. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is leading most of the flows.\nOn Jan. 6, inflows into spot Ether ETFs stood at a total of $114.7 million, as per data from Farside Investors.\nAccording to market data, the BlackRock Ethereum ETF saw net inflows of 61,359 ETH. Trading activity was also elevated, with daily volume reaching about $1 billion.\nThe latest figures extend a positive trend for the fund.\nOver the first three trading days of 2026, ETHA has attracted more than $344 million in net inflows, representing roughly 108,000 ETH added to the fund.\nRead original story Morgan Stanley Files With US SEC for Ethereum ETFs, After Bitcoin and Solana by Bhushan Akolkar at Coinspeaker.com"

                "body": "In a yet another move signaling the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and digital assets, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has submitted applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). This development represents an expansion by one of Wall Street\u2019s major players into the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment space, where BTC recently saw a modest uptick and SOL climbed as well to start the year.\nThe investment bank, which manages roughly $6.4 trillion in client assets, detailed its plans in two distinct S-1 registration forms released by the SEC on Tuesday.\nThese outline the creation of the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust and the Morgan Stanley Solana Trust.\nNotably, the Solana-focused product incorporates a staking mechanism, allowing investors to potentially earn rewards by participating in the network\u2019s validation process.\nThis feature adds an innovative layer to the ETF, aligning with Solana\u2019s emphasis on high-speed blockchain operations.\nShould the SEC greenlight these proposals, Morgan Stanley would align itself with established players like BlackRock and Fidelity, who have already carved out substantial positions in the crypto ETF arena.\nThe filings come on the heels of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States back in January 2024, which opened the floodgates for regulated crypto exposure in conventional portfolios.\nThis step highlights a broader shift: mainstream financial institutions are increasingly viewing digital currencies not as fringe experiments but as viable components of diversified investment strategies.\nThe timing of Morgan Stanley\u2019s initiative coincides with a surge in crypto ETF adoption across both professional money managers and everyday investors.\nThe total trading volume for U.S. spot crypto ETFs has now surpassed the $2 trillion milestone.\nNotably, it required over a year to hit the initial $1 trillion mark, but the subsequent trillion accumulated in a mere eight months.\nThis acceleration points to heightened market enthusiasm, improved liquidity, and greater confidence in these instruments.\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs, in particular, have amassed more than $123.5 billion in assets under management.\nThis figure equates to approximately 6.6% of Bitcoin\u2019s overall market capitalization, a testament to the asset\u2019s growing institutional footprint despite its price hovering below the $100,000 threshold in recent trading periods.\nSuch statistics underscore how crypto ETFs are bridging the gap between speculative trading and long-term holding, making digital assets more accessible through familiar vehicles like retirement accounts and brokerage platforms.\nMorgan Stanley\u2018s foray isn\u2019t isolated; it reflects a maturing ecosystem where regulatory clarity is fostering innovation. Since the 2024 approvals, inflows into these funds have been steady, even amid market volatility.\nFor instance, Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations haven\u2019t deterred investors, as the ETFs provide a buffered entry point without the complexities of direct custody or wallet management.\nLooking ahead, approvals for these new trusts could further democratize access to altcoins like Solana, which has gained traction for its scalability and low transaction costs.\nThe staking element in the Solana Trust could appeal to yield-seeking investors, potentially setting a precedent for future products incorporating active blockchain features.\nThis push by Morgan Stanley exemplifies the blurring lines between TradFi and DeFi. As more players enter the space the crypto market stands to benefit from enhanced legitimacy, deeper liquidity pools, and broader participation.\nHowever, challenges remain, including ongoing regulatory challenges and the inherent risks of digital asset volatility. Investors should weigh these factors carefully, consulting professionals before diving in.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s ETF filings mark a pivotal chapter in crypto\u2019s mainstream integration. Wi"

                "body": "Morgan Stanley filed for an Ethereum ETF that will hold and stake ETH, offering regulated price exposure plus yield as institutional crypto adoption accelerates.\nETH trades near $3,200 as analysts eye $3,800, with ETF momentum, staking rewards, and bullish technicals strengthening Ethereum\u2019s outlook.\nMorgan Stanley has taken another major step into digital assets by filing with the US SEC to launch an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The proposed product, named the Morgan Stanley Ethereum Trust, comes from Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which oversees more than $1.8 trillion in assets, underscoring the scale of institutional interest behind the move.\nThe filing signals the firm\u2019s intent to expand beyond traditional markets and offer regulated crypto exposure to a much wider pool of investors. While details such as the ticker symbol and listing exchange have not yet been revealed, the structure of the fund offers insight into how Wall Street is increasingly approaching Ethereum.\nHow the Ethereum ETF Is Structured\nAccording to the filing, the ETF will be set up as a Delaware statutory trust, a structure commonly used in traditional finance products. The fund is designed to hold Ether directly, allowing investors to track ETH\u2019s price performance without having to buy, custody, or manage the tokens themselves.\nNotably, the trust also plans to stake a portion of its ETH holdings through third-party providers, meaning staking rewards would be reflected in the fund\u2019s net asset value. This approach goes beyond simple price exposure and introduces a yield component, something that could make Ethereum-based ETFs more attractive than earlier-generation crypto products.\nPart of a Broader Crypto Push\nThe Ethereum filing follows closely on the heels of Morgan Stanley submitting S-1 registrations for Bitcoin- and Solana-linked ETFs. Like the Ethereum trust, the proposed Solana product would also include staking, signaling a broader strategy focused on capturing both price appreciation and network rewards.\nThis coordinated push suggests Morgan Stanley is positioning itself early in what could become the next wave of regulated crypto investment vehicles, especially as investor appetite shifts beyond Bitcoin alone.\n- Also Read :\n- Why Bitcoin Is Not Surging Despite Bullish MSCI News\n- ,\nMarket Reaction and Ethereum Price Outlook\nEthereum has responded positively to the growing institutional narrative. At the time of the filing, ETH was trading near $3,200, up roughly 8% over the past week, reflecting improving sentiment across the market.\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe points out that ETH has decisively broken above the $3,100 resistance level and is now consolidating, a structure he compares closely to Bitcoin\u2019s recent behavior. He highlights the reclaim of the 21-day moving average as a key bullish signal, suggesting momentum has flipped in favor of buyers.\nIf ETH continues to hold above this level, Van de Poppe expects the uptrend to extend in the coming weeks, with $3,800 emerging as the next major upside target.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Ethereum ETF filing reinforces the idea that crypto adoption is moving firmly into the institutional phase. For Ethereum, regulated access combined with staking-based yield could strengthen long-term demand and further solidify ETH\u2019s role within traditional capital markets.\nNever Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!\nStay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.\nFAQs\nIt\u2019s a proposed ETF that holds Ether directly, letting investors gain regulated ETH exposure without buying, storing, or managing crypto themselves.\nThe ETF is set up as a Delaware statutory trust that holds ETH and tracks its price, using a structure familiar to traditional investment products.\nThe move reflects rising institutional demand for regulated crypto products beyond Bitcoin, especially those offering both price exposure and yield.\nRegulated ac"

                "body": "Solana Builds Strong Case for Higher Valuations as ETFs and Network Metrics Surge\nInvestors are expecting Solana (SOL) to gain momentum in 2026, driven by rising on-chain activity, expanding DeFi participation, and increasing institutional exposure through exchange-traded funds.\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bring The Heat: $1.2 Billion Flows In First 48 Hours\u2014Analyst\nWhile SOL trades at $139, below its all-time high, recent data suggests that the network\u2019s fundamentals are strengthening alongside a gradual price recovery. Together, these trends are shaping a clearer narrative around how Solana\u2019s valuation could be supported beyond short-term market moves.\nNetwork Activity and DeFi Metrics Show Sustained Growth\nOn-chain usage has picked up notably since the start of the year. Active addresses on Solana rose from around 3.38 million to 3.78 million in early January, indicating broader participation across transfers, trading, and application usage. This increase in activity has coincided with a steady rise in decentralized finance metrics.\nThe TVL across Solana-based protocols increased from approximately $8 billion to just over $9 billion, reflecting higher capital commitments to lending, liquidity provision, and yield-focused strategies.\nThese gains align with longer-term data from Solana\u2019s 2025 network review, which showed that daily active wallets averaged 3.2 million and non-vote transactions reached a record 33 billion over the year.\nDecentralized exchange activity also remained a key contributor. The annual DEX volume reached $1.5 trillion in 2025, up 57% year-over-year, with SOL-stablecoin trading volume exceeding $780 billion. Raydium led DEX platforms in terms of volume, while several others surpassed the $10 billion threshold.\nApplication Revenue and Ecosystem Expansion\nRevenue generation across the Solana ecosystem continues to scale. Applications built on the network generated $2.39 billion in revenue in 2025, a 46% increase from the prior year.\nSeven applications surpassed $100 million in annual revenue, while smaller projects collectively contributed more than $500 million. The network itself reported $1.4 billion in revenue, reflecting a sharp rise in economic activity tied to usage rather than speculation alone.\nBeyond DeFi, Solana also saw growth in stablecoin transfers, tokenized equities, and Bitcoin-related activity. Stablecoin supply more than doubled to $14.8 billion, while transfers reached $11.7 trillion, pointing to increased settlement and payment use cases.Solana ETF Inflows and Price Levels in Focus\nInstitutional participation has become more visible through Solana-focused ETFs. Assets under management across these products recently crossed $1.02 billion, with Bitwise\u2019s BSOL accounting for the majority share.\nData shows cumulative inflows of nearly $800 million and steady trading volumes, suggesting ongoing demand for regulated exposure. In the spot market, SOL has rebounded from the $120 area to trade near $140, supported by rising volume and improving technical indicators.\nRelated Reading: XRP Rally Reopens The $8\u2013$12 Zone Debate, Says Will Taylor\nWhile resistance levels remain, the combination of ETF inflows, higher network usage, and expanding revenue streams is reinforcing the case for higher valuations if broader market conditions remain supportive.\nCover image from ChatGPT, SOLUSD chart from Tradingview"

Dow Jones will publish the predictions data in outlets such as the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, and Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\nPolymarket and Kalshi have signed a plethora of media deals in recent months as prediction markets continue to gain a major foothold in the United States and abroad. Polymarket is the exclusive prediction market partner for Yahoo Finance, while Google Finance will roll out both Polymarket and Kalshi data in search results. Kalshi is CNN's official partner, integrating prediction market data into programming.\n\"What makes Polymarket so valuable is that they have data, collective intelligence, decentralized data from all around the world, wisdom of the crowd, essentially, that is able to give you much more accurate predictions on what's going to happen,\" Leo Chan, co-founder and CEO of the predictive intelligence startup Sportstensor, told The Block last month.\n\"This kind of information, this kind of data is extremely important and extremely valuable to people outside of the traders,\" Chan continued. \"All these financial institutions that could use this kind of data see prediction markets as an infrastructure to collect this data.\"\nFollowing various raises in 2025, Polymarket was most recently valued at $9 billion, while Kalshi's valuation was around $11 billion.\nEarlier this week, Polymarket said it will offer a new suite of housing-related prediction markets via an integration with onchain real estate platform Parcl.\nOf note, Polymarket confirmed in October that the company plans to launch a native POLY token and an accompanying airdrop.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

                "body": "January 08: Dow Jones\u2013Polymarket Deal Brings Live Odds to WSJ\nPolymarket will power live odds across WSJ, Barron\u2019s, and MarketWatch under a new Dow Jones partnership. For UK investors, this adds a clear read on market-implied probabilities for rates, elections, and major earnings. We can watch real-time shifts in confidence and plan around risk. The move also boosts News Corp\u2019s data edge, while rivals chase prediction market data. Here is what changes, why it matters, and how we can use it in daily decisions.\nWhat the Dow Jones\u2013Polymarket deal includes\nReaders will see live odds embedded within WSJ, Barron\u2019s, and MarketWatch articles and data pages, showing the current market view on key events. The integration appears exclusive, sharpening News Corp\u2019s data moat. For UK users, it means a single, trusted window for concise probabilities on rates, politics, and corporate milestones. Initial coverage focuses on headline events that move global markets. source\nThe feed turns event contracts into easy percentages that update in real time. We can scan odds at a glance and judge whether a shift is noise or signal. Polymarket converts crowd views into clear figures, letting us compare today\u2019s number with prior levels. That helps us align entries, exits, and hedges with timely, measurable changes in sentiment.\nWhy prediction market data matters for investors\nPrediction market data compresses varied views into market-implied probabilities. If the odds on a rate cut jump, we can expect pressure on yields, banks, and the pound, while growth shares may benefit. UK investors can map these shifts to gilts, FTSE sectors, and GBP crosses. Clear numbers anchor narratives and support faster, more confident decisions. source\nThese odds can move on thin liquidity, biased flows, or sudden headlines. We should cross-check with rates futures, options skews, surveys, and primary data. Avoid trading on a single print. Use alerts, confirm moves across markets, and size positions modestly. Polymarket data is a guide, not a guarantee. Process beats prediction when events are close or ambiguous.\nBusiness impact across media and platforms\nExclusive access helps Dow Jones create premium charts, alerts, and newsletters built around real-time probabilities. That supports subscriptions and new ad products tied to event cycles. Competitors without comparable feeds could lose time-on-page and data licensing revenue. The integration also strengthens syndication options, since many desks want clean, vetted predictive signals inside their workflow.\nAs odds embed into news flow, we expect more watchlist additions and pre-event positioning. Retail platforms may add similar feeds to drive engagement and education. UK brokers could highlight probabilities for central bank days or mega-cap earnings. That can increase session depth and trade preparation, even if actual order volume clusters near the final hours before an event.\nHow UK investors can apply the live odds\nIdentify key events for the next month and set alert levels. For example, treat a move from 45% to 60% as a threshold to re-check your case. Align exposure with scenarios, add hedges in GBP terms, and plan exits before the event. Use the odds to time research, not to skip it.\nFocus on policy meetings, headline elections, and mega-cap earnings that sway global risk. If probabilities rise for a cut, review gilts duration and GBP sensitivity in your portfolio. If election odds swing, revisit defensives and FX hedges. For single stocks you hold in the US, consider position sizing and stop levels ahead of prints visible on Polymarket.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Dow Jones partnership brings Polymarket\u2019s real-time odds into mainstream financial reading. For UK investors, it means clearer signals, faster context, and a shared language for discussing events. Start with a watchlist of key meetings and elections, set alert thresholds, and rehearse scenarios before headlines hit. Cross-check probabilities with rates curves, opt"

                "body": "Inflation in the eurozone returned to the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target in December, offering reassurance to policymakers as price pressures continue to ease.\nEurozone inflation fell to 2% in December, meeting the European Central Bank\u2019s price stability target and reinforcing signs that the sharp surge in prices seen over recent years is continuing to fade.\nFlash estimates published by Eurostat on Wednesday show the annual rate of consumer price growth slowed from 2.1% in November to 2.0% in December, in line with market expectations.\nUnderlying price pressures also eased. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy components and is closely watched by policymakers, fell to 2.3% year-on-year from 2.4% in November, its lowest level since August.\nOn a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.2% in December, rebounding from a 0.3% decline the previous month.\nThe breakdown of inflation highlights a familiar pattern. Services continued to record the strongest annual increase, at 3.4%, although this was slightly down from November.\nFood, alcohol, and tobacco inflation edged higher to 2.6%, while non-energy industrial goods saw prices rise by just 0.4%.\nEnergy prices remained firmly in negative territory, falling 1.9% compared with a year earlier, a key factor behind the broader slowdown in headline inflation.\nECB's policy in good place\nWith both headline and core inflation now stabilising, financial markets see limited scope for immediate action by the ECB.\nAccording to the betting platform Polymarket, there is a 97% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged at the next Governing Council meeting in February.\nThe odds of a rate cut during 2026 stand at 45%, while a rate hike is seen as more unlikely, at 11%.\n\"The key takeaway is that price pressures are normalising after several turbulent years,\" said Professor Emeritus Joe Nellis, economic adviser at MHA, in an emailed comment.\n\u201cHeadline and core inflation are now moving within a relatively narrow range, which suggests that the extreme volatility of the recent past is behind us, even if risks have not disappeared,\u201d he added.\nAccording to Nellis, caution is likely to remain the dominant theme.\n\u201cPolicymakers are understandably wary of declaring victory too soon,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWage dynamics, shifts in global energy markets, and uneven demand across member states still pose risks to the outlook. The ECB is therefore more likely to keep borrowing costs steady unless there is a pronounced deterioration in economic conditions.\u201d\nWhat the inflation figure means for households and firms\nThe softer inflation backdrop offers some relief for households whose purchasing power has been eroded by years of rapid price increases.\nMore stable prices also help businesses plan investment and staffing decisions with greater confidence. However, the return of inflation to target has coincided with only modest economic momentum.\nConsumer spending remains subdued in several countries, industrial output has struggled to regain strength and cross-border trade shows signs of inertia.\nNellis cautioned that this combination presents a delicate challenge for policymakers. \u201cPrice stability is returning, but growth remains fragile,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe ECB\u2019s task now is to support a recovery without allowing inflation to reignite. That balancing act will define the policy debate over the coming months.\u201d\nDAX climbs to record highs\nIn equity markets, Germany\u2019s DAX index extended its rally, rising 0.5% to 25,150, a new record high and eyeing the seventh consecutive day of gains.\nSiemens and Siemens Energy led the advance, rising 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively.\nOther major European indices posted mixed results, with markets in France and Italy retreating slightly.\nThe euro held steady at $1.1685, while eurozone sovereign bond yields edged lower.\nGerman Bund yields fell five basis points to 2.78%, reflecting investor confidence that inflation remains under control and that the ECB will maintain its cur"

The risk sentiment has been positive in the past few days, and a couple of economic data gave the bulls more conviction to keep pushing into new highs.\nIn fact, we just got the latest inflation readings for Germany and Eurozone as a whole, and they showed a welcome easing. One of the biggest risks for 2026 has been the risk of earlier than expected rate hikes.\nThe softer inflation data not only eases the tightening risk but also gives traders hope for more rate cuts down the road. Couple that with easing tariff uncertainty and fiscal boost and you get a positive outlook for the stock market.\nMoreover, yesterday the US Supreme Court scheduled Friday as an opinion day, which could see a decision on Trump\u2019s tariffs. In case the tariffs are struck down, the DAX is likely to rally on expected better global growth. On the other hand, if tariffs are kept in place, it shouldn\u2019t change much given that the markets have already adjusted to the tariffs.\nDAX 40 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS \u2013 DAILY TIMEFRAME\nOn the daily chart, we can see that the DAX (CFD contract) broke out of the 2025 range and extended the gains above the 25,000 level. The buyers piled in on the breakout with a defined risk below the resistance-turned-support. The sellers will now need to see the price falling back below the previous all-time high to regain some control and start positioning for a drop back into the 23,000 level.\nDAX 40 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS \u2013 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME\nOn the 4 hour chart, we can see that we have a couple of upward trendlines defining the bullish momentum. If we get a pullback into the support zone around the 24,700 level, we can expect the buyers to step in with a defined risk below the trendline to keep pushing into new highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for downside breaks to target new lows.\nDAX 40 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS \u2013 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME\nOn the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have a minor trendline defining the bullish momentum on this timeframe. Aggressive buyers might lean on the trendline to keep pushing into new highs, although from risk to reward perspective, the area around the major support would offer a much better dip-buying opportunity. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break lower to pile in for a pullback into the major support.\nUPCOMING CATALYSTS\nToday we have the US ADP, the US ISM Services PMI and the US Job Openings data. Tomorrow, we get the latest US Jobless Claims figures. On Friday, we conclude the week with the US NFP report and a potential US Supreme Court decision on Trump's tariffs."

                "body": "- United States\n- /\n- Communications\n- /\n- NasdaqGS:GILT\nEarnings Not Telling The Story For Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ:GILT) After Shares Rise 27%\nGilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ:GILT) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 27% after a shaky period beforehand. The last month tops off a massive increase of 132% in the last year.\nSince its price has surged higher, Gilat Satellite Networks may be sending very bearish signals at the moment with a price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 46.5x, since almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 19x and even P/E's lower than 11x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.\nGilat Satellite Networks certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Gilat Satellite Networks\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Gilat Satellite Networks.How Is Gilat Satellite Networks' Growth Trending?\nGilat Satellite Networks' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 42% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 725% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\nShifting to the future, estimates from the four analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 16% over the next year. With the market predicted to deliver 16% growth , that's a disappointing outcome.\nWith this information, we find it concerning that Gilat Satellite Networks is trading at a P/E higher than the market. Apparently many investors in the company reject the analyst cohort's pessimism and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. There's a very good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the negative growth outlook.\nThe Final Word\nGilat Satellite Networks' P/E is flying high just like its stock has during the last month. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\nWe've established that Gilat Satellite Networks currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E for a company whose earnings are forecast to decline. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings are highly unlikely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.\nThere are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 2 warning signs for Gilat Satellite Networks that you should be aware of.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

(NASDAQ:APLD) shares climbed in Wednesday's extended trading after the company released its second quarter earnings report, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines.\nHere's a look at the key figures from the quarter.\n- APLD stock is moving. Watch the price action here.\nThe Details: Applied Digital reported quarterly earnings of zero cents per share, which beat the analyst consensus estimate for a loss of 10 cents.\nQuarterly revenue came in at $126.59 million, which beat the Street estimate of $89.76 million and was up from revenue of $36.16 million from the same period last year.\nRevenue from the HPC Hosting Business was $85 million for the quarter and $111.3 million for the six months ended Nov. 30, 2025.\nRevenue from the Data Center Hosting Business segment was $41.6 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 15% compared to the $36.2 million during the three months ended Nov. 30, 2024.\n\u201cThe Dakotas represent a compelling region for hyperscalers due to their cool climate and abundant energy. We believe our first-mover advantage, combined with our proven ability to execute technically complex data center construction, positions Applied Digital with a strong competitive advantage,\u201d said CEO Wes Cummins.\n\u201cHaving already secured two hyperscalers in the region, inbound demand has increased meaningfully. We are also in advanced discussions with another investment-grade hyperscaler across multiple regions, including additional locations in the Dakotas and select southern U.S. markets. While there can be no assurance of future contracts, we believe we are well-positioned to begin construction in the near term on these new sites,\u201d Cummins added.\nAPLD Stock Price: According to data from Benzinga Pro, Applied Digital stock rose 4.84% to $30.99 in Wednesday's extended trading.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2026 Benzinga.com.

                "body": "Apogee (NASDAQ:APOG) Reports Sales Below Analyst Estimates In Q4 CY2025 Earnings, Stock Drops 11.4%\nArchitectural products company Apogee APOG missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2025 as sales rose 2.1% year on year to $348.6 million. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $1.39 billion at the midpoint came in 1.4% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.02 per share was 1% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nApogee (APOG) Q4 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $348.6 million vs analyst estimates of $355.3 million (2.1% year-on-year growth, 1.9% miss)\n- Adjusted EPS: $1.02 vs analyst estimates of $1.01 (1% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $46.13 million vs analyst estimates of $44.76 million (13.2% margin, 3.1% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year is $3.45 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 6%\n- Operating Margin: 7.1%, down from 10.3% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 6.6%, similar to the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $802.1 million\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s disciplined execution and agility during this transition. Despite a challenging environment, we delivered results in line with expectations and remain focused on serving customers with innovative products and exceptional service. Our strong operational foundation and balance sheet position us to navigate near-term challenges and drive sustainable long-term value,\u201d said Donald Nolan, Executive Chair and CEO.\nCompany Overview\nInvolved in the design of the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in New York City, Apogee APOG sells architectural products and services such as high-performance glass for commercial buildings.\nRevenue Growth\nExamining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Regrettably, Apogee\u2019s sales grew at a sluggish 2.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This was below our standards and is a rough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Apogee\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years.\nThis quarter, Apogee\u2019s revenue grew by 2.1% year on year to $348.6 million, falling short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its newer products and services will not accelerate its top-line performance yet.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can\u2019t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories.\nOperating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nApogee has done a decent job managing its cost base over the last five years. The company has produced an average operating margin of 8.5%, higher than the broader industrials sector.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Apogee\u2019s operating margin rose by 2.8 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage.\nThis quarter, Apogee generated an operating margin profit margin of 7.1%, down 3.2 percentage points year on year. Since Apogee\u2019s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead increased.\nEarnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profi"

                "body": "Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr.'s announcement Tuesday night that he plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal sent shockwaves through college sports.\nFour days earlier, he'd signed a contract to return to Washington, which was set to pay him in the mid-$4 million range and put him near the top the market for college football. Washington continues to pursue legal action, per sources, to enforce the contract.\nWilliams' declaration online that he is leaving quickly became a touchstone for a sport and system where there's already significant skepticism over the viability of signed contracts.\nWhat happens next with Williams will speak volumes about the future of college football and the enforceability of contracts, providing a bellwether for this new era of college sports.\n\"This is a very bright line,\" a high-ranking college official said. \"Are we going to respect each other's contracts? This is a very simple thing. If we can't protect this, nothing else matters.\"\nIf Williams follows through on his desire to leave Washington -- LSU is the presumptive favorite for his services, but others are expected to be involved as well -- his case will be a litmus test for the rules of a new era. And it will likely end up in court.\nThe situation can be boiled down to a simple point that has been a running issue and an embarrassment for college sports: Can contracts be enforced?\n\"This situation is a product of 2026 football,\" a prominent athletic director told ESPN. \"Where the story ends, this is one of the big moments in college football -- or really, college sports -- and what we do next.\"\nWhen initially contacted, Demond Williams Sr. -- the quarterback's father -- declined to comment.\nIf Williams attempts to leave for LSU or another school, it is likely to become a bigger saga than former Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava's jump from Tennessee to UCLA last year.\nIt's also a potentially much higher-profile version of the legal fallout -- still unresolved -- from the departure last fall of Wisconsin defensive back Xavier Lucas to Miami.\nWisconsin sued Miami claiming the school committed tortious interference by knowingly compelling a player to break the terms of his deal with the Badgers.\nWilliams is a household name in the Big Ten and among college sports fans, as he threw for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns this season. He also ran for 611 yards and six touchdowns. Williams was originally committed to coach Lane Kiffin and Ole Miss in 2023 before flipping to Jedd Fisch and Arizona. He followed Fisch to Washington when Fisch took the head coaching job there in 2024.\n\"This wouldn't happen in professional sports,\" another high-ranking college official said. \"Things like this seem to show that people think that they can do anything.\"\nThe college sports world is watching intently. One general manager at a top program told ESPN on Wednesday: \"It's extremely embarrassing the system allows this. There's no stability at all. How are people sitting around watching everything crumble? What are the leaders doing? What are the commissioners doing? How do we not get everyone in a room and not leave until there's a solution.\"\nOne veteran head coach added with a chuckle on the lack of oversight: \"I don't even know who we turn complaints in to.\"\nWashington sources say the university is prepared to pursue all legal avenues to enforce Williams' contract. The Big Ten has also been engaged on the issue, and the league has been vocal in the past about how crucial it is that \"agreed-to obligations be respected, honored and enforced.\" Williams used a traditional agency to complete his deal. Sources said there had been outreach for more than two weeks from people outside the agency to schools. The agency that did his deal was blindsided by Williams' portal entry.\nPer sources, one person who has contacted schools about Williams is Cordell Landers, who generally refers to himself as an adviser and loomed as one of the central figures in Iamaleava's departure"

That rally extended the index\u2019s advance from the 2008 low to more than 13,000%, while a wide 72% high-to-low range made it the most volatile year in five.\nWhether bulls can repeat that level of exuberance in 2026 remains uncertain. While the Nikkei pushed to fresh record highs on Tuesday, momentum signals are showing early signs of fatigue, suggesting further upside may prove harder to sustain without broader participation.\nView related analysis:\n- ASX 200 Outlook: Qantas, Brambles and ALS Highlight Mixed Signals\n- Trade to Watch 2026: Nasdaq 100 Correction Risk Before New Highs\n- AUD/USD 2026 Outlook: Policy Divergence and a Shifting Dollar Trend\nNikkei 225 Futures (Yen-denominated) \u2013 COT positioning\nWhile the Nikkei remains in a strong uptrend and consolidates ahead of its next bullish breakout, net-long exposure to Nikkei futures has begun to wane. The middle panel shows net-long positioning among large speculators (blue line) and asset managers (light-blue histogram) falling in recent weeks, with both cohorts drifting closer to net-short territory.\nThis shift is largely driven by a reduction in gross long positions, although gross shorts among large speculators have also risen over the past two weeks. While this does not point to an imminent bearish reversal, it is a development worth monitoring as the year progresses.\nMore immediately, the weekly chart is showing the potential formation of a shooting star at resistance, which could signal near-term exhaustion if confirmed.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), CME, LSEG\nNikkei 225, Stock Correlations\nThe correlation data highlights increasingly narrow leadership within the Nikkei 225, with performance dominated by a small group of high-priced stocks. Fast Retailing and Tokyo Electron remain the most consistent drivers, showing strong correlations across short- and medium-term windows, while semiconductor exposure continues to tie the index closely to global tech sentiment rather than broad market participation.\nShort-term correlations have tightened further, suggesting trend strength remains intact but fragile. SoftBank and MUFG have offered intermittent support, but weaker and less stable correlations across the rest of the index point to limited internal breadth, leaving the Nikkei vulnerable should its key leaders lose momentum.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), LSEG\nNikkei 225 Key Stock Drivers and Risk Signals\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) remains the largest Nikkei stock by market capitalisation and continues to trade in a strong uptrend after printing a fresh record high earlier this week. It is difficult to lean bearish on the Nikkei while its most influential heavyweight remains so resilient, suggesting any near-term pullbacks are still likely to be viewed by bulls as opportunities to reload unless a sharp reversal emerges.\nSoftBank Group, however, is telling a different story. The Nikkei\u2019s second-largest stock by market cap is carving out a potential bearish continuation pattern on the daily chart, with price set to close back beneath its 20- and 50-day EMAs. This keeps the risk skewed lower, with a move back towards the 4,000 area increasingly plausible near the high-volume node (HVN) of the current consolidation. A break below 3,795 would confirm the next leg lower within its broader bearish daily trend.\nSony Group is showing tentative signs of stabilisation around its 200-day SMA and EMA \u2014 levels that often prove difficult to break on first test. Heavy volume accompanied yesterday\u2019s decline into these averages, and today\u2019s inability to push decisively lower may prompt some short covering and allow for a modest bounce. However, unless buying pressure accelerates meaningfully, downside risks remain given the prevailing bearish daily trend and lack of convincing "
