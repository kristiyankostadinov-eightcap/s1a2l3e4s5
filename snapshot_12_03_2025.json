                "body": "Precious metals bounce back with record silver and stronger central bank gold demand as traders look ahead to next week\u2019s expected Fed rate cut.\nabout 1 hour ago \u2022 2 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nGold and silver climbed on Wednesday as traders ramped up their bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week, with silver even touching a fresh record high near $59 an ounce.\nWhat does this mean?\nSpot gold and December US gold futures inched higher in early Wednesday trading, clawing back some of the nearly 1% drop from the previous session. That earlier weakness partly reflected investors taking profits and rotating into crypto and stocks \u2013 a fairly typical move when markets already see a high chance of a Fed rate cut. Those odds have nudged higher: CME\u2019s FedWatch tool now shows traders pricing an 89% chance of a cut next week, up from 85% a week ago, helped by recent US data hinting at a mild economic slowdown. Because gold doesn\u2019t pay interest, it tends to look more appealing when rates and bond yields fall, so investors are glued to upcoming US releases like November\u2019s ADP jobs report and the delayed September Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge. Central banks are adding fuel too: they bought a net 53 tons of gold in October \u2013 36% more than in September and the strongest monthly buying since early 2025, according to the World Gold Council.\nWhy should I care?\nMarkets: Precious metals are following the rate-cut playbook.\nSilver stole the show, rising 0.8% to a new record high of $58.94 per ounce, with analysts at Nirmal Bang Commodities pointing to physical shortages and shrinking inventories on COMEX and in China as signs of strong underlying demand. Gold\u2019s rebound \u2013 alongside that record silver price \u2013 suggests traders see softer US data and likely rate cuts as a green light to add exposure to hard assets. Other precious metals barely budged, with platinum dipping 0.1% to $1,636.10 and palladium edging up 0.1% to $1,463.43, which hints that investors are being picky rather than rushing into the whole sector. From here, rate futures, bullion flows, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) positioning will be key signals as markets digest next week\u2019s Fed decision and fresh inflation and jobs data.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks are voting with their vaults.\nCentral banks\u2019 renewed appetite \u2013 with October\u2019s 53 tons of net gold purchases the most since early 2025 \u2013 shows that official institutions still lean on bullion as a core reserve when macro uncertainty creeps higher. At the same time, traders are thinking beyond the next move to the broader policy path, especially after President Donald Trump said he plans to name a replacement for Fed chair Jerome Powell early next year. That combination of slowing growth, shifting Fed leadership, and tight physical silver supply could help keep precious metals at the center of how governments and investors hedge against inflation, currency swings, and policy surprises over the coming years.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nResearch\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 11 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 1 hour ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Asia stocks mixed as Fed cut bets lift Japan, S.Korea; Australia Q3 GDP in focus\nYesterday, the U.S. dollar defended its important support zone, halting its drop and putting pressure on metals.\nGold responded with a textbook pullback, but now it\u2019s decision time: either the bulls reclaim momentum, or the bears take us lower.\nThe USD Index\nYesterday, the dollar tapped the green support zone and bounced, just like we anticipated. The result? A textbook hammer candle: small body, long tail, signaling a potential short-term reversal fueled by demand pressure from below.\nSounds bullish? At first glance: yes.\nBut here\u2019s the catch: DX.F still remains capped below the rising wedge and the key 100.00 barrier. Until that ceiling is cleared, this bounce may just be a pause not a pivot.\nZooming into the microstructure, the dollar just hit its first local resistance created by the previous swing highs and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the recent decline.\nAdditionally, momentum indicators flashing warning signs:\n- CCI is approaching overheated territory\n- Stochastics are already overbought and curving down\n- RSI flirting with resistance near 60\nAll the above paints two near-term possibilities:\n- Pullback scenario: a rejection here could send DX.F back toward 99.10\u201399.20 zone or even to around yesterday\u2019s low.\n- Breakout test: if buyers push through and price closes above the red descending channel\u2026 things will change.\nKey upside levels to watch if bulls push through:\n- 99.49 -> the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement\n- 99.65-99.67 -> the 50% Fibo + the black declining resistance line\n- around 99.76 -> Nov. 28 highs + the bearish engulfing formation\n- 99.81-99.86 -> the 61.8% Fibo + Nov.25/Nov.26 highs (+2 bearish engulfing patterns)\nBearish scenario?\n- watch 99.30-99.34 -> recent lows + 38.2% Fibo (based on recent upswing)\n- below that: 99.23 (50% Fibo), 99.16 (61.8% Fibo), 98.96-99.06 (yesterday\u2019s lows)\nMy takeaway: the bounce was expected. The rejection? Still on the table. This is a reaction zone - not confirmation of trend reversal. Let the market show its hand. Today\u2019s close matters more than today\u2019s high.\nGold\u2019s Response\nAnd now\u2026 let\u2019s see how gold (GC.F) responded.\nThe gap zone we discussed yesterday was fully filled, confirming the shift in the very short-term control to sellers and triggering a decline under the next support zone (highlighted in yesterday\u2019s Lab Note #19).\nThanks to this move, today\u2019s session saw a short-lived drop below the 50% retracement of the latest swing from 4150, approaching the price to the next important support zone (4200-4208) and encouraging bulls to step in.\nBut can they take control?\nWe\u2019re seeing early bullish signals on both CCI and Stochastics plus (as mentioned earlier) the USD just hit its first intraday resistance. That creates a setup for a potential bullish breakout, but only if buyers can break above the upper line of the red declining wedge visible on H1.\nIf they can, we\u2019ll likely see a move to at least 4252.85-4259.70 (today\u2019s opening gap). If the buyers close it, the next target could be around 4281-4284 (78.6% of the last swing + the wedge target area marked with blue).\nIf they can\u2019t (rejection from the wedge), we\u2019ll likely see a test of the above-mentioned green support zone 4200-4208). However, a potential break below 4200 opens the path to 4172\u20134182 where the 38.2% retracement of the entire mid-November rally is.\nLevels to Watch:\n- Resistances: 4242 / 4255 / 4275\u20134280\n- Supports: 4200 / 4172\u20134182\nMy takeaway: the pressure is building. Don\u2019t front-run this. Let the wedge (in gold) and the first resistance zone (in the index) decide.\nAnother dot connected. Another trail unfolding.

                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/as-traders-lock-in-profits-gold-falls-to-4193-amidst-a-strong-us-dollar/",
                "body": "Gold Price Influences\nGold prices fell below $4,200 as traders took profits before the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting scheduled for December 9-10. A stronger US Dollar and a risk-on sentiment diminished the demand for gold, even though weak US manufacturing activity pressured the Fed to reconsider its policies.\nGold slipped by nearly 0.80% on Tuesday, with the XAU/USD pair trading at $4,193 after peaking at $4,240 earlier in the day. Traders are focusing on the upcoming ADP Employment Change report and the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index due at the end of the week, as Federal Open Market Committee members remain divided on future policy decisions.\nUS Treasury yields remain solid with the 10-year yield at 4.086%, influencing gold prices negatively given their inverse relationship. The market currently anticipates an 87% likelihood of a 0.25% rate cut by the Fed, up from 63% a month ago.\nMarket Reaction to Economic Data\nThe ISM Manufacturing PMI decreased to 48.2 in November from 48.7 in October, marking the ninth consecutive month of contraction. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions continue as Russian President Putin made statements concerning the Ukraine conflict, with Ukrainian officials responding negatively.\nTechnically, gold is seeing bearish momentum as it moves towards a daily close under $4,200, which could open pathways to lower support levels. A close above $4,200 would, however, focus attention on potential rebounds toward recent highs.\nGiven the current pullback in gold to below $4,200, we see this primarily as profit-taking before the Federal Reserve\u2019s pivotal meeting next week. The immediate question for us is whether this dip is a buying opportunity or the beginning of a larger correction. The market\u2019s high conviction for a rate cut creates a precarious situation where any disappointment could trigger a significant sell-off.\nThe market is currently pricing in an 87% chance of a rate cut, but we know the Fed committee is sharply divided. This division creates uncertainty and points toward increased volatility in the coming days. This environment is ideal for options strategies, such as straddles, that can profit from a large price move regardless of the direction.\nWe\u2019ve seen this situation before, looking back to late 2023 and early 2024 when markets aggressively priced in Fed cuts that were repeatedly delayed by persistent inflation. For example, expectations for rate cuts in March 2024 were high but ultimately pushed back, causing market turbulence. That historical lesson suggests we should be cautious and not treat the upcoming rate cut as a certainty.\nThe recent ISM Manufacturing PMI reading of 48.2 confirms a ninth straight month of contraction, which strengthens the case for the Fed to ease policy. However, all eyes are now on Friday\u2019s Core PCE inflation report. A higher-than-expected inflation number could completely upend expectations for next week\u2019s meeting and send gold prices tumbling.\nGeopolitical Influence on Gold Prices\nAt the same time, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict provides a solid floor for gold\u2019s price. The latest statements suggest no resolution is near and highlight persistent geopolitical risk. This background tension acts as a form of insurance against a major price collapse and supports a longer-term bullish view on the metal.\nFrom a tactical standpoint, the break below the $4,200 level opens the door for a test of support near the November 25 low of $4,109. Traders with a bearish short-term view could consider buying put options to capitalize on further downside before the Fed\u2019s decision is announced.\nConversely, if we view this pullback as a temporary dip within a larger uptrend, it presents a chance to position for the next move higher. Buying call options or selling put spreads at these levels could be an effective way to play for a rebound toward the recent highs near $4,264 and eventually the all-time highs above $4,381."

This comes after the group spent most of this year increasing oil production.\nFor most of OPEC\u2019s history, the group and its allies met in person a couple times a year to decide the fate of global oil production. Since the pandemic though, OPEC has gone virtual, only meeting monthly for much of the year, usually on Sundays.\n\u201cSo yeah, it ruins your weekend, but hey, it\u2019s fun,\u201d said Jorge Le\u00f3n, an analyst with Rystad Energy.\nHe said OPEC sets production levels so that prices don\u2019t climb too high or fall too low. And next year, the group will hold production steady for a few reasons. For one:\n\u201cGlobal demand tends to follow a seasonal pattern. And the first quarter is when demand is the lowest,\u201d Leon said.\nBecause people travel less. Another reason OPEC ended its streak of increasing output: there\u2019s already an excess of oil on the global market. OPEC has pumped up that excess, to try and win market share.\n\u201cBut after you get to a certain point, then you can lose control of the market, where there\u2019s so much excess oil, that the oil price could start to slide precipitously,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe of NYU.\nWhich OPEC would like to avoid. But Jaffe said they also don\u2019t want prices to rise too high.\n\u201cThey have to think about, you know, sort of Goldilocks,\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cWhat price is not too high that it stimulates more and more electrification.\u201d\nAs in, more people buying EV\u2019s, and driving off into the sunset never to burn gas again, also something the oil cartel wants to avoid. But there are some parts of the oil market that OPEC can\u2019t control. Tom Seng, of Texas Christian University, said emerging non-OPEC producers, like Guyana and Brazil, are likely to boost their output in 2026.\n\u201cThese are fairly new plays. They've gotta start getting revenue in to start paying down the CapEx they deployed on these massive offshore platforms. They've gotta start bringing revenue in fairly quickly,\u201d Seng said.\nGeopolitics could come into play too. A peace deal in Ukraine could add Russian oil to the market, while a conflict in Venezuela could subtract oil, said Le\u00f3n. And then there\u2019s whatever happens with tariffs and trade wars around the world.\nBecause historically, trade activity drives oil demand. Though Le\u00f3n said that connection could weaken as more countries shift toward electrification"

But Jaffe said they also don\u2019t want prices to rise too high.\n\u201cThey have to think about, you know, sort of Goldilocks,\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cWhat price is not too high that it stimulates more and more electrification.\u201d\nAs in, more people buying EV\u2019s, and driving off into the sunset never to burn gas again, also something the oil cartel wants to avoid. But there are some parts of the oil market that OPEC can\u2019t control. Tom Seng, of Texas Christian University, said emerging non-OPEC producers, like Guyana and Brazil, are likely to boost their output in 2026.\n\u201cThese are fairly new plays. They've gotta start getting revenue in to start paying down the CapEx they deployed on these massive offshore platforms. They've gotta start bringing revenue in fairly quickly,\u201d Seng said.\nGeopolitics could come into play too. A peace deal in Ukraine could add Russian oil to the market, while a conflict in Venezuela could subtract oil, said Le\u00f3n. And then there\u2019s whatever happens with tariffs and trade wars around the world.\nBecause historically, trade activity drives oil demand. Though Le\u00f3n said that connection could weaken as more countries shift toward electrification"

                "body": "China Shale Oil Output Outlook Improving\nIn a BMI report sent to Rigzone by the Fitch Group recently, analysts at BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, said China\u2019s outlook for shale oil production is improving on the back of accelerated exploration and a series of new discoveries.\n\u201cState-owned companies are making notable progress in shale oil exploration and production, viewing shale as a key source of future supply as conventional fields mature and face steeper decline rates,\u201d BMI analysts stated in the report.\nThe analysts went on to note that China \u201chas significant potential in shale and tight oil\u201d but said \u201creplicating the U.S. shale boom remains unlikely\u201d.\n\u201cState-owned companies cite abundant tight oil resources in the Ordos, Junggar, Songliao, Sichuan, Qaidam, Santanghu, Jiyang, North Jiangsu, and Bohai Bay basins,\u201d the analysts said in the report.\n\u201cThese firms are incentivized to pursue high-risk, high-cost projects regardless of global oil prices, given national priorities of energy security and self-sufficiency,\u201d they added.\nThe analysts highlighted that the country\u2019s National Energy Administration reported a 30 percent year on year increase in shale oil output in 2024, \u201cto 6.0 million tons (around 120,000 barrels per day)\u201d.\n\u201cAlthough shale currently represents a small share of total production, steady growth is expected,\u201d the BMI analysts stated in the report.\n\u201cMost projects remain pilots with small capacities relative to conventional developments, and production growth will be constrained by challenging geological conditions,\u201d they added.\n\u201cUnlike the U.S., exploiting China\u2019s shale oil and gas resources is more challenging due to the complex and deep reservoir geology, lower reserves scattered across valleys, lower well productivity, and higher costs of production,\u201d they continued.\n\u201cCurrently projects produce small volumes between 10,000 barrels per day and 50,000 barrels per day, far lower than conventional fields like Daqing. Although China has made some progress in producing shale oil, the pace of production growth would remain slow, far less than enough to offset depletion in producing fields,\u201d they said.\nThe analysts went on to note that \u201cprogress in terms of shale oil production could supplement China\u2019s crude oil production\u201d but said \u201cit is unlikely to raise domestic output to a new level\u201d.\n\u201cAchieving higher shale oil production will depend on the commercially viable large-scale production from new discoveries,\u201d the analysts said.\nIn the report, the BMI analysts projected that PetroChina and Sinopec will continue to lead unconventional oil and gas exploration and production, \u201cwith rising investment burdens reflecting limited foreign participation\u201d.\n\u201cInternational companies have shown little interest in shale oil in China, and firms such as Shell and ExxonMobil have scaled back their involvement,\u201d they added.\n\u201cSinopec increased capital expenditure for shale and ultra-deep oil and gas exploration by 30 percent in 2025, lifting spending to CNY8.4 billion [$1.18 billion] in the first three quarters from CNY6.4 billion [905 million] in 2024,\u201d they continued.\n\u201cSinopec\u2019s shale works are concentrated in the Jiyang, North Jiangsu, and Bohai Bay basins, where the company reports breakthroughs in ultra-deep shale oil exploration. The Shengli Jiyang project remains Sinopec\u2019s largest shale asset,\u201d they said.\n\u201cIn September 2025, Sinopec announced the Xinxing and Qintong discoveries in eastern China, with combined proven reserves of 180 million tons. However, we do not expect to see output from these reserves before 2030,\u201d the analysts went on to state.\nThe BMI analysts also noted that shale oil exploration and production are central to PetroChina\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\u201cKey projects include Qingcheng at the Changqing oilfield in the Ordos Basin, Jimsar at the Xinjiang oilfield and Gulong at the Daqing oilfield,\u201d they highlighted.\n\u201cPetroChina produced 5.1 million tons of shale oil in 2024, accounting for about 85 percent of China\u2019"

                "body": "Asia stocks mixed as Fed cut bets lift Japan, S.Korea; Australia Q3 GDP in focus\nThe EUR/USD pair retreated to 1.1612 on Tuesday, pulling back from a recent two-week high. The catalyst for the move was a significant repricing of US interest rate expectations following weak manufacturing data. The ISM Manufacturing Index confirmed a ninth consecutive month of contraction, with the pace of decline the fastest in four months.\nThis data solidified market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. Futures markets now imply an 88% probability of a 25-basis-point reduction at next week\u2019s FOMC meeting.\nIn related news, President Donald Trump announced he has selected a candidate for the next Fed Chair. Media reports suggest the leading contender is Kevin Hassett, the current head of the White House National Economic Council.\nInvestor attention is now focused on an upcoming speech by current Chair Jerome Powell later today, which may offer further clues on the Fed\u2019s policy trajectory.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD\nH4 Chart:\nOn the H4 chart, EUR/USD continues to trade within an established ascending channel. The pair is currently testing a key resistance zone at 1.1655, where buying momentum has met significant selling pressure. A decisive breakout above this level would open the path towards the next major resistance at 1.1730.\nThe Stochastic Oscillator is rising from the middle zone, indicating sustained bullish momentum without overbought conditions. The MACD remains above its zero line, maintaining a stable, albeit weak, buy signal. Conversely, a break and close below the key support at 1.1545 would signal a deeper correction, likely targeting the lower boundary of the current range near 1.1468.\nH1 Chart:\nOn the H1 chart, the pair is undergoing a correction after being rejected from local resistance at 1.1652. Buyers are currently defending the price above the middle Bollinger Band, suggesting short-term bullish control remains intact.\nThe Stochastic Oscillator is in overbought territory (above 80) and is turning down, pointing to a near-term corrective pullback. However, the MACD remains in positive territory, supporting the broader upward bias. This technical picture suggests a brief downward pause is likely, with a potential retest of support in the 1.1600\u20131.1585 zone. A successful hold above this area would increase the probability of a fresh upward impulse, targeting a renewed test of 1.1652 and an eventual push towards 1.1700.\nConclusion\nEUR/USD remains confidently bid, supported by growing expectations of Fed easing. While a short-term technical correction is underway, the broader structure on both the H4 and H1 charts remains constructive. The key for continued upside is a successful defence of the 1.1600\u20131.1585 support zone. A break above 1.1655 would be a significant bullish confirmation, while a failure to hold support could trigger a deeper pullback towards 1.1545.\nBy RoboForex Analytical Department\nDisclaimer: Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author\u2019s particular opinion.

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar Steadies at 1.1610 as Traders Weigh Fed Cut and Eurozone Inflation Surge\nThe euro edges higher against the dollar after German HICP jumps to 2.6% and the U.S. ISM PMI slumps to 48.2. | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar Consolidates Near 1.1600 as Inflation and Fed Expectations Shape Market Momentum\nThe EUR/USD pair remains tightly coiled around the 1.1600 level, reflecting a market caught between divergent central bank outlooks and softening U.S. economic data. During Tuesday\u2019s European session, the pair traded near 1.1610, after touching a two-week peak at 1.1650, as the dollar found temporary support from rising Treasury yields while the euro held firm on optimism around Eurozone inflation resilience. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) recovered to 99.10, stabilizing after a steep drop last week, yet remains 4% below its mid-November high, keeping the euro\u2019s tone slightly constructive.\nEurozone Data Anchors Euro Strength While U.S. Economy Falters\nThe euro\u2019s recent rebound is underpinned by improving regional inflation dynamics. Germany\u2019s HICP rose 2.6% YoY in November, beating expectations of 2.4%, while the bloc-wide CPI is forecast at 2.1% YoY, with core inflation holding near 2.5%. These readings support the ECB\u2019s stance that policy rates are \u201cappropriately restrictive,\u201d with President Christine Lagarde reaffirming that no near-term cuts are planned. By contrast, U.S. data continues to erode the greenback\u2019s advantage. The ISM Manufacturing PMI dropped to 48.2, marking the ninth consecutive month of contraction. New orders and employment indexes both weakened, signaling that industrial demand remains sluggish despite prior fiscal stimulus. The deterioration in factory output raised market odds of a December 25-basis-point Fed rate cut to 87%, up from 71% a week earlier.\nFed Policy Divergence Becomes EUR/USD\u2019s Core Catalyst\nThe Federal Reserve enters its blackout period with the next policy decision due on December 17. Markets anticipate at least one more rate cut this year and multiple through 2026. This dovish bias contrasts with the ECB\u2019s commitment to hold rates steady, giving EUR/USD a medium-term tailwind. Strategically, traders are adjusting positions ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s upcoming remarks. Yield spreads between the U.S. 10-year (4.12%) and German Bund (2.28%) have narrowed to a four-month low of 184 basis points, supporting euro stability. Any confirmation of a December cut could push EUR/USD above 1.1700, especially if Eurozone CPI remains firm.\nGeopolitics and Risk Sentiment Add a Secondary Layer\nLingering geopolitical developments continue to affect the dollar\u2019s safe-haven demand. Progress in Russia-Ukraine ceasefire discussions and relative calm in Middle Eastern energy markets have diminished the dollar\u2019s defensive appeal. The euro, meanwhile, benefits from stronger capital flows into European equities, with the DAX 40 up 1.7% this week and the Euro Stoxx 50 adding 0.9%, as investors price a mild recovery in manufacturing and services output.\nTechnical Landscape: EUR/USD Awaits Breakout Confirmation\nThe EUR/USD pair remains confined within a symmetrical triangle that has narrowed over the past three weeks. The pair\u2019s immediate resistance lies at 1.1656\u20131.1670, while support holds at 1.1542\u20131.1550. A confirmed daily close above 1.1669 would signal a bullish breakout, targeting 1.1720, followed by 1.1830\u2014the upper resistance band identified by long-term moving averages. Conversely, failure to hold above 1.1600 risks a drop toward 1.1550 and possibly the psychological 1.1500 floor. The 20-day EMA sits near 1.1605, while the 100-day SMA converges with the 200-day SMA at 1.1520, forming a major support cluster. The RSI remains neutral around 56, indicating room for directional extension. Momentum oscillators hint at latent upside pressure, though a decisive catalyst is still required.\nShort-Term Trading Dynamics Reflect Market Indecision\nIntrada"

                "body": "US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY\nThe USD fell quickly to start the week but bulls showed up at a key spot \u2013 just above the 98.98 Fibonacci level that held the prior higher-low. That led to a strong bounce yesterday with a large push starting around the US open, and that came along with a pullback in EUR/USD as the pair held yet another lower-high, just inside of the 1.1656 level that marked lower-high resistance in late-November.\nThe weekly open was a tumble in the USD to go along with a hit to stocks and a sell-off in Bitcoin, but we\u2019ve seen matters recover in each market and there remains widespread expectation that the Fed will cut rates again at their meeting next week. The bigger question, however is what\u2019s in store for next year as there\u2019s still the expectation for another 50 or 75 bps in cuts even though the Fed has been evasive around the topic. Next Wednesday, however, there will be nowhere to hide as the bank is also issuing updated guidance via the dot plot matrix and that will show where the bank expects to guide rates for next year.\nThis is, of course, with the opacity of lacking data and that\u2019s something that unfortunately will have to wait for 2026 to rectify. But if we do see inflation flare higher that\u2019s going to be problematic, for both equities and other risk markets.\nIn the USD, the move so far this week has been telling. The currency dipped down towards the 99 level with buyers coming in to hold a higher-low above the swing from a few weeks ago, thereby holding a higher-low. Then underside wick is attractive for bulls but the fact that yesterday couldn\u2019t close in the green thereby disallowing a hammer formation is a factor that must be considered. As I said in the webinar, I expect this to be a difficult backdrop for trends given that the Fed is in the blackout window.\nUS Dollar Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nI remain of the mind that the key for USD trends rests with the Euro. And interestingly, as we had USD bulls respond to higher-low support yesterday, we also had EUR/USD bears hold yet another lower-high, with price coming a mere 3.9 pips away from the previous swing high.\nOn a shorter-term basis, however, there remains a bullish trend and I looked at the familiar 1.1593 level as support in the webinar which has since held. This keeps bulls aligned on the four-hour and two-hour charts and this sets up a possible re-test of resistance around the 1.1650 area.\nEUR/USD Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/USD\nI\u2019ve been tracking GBP/USD as a more attractive venue for USD-weakness than EUR/USD above, and the fact that the pair pushed in a higher-high, even as EUR/USD has remained below the mid-November swing high remains a notable item.\nAt the time of the webinar, there was also a spot of support in play in GBP/USD and that has since held into a bounce, and that\u2019s taken from a prior level of support-turned-resistance at 1.3186. Overhead, 1.3250 remains initial resistance with 1.3287 followed by 1.3328.\nGBP/USD Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/JPY\nFor USD-strength I still think USD/JPY is one of the more attractive major pairs, which, deductively, can be interpreted as interest for both EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY to avoid USD dynamics as we sit about a week away from the Fed.\nBut last week I looked at support in the 154.45-155.00 area and that so far has held a clean test, with buyers defending the big figure so far. I looked at that zone in the Friday article and, so far, it\u2019s held up.\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\n--- written by James Stanley, Senior Market Analyst, Global Macro\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

This delicate equilibrium reflects not stability, but tension \u2014 a currency tug-of-war shaped by slowing U.S. manufacturing data, collapsing inflation in the U.K., and the strongest cross-Atlantic policy divergence since early 2023. Both central banks are under pressure to ease, and traders are positioning for simultaneous cuts that could reshape global FX risk in December.\nFed Weakness Pushes USD Lower as Manufacturing Contraction Deepens\nThe U.S. ISM Manufacturing PMI slumped to 48.2 in November, marking its ninth straight month below 50, confirming an entrenched contraction across the industrial base. Employment within the index fell sharply to 44.0, while Prices Paid spiked to 58.5, signaling stagflationary undertones. The weak print, combined with softer labor data \u2014 Non-Farm Payrolls of 155,000 versus 180,000 expected \u2014 has cemented expectations of a 0.25% Federal Reserve rate cut at the December 9\u201310 FOMC meeting, now priced in with 87.4% probability. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) trades near 99.40, down from 100.80 two weeks ago, reinforcing structural dollar softness ahead of the Fed decision.\nPound Sterling Under Pressure Despite Autumn Budget Relief\nThe British Pound (GBP) remains capped near $1.3270, unable to extend gains despite a positive Autumn Budget reception. The relief rally was short-lived as markets priced in a 90% probability of a Bank of England rate cut at the December 18 meeting. Inflation has cooled from 4.5% in August to 3.1% in October 2025, reducing the urgency for tight policy. However, this disinflation also raises fears of a premature slowdown. The BoE faces a policy dilemma: maintain high rates and risk a deeper recession, or cut too early and reignite price pressures. Traders are increasingly betting on the former, keeping Sterling volatile but capped within a $1.3190\u2013$1.3310 range.\nTechnical Landscape: Key Battle Around the 50-Day SMA\nThe GBP/USD chart shows a defined rising channel since late November, supported near $1.3190 and resisted around $1.3310. The 21-day Simple Moving Average sits at 1.3149, providing dynamic short-term support. Meanwhile, the 50-day SMA at 1.3270 remains the critical ceiling \u2014 a level repeatedly rejected since mid-October. The 100-day SMA at 1.3369 and 200-day SMA at 1.3318 converge above, forming a dense resistance cluster that limits upside momentum. The RSI (14) stabilizes near 51.5, reflecting a neutral market with potential for a breakout upon a decisive close above 1.3275. A slide below 1.3145 would open the door to 1.3100, the lower trendline from early November.\nMarket Sentiment: Dual Easing Cycle Fuels Volatility Premium\nBoth the Fed and BoE are signaling readiness to pivot, creating a rare double easing cycle where timing, not direction, dictates price movement. Traders are now hedging GBP/USD volatility through short-dated options \u2014 one-week implied volatility jumped to 10.8%, its highest since July. The pair\u2019s current positioning favors tactical long exposure ahead of the Fed decision but short-covering after the BoE announcement. The \u201crace to cut\u201d dynamic mirrors the 2008\u201309 coordinated easing phase, where the less dovish central bank\u2019s currency eventually gained dominance. The pair\u2019s beta to Treasury yields remains high, with a 10-year U.S. yield decline to 3.91% adding downward momentum to the dollar.\nComparative Strength: GBP Outperforms Euro and Yen, But Faces Dollar Headwinds\nThe Pound Sterling has risen 0.67% against the euro "

Technical signals reinforce the upside bias, but the next 48 hours bring heavy event risk: Australia\u2019s GDP and household spending data, RBA commentary, and key U.S. releases including ADP employment and ISM services. Add speculation over the next Fed Chair, and the stage is set for volatility. Traders should watch whether the breakout holds as fundamentals take centre stage.\nRate Recalibration, Risk Appetite Fuel Breakout\nTo begin with, the following graphic looks at the correlation AUD/USD has seen with traditional drivers over the past week (middle pane) and month (right-hand pane), such as the offshore Chinese yuan, rate differentials between Australia and the U.S., along with Nasdaq 100 and copper futures\u2014the latter two used as proxies for risk and cyclical appetite.\nSource: TradingView\nWhat\u2019s clear over both timeframes is that risk appetite has been a key influence on the Aussie\u2019s recent outperformance, sitting with correlation coefficients with Nasdaq futures of 0.93 and 0.75 respectively. There has also been a reasonable relationship with cyclical assets such as copper, while short-dated rate differentials have also seen a strong positive correlation over the past week.\nThe broader read-through is that if you\u2019re trading AUD/USD, keep a close eye on the performance of riskier asset classes and incoming economic data that could influence the outlook for interest rates in both Australia and the U.S.\nMajor Event Risk Looms Large\nLooking at the economic calendar, there\u2019s ample event risk on both sides of the Pacific to end the week, headlined by Q3 GDP and household spending data in Australia and ADP employment, ISM services, and belatedly released incomes, consumption and core inflation figures in the States.\nSource: TradingView\nIn Australia, the key information in the GDP report is not the headline growth rate. Instead, detail on household consumption, household savings, and unit labour costs (productivity) is far more important for the RBA, providing insights into what influence the largest and most important part of the economy is having on the growth and inflation outlook. For the same reasons, the household spending data released 24 hours later will also be crucial.\nIt\u2019s not on the calendar, but RBA Governor Michele Bullock will appear before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee from 9am AEDT on Wednesday. While that\u2019s before the national accounts are released, keep a lookout for comments made after the GDP details have been made public for hints on possible policy implications.\nSource: Bloomberg\nBefore the Aussie data deluge, swaps traders have all but abandoned expectations for further rate cuts from the RBA, attaching almost zero risk of further easing before the risk of rate hikes begins to emerge from the middle of 2026. With inflation currently accelerating away from the RBA target, further strength in activity data\u2014without evidence of a meaningful pickup in productivity\u2014will likely see the timing and scale of rate hikes brought forward. Weakness in the data would likely see the opposite reaction, of course.\nIn the States, Wednesday\u2019s ADP national employment report and ISM services PMI\u2014both for November\u2014loom as the key events in the absence of top-tier and timely official data, which will begin to arrive in December. Also keep an eye out for any official statements on who will replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair next year.

                "body": "Australian Dollar advances to its highest level since late October vs weaker USD\n- The Australian Dollar shrugs off a disappointing Q3 GDP print amid the RBA\u2019s hawkish tilt.\n- Rising December Fed rate cut bets continue to undermine the USD and support AUD/USD.\n- Traders now look forward to the US ADP report and ISM Services PMI for a fresh impetus.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) prolongs a two-week-old uptrend against a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD) and climbs to its highest level since late October during the Asian session on Wednesday. Diminishing odds for more policy easing by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) offset the disappointing Australian economic growth figures and turn out to be a key factor that continues to underpin the Aussie.\nApart from this, a generally positive tone around the equity markets acts as a tailwind for the risk-sensitive AUD, which seems unaffected by China's unimpressive Services PMI. The USD, on the other hand, hangs near its lowest level in over two weeks amid bets that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates next week. This contributes to the bid tone surrounding the AUD/USD pair and favors bullish traders.\nAustralian Dollar buying remains unabated as RBA's hawkish tilt offsets dismal Q3 GDP growth figures\n- The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported this Wednesday that the economy grew by 0.4% during the July-September period, down from the 0.6% rise seen in the second quarter. The annual Gross Domestic Product growth rate stood at 2.1% compared to 1.8% in the previous quarter. Both the quarterly and the yearly print missed expectations, prompting some intraday selling around the Australian Dollar during the Asian session.\n- Speaking before a parliamentary committee earlier today, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock said that the central bank is looking very hard at recent inflation numbers to see if some of the price pressures are temporary. Bullock added that if inflation proves to be persistent, it would have implications for future monetary policy. This dampens hopes for more policy easing and lends support to the Aussie.\n- In fact, Australia's headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerated from a 3.5% increase reported in the previous month to 3.8% YoY in October. Moreover, the RBA Trimmed Mean CPI rose 3.3% during the reported month from 3.2% in September. This indicated that inflation remains above the RBA\u2019s 2% to 3% annual target and raises questions about just how much headroom the central bank has to cut rates further.\n- The latest data published by RatingDog showed that China's Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 52.1 in November from 52.6 in October. This, however, was better than consensus estimates for a reading of 52 and does little to dent the underlying bullish sentiment surrounding the China-proxy AUD.\n- The US Dollar hangs near its lowest level since November 14, touched on Monday, amid dovish Federal Reserve expectations, and contributes to limiting the downside for the AUD/USD pair. According to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, traders are pricing in a nearly 90% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut on December 10. Moreover, speculations of a dovish pick for the next Fed Chair undermine the Greenback.\n- Meanwhile, the prospects for lower US interest rates, along with hopes for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, remain supportive of a generally positive tone around the equity markets. This further dents the safe-haven buck and benefits the risk-sensitive Aussie. Traders now look to the release of the US ADP report on private-sector employment and the US ISM Services PMI for a fresh impetus.\n- The market attention, however, will remain glued to the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, due on Friday, which will be scrutinized for cues about the Fed's future rate-cut path. This, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the USD and determining the next leg of a directional move for the AUD/USD pair. The fund"

                "body": "AUD/USD steady ahead of GDP as markets reassess the RBA outlook\nAustralian GDP growth is tipped to rise with hotter inflation leading the markets to price in the chance of an RBA hike in the near future.The latest Australian GDP data for the September quarter will be released on Wednesday, 3rd of December, 2025.\nEconomists tip a lift in Australia growth in September quarter\nConsensus expectations point to quarterly GDP growth of around 0.6\u20130.7%, lifting annual growth to roughly 2.2%. While still subdued, this would mark an improvement from earlier in the year and reflects tentative improvements in household activity. Real household consumption had been under pressure from high rates, but the sector has shown signs of improving following rate cuts from the RBA. Retail spending has stopped deteriorating, and wage gains are providing a little more support than earlier in the tightening cycle, with real wages growing modestly.\nInflation re-accelerates above the RBA\u2019s target band\nThe GDP release arrives at a time when inflation momentum is turning higher again. The September-quarter CPI print surprised to the upside, and the latest monthly indicator rose to 3.8%, pushing inflation back above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target band. Price pressures remain concentrated in services, where demand is still firm, while housing-related inflation continues to be driven by strong population growth and ongoing constraints on supply.\n(Source: Trading Economics)\nDespite below-trend GDP growth, inflation has proven persistent. Typically, softer demand would be expected to ease price pressures, but Australia\u2019s supply-side constraints are amplifying the inflationary impulse. The most notable issue is extremely weak productivity growth, which has limited the economy\u2019s capacity to absorb demand without generating additional inflation. This means that even modest household and business spending is translating into higher prices rather than higher output.\nThis dynamic \u2014 low growth but insufficient supply \u2014 explains why the RBA is finding it harder than expected to return inflation to target. The economy is operating below potential, but potential itself has grown slowly because productivity has been stagnant for several years. With demand running ahead of the economy\u2019s constrained capacity, inflation remains sticky across key categories.\nRates markets shift toward the risk of another RBA hike\nA month ago, rates markets were confidently leaning toward RBA rate cuts in late 2025. But the recent inflation surprises and the firming in the monthly CPI series have triggered a meaningful repricing. Futures curves now imply that the next move from the RBA could be a hike, reflecting concern that the central bank may not have done enough to ensure inflation\u2019s return to target in a reasonable timeframe.\n(Source: Bloomberg, ASX, Capital.com)\nFor the AUD/USD, the GDP result will be an important catalyst. A stronger-than-expected print reinforcing the hawkish repricing could offer support to the currency, particularly if US yields stabilise. But a weak outcome \u2014 or signs that household momentum is fading again \u2014 would likely unwind some of the tightening premium now priced into the curve and weigh on the Aussie heading into year-end.\nThere is also the matter of the US Dollar, which has pulled back recently because of expectations of a looming US Federal Reserve rate cut. If the Dollar reverses, perhaps because a cut doesn\u2019t materialise, or because the central bank delivers a hawkish cut at its next meeting, that could also weigh on the AUD/USD\nFrom a technical perspective in the short-term, the AUD/USD remains in a downtrend, marked by higher-lows and lower-lows. The pair does remain above its 200-day moving average, having sustained an uptrend for much of 2025. A break above 0.6620 could indicate a reversal of this short-term downtrend. Meanwhile, a push below 0.6420 could signal further bearish and a deeper downtrend.\n(Source: Trading View)\n(Past performance is not a reliab"

                "body": "USD/JPY remains on the back foot below 156.00; BoJ-Fed policy divergence favors bears\n- USD/JPY trades with a mild negative bias and is pressured by a combination of factors.\n- BoJ rate hike bets underpin the JPY and weigh amid dovish Fed-inspired USD weakness.\n- A positive risk tone caps gains for the safe-haven JPY and limits losses ahead of US data.\nThe USD/JPY pair struggles to capitalize on the previous day's move higher to levels beyond the 156.00 mark and edges lower during the Asian session on Wednesday. Spot prices currently trade around the 155.75 region, though the downtick lacks follow-through or a bearish conviction.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) continues with its relative outperformance on the back of rising bets for an interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The expectations were lifted by BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments earlier this week, saying that the likelihood of the central bank's economic and price projections being met is rising. This was seen as the strongest signal that conditions for a rate hike were falling into place, which underpins the JPY and weighs on the USD/JPY pair.\nThe US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, struggles to attract any meaningful buyers and languishes near its lowest level since November 14, touched on Monday, amid the growing acceptance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut rates next week. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to the BoJ's hawkish outlook, which should continue to drive flows towards the lower-yielding JPY and suggests that the path of least resistance for the USD/JPY pair is to the downside.\nThat said, a generally positive risk tone is holding back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the safe-haven JPY. Investors also opt to wait for this week's important US macro releases before positioning for the next leg of a directional move. Wednesday's US economic docket features the release of the ADP report on private-sector employment and the ISM Services PMI. The focus, however, remains on the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index on Friday.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation. The BoJ\u2019s policy led to a widening differential with other currencies, dragging down the value of the Yen. This trend partly reversed in 2024, when the BoJ decided to abandon its ultra-loose policy stance.\nA weaker Yen and the spike in global energy prices led to an increase in Japanese inflation, which exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. The prospect of rising salaries in the country \u2013 a key element fuelling inflation \u2013 also contributed to the move.\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Forecast - Yen Rallies as BoJ Turns Hawkish and Fed Rate Cuts Loom\nThe USD/JPY (Dollar/Yen) pair trades at 155.20, reversing sharply from 158.00, as Governor Ueda\u2019s hawkish comments fuel bets on a BoJ December hike while the Fed faces pressure to cut amid a 48.2 PMI contraction | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY (Dollar/Yen) Battles Between Policy Shifts and Yield Pressures as 155.00 Becomes Pivotal Zone\nThe USD/JPY pair trades under heavy scrutiny near 155.20, down from its late-November swing high at 158.00, as investors recalibrate positions ahead of key central-bank decisions in both the U.S. and Japan. The pair has shed nearly 0.7% in the past 24 hours, marking its sharpest daily drop since mid-October. The volatility stems from renewed hawkish signals out of Tokyo and rising speculation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could deliver its first rate hike in more than a decade at the December 18\u201319 meeting, while the Federal Reserve leans toward its first rate cut cycle beginning December 9\u201310.\nJapanese Yields Surge and the Yen Awakens from Multi-Year Weakness\nThe yield on the 10-year Japanese Government Bond has surged to a 17-year high, while the 2-year JGB touched 1.0%, its highest level since 2008, as traders priced in nearly an 80% probability of a December hike \u2014 up from 60% just a week ago. The 30-year yield climbed to fresh records on Tuesday, signaling the BoJ\u2019s implicit acceptance of tighter policy. Governor Kazuo Ueda intensified the move with remarks that the probability of Japan meeting its inflation and wage targets \u201chas risen materially,\u201d warning that delaying tightening could \u201crisk an inflation overshoot.\u201d These comments broke months of dovish ambiguity and sent the yen rallying across major pairs. The resulting surge in Japanese yields is squeezing the long-running yen-funded carry trade, forcing leveraged positions to unwind and pressuring speculative markets globally.\nUSD/JPY (Dollar/Yen) Faces Carry-Trade Unwind as U.S. Dollar Momentum Fades\nThe pair\u2019s reversal below 155.75 \u2014 a key channel resistance \u2014 reflects a clear shift in market dynamics. Traders that had relied on ultra-cheap yen funding are now facing rising JGB yields, making dollar-long positions costlier to maintain. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) trades near 99.43, up just 0.08%, showing limited strength as rate-cut expectations climb. Fed funds futures imply an 88% probability of a 25-basis-point cut in December, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hover near 3.92%, far below October\u2019s 4.88% peak. The narrowing yield differential between U.S. and Japan has compressed one of USD/JPY\u2019s most reliable bullish engines.\nMacro Data Weakens the Dollar Narrative\nThe latest ISM Manufacturing PMI fell again to 48.2, the ninth straight contraction, with new orders and employment both softening. Production rose modestly, but demand remains weak. At the same time, the Core PCE Index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, is projected at 0.2% MoM, a mild enough print to keep dovish pressure alive. The slowdown is evident across job metrics too: ADP payrolls are expected flat to slightly negative, and Challenger job cuts could show another rise, underscoring labor-market cooling. Such data adds weight to the argument that the Fed has completed its tightening cycle and may cut rates sooner than previously priced.\nBOJ Hawkish Shift Versus Fed Dovish Tilt Redefines the Spread\nThe divergence between the two central banks is now the defining catalyst for USD/JPY. The Fed\u2019s tone, coupled with softer data, implies easing into early 2026, while the BoJ\u2019s rhetoric hints at normalization. The rate gap \u2014 once above 500 basis points \u2014 is shrinking fast. Traders now expect Japan to move its policy rate from \u20130.1% to 0%, possibly by December, while U.S. benchmark rates could fall from 5.25% to 5.00% this month. The narrowing spread effectively removes the structural tailwind for the dollar and sets the stage for continued downside pressure on USD/JPY through De"

                "body": "USD/JPY briefly reclaimed the 156 handle on Tuesday, December 2, as 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields eased back from the previous day\u2019s 2008 highs. The drop in JGB yields calmed concerns about a yen carry trade unwind, sending USD/JPY higher for the day.\nOn Wednesday, December 3, Japanese Services PMI data fueled speculation about a December Bank of Japan rate hike. Service sector activity and price trends remain key considerations for BoJ interest rate decisions. Rising bets on a BoJ rate hike clash with expectations of a Fed rate cut, supporting a short- to medium-term bearish USD/JPY outlook.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nThe S&P Global Japan PMI increased from 53.1 in October to 53.2 in November, up from the preliminary 53.1 reading. November\u2019s PMI survey signaled a pickup in economic momentum, given that services account for roughly 70% of Japan\u2019s GDP. While the headline PMI influences yen demand, several sub-components are likely to bolster bets on a December BoJ rate hike. These include:\nLabor market and inflation trends are crucial. Typically, rising employment and higher wages boost domestic consumption and fuel demand-driven inflation, supporting a more hawkish BoJ policy stance.\nFurthermore, optimism across the sector improved mid-way through Q4, signaling a robust demand outlook.\nNovember\u2019s PMI came as Japanese labor unions have started negotiating wage hikes for 2026. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda underscored the significance of wage growth. Governor Ueda hinted at an imminent rate hike, citing rising wages, easing US tariff risks, and FX sensitivity.\nLooking at the five-minute chart, USD/JPY briefly dropped to a post-Services PMI release low of 155.662 before edging higher. Price action aligned with rising bets on a December BoJ rate hike, supporting a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nWhile Japan\u2019s Services PMI data supported bets on a BoJ rate hike, US Services PMI data will likely influence the Fed\u2019s post-December rate path.\nEconomists forecast the ISM Services PMI to fall from 52.4 in October to 52.1 in November. A sharper drop in the headline PMI would signal a loss of economic momentum, given that services account for around 80% of US GDP. However, traders should also consider employment and price trends. Slower sector activity, rising job cuts, and higher prices may revive stagflation jitters and challenge bets on post-December Fed rate cuts.\nRising stagflation risks and a hawkish BoJ rate path align with my short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nCrucially, there are no FOMC member speeches to influence sentiment, with the Fed Blackout Period in effect until December 11, limiting Fed-driven volatility.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a December cut stand at 89.2% on December 2, up from 86.4% on December 1. Meanwhile, the probability of a January rate cut edged up from 23.0% to 25.7%. Sentiment toward first-quarter rate cuts will be key, given that markets are expecting BoJ and Fed policy adjustments in December.\nLooking at the daily chart, USD/JPY traded above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), affirming a bullish bias. However, fundamentals have begun to shift from the technical trend, supporting a bearish outlook.\nA drop below the 155 support level would open the door to testing the 50-day EMA. If breached, the 153 support level would be the next key support. Crucially, a break below the 50-day EMA would indicate a bearish trend reversal, suggesting a near-term fall toward 150.\nIn my view, the Japanese PMI data support a bearish short- to medium-term outlook. A USD/JPY drop below the 50-day EMA will likely bolster the case for a sharper decline toward 150 and the 200-day EMA, bringing 140 into view over an extended horizon.\nHowever, upside risks linger, including:\nDespite the upside risks, yen intervention warnings will likely cap upside around"

A recent pullback in Crude prices, Canada\u2019s main export, and a cautious market mood are offsetting hopes of immediate Fed cuts and providing some support to the US Dollar.\nOil prices have lost nearly $1 after pulling back from $59.85 high on Monday, to trade at the $59.00 area at the time of writing, as the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, heads to Moscow to talk about peace in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe pair, however, remains well below the November 21 peak, near 1.4150. Upbeat Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures from Canada released on Friday prompted investors to reassess their bets on a Bank of Canada interest rate cut next week and sent the Canadian Dollar surging.\nIn the US, by contrast, manufacturing activity data, as measured by the US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, showed that the sector contracted for the ninth consecutive month. Furthermore, new orders declined, highlighting the downbeat near-term prospects, while employment fell and the Prices Paid Index rose.\nThese figures add pressure on the US Federal Reserve to lower borrowing costs further in the coming months. Investors are pricing in a nearly 90% chance of a quarter-point rate cut next week and two or three more cuts next year. This is triggering a CAD-supportive monetary policy divergence and acting as a headwind for US Dollar rallies.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy a"

The pair has returned to the upper range of the 205.00s and is trading at 205.85 in the early London trading session, retracing losses from a nearly 0.7% sell-off to the 205.20 lows on Monday.\nComments from the Governour of the Bank of Japan (BoJ), Kazuho Ueda, affirming that the bank is contemplating the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of hiking interest rates in December, rattled markets, pushing the Japanese Yen higher acrross the board.\nA well-received Japanese Government Bond auction on Tuesday has somewhat soothed markets, pushing the Yen lower against its main peers and providing some support to the Sterling. Market sentiment, however, remains cautious, which is keeping the Pound from rallying further for now.\nIn the UK, the Bank of England released its Financial Stability report earlier on Tuesday. The BoE warned about the higher risks of a stock market crash amid the \u201cmaterially stretched\u201d valuations of AI companies and the use of debt to finance the sector. The impact on the pound, however, has been marginal.\nThe economic docket for the UK and Japan is thin on Tuesday, but growing hopes that the BoJ will tighten its monetary policy in December or January, and recent intervention warnings by Japanese officials are likely to keep the Yen supported this week.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and copywriter in diverse Forex-related firms, like FXStreet and Kantox."

                "body": "The British Pound has weakened against the Japanese Yen due to hawkish comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda. At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is trading near a five-day low of 205.25.\nGovernor Ueda indicated that a December rate hike is still being considered, which increased market expectations. His comments led traders to increase the odds of a December 18-19 rate hike to 80%, up from 60% a week earlier.\nMarket Response To BoJ Governor\u2019s Comments\nJapan\u2019s 10-year government bond yield surged above 1.85% following Ueda\u2019s remarks, the highest since July 2006. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.2 in November, the first time it surpassed 50 in over a year.\nDespite this PMI increase, Sterling received limited support, showing ongoing business uncertainty. Traders are watching for upcoming remarks from a Bank of England policymaker and the Financial Stability Report.\nThe Bank of Japan has historically engaged in ultra-loose monetary policy to stimulate the economy. Recent decisions to unwind this policy have strengthened the Yen, reversing trends observed in previous years. This shift is partly due to rising Japanese inflation and wage expectations.\nThe Bank of Japan is signaling a clear shift in policy, with Governor Ueda\u2019s comments suggesting a rate hike is likely at the December 18-19 meeting. We should now position for continued Yen strength against the Pound. This fundamentally alters the trading landscape for JPY pairs which has been dominated by a weak Yen for years.\nStrategic Positioning For GBP/JPY\nGiven the increased probability of a sharp move, we are looking at options to position for a lower GBP/JPY. Buying put options on the pair offers a defined-risk way to profit from further Yen appreciation leading into the BoJ meeting. One-month implied volatility for GBP/JPY has surged past 14%, a level we haven\u2019t seen since the policy shift back in the spring of 2025, reflecting market anticipation.\nThe broader market is already reacting to this potential shift away from the ultra-loose policies of the last decade. Looking at the latest CFTC data from last Friday, speculative net short positions on the Yen saw their most significant weekly decrease since the third quarter of 2025. This is happening as recent reports show major Japanese corporations are considering average wage increases of over 4.5% for 2026, a key factor for the BoJ.\nWhile the UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI finally climbing above 50 is a positive domestic sign, it is being overshadowed by the BoJ\u2019s powerful monetary policy narrative. Sterling\u2019s own fundamentals are taking a backseat as the interest rate differential between the UK and Japan is poised to narrow. Therefore, we see any strength in the Pound as a selling opportunity in the GBP/JPY pair for now.\nThis is a stark reversal from the 2022-2024 period when the wide policy divergence between the BoJ and other central banks made shorting the Yen a very crowded trade. We must now closely watch for any further guidance from either the BoJ or the Bank of England ahead of their mid-December meetings. The primary focus remains on the December 18-19 BoJ decision, which will be the main driver of this pair."

However, the inability of the currency to respond is worrying says McQueen.\n\"For recent yen buyers this is a concerning development, given that if the currency struggles to sustain a bid on good news, then risks are much more clearly on the downside,\" he explains.\nHe says the glacial pace at which the BoJ has been raising interest rates means that the hawkish BoJ trade alone is not enough to materially support the currency.\n\"This is not expected to change anytime soon, even if the central bank hikes in December,\" he adds."

That limitation effectively sidelined more than 15,000 advisers during a period when demand for digital assets was accelerating.\nMore broadly, the move places Bank of America in the same camp as peers that have recently formalized crypto allocation guidance.\nMorgan Stanley issued a 2%\u20134% recommendation for \"opportunistic portfolios\" in October, while BlackRock has often argued for a 1%\u20132% bitcoin allocation.

Nevertheless, big banks like JPMorgan and Standard Chartered have reaffirmed long-term bullish outlooks for crypto\u2019s largest asset.

By contrast, stablecoins giants like USDT and USDC are primarily held in Binance-related wallets, indicating their use in trading pairs, with Aave holdings coming in further down the list.\nDespite this latest milestone, RLUSD is still small compared with leading USD-pegged stablecoins. Tether\u2019s USDT leads the pack with over $184 billion in circulating supply, followed by Circle\u2019s USDC with $77.5 billion. As of press time, RLUSD is ranked 10th among USD stablecoins by market cap with a supply of $1.26 billion, according to CoinGecko.\nRLUSD\u2019s growth on Ethereum comes months after Ripple acquired the stablecoin platform Rail for $200 million.

The protocol allows nodes to verify that blob data exists by sampling small pieces rather than downloading entire blobs.\nThat removes a scaling bottleneck introduced by EIP-4844 and creates a path to push blob throughput up by roughly an order of magnitude over time.\nHigher blob capacity translates directly into cheaper layer-two transaction fees, as rollups compress user transactions into blobs and post them to Ethereum\u2019s base layer.\nFusaka also raises the default gas limit per block to 60 million gas, up from the 30 million configuration set after the Merge.\nThe increase doubles the L1 block gas budget, providing more room for both standard transactions and blob processing.\nTwo follow-on \u201cBlob Parameter Only\u201d forks, BPO1 on Dec. 9 and BPO2 on Jan. 7, will adjust blob parameters without additional code changes, further expanding capacity.\nBlob fee market rewired\nEIP-7918 ties the minimum blob base fee to execution gas, preventing blob prices from collapsing to near zero while L1 gas remains expensive.\nThe change keeps the data-availability market economically rational as usage fluctuates. Previously, blob fees could diverge sharply from execution costs, creating arbitrage opportunities and distorting rollup economics.\nA set of related Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) hardens several heavy opcodes and transaction limits. The EIPs are 7823, 7825, 7883, and 7934.\nThe proposals cap ModExp precompile input sizes, raise its gas cost, introduce a transaction gas limit ceiling, and enforce an RLP block size limit. These constraints reduce denial-of-service attack surface and make worst-case client workloads more predictable.\nDeveloper tools and cryptographic hooks\nEIP-7939 introduces a count-leading-zeros opcode that makes bit-manipulation, integer logarithms, and randomness logic cheaper and simpler on-chain.\nThe addition benefits DeFi protocols and cryptographic contracts that rely on efficient bitwise operations.\nDeterministic proposer lookahead, specified in EIP-7917, gives validators a fixed schedule of who will propose blocks.\nMEV relays and staking operators can use the more precise timeline to coordinate more safely and efficiently, reducing uncertainty in block-production workflows.\nEIP-7951 adds a native precompile for the secp256r1 curve, the same cryptographic standard used by Apple Secure Enclave, Android Keystore, and WebAuthn.\nWallets and smart account schemes can now verify passkey-style signatures directly on Ethereum, enabling FaceID and TouchID authentication flows without custom bridges or circuits.\nThe precompile removes a major friction point for consumer-facing applications that rely on biometric hardware.\nImmediate and phased rollout\nFusaka activates at block height on Dec. 3, with the first blob-parameter adjustment following six days later. BPO2 lands Jan. 7, completing the initial capacity expansion.\nThe phased rollout allows node operators and rollup teams to monitor blob usage and client performance before the next parameter increase.\nThe upgrade does not introd"

This increases revenue potential, enhances decentralization and gives operators more control over accepted order flow.\nBy integrating Harmonic, DeFi Development, the first public company with a treasury strategy focused on accumulating and compounding Solana, gains three key advantages. First, it can automatically select the most valuable block in each slot, boosting validator efficiency and increasing staking revenue.\nSecond, the system provides greater transparency and control, allowing DeFi Development to set builder preferences consistent with its responsibilities as a public company.

                "body": "Solana (SOL) is a Layer\u20111 blockchain designed for high throughput and low transaction costs. As of late 2025, Solana has a market capitalization exceeding $14 billion and daily trading volumes averaging $1.2\u2013$1.5 billion. Its ecosystem encompasses decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized applications (dApps), and staking platforms.\nThis article provides a data-driven assessment of Solana\u2019s network, adoption, historical performance, and tokenomics. By analyzing network metrics, staking trends, DeFi and NFT activity, and macroeconomic factors, we aim to offer a grounded perspective on Solana\u2019s potential price trajectory, without speculative guarantees.\nKey Takeaways\n- Network Throughput: Solana consistently achieves 1,000+ transactions per second (TPS) with near-constant uptime, supporting large-scale dApp activity.\n- Token Utility: SOL functions primarily as a utility token for transaction fees and staking, not as a speculative instrument alone.\n- Ecosystem Growth: DeFi and NFT activity continue to expand, with rising institutional and retail participation.\n- Market Context: SOL\u2019s price remains influenced by Bitcoin and Ethereum trends, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory developments.\n- Investment Considerations: High throughput, staking rewards, and ecosystem adoption support SOL\u2019s utility, but price outcomes are subject to volatility and external factors.\nSolana Network Fundamentals\nPoH + PoS: Architecture and Efficiency\nSolana\u2019s combination of Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) is central to its high-speed transaction capabilities. PoH functions as a cryptographic timestamping system, allowing validators to process transactions more efficiently by providing a verifiable historical record. PoS secures consensus through token staking, incentivizing network participants to maintain reliability.\nThis dual mechanism allows Solana to:\n- Confirm transactions in less than 400 milliseconds under normal load.\n- Process thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost (~$0.00025 per transaction).\n- Scale for sudden spikes in demand, such as major NFT drops, while maintaining operational integrity.\nNetwork Metrics (2025)\nAnalysis:\nSolana ranks among the fastest operational Layer-1 networks, sustaining ~1,100 TPS under typical conditions. Its profile differs from competitors:\n- Aptos: Higher theoretical throughput, but limited real-world validation.\n- Avalanche: Strong uptime, lower base-layer TPS, relies on subnet scaling.\n- Near: Comparable reliability with lower hardware demands.\nSolana\u2019s ~99.9% uptime over 16 months is competitive, though stress periods reveal sensitivity to spikes in non-vote transactions. Monitoring validator distribution and throughput stability remains important for assessing long-term reliability.\nOperational Demands and Decentralization Impact\nHigh throughput comes with elevated hardware requirements\u2014multi-core CPUs, large memory, and high disk I/O. These demands:\n- enable Solana\u2019s low-latency performance,\n- but raise the entry barrier relative to networks like Near or Cosmos,\n- contributing to validator concentration among well-capitalized operators.\nValidator Distribution and Hardware Requirements\nValidators are geographically diverse but concentrated in regions with strong data-center infrastructure (primarily North America and Western Europe). The need for high-performance hardware and stable bandwidth shapes decentralization dynamics by favoring technically equipped participants.\nTokenomics and Supply Analysis\nSOL\u2019s Utility\nSOL primarily functions as a utility token:\n- Transaction fees: Every transaction on Solana requires SOL to be burned or paid to validators.\n- Staking: Validators and delegators stake SOL to secure the network, earning annual yields (~6\u20137%).\n- Ecosystem participation: SOL is used in DeFi protocols, governance, and NFT marketplaces.\nThe token\u2019s utility ensures that real network activity underpins demand, rather than speculative hype a"

Over the past week, the network has seen a surge in transactions related to automated machine payments, underscoring its growing role in the X402 ecosystem. This expansion highlights Solana\u2019s ability to handle high-volume, low-value transfers efficiently.\nSolana Powers X402 Payment Flows for AI and API Monetization\nThe X402 ecosystem\u2019s growth is centered on Solana\u2019s robust support for AI-driven payment flows. Developers are increasingly adopting the network to power autonomous agent systems, which use X402 for requesting data, triggering compute tasks, and settling payments.\n\u201cThe ability to use gasless USDC transfers has reduced the friction in automated billing,\u201d a Web3 infrastructure developer noted.\nSolana\u2019s transaction speed and predictable fees make it an ideal fit for these systems. Many teams in the Web3 space are now relying on X402 as their default billing method. The new documentation and integration tools released in recent weeks are lowering the barriers for developers.\nX402 Payment Adoption on Solana Increases with Stability\nX402 payments have shown consistent growth, with daily volume rising steadily despite still being smaller compared to DeFi transactions. However, this uptick demonstrates an emerging trend in machine-to-machine commerce. As AI systems and APIs continue to leverage X402 on Solana, the network\u2019s capacity for processing frequent, small payments is proving essential for modern infrastructure.\nDevelopers of AI platforms have confirmed that the X402 payment system helps streamline monetization models. The simplicity of using Solana for recurring payments and subscriptions is driving more projects to adopt the solution. Stablecoins, particularly USDC, are frequently used for instant payments between autonomous agents."

                "body": "The UK stock market spent Tuesday trading in cautiously positive territory, with bank and housebuilder stocks doing much of the heavy lifting while investors digested a fresh Financial Stability Report from the Bank of England (BoE)and a new round of corporate earnings.\nBy late morning in London, the FTSE 100 hovered around 9,740 points, up roughly 0.4% on the day, while the FTSE 250 was fractionally higher near 22,040. In contrast, growth\u2011oriented small caps underperformed, with the AIM All\u2011Share index in the red, reflecting a more risk\u2011averse tone further down the market-cap spectrum. [1]\nMarket snapshot: Banks and builders support a modestly higher FTSE\nData from Halifax\u2019s market centre showed the main UK indices as follows around midday on 2 December 2025: [2]\n- FTSE 100: 9,739.57 (+0.38%)\n- FTSE 250: 22,038.03 (+0.08%)\n- FTSE All\u2011Share: 5,246.94 (+0.34%)\n- FTSE AIM All\u2011Share: 751.48 (\u20130.44%)\nThe pattern is classic \u201crisk\u2011on but selective\u201d:\n- Financials are finding support from a more relaxed capital outlook after BoE stress tests. [3]\n- Housebuilders are being re\u2011rated on the back of a bullish sector note from RBC Capital and encouraging UK housing data. [4]\n- Smaller growth names remain under pressure as the BoE flags stretched valuations in parts of the global tech and AI complex. [5]\nIntraday commentary has highlighted some volatility, with live blogs at various outlets noting that the FTSE 100 has swung between modest gains and slight dips as investors toggle between the positive bank story and unease about overvalued AI\u2011linked equities. [6]\nBanks in the spotlight after BoE stress tests and capital rule easing\nFinancials are centre stage today. The Bank of England has published the results of its latest bank capital stress tests, concluding that major UK lenders hold sufficient capital to withstand severe economic shocks. [7]\nAlongside the tests, the BoE moved to ease certain capital requirements for UK banks, a decision widely read as a signal that the sector is robust enough to support credit growth even under stress scenarios. [8]\nKey points for the sector:\n- All major lenders passed the BoE\u2019s capital stress tests, including HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, which both reported passing the regulatory hurdle in exchange announcements. [9]\n- The BoE subsequently relaxed some capital buffers for banks, which markets interpret as a modest tailwind for lending capacity and shareholder returns (dividends and buybacks), even if detailed calibrations remain behind paywalls in some reports. [10]\nShares responded accordingly:\n- Lloyds Banking Group was quoted around 97p, up roughly 1.6% on the session in early US\u2011time trading, with the stock up more than 70% year to date according to MarketScreener snapshots. [11]\n- HSBC traded just above 1,080p, posting smaller but still positive gains on the day. [12]\nThe combination of successful stress tests and lighter capital requirements gives UK banks a cleaner runway into 2026. It also helps explain why financials have been among the biggest positive contributors to today\u2019s FTSE 100 performance.\nBoE warns on AI\u2011driven valuation risks and gilt repo concentration\nIf the stress tests were the \u201cgood news\u201d for markets, the BoE\u2019s Financial Stability Report (December 2025) provided the caveat.\nIn commentary summarised by several outlets, the BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC): [13]\n- Warned that valuations of AI\u2011driven technology companies, especially in the United States, have become \u201cstretched\u201d and look reminiscent of past speculative episodes.\n- Noted that US equity valuations are now near levels last seen during the dot\u2011com bubble, while UK valuations, though lower, have climbed back toward pre\u2011global\u2011financial\u2011crisis ranges.\n- Highlighted broader global risks around high sovereign debt, elevated risk\u2011asset prices and pockets of leverage across non\u2011bank financial institutions. [14]\nThe FPC also flagged a more niche but potentially important issue: concentration in the UK gilt repo mark"

[7]\nEnd\u2011of\u2011day data from Investing.com show the DAX finishing at 23,780.07, with an intraday range between roughly 23,603 and 23,780 points, for a daily gain of about 0.81%. [8]\nIn the background:\n- The DAX\u2019s 52\u2011week range currently sits between 18,489.91 and 24,771.34, with a 12\u2011month gain of roughly 18\u201319%, underlining how close German blue chips remain to record territory despite the recent wobble. [9]\n- Within Europe, the STOXX 600 was only up about 0.1%, but banks jumped roughly 0.9%, and Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC 40 outperformed with gains around 0.5% by late morning, according to Reuters. [10]\nSo while Tuesday\u2019s rally did not fully erase Monday\u2019s decline, it re\u2011anchored the DAX in the upper half of its recent range, suggesting that the pullback still looks more like a pause in an ongoing bull market than the start of a deeper correction.\nMDAX and TecDAX: Mid\u2011Caps Firmer, Tech Slightly Softer\nBelow the headline index, the picture was more nuanced:\n- The DAX Midcap Index (MDAX) traded around 29,549.67 points, up 0.25% on the day, with a range of about 29,320\u201329,555, after closing Monday at 29,475.82. [11]\n- The TecDAX lagged, ending at 3,541.89, down 0.16%, following a 1.24% drop on Monday. [12]\nThat combination \u2013 large caps and mid\u2011caps up, tech slightly down \u2013 fits Tuesday\u2019s broader European pattern, where banks and cyclicals outperformed, while healthcare and some growth names underperformed. [13]\nBayer\u2019s Roundup Breakthrough Dominates the DAX\nThe single biggest story in Frankfurt today was Bayer.\nWhat happened?\n- A U.S. policy shift triggered the move: the Trump administration formally urged the U.S. Supreme Court to hear Bayer\u2019s appeal in thousands of lawsuits over whether its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer. [14]\n- That move significantly improves Bayer\u2019s chances of getting a clearer, potentially more favourable legal framework around its legacy Monsanto litigation, which has already forced the company to book multi\u2011billion\u2011euro provisions in recent years.\nMarket reaction\nThe impact on the stock was explosive:\n- Trading Economics, via TradingView, reports that Bayer surged as much as 15% in early deals, the biggest intraday jump in more than two decades, pushing its year\u2011to\u2011date gain to around 80%. [15]\n- Mid\u2011session snapshots from German portals showed Bayer up about 11\u201312%, with the share price around \u20ac33\u201335 on Xetra. [16]\n- A dedicated analysis on TechStock\u00b2 notes the stock trading around \u20ac34\u201335, up roughly 13% intraday, and frames the move as a potential \u201ctrend\u2011changing\u201d rally for a name that has become a symbol of legal overhang in the "

That report covered its chief financial officers\u2019 compensation, board composition, an amendment to its bylaws that lowered the quorum requirement, a judgment in Rwanda against its Canadian subsidiary and the personal bankruptcy of its former chief financial officer. Alt5 Sigma also attributed the delayed report to \u201cthe timeliness and responsiveness of the company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if the company had an accountant at that time, though \u2014 Alt5 Sigma told the SEC on Friday its independent accountant, Hudgens CPA, PLLC, notified the company on Nov. 21 it was resigning \u201ceffective immediately.\u201d But the firm\u2019s partner, William Hudgens, told Forbes he informed Alt5 Sigma before June 30 that he would step down after its second-quarter report, which was filed on Aug. 12.

                "body": "GREEN BAY \u2013 Perhaps nobody in the National Football League knows Evan Williams better than Matt LaFleur.\nThe Packers' head coach has been running his scheme against the 24-year-old safety in practice for nearly two years and yet trying to glean any information off Williams' pre-snap tendencies often remains a mystery in the film room.\n\"Sometimes I can't tell when I'm watching the tape,\" said LaFleur on Monday. \"Was that quarters? Was that like a three-hook coverage?\"\nLaFleur ain't the only one.\nA member of the PFWA's All-Rookie team in 2024, Williams has taken his game \u2013 and deception \u2013 to the next level in Year 2 on his way to becoming one of the top playmakers on Green Bay's defense.\nThe 5-foot-11, 200-pound safety not only leads the Packers with three interceptions this season but also has been impactful against the run. He racked up nine tackles in last Thursday's 31-24 win against Detroit, including four run stops in which the Lions netted between one and minus-5 yards.\nLions running back Jahmyr Gibbs finished with 68 yards on 20 rushing attempts, four days after needing just 15 carries to run for 219 yards and two touchdowns against the New York Giants.\n\"I take a lot of pride in that,\" said Williams of his physicality in the run game. \"I feel like the casual fan kind of looks over those type of plays, but when you look back at it, that's a good 60-70% of the game are those run plays that a lot of people look over. I want to be the complete player that I think I can be, it definitely starts with being stout in the run game.\"\nThe secret to Williams' success has been defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley's principles of disguise and not allowing the offense to count him in the run fit until the very last minute. At the same time, Williams' antenna is always up to glean any information he can from the opposition.\nThere's a saying amongst the Packers' defensive backs, \"See a little, see a lot,\" and Williams plays to that standard through film study, reading his keys and reacting to the visual cues the offensive line, tight ends and backfield are providing.\nThe rest is up to Williams to arrive with speed and \"a little bit of violence\" to knock back a receiver or tight end off a crack block, or cause them to miss him entirely like he did on his tackle of Gibbs for no gain on third-and-3 in the fourth quarter of the Thanksgiving win over the Lions.\nIt's no accident. LaFleur even remarked to one of the Packers' coaches after the team's extra practice on Monday how Williams is always putting in extra time working his technique on the heavy bag after practice ends.\n\"He's always been a pretty aware player,\" LaFleur said. \"He's got great instincts but now just his knowledge of what we're trying to get accomplished and then his ability to disguise and hold things and then on the snap, trigger. \u2026 The physicality that he's brought to our defense has been pretty impressive.\"\nThere has been a night-and-day difference in terms of the production the Packers have received from the safety position during Hafley's two seasons as defensive coordinator.\nGreen Bay started the overhaul with the marquee signing of Xavier McKinney, who was voted first-team All-Pro last year after intercepting a team-high eight passes. The Packers also drafted Georgia's Javon Bullard in the second round before taking Williams on Day 3.\nWith Bullard growing into Green Bay's starting nickelback, McKinney and Williams have worked in unison on the backend to aid a Packers pass defense allowing the fourth-fewest yards per play (5.67) in the NFL this season.\n\"He's a special player, man,\" said McKinney of Williams. \"He's done a hell of a job for this defense, for this team, and you just continue to see his growth, within every game, within every practice, and you know that's good for all of us.\"\nThe Packers' run defense is in for a massive test this Sunday at Lambeau Field against Chicago's one-two punch of D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monganai, who each rushed for more than 100 yard"

DeKnight, the man he spent years working with in the early 2010s on Starz\u2019s Spartacus franchise playing Ashur, a turncoat slave and gladiator that audiences loved to hate.\nAshur had met his end in 2013\u2019s Spartacus: Vengeance, but the character never truly left DeKnight\u2019s mind, which is why he picked up the phone to ask Tarabay a question. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Nick, what are you doing for the next five to six years?\u201d recalled the actor.\nRelated Stories\nDeKnight pitched Tarabay on playing Ashur once more in a new revisionist history series that imagines what would have happened had Ashur lived. Thankfully, the actor gave a resounding \u201cyes\u201d to DeKnight\u2019s pitch, and the series, Spartacus: House of Ashur, now premieres Dec. 5 on Starz. And just like the initial series that debuted back in 2010, the show brings back slow-motion blood-letting, orgies galore, and plenty of sudsy soap opera machinations.\nDeKnight and Tarabay recently came together for a lively conversation at the London Hotel for the very first Heat Vision Live event \u2014 a screening and Q&A series hosted by The Hollywood Reporter with a focus on all things great about genre film and television. And House of Ashur certainly fits that bill with sword-clashing, trident-piercing, hammer-smashing action sequences paired with visually-flourishing storytelling. (Watch the full conversation, moderated by THR senior film writer and creator of the Heat Vision blog Borys Kit, at the top of this post.)\nIn an era in which TV feels a little tamer, the series is boundary-pushing as ever, with its sex and violence. DeKnight said that he hasn\u2019t found a boundary he isn\u2019t willing to cross and received support from Starz, as well as producer Lionsgate TV. In fact, after a certain, um, dismemberment near the end of episode two, \u201d I was sure we were going to get a note about that,\u201d he recalled. Instead? \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cThis time in ancient Rome was a brutal, brutal time and hypersexual,\u201d said DeKnight, who is particularly proud of the show\u2019s introduction of a female gladiator. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful to Lionsgate and Starz that I have not gotten a note that said, \u2018Whoa, can you pull it back?\u2019\u201d\nDeKnight struck a defiant tone when it was suggested a parents group could become agitated due to all the sex and violence.\n\u201cI welcome a parents advisory out for blood,\u201d he said , aughing.\nStill, ideas about sexuality and performer safety have evolved since Spartacus bowed in 15 years ago, before intimacy coordinators became commonplace on big productions. \u201cI come from a theater world where we didn\u2019t have an intimacy coordinator. We would just talk about it. \u2018What are you OK with? What are you not OK with?\u2019\u201d Tarabay said. The House of Ashur set employed intimacy coordinators for performers who wanted them. Tarabay continued, \u201cBringing that in is great for the new generation. That\u2019s awesome. But also being nude, after a while, it becomes easy. It becomes just another scene.\u201d\nDuring the Q&A, Tarabay came off as a boisterous, fun-loving sort of guy, revealing he relishes fight training, which for the show included a month of gladiator camp, comprised of four hours of training a day, \u201cfrom weapons to jiujitsu, to grappling, to wrestling, to CrossFit,\u201d he said.\nBut one line Tarabay wouldn\u2019t cross is changing the lines on set. The show is known for a certain style of speaking and a specific diction. DeKnight describes is as \u201cShakespeare meets Conan the Barbarian.\u201d Each word was written with painstaking precision by DeKnight and his writer\u2019s room, crafted to give the sense that you are in another time, even if it\u2019s not accurate to how the Romans actually spoke.\n\u201cThe dialogue\u2019s so specific, it\u2019s got to be word for word,\u201d said DeKnight, who recalled being on set and noticing when an actor dropped a single word. \u201cWhen it\u2019s improvised or wrong, it\u2019s like a record skipping. You can tell something wasn\u2019t quite right.\u201d\nEven before the new sho"

On one side, tech and chip-related firms \u2013 including Advantest, Tokyo Electron, Renesas Electronics, and tech investor SoftBank Group \u2013 jumped as they tracked Wall Street\u2019s tech rally, fueled by growing bets that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week. Lower US rates tend to prop up growth and tech stocks around the world by making future earnings more valuable and loosening financial conditions. On the other side, investors are cashing out of sectors that have already surged: major banks like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group fell around 2% after a strong run-up on expectations that the Bank of Japan might lift rates at its December 18 \u2013 19 meeting. Automakers such as Toyota, Honda, and Nissan also slipped, as a strengthening yen threatens to squeeze exporters\u2019 profits \u2013 so with just 26% of prime-market stocks rising versus 69% falling, the Nikkei\u2019s gain is papering over broad selling pressure underneath.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: One index many different stories.\nThe split between a rising Nikkei and a falling Topix shows how a few heavyweight stocks can haul headline indices higher even when most shares are under pressure. Tech and chip firms now wield outsized clout in Japan, a bit like the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d in the US: when they surge on global rate-cut hopes or booming AI demand, they can offset weakness in banks, autos, and smaller domestically focused firms. The retreat in Japanese bank shares after a strong rally also underlines how hypersensitive rate-linked sectors are to every hint from the Bank of Japan, with Governor Kazuo Ueda openly debating the pros and cons of the first proper hike in years. For global investors, this all drives home that Japan\u2019s market is being tugged by two powerful forces at once \u2013 a US-led tech cycle shaped by Fed policy and a homegrown rate story driven by the BoJ.\nThe bigger picture: Japan sits at the crossroads of global policy shifts.\nTokyo\u2019s next moves will be steered by both US and Japanese central banks. If the Fed starts trimming rates, extra global liquidity could keep fueling growth and tech stocks, boosting Japanese chipmakers that plug into worldwide supply chains. At the same time, even a modest BoJ rate hike would mark a sharp break from decades of ultra-loose policy, with knock-on effects for bank profitability, the yen\u2019s strength, and export-heavy sectors like autos. That mix could reshape capital flows across Asia, as investors rethink Japan\u2019s role as a low-yield funding hub and a manufacturing powerhouse. The current gap between the Nikkei and the broader market is an early hint that this transition could be bumpy and uneven.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nResearch\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 11 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 1 hour ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Japanese Yen Price Action Setups into ISM and ADP: USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, CHF/JPY\nYen crosses enter a pivotal 48-hour window as ISM services, ADP payrolls and Australian GDP hit the wires. USD/JPY remains surprisingly resilient despite renewed Fed-cut bets, while EUR/JPY and CHF/JPY continue to trend higher on the daily charts. Below are the key technical levels, breakout signals and near-term risks to watch.\nView related analysis:\n- US Dollar Seasonality in December: USD/JPY, USD/CHF, EUR/USD, AUD/USD\n- USD/JPY Probes Support as US Dollar Stumbles on Fed Cut Bets\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD 6-Day Rally Into AU GDP, US Data Deluge\n- USD/JPY, Nikkei Outlook: Japanese Yen Weakens amid Risk-On Tone\nYen Cross Technical Setups Ahead of ISM and ADP\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nWhile speculation persists that the Bank of Japan may inch closer to a rate hike, it hasn\u2019t been enough to spark a meaningful rebound in the yen. With a December Fed cut now back in play, USD/JPY should arguably be falling faster \u2014 yet price action remains relatively resilient. That keeps the latest pullback looking more corrective than structural, with a rebound towards 157 still a reasonable assumption within the broader bullish trend.\nJPY Volatility Stays Muted Ahead of Heavy US Data\nImplied volatility is unusually subdued given the upcoming ISM services, ADP payrolls and PCE inflation data. Any upside surprise here could catch US dollar bears off guard and support USD/JPY before its typical December softness \u2014 which tends to kick in during the second half of the month.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nAlso note that the 1- and 3-month risk reversals remain aligned with the prevailing daily trend, signalling that options markets aren\u2019t pricing a major bearish reversal yet. The 1-week tenor has slipped alongside spot, hinting at scope for further near-term downside, but nothing that challenges the broader structure.\nBulls Favoured Above 155 as Volume Confirms the Rebound\nUSD/JPY reached my 155 downside target with a strong lower wick, aligning with a heavily oversold RSI. Monday\u2019s close back above the 20-day EMA and Tuesday\u2019s small bullish candle show demand rebuilding above the spike low. Bias remains to buy dips while price holds above the 155 zone.\nOn the 1-hour chart, rising volume after the spike low supports the recovery. RSI (14) is confirming the move, and once Tokyo volatility clears, bulls can hunt dips within yesterday\u2019s range targeting the high-volume nodes at 156.34, 156.70 and possibly the 157 handle. Further upside assumes incoming US data doesn\u2019t tilt the narrative back toward Fed doves.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nEUR/JPY and CHF/JPY: Bullish Trends Intact Despite Minor Pullbacks\nThese charts are straightforward to interpret given the dominant bullish trends on the daily timeframe.\nEUR/JPY: Triangle Patterns Hint at an Upside Break\nEUR/JPY is carving out a potential symmetrical triangle near its highs and continues to hold above the 10-day EMA. The moving averages remain in a bullish sequence, and Wednesday\u2019s bullish engulfing candle signals renewed demand. Bias favours an upside breakout and trend continuation. Even if we see a dip first, bulls can look for support around the 180 HVN or the monthly pivot.\nCHF/JPY: Pullback Holds Above Supportive EMAs\nCHF/JPY also retains a strong bullish trend, although the pullback from its record high has been slightly deeper than in EUR/JPY. Price is still holding above the 20-day EMA, and a supportive candle has formed, hinting that another test of the highs may be building. If price softens, bulls can watch for a swing low near the October high or the 192 handle. A clean break beneath 192 points to a deeper correction.\nKey Economic Events for Traders (AEDT / GMT+11)\nAustralian GDP looks more likely than not to show some strength today, given elevated inflation, firm household spending and solid employment data.
