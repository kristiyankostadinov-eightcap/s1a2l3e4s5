The Fed is poised to lower the cost of money even though inflation stayed stubbornly high at an annual rate of 2.9% in August. In the past quarter century, gold has never declined in price when the central bank eases monetary policy at the same time as inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target, according to Bank of America's commodity analysts. \"In fact, even if we disregard the Global Financial Crisis , gold has returned around 13% annually during 'inflationary easing,'\" analysts led by Michael Widmer told clients in a report on Monday. Bank of America forecasts gold will hit $4,000 an ounce in 2026. Gold futures have gained more than 40% in 2025 alone, to reach $3,729 per ounce as of mid-morning Tuesday. Gold is also seeing strong demand from central banks, which now hold more of the precious metal than U.S. Treasuries, the analysts said. Global monetary authorities are increasingly worried about Fed independence under President Donald Trump, which has encouraged the acquisition of gold reserves, they said. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has slumped more than 10% in 2025 against a basket of leading trading partners' currencies .

                "body": "The precious metals market has witnessed an extraordinary surge in recent sessions, with front-month gold futures establishing yet another milestone by settling at an unprecedented $3,688.90 per troy ounce. This modest yet significant gain of 0.2% marks the third consecutive trading session in which gold has achieved a new all-time settlement record, underscoring the metal's remarkable momentum in the current economic climate.\nThe sustained upward trajectory comes as market participants position themselves ahead of an anticipated interest rate reduction from the Federal Reserve, a monetary policy shift that historically has proven favorable for non-yielding assets like gold. The precious metal's recent performance reflects growing investor confidence in gold's role as both an inflation hedge and a safe-haven asset during periods of monetary accommodation.\nAccording to analysts at Bank of America, the current economic landscape presents particularly supportive conditions for gold appreciation. The investment bank highlights persistent concerns over stagflation\u2014a challenging economic scenario characterized by simultaneous inflation and economic stagnation\u2014as a key driver of precious metals demand. This macroeconomic backdrop traditionally creates an environment where gold's intrinsic value proposition becomes increasingly attractive to institutional and retail investors alike.\nSupporting this bullish narrative, the Consumer Price Index reading of 2.9% for August provides additional fundamental backing for gold's ascent. Bank of America's research reveals a compelling historical precedent: since 2001, gold has never experienced a decline during periods when U.S. inflation exceeds 2% while the Federal Reserve simultaneously pursues an accommodative monetary policy stance. This statistical correlation suggests that the current environment may continue to provide tailwinds for precious metals investments.\nThe magnitude of gold's recent performance becomes even more striking when examined across various timeframes. From its 52-week nadir of $2,564.30, reached on September 17, 2024, gold has surged an impressive 43.86%, demonstrating the metal's capacity for substantial appreciation during favorable market conditions. This same percentage gain is reflected in the year-over-year comparison, highlighting the consistency of gold's upward momentum over the past twelve months.\nPerhaps even more noteworthy is gold's recovery from its 2025 settlement low of $2,638.40, recorded on January 6. The 39.82% appreciation from that recent trough illustrates the rapid acceleration in gold's value during the opening months of this year, suggesting that institutional and sovereign demand may be intensifying as global economic uncertainties persist.\nThe shorter-term performance metrics further reinforce gold's current strength. Month-to-date gains of 6.20% indicate sustained buying pressure, while the year-to-date advancement of $1,059.70 per ounce\u2014representing a remarkable 40.31% increase\u2014positions gold among the standout performers in commodity markets for 2025.\nThis exceptional price action reflects broader themes currently influencing financial markets, including concerns about fiscal sustainability, geopolitical tensions, and the long-term implications of expansionary monetary policies. As central banks worldwide continue to grapple with the delicate balance between supporting economic growth and managing inflationary pressures, gold's traditional role as a store of value appears to be resonating with investors seeking portfolio diversification and protection against currency debasement.\nThe convergence of technical momentum, fundamental support, and favorable monetary policy positioning suggests that gold's recent achievements may represent more than merely speculative enthusiasm. Instead, the precious metal's performance appears to reflect a fundamental reassessment of value and risk in an evolving global economic landscape where traditional safe"

                "body": "US Dollar Talking Points:\n- The US Dollar is breaking down ahead of the widely-expected rate cut from the FOMC at tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\n- The bigger question is whether the Fed will echo the dovish expectation built in by markets, with as much as 125-150 bps of softening expected into the end of next year. This puts emphasis on the bank\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections, which will also contain forecasts for inflation, growth and employment.\n- This is an archived webinar and you\u2019re welcome to join the next one. Click here to register.\nSince the global financial collapse the Federal Reserve has largely managed markets with expectations, often communicated by the Summary of Economic Projections but also using media engagements with Fed members to sway capital flows in one direction or the other. This has been incredibly effective, on net, at least if we\u2019re evaluating the matter from the perspective of stock prices.\nThat\u2019s actually an interesting variable, because that also comes into play here, as it\u2019s the Fed\u2019s embrace of the Wealth Effect, or the \u2018implied third mandate,\u2019 that\u2019s on full display at tomorrow\u2019s rate decision. Inflation remains high and unemployment remains low, at least from the perspective of the unemployment rate. When Powell last opined on the matter on July 30th, at the last FOMC meeting, he said that policy didn\u2019t seem overly restrictive given those two factors, which are the two sides of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate.\nAnd from that perspective, really, the Fed should not be cutting, and there\u2019s an argument that rates should be much higher considering that inflation has been going up by most metrics over the past few months.\nYet, not only is the Fed widely-expected to cut, they\u2019re also expected to lean heavy into a dovish cycle that\u2019s pricing in as much as 125-150 bps in cuts to the end of next year. And this really begs the question, what is it that the Fed sees that isn\u2019t quite showing up in the data?\nAnd a related question, with so many cuts already priced-in, how much more bearish can USD bears get, and what can the Fed say that will compel that drive?\nAt this point the USD has been selling off to a fresh monthly low although it does remain above the Q3 opening swing-low, as of this writing. As highlighted in the webinar, I think this is a bit of positioning in EUR/USD ahead of the FOMC meeting with EUR/USD shorts getting squeezed as positions square up. Given the shift at the ECB last week, there could be wherewithal for continuation, but it seems that the Fed will essentially need to mirror or beat the market\u2019s current expectation for rate cuts, which will probably require some massaging of the bank\u2019s forecasts for inflation and unemployment.\nUS Dollar Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nEUR/USD is breaking out with a push from Christine Lagarde\u2019s comment at the ECB meeting last week, saying that the disinflationary process was over for the Eurozone. I looked at this in the Tuesday webinar, ahead of the event, and then later in the week after that comment.\nGoing into last week, there was a bullish breakout from both a bull pennant and an inverse head and shoulders pattern. As of this writing, the pair is trading at a fresh four-year-high, and if USD bears are going to get their way, they\u2019re likely going to need some continued participation from EUR/USD.\nEUR/USD Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/USD: Clean Cable\nThe support looked at in last week\u2019s webinar at the 1.3500 handle held cleanly, and this morning saw price move up to resistance at 1.3670. Contrasting with EUR/USD above, the pair is not at a fresh four-year-high, but it still does remain attractive for USD-weakness scenarios.\nGBP/USD Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/CAD\nUSD/CAD has pulled back after this morning\u2019s Canadian CPI print, and tomorrow also brings a Bank of Canada rate decision, with the expectation"

                "body": "- EUR/USD softens to around 1.1855 in Wednesday\u2019s Asian session.\n- Traders have fully priced in a 25 bps Fed rate cut.\n- German ZEW sentiment improves in September.\nThe EUR/USD pair loses momentum near 1.1855, snapping the four-day winning streak during the Asian trading hours on Wednesday. Nonetheless, the potential downside of the major pair might be limited, as economists expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to deliver a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.\nThe Fed is widely expected to lower its key lending rate in the range of 4.0% to 4.25%, the lowest level since late 2022. The probability of a 25 bps cut stands at 96%, according to CME FedWatch, which relies on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices to determine the likelihood. There's only a 4% chance of a jumbo cut of 50 bps.\nTraders will take more cues from the speech from the Fed\u2019s Chair Jerome Powell after the policy meeting. \"A 25 bp cut gives room for a somewhat dovish leaning, while a 50 bp cut would allow Chair Powell to be as hawkish as he likes, as the move itself would dominate aggregate impact,\" said ING economists.\nAcross the pond, the ZEW Economic Sentiment survey in Germany showed that investors\u2019 expectations are growing optimistic, which might provide some support to the shared currency. Germany\u2019s ZEW Economic Sentiment Index rose to 37.3 points from 34.7 points in August, stronger than the expectation of 26.3 points.\nThe ECB President Christine Lagarde is set to speak later on Wednesday. Any dovish remarks from ECB policymakers could weigh on the EUR against the USD in the near term. The final reading of Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data from the Eurozone will be published later on the same day.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they ac"

Fed easing, ZEW surprises, and weak dollar momentum drive bullish targets at $1.1830 and $1.20 | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Breaks Above 1.1800 as Fed Cut Bets Dominate\nThe euro surged past $1.1800 against the U.S. dollar, marking its strongest level since early July, as markets locked onto the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day policy meeting. EUR/USD traded as high as $1.1818 before consolidating near $1.1800, driven by mounting bets on a September rate cut. Futures markets are fully pricing a 25-basis-point move, with a minority of traders eyeing a deeper 50-point cut. Deutsche Bank projects the federal funds rate could fall to 3.50%\u20133.75% by year-end after three consecutive reductions, aligning with the market\u2019s increasingly dovish expectations.\nDollar Weakness Undermines Support as Retail Sales Data Loom\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slipped to 97.20, a three-week low, losing 0.28% on Tuesday\u2019s session. Despite August retail sales climbing 0.6% versus the 0.3% consensus, the stronger data failed to lift the Greenback. Investors instead leaned on expectations of a looser Fed policy path. With the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate currently at 4.33%, traders anticipate as much as 150 basis points of cuts through the end of 2026, suggesting further erosion of the dollar\u2019s yield premium. Powell\u2019s press conference following the FOMC decision is now seen as the key trigger for the next breakout in EUR/USD.\nEuropean Resilience: ZEW Sentiment and Industrial Output Surprise\nEurope added fuel to the bullish case for the single currency. Germany\u2019s ZEW Economic Sentiment Index climbed to 37.3 in September, well ahead of forecasts for 27.3, marking its second consecutive monthly improvement. Eurozone sentiment also brightened, rising to 26.1 from 25.1 despite expectations of a decline. Industrial production in the bloc rose 0.3% in July after a 1.3% drop in June, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 1.8%. These figures suggest a more resilient economy than markets had priced in, cushioning the euro despite lingering fiscal concerns such as Fitch\u2019s downgrade of France to A+.\nTechnical Setup Points Toward 1.1830 and 1.20\nFrom a technical standpoint, EUR/USD is consolidating above $1.1790, breaking through the ceiling that has repeatedly capped advances since late August. The July 24 high at $1.1790 has turned into support, while immediate resistance sits at $1.1830, followed by a broader psychological barrier at $1.2000. The RSI at 66 shows momentum remains bullish without hitting overbought extremes. Price action has been supported by the ascending trendline from September lows, while the 50-day EMA at $1.1736 and 200-day EMA at $1.1698 provide strong underpins. A Fibonacci extension from the late August rally points to $1.1885 as the next upside target if buyers clear $1.1830 convincingly.\nRead More\n-\nSPYI ETF at $52.31 Delivers 11.67% Yield and Outpaces JEPI, XYLD With 50.58% Return\n16.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Top $2.3B as BTC-USD Price Nears $118K Resistance\n16.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price Forecast: HG=F Targets $4.95 Near-Term and $11,000 Long-Term\n16.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Slides to 146.56 as Fed and BoJ Decisions Set Up Breakout\n16.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nFed Politics and Independence Questions Add Risk Premium\nPolitical developments surrounding the Federal Reserve are adding a unique twist to the outlook. The U.S. Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, a Trump economic ally, to the Fed Board, sparking speculation that policy could face political influence. At the same time, an appeals court blocked efforts to remove Governor Lisa Cook, preserving institutional continuity. This tension between political pressure and central bank independence could add volatility to EUR/USD, particularly if Powell\u2019s guidance fails to reassure markets "

A steady UK labor market added momentum, with the Office for National Statistics reporting unemployment at 4.7% for the three months ending July, unchanged and aligned with expectations. Employment rose by 232,000 compared to a forecast of 222,000, reinforcing demand for sterling. Wages remain sticky at 4.7%\u20134.8% year-on-year, a dynamic that keeps the Bank of England wary of inflationary pressure. This backdrop supported a strong 3.5% rebound in GBP/USD for September, placing the pair at its highest level in over two months.\nDollar weakness intensifies as Fed cut bets rise\nThe U.S. dollar has weakened broadly, setting the stage for GBP/USD gains. Markets are pricing in a 96% probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut at the upcoming meeting, with at least two more cuts expected before year-end. Retail sales slowed from 0.5% in July to 0.3% in August, while industrial production printed at just 0.1%, both signaling a cooling U.S. economy. The unemployment rate in the U.S. has risen to 4.3% after the economy created only 22,000 jobs last month, increasing the pressure on the Fed to loosen policy. Treasury yields softened, pushing investors back into risk assets, including sterling, which now outpaces the greenback on yield spreads. The UK two-year gilt to U.S. Treasury note premium has widened from 0.29% to 0.45%, a key driver behind sterling\u2019s strength.\nTechnical picture favors further GBP/USD upside\nPrice action has broken decisively above the 20-day and 50-day moving averages since early September, reinforcing a bullish short-term sequence. GBP/USD now trades within an ascending channel that projects potential resistance near 1.3715\u20131.3750, coinciding with Fibonacci extension levels. On the 4-hour chart, a breakout through 1.3575 triggered fresh bullish momentum, confirmed by price holding above the Ichimoku cloud. RSI has moved to its highest level in over a month, staying above 50 and showing room for continuation. Analysts point to 1.3700 as the immediate target, while a push above 1.3787, the year-to-date high, could extend gains toward 1.3840 and even 1.3950 if the Fed delivers a dovish surprise.\nSterling performance across majors strengthens case for GBP/USD\nBeyond the dollar cross, sterling has shown relative resilience across other majors, amplifying its fundamental case. GBP/JPY secured a daily close above the psychological 200 level, though RSI flagged overbought conditions, suggesting momentum could pause. GBP/CAD posted a bearish engulfing candle at the June high, signaling profit-taking after seven sessions of gains, yet short-term charts point to a possible rebound. GBP/AUD has shed over 3% in 17 days, but divergence on RSI indicates bearish exhaustion. This broad but nuanced performance illustrates that sterling\u2019s primary strength lies against the dollar, where macro divergence is most pronounced.\nRead More\n-\nSPYI ETF at $52.31 Delivers 11.67% Yield and Outpaces JEPI, XYLD With 50.58% Return\n16.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Top $2.3B as BTC-USD Price Nears $118K Resistance\n16.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price Forecast: HG=F Targets $4.95 Near-Term and $11,000 Long-Term\n16.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Slides to 146.56 as Fed and BoJ Decisions Set Up Breakout\n16.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nKey event risks set the tone for GBP/USD traders\nThe immediate catalysts lie in Wednesday\u2019s dual central bank decisions.

Sales for the Control Group, used to calculate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures, expanded by 0.7% MoM, up from July\u2019s print of 0.5%.\nAlthough the data was solid, this would not prevent the Fed from easing policy as the labor market continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, US Industrial Production rose by 0.1% MoM in August, exceeding July\u2019s -0.1% MoM contraction.\nAcross the pond, UK jobs data showed that payrolls fell for a seventh straight month, showing that the labor market is cooling, though it might not deter the Bank of England (BoE) from keeping rates unchanged at Thursday\u2019s monetary policy meeting.\nTraders' focus shifts to the Fed\u2019s decision on Wednesday. Market participants had fully priced in a quarter of a percentage point cut, though a tiny minority eyes a 50-bps rate cut. In addition to the decision, Fed officials will update their economic projections and lay the path for interest rates moving forward for the remainder of the year.\n(This story was corrected on September 16 at 15:53 to say that the US July Retail Sales print was 0.6%, not 0.5%.)\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom.

                "body": "Markets brace for dual central bank shocks. Japanese trade data has raised hawkish Bank of Japan bets ahead of the Bank\u2019s interest rate decision on Friday, September 19. The FOMC decision is on Wednesday. The USD/JPY held its ground despite a modest drop in exports and hopes that the US-Japan trade agreement may boost demand for Japanese goods.\nExports declined 0.1% year-on-year in August after falling 2.6% in July, while imports dropped 5.2% (July: -7.4%). Notably, exports to the US slid 13.8%, while shipments to China slipped 0.5%.\nWhy do traders need to track Japan\u2019s trade terms?\nJapan has a trade-to-GDP ratio of around 45%, exposing the economy to trade terms. Falling exports could increase competition, potentially squeezing margins. Firms may cut jobs to manage costs, weakening consumer sentiment and spending. A pullback in spending could weigh on the economy, given that private consumption accounts for around 55% of the GDP.\nWhile August\u2019s data influenced appetite for the Yen, September and October\u2019s trade data will likely have a greater impact on USD/JPY. In early September, the US reduced tariffs on Japanese goods to 15%.\nLater Wednesday, the FOMC will be under the spotlight, amid expectations of multiple near-term Fed rate cuts. Will the Fed\u2019s cut trigger a yen rally?\nEconomists forecast the FOMC to lower interest rates by 25 basis points. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is a 3.9% chance of a larger 50 bps rate cut. Unless there is a larger rate cut, the FOMC Economic Projections and Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference will have a greater effect on USD/JPY.\nA dovish 50 bps rate cut, with projections of two further cuts in the fourth quarter, could push USD/JPY toward 145. If breached, 140.309 would be the next key support level.\nOn the other hand, a 25 bps rate cut, with projections of fewer or no further rate cuts in the fourth quarter, could send the pair toward 148. A break above 148 would bring the 149.358 resistance level into play.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: Hawkish BoJ vs. Dovish Fed Risks\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nBeyond USD/JPY, upbeat Aussie economic data continues to challenge expectations of multiple RBA rate cuts beyond November, influencing AUD/USD trends.\nShifting focus to the AUD/USD pair, the Westpac Leading Index will provide traders with insights into Australia\u2019s economic outlook. Economists expect the Leading Index to increase 0.2% month-on-month in August after July\u2019s 0.1% rise.\nA higher print could indicate a tightening labor market and an upswing in consumer sentiment. Consumers could increase spending on expectations of falling unemployment and potentially higher wages, fueling demand-driven inflation. A higher inflation outlook may temper expectations of multiple RBA rate cuts, lifting demand for the Aussie dollar.\nConversely, a lower reading could support a more dovish RBA rate path, weighing on the Aussie dollar. Consumers could curb spending on expectations of rising unemployment, dampening demand-driven inflation.\nAUD/USD: Key Scenarios to Watch\nSee our full AUD/USD analysis for detailed trends and trade setups.\nWhile economists expect a November RBA rate cut, traders continue betting on aggressive Fed rate cuts, driving AUD/USD above $0.6650 in recent sessions.\nA dovish 25-basis-point Fed rate cut would narrow the rate differential in favor of the Aussie dollar. A narrowing rate differential may send AUD/USD above the $0.67 level and bring $0.6750 into play.\nHowever, a hawkish 25 bps Fed rate cut, projecting one or no rate cuts in the fourth quarter, may widen the rate differential. Under this scenario, the AUD/USD pair could drop below the $0.6650 level. If breached, $0.66 would be the next key support level.\nFor more in-depth analysis, review today\u2019s USD/JPY and AUD/USD trading setups in our latest reports and consult the economic calendar.\nWith over 28 years of experience in the financial industry, Bob has worked with various global ratin"

In separate notes on Friday, the brokerages projected 25-basis-point reductions at each of the Fed\u2019s remaining meetings in September, October, and December, according to Reuters.\n- The US Senate confirmed Stephen Miran by a 48-47 vote to fill the Federal Reserve Board seat vacated by Adriana Kugler last month.

Traders are bracing for the Federal Reserve to deliver a 25bp cut while signalling the path for future easing, with market pricing leaning towards another 50bp of cuts by year-end. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan\u2019s upcoming meeting could add further volatility for the yen. Against this backdrop, USD/JPY shows signs of a bearish breakdown, while EUR/JPY and AUD/JPY retain bullish momentum.\nView related analysis:\n- EUR/USD and GBP/USD Outlook: Bullish Patterns Form as Dollar Wavers\n- USD/CAD, EUR/CAD Outlook: Canadian Dollar Bulls Flex Ahead Inflation\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD, GBP/AUD\n- EUR/USD, USD/JPY, VIX, Gold, Crude oil: COT Report Analysis\n- USD/JPY and Yen Crosses Analysis: Jobs Revision, Fed Cuts, Technical Outlook\nUS Dollar Weakness and Market Expectations for the Fed\nThe US dollar was the weakest FX major on Tuesday, with traders front-running expectations of a dovish Fed cut at this week\u2019s meeting. This, of course, raises the risk of a sharp bullish reversal in the USD should the Fed fail to support current market pricing of another 50bp of cuts this year, alongside the expected 25bp cut on Wednesday. That said, I do not expect the Fed to deliver a 50bp cut at this meeting\u2014partly to save face amid Trump\u2019s persistent pressure to cut, but mostly to avoid triggering unnecessary, widespread panic. Traders would likely view a 50bp cut as confirmation that the Fed is indeed behind the curve.\nSwiss Franc Strength: USD/CHF Hits Lowest Since 2015\nThe Swiss franc (CHF) was the strongest FX major, sending USD/CHF down 1% to its lowest level since January 2015\u2014the infamous day the Swiss National Bank (SNB) removed the franc\u2019s peg to the euro. This places the Swissy firmly below levels where the SNB has previously intervened to support its currency.\nEUR/USD Breaks Higher on Strong Data and Dovish Fed Bets\nEUR/USD reached a near four-year high on Tuesday on stronger-than-expected European data and pre-emptively dovish Fed bets against the US dollar ahead of the FOMC meeting. Germany\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment rose to 37.3, beating the 25.3 estimate and above the 34.7 prior. This marked its fifth consecutive expansion and places it well above its long-term average of 21.1.\nThe euro\u2019s 0.8% gain was its best day in over three weeks, bringing the July and October 2021 highs near 1.1908 and the 1.20 handle into focus for bulls, in line with my bullish bias. EUR/USD bulls have enjoyed a clean breakout from the inverted head and shoulders pattern.\nFX Majors Rundown\n- GBP/USD broke higher from its own inverted head and shoulders pattern, reaching a 2.5-year high.\n- AUD/USD rose 0.2% to its highest level since November, though resistance was predictably met around the 200-day averages and November high.\n- NZD/USD climbed to a 22-day high, though resistance at the August high of 0.5996 is nearby.\n- USD/JPY fell -0.6% and saw its most bearish daily close level since 23 July\n- USD/CAD continued lower in line with my bearish bias, with a move down to at least 1.36 now on the cards. While CPI came in below expectations\u2014keeping the Bank of Canada (BoC) on track for a 25bp cut later today\u2014it remains elevated enough to warrant caution on future cuts.\n- US dollar index (DXY) fell 0.7% to a two-month low, with a break of the July trough at 95.61 now in focus for bears.\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nFor several weeks I have noted that USD/JPY has been ranging between two weekly volume points of control (VPOCs). As is often the case with ranges, there have been several twists and turns around these hidden support and resistance levels, each with their broken promise of a bullish or bearish breakout. But with USD/JPY printing its lowest daily close of the range\u2014and volumes rising during yesterday\u2019s selloff\u2014I am once again on guard for a bearish breakout. Only a less-dovish"

                "body": "USD/JPY forecast: traders bet on yen ahead of the BoJ, Fed decisions\n- The USD/JPY exchange rate slipped ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision.\n- The Bank of Japan will deliver its interest rate decision on Friday.\n- The BoJ and Fed divergence favors the Japanese yen.\nThe USD/JPY exchange rate pulled back this week as focus shifted to the upcoming Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan (BoJ) interest rate decision. It fell to a low of 146.25, down by almost 3% from its highest level in July.\nFederal Reserve interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe USD/JPY exchange rate pulled back sharply as traders waited for the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision.\nAll indications are that the bank will cut interest rates by 0.25% in this meeting as they make a strategic shift from focusing on inflation to the labor market.\nData released earlier this month showed that the economy created just 22,000 jobs in August as the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. Wage growth momentum also stalled during the month.\nMore jobs numbers have painted to an economy that is not doing too well. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of job vacancies in the UK has slowed in the past few months.\nAdditionally, a recent revision showed that the economy lost jobs in June for the first time since the pandemic era.\nCompanies have been reluctant to employ in the past few months because of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have increased costs across the board.\nThe USD/JPY exchange rate slump has coincided with the ongoing decline in US bond yields, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.02% and the five-year yield to 3.65%. Also, it has coincided with the ongoing stock market rally, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices jumping to a record high. The gold price has also jumped.\nBank of Japan interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other notable catalyst for the USD/JPY exchange rate is the upcoming Bank of Japan interest rate decision on Friday.\nUnlike the Federal Reserve, the BoJ is taking a different route on interest rates this year. While economists expect the bank to leave interest rates unchanged, there is rising expectation that the bank will hike interest rates at least once this year.\nThe BoJ has been concerned about the stubbornly high inflation despite the recent improvement. Recent data showed that the country\u2019s inflation dropped to 3.1% in July, the lowest level since March this year. While the drop was notable, it remained much higher than what analysts were expecting.\nAs such, in theory, a situation where the Fed is cutting rates and the BoJ is cutting would benefit the Japanese yen, which explains why many investors have taken the position. In a note, BlueBay Asset Management, which has taken the position, said:\n\u201cWe do think an October move is possible or likely. And so we think this is a more attractive moment to be long the yen, as long as Koizumi is the victor in the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s leadership contest.\u201d\nUSD/JPY technical analysis\nCopy link to sectionThe daily timeframe shows that the USD/JPY exchange rate has pulled back in the past few months, moving from a high of 150.96 in August to 146.5p today. It recently dropped below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\nThe pair is now attempting to drop below the important support level at 146.30, a level it has failed to move below since July. This price is also along the bottom of the trading range of the Murrey Math Lines tool.\nThe MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators have continued falling in the past few weeks. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the pair continues falling as sellers target the ultimate support level at 144."

The NY Empire State Manufacturing Survey showed that businesses conditions were far weaker than expected. Then news broke that Trumps former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors Stephen Miran, was confirmed as a Fed Governor and will vote at the FOMC meeting that starts today.\nCanadian inflation is expected to have risen to 2.7% y/y from 2.6% in July while Core CPI ticks up to 2.7% from 2.6%. The results won\u2019t stop the BoC from cutting rates by 25 bps tomorrow, but they may encourage a more hawkish outlook from policymakers.\nToday\u2019s US data releases are unlikely to shift expectations. Retail sales are projected to rise 0.2% in August compared to 0.5% in July, while capacity utilization, industrial production, and inventories are expected to show little change. Regardless of the results, markets remain convinced that the Fed will ease policy.\nAsian markets ended mixed overnight. Japan\u2019s Topix gained 0.25% and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 rose 0.28%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng closed flat.\nIn Europe as of 7:30 am, sentiment is cautious. The German DAX is down 0.56%, the UK FTSE 100 has lost 0.20%, and the French CAC 40 is unchanged. US futures are modestly positive with the S&P 500 up 0.16%.

The move was supported by weak NY Empire State data and speculation that Miran\u2019s Fed confirmation could accelerate the pace of rate cuts. Traders brushed aside political tension in France and weak German survey data. The uptrend from August 1 remains intact as long as prices hold above 1.1680.\nGBPUSD followed the euro higher, rallying to 1.3646 from 1.3597. The move was underpinned by broad dollar selling and reinforced by UK labor data, which showed cooling but not enough to push the Bank of England into an immediate rate cut. Technicals stay bullish above 1.3560 with room to extend through 1.3680 toward 1.3900.\nUSDJPY weakened as the pair traded in a 146.70\u2013145.54 band overnight. Diverging Fed and BoJ policies remain the driver, with Japan\u2019s election keeping the BoJ on hold while the Fed is expected to trim rates by 25 basis points tomorrow. Lower US tariffs on Japanese exports, including autos, also take effect today.\nAUDUSD edged higher in a narrow 0.6660\u20130.6676 range, buoyed by softer US yields and broad dollar weakness. RBA Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter noted that risks to the domestic outlook are balanced, suggesting no change to rates at the September 30 policy meeting."

The Fed\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the \u2018dot plot,\u2019 will be eyed, where each member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects the federal funds rate in the near future.\nThe upside of the USD/CAD pair could be limited as the US Dollar (USD) could weaken amid rising likelihood of multiple Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts, with strong retail sales and labor data outweighing hotter inflation. Additionally, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank projected 25-basis-point reductions at each of the Fed\u2019s meetings in September, October, and December.\nUS Retail Sales increased by 0.6% month-over-month in August, following the 0.6% increase (revised from 0.5%) recorded in July, and came in better than the market expectation of 0.2%.

The sales report showed resilient consumer spending despite sticky inflation and a softening labor market.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) finds support as domestic inflation data boost the cautious sentiment surrounding the Bank of Canada\u2019s (BoC) policy outlook. Alongside signs of economic resilience, the latest inflation figures support a longer restrictive stance and reduce the odds of rapid easing. Markets now expect only a modest 25-basis-point cut on Wednesday.\nHeadline CPI rose to 1.9% in August from 1.7% in July, missing the 2.0% forecast and staying below the BoC\u2019s 2% midpoint for a fifth straight month. However, trimmed-mean core CPI, its preferred inflation gauge, held near 3.0%, highlighting persistent underlying pressures once volatile items are excluded.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a cu"

                "body": "The Canadian dollar is flexing its muscles ahead of this week\u2019s inflation report, supported by stronger manufacturing sales and early signs of a technical reversal across CAD pairs. While soft employment data raises pressure on the Bank of Canada to cut rates, the broader picture suggests CAD bulls may not be done yet.\nView related analysis:\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD, GBP/CAD\n- USD/CAD Technical Outlook: Futures Traders move Against the Canadian Dollar\n- AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY and ASX 200 Technical Setups: Key Levels in Focus\nCanadian Employment Weakness Fuels BoC Rate Cut Bets\nThe Bank of Canada is expected to cut its overnight cash rate (OCR) by 25bp to 2.5% on Wednesday, a move that the 1-month OIS has priced in with a 64% probability.\nWeakening labour market conditions are the main reason the BoC may be forced to resume its easing cycle, with employment contracting, participation declining, and unemployment climbing.\nEmployment fell for a second straight month in August, with the -65.5k drop marking the sharpest decline since January 2022. While the bulk of the losses came from part-time jobs (-59.7k), the deterioration is still significant. The participation rate slid to 65.1%, its lowest since May 2021, while the unemployment rate climbed to 7.1% \u2013 the highest since August 2021.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpon, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nCanadian Manufacturing Rebound Eases Pressure on BoC\nWith the 1-year OIS only pricing a 54% chance of another 25bp cut, market expectations are not overly dovish. The BoC could adopt a more cautious tone with this week\u2019s rate cut, particularly after the surprise rebound in manufacturing sales.\nManufacturing sales rose 2.5% in July to $70.3 billion, the fastest pace since January 2023. The transportation sector led the gains, with auto and aerospace sales rebounding strongly. Normally, July sees temporary shutdowns in Ontario auto plants, but closures were less severe this year. Combined with a 6.7% rise in auto exports, the data suggests manufacturers are adapting to Trump\u2019s tariffs, signalling that the worst disruptions may have passed.\nIf stronger inflation figures follow, money markets could fully price out expectations of further rate cuts, potentially boosting the Canadian dollar broadly.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpon, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nCanadian Inflation Data Key for BoC and Loonie Direction\nAttention now shifts to today\u2019s inflation report. Headline CPI has slowed to 1.7% y/y, but core CPI remains at 2.6%, the upper end of the BoC\u2019s target band. Meanwhile, trimmed mean inflation at 3.0% and median CPI at 3.1% remain uncomfortably high for doves.\nCounterintuitively, the Canadian dollar could weaken if trimmed mean and median CPI linger deeper into the 3% range, as that would raise stagflation concerns and revive expectations for further BoC cuts. Conversely, even a modest cooling in these measures could give the BoC breathing space to be more cautious with its dovish messaging, potentially lifting the Canadian dollar.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpon, data source: Statistics Canada, LSEG\nCanadian Dollar Technical Analysis\nWe\u2019re seeing early signs of a reversal in favour of Canadian dollar bulls, and I expect these moves to extend. It\u2019s still early days, but CAD is trading higher against all its major FX peers so far this week, building on mixed success against them late last week.\nGBP/CAD formed a notable bearish engulfing candle around the June high on Monday, snapping its 7-day rally. A similar bearish engulfing pattern appeared on EUR/CAD, hinting at a near-term cycle high. The mighty Australian dollar has also allowed AUD/CAD to retrace for a third straight day from its highest level since November 2023. CAD/JPY has risen for a third day as well, though my bias remains neutral for now. USD/CAD, however, has caught my attention, as it appears to have finally printed the swing high I anticipated last week.\nUSD/CAD Weekly Chart"

The currency cross depreciates as the Pound Sterling (GBP) struggles against its peers ahead of the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Price Index data. Focus will shift toward the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy decision due later in the day.\nHowever, a look at the daily chart suggested the GBP/JPY cross is remaining within an ascending channel pattern, suggesting the market sentiment is bullish. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), a key momentum gauge, is positioned slightly above the 50 mark, signaling bullish bias is in play. Additionally, the currency cross is remaining above the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), suggesting the market sentiment is stronger.\nOn the upside, the GBP/JPY cross is testing its immediate barrier at the psychological level of 200.00, followed by the 200.75, the highest since July 2024, which was reached on September 15. A break above this level could lead the currency cross to explore the region around the ascending channel\u2019s upper boundary at 203.10.\nThe immediate support appears at the nine-day EMA of 199.79, followed by the lower boundary of the ascending channel around 199.50.

Traders are bracing for the Federal Reserve to deliver a 25bp cut while signalling the path for future easing, with market pricing leaning towards another 50bp of cuts by year-end. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan\u2019s upcoming meeting could add further volatility for the yen. Against this backdrop, USD/JPY shows signs of a bearish breakdown, while EUR/JPY and AUD/JPY retain bullish momentum.\nView related analysis:\n- EUR/USD and GBP/USD Outlook: Bullish Patterns Form as Dollar Wavers\n- USD/CAD, EUR/CAD Outlook: Canadian Dollar Bulls Flex Ahead Inflation\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD, GBP/AUD\n- EUR/USD, USD/JPY, VIX, Gold, Crude oil: COT Report Analysis\n- USD/JPY and Yen Crosses Analysis: Jobs Revision, Fed Cuts, Technical Outlook\nUS Dollar Weakness and Market Expectations for the Fed\nThe US dollar was the weakest FX major on Tuesday, with traders front-running expectations of a dovish Fed cut at this week\u2019s meeting. This, of course, raises the risk of a sharp bullish reversal in the USD should the Fed fail to support current market pricing of another 50bp of cuts this year, alongside the expected 25bp cut on Wednesday. That said, I do not expect the Fed to deliver a 50bp cut at this meeting\u2014partly to save face amid Trump\u2019s persistent pressure to cut, but mostly to avoid triggering unnecessary, widespread panic. Traders would likely view a 50bp cut as confirmation that the Fed is indeed behind the curve.\nSwiss Franc Strength: USD/CHF Hits Lowest Since 2015\nThe Swiss franc (CHF) was the strongest FX major, sending USD/CHF down 1% to its lowest level since January 2015\u2014the infamous day the Swiss National Bank (SNB) removed the franc\u2019s peg to the euro. This places the Swissy firmly below levels where the SNB has previously intervened to support its currency.\nEUR/USD Breaks Higher on Strong Data and Dovish Fed Bets\nEUR/USD reached a near four-year high on Tuesday on stronger-than-expected European data and pre-emptively dovish Fed bets against the US dollar ahead of the FOMC meeting. Germany\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment rose to 37.3, beating the 25.3 estimate and above the 34.7 prior. This marked its fifth consecutive expansion and places it well above its long-term average of 21.1.\nThe euro\u2019s 0.8% gain was its best day in over three weeks, bringing the July and October 2021 highs near 1.1908 and the 1.20 handle into focus for bulls, in line with my bullish bias. EUR/USD bulls have enjoyed a clean breakout from the inverted head and shoulders pattern.\nFX Majors Rundown\n- GBP/USD broke higher from its own inverted head and shoulders pattern, reaching a 2.5-year high.\n- AUD/USD rose 0.2% to its highest level since November, though resistance was predictably met around the 200-day averages and November high.\n- NZD/USD climbed to a 22-day high, though resistance at the August high of 0.5996 is nearby.\n- USD/JPY fell -0.6% and saw its most bearish daily close level since 23 July\n- USD/CAD continued lower in line with my bearish bias, with a move down to at least 1.36 now on the cards. While CPI came in below expectations\u2014keeping the Bank of Canada (BoC) on track for a 25bp cut later today\u2014it remains elevated enough to warrant caution on future cuts.\n- US dollar index (DXY) fell 0.7% to a two-month low, with a break of the July trough at 95.61 now in focus for bears.\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nFor several weeks I have noted that USD/JPY has been ranging between two weekly volume points of control (VPOCs). As is often the case with ranges, there have been several twists and turns around these hidden support and resistance levels, each with their broken promise of a bullish or bearish breakout. But with USD/JPY printing its lowest daily close of the range\u2014and volumes rising during yesterday\u2019s selloff\u2014I am once again on guard for a bearish breakout. Only a less-dovish"

The release reduced expectations of further ECB easing after last week\u2019s meeting, where policymakers held rates steady and described risks as \u201cbalanced\u201d with the outlook in \u201ca good place.\u201d At the same time, the US dollar softened as traders positioned for a dovish Fed cut later today. Together, these dynamics left EUR/USD looking more constructive than GBP/USD, helping EUR/GBP extend gains as the pound lagged behind.\nView related analysis:\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD, GBP/AUD\n- EUR/USD and GBP/USD Outlook: Bullish Patterns Form as Dollar Wavers\n- GBP/USD, EUR/GBP: COT Data Appears Favourable to British Pound Bulls\n- USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, AUD/JPY Outlook: Dollar, Yen Weakness Into FOMC, BOJ\nEUR/GBP Outlook: Euro Favoured as Dollar Weakens, Pound Lags\nThe euro was a strong performer on Tuesday, buoyed by an upbeat ZEW report for Germany and the broader eurozone. With the ECB leaving rates unchanged last week, describing risks as \u201cbalanced\u201d and the outlook as \u201cin a good place,\u201d expectations of further cuts have diminished \u2013 reinforcing the view that the easing cycle is likely over. At the same time, traders are positioning for a dovish Fed cut later today, leaving the US dollar weaker and allowing EUR/GBP to outperform GBP/USD.\nEUR/USD vs GBP/USD: Diverging Inverted Head and Shoulders Patterns\nI previously highlighted the potential inverted head and shoulders patterns forming on the daily charts of EUR/USD and GBP/USD. The structure on the euro\u2019s chart looks far more convincing, whereas I remain sceptical of the validity of the pattern on the British pound. This makes EUR/USD the more attractive option for bulls compared to GBP/USD in my view, and also underpins my near-term bullish bias on EUR/GBP.\nIt is worth noting that the daily RSI (2) is overbought for both EUR/USD and GBP/USD, warning of near-term overextension to the upside. However, their respective RSI (14s) confirm the move higher without yet being overbought. In both cases, dips may appeal to bulls \u2013 though EUR/USD appears to stand the better chance of reaching its inverted head and shoulders target, which sits around 1.21.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView EUR/USD, GBP/USD\nEUR/GBP Technical Analysis: Euro vs British Pound\nMuch of this year\u2019s volatility for EUR/GBP was concentrated between March and May, during the peak of Trump-tariff concerns. Its current high-to-low range of 6.5% has already exceeded those of the previous two years, with more than a quarter of the year still to play out.\nThe weekly chart shows momentum turning higher. A series of lower wicks formed around the rising 10-week EMA, and at current levels EUR/GBP is on track to post a bullish outside week.\nThe question now is whether this proves to be a smaller bounce ahead of a sharper move lower, or the prelude to a breakout above the 2025 high. Futures positioning suggests the latter.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView EUR/GBP\nEUR/GBP Trader Positioning \u2013 COT Report Analysis\nAlthough the weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report has dedicated data for EUR/GBP futures, liquidity in this market is relatively low. To better gauge sentiment, I have built a higher-liquidity proxy by subtracting GBP/USD futures positioning from EUR/USD futures data. This method provides a reasonable measure of relative bullish and bearish exposure between the euro and the pound against the US dollar.\nThe proxy COT charts for EUR/GBP show net-long exposure continuing to rise, driven by an increase in gross-longs and a reduction in gross-shorts. This trend is consistent across both large speculators and asset managers.\nIt could be argued that asset managers net-long exposure is approaching a sentiment extreme, but that could still allow for a rise of bullish bets over the near term.

                "body": "After a volatile August, Bitcoin has been regaining momentum in September, gaining about 5.6% month to date. Growing institutional adoption, a weakening greenback and interest rate cuts by the Fed pave the way for a highly optimistic future for the digital asset, outweighing any concerns over volatility.\n``Increasing interest from institutional investors is sending a positive signal to the market, reflecting the confidence of the world\u2019s largest institutions in digital currency. Additionally, pro-crypto moves by the Trump administration are another key tailwind for the asset.\n``Bitcoin Rallies on Growing Rate Cut Expectations\n``The main reason behind Bitcoin\u2019s surge is strong market expectations of Fed easing. With the Fed widely expected to cut rates at its September meeting, the key question is the size of the move. Markets largely anticipate a 25-bps cut, which is already priced in. However, a surprise 50-bps reduction could trigger a sharp rally in Bitcoin.\n``According to Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, the key driver will be the Fed\u2019s tone on future policy moves, as quoted on Forbes. Kuptsikevich also stated that if the Fed shows willingness to ease further, Bitcoin may push into record territory.\n``Further Fed interest rate cut could boost investor risk appetite, potentially leading to increased exposure to digital currencies. Additionally, lower interest rates would leave investors with more capital, often leading to increased interest in cryptocurrency.\n``According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are anticipating a 74.8% likelihood of interest rates falling to 3.75-4% in October and a 69.7% likelihood of interest rates falling to 3.5-3.75% in December.\n``Dollar Weakness Boosts Bitcoin Appeal\n``Cryptocurrency, an alternative to traditional currencies, tends to gain from a weaker greenback. The greenback continues to remain under heavy pressure this year, following its weakest first-half performance since the 1970s.\n``According to TradingView, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen 1.22% over the past month and 10.57% year to date. The index has recorded an all-time decline of 19.10%.\n``Bitcoin\u2019s Path Looks Northbound\n``Per TradingView, top financial institutions maintain an overwhelmingly positive stance on Bitcoin\u2019s price. Standard Chartered projects the digital currency to reach $200,000 by the year\u2019s end, driven by institutional adoption and clearer regulatory frameworks, marking a rise of about 73% from Bitcoin\u2019s current price level.\n``According to VanEck, Bitcoin is forecasted to reach $180,000 by this year, supported by institutional flows over the long term. Additionally, VanEck also projects a long-term price target of $2 million by 2050."

Institutional holdings reach 2.88M BTC, setting up a breakout toward $124,500 if the Fed confirms easing | That's TradingNEWS\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs Post $2.3 Billion Weekly Inflows, Strongest Since June\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded $2.3 billion in net inflows during the week of September 8\u201312, the biggest weekly tally in three months. Leading the surge was BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which added over $1 billion. Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured nearly $850 million, while Ark Invest\u2019s ARKB pulled in $181.7 million. Together, the three managers absorbed over $2 billion, confirming that institutional demand is consolidating around the largest issuers.\nDaily Flows Highlight Structural Demand for Bitcoin Exposure\nCapital flows into Bitcoin ETFs showed remarkable consistency throughout the week. Monday saw $364 million, Tuesday slowed to $23 million, then Wednesday exploded with $742 million in a single session. Thursday contributed $553 million, and Friday closed with $642 million. This sustained accumulation pattern is the most significant since mid-July, indicating institutions are not simply speculating but strategically allocating.\nETF Holdings Reach 6.6% of Bitcoin Market Cap\nThe combined net asset value of Bitcoin ETFs now sits at $151.72 billion, representing 6.6% of Bitcoin\u2019s $2.3 trillion market capitalization. Lifetime cumulative inflows into Bitcoin products stand at $57.09 billion. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT dominates with $60.04 billion in historical inflows, while Fidelity\u2019s FBTC has built $12.63 billion. Bitwise\u2019s BITB registered $18.8 million in outflows during the week, but its total net inflows remain positive at $2.33 billion.\nFederal Reserve Rate Cuts Provide the Key Macro Catalyst\nThe CME FedWatch Tool shows a 96% probability of a 25 bps rate cut at the September 17 FOMC meeting, with markets speculating whether the Fed will go further. Lower rates weaken the U.S. dollar, improve liquidity conditions, and drive demand for risk assets. For Bitcoin ETFs, which rely on institutional appetite, dovish monetary policy is a direct tailwind. Any confirmation of an easing cycle into 2026 could keep inflows strong and send BTC-USD toward $124,500, its all-time high.\nBTC-USD Price Action Battles Resistance at $118,000\nBitcoin is consolidating around $115,300, recovering nearly 9% from the September 1 low of $107,270. The critical zone lies between $117,500\u2013$118,000, where liquidation data shows heavy supply and stop clusters. Breaking this resistance could unleash momentum toward $124,500, while rejection risks a pullback to $110,000\u2013$112,000. Despite the challenge, Bitcoin remains up 90% year-over-year and continues to outperform 93 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, supported by trading above its 200-day moving average.\nStrategic Reserves and ETF Holdings Expand by 30% in 2025\nBitcoin ETF and corporate treasury holdings have surged from 2.24 million BTC in January to 2.88 million BTC in September, a 30% increase year-to-date. This means that nearly 14% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply is now locked in institutional vehicles, reducing exchange liquidity and magnifying price reactions to incremental demand. This structural consolidation has shifted market dynamics, embedding ETFs as a core driver of Bitcoin\u2019s valuation.\nEthereum ETFs Join the Rally but Remain Smaller in Scale\nEthereum ETFs also attracted significant inflows, led by BlackRock\u2019s ETHA with $363.2 million in a single day, lifting its AUM to $17.09 billion. Fidelity\u2019s FETH saw $13.5 million outflows, but overall ETH products gained $646 million over four days. Despite this rebound, Ethereum ETF flows remain far smaller than Bitcoin\u2019s, which captured $2.4 billion last week alone. BTC retains dominance in the ETF flow race, though ETH\u2019s rebound highlights a growing diversification trend.\nWhale Accu"

                "body": "Ethereum is in the midst of a paradox. Even as ether hit record highs in late August, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 (L1) looks muted compared to its peak in late 2021. Fees collected on mainnet in August were just $44 million, a 44% drop from the prior month.\n``Meanwhile, layer-2 (L2) networks like Arbitrum and Base are booming, with $20 billion and $15 billion in total value locked (TVL) respectively.\n``This divergence raises a crucial question: are L2s cannibalizing Ethereum\u2019s DeFi activity, or is the ecosystem evolving into a multi-layered financial architecture?\n``AJ Warner, the chief strategy officer of Offchain Labs, the developer firm behind layer-2 Arbitrum, argues that the metrics are more nuanced than just layer-2 DeFi chipping at the layer 1.\n``In an interview with CoinDesk, Warner said that focusing solely on TVL misses the point, and that Ethereum is increasingly functioning as crypto\u2019s \u201cglobal settlement layer,\u201d a foundation for high-value issuance and institutional activity. Products like Franklin Templeton\u2019s tokenized funds or BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL product launch directly on Ethereum L1 \u2014 activity that isn\u2019t fully captured in DeFi metrics but underscores Ethereum\u2019s role as the bedrock of crypto finance.\n``Ethereum as a layer-1 blockchain is the secure but relatively slow and expensive base network. Layer-2s are scaling networks built on top of it, designed to handle transactions faster and at a fraction of the cost before ultimately settling back to Ethereum for security. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve become so appealing to traders and builders alike. Metrics like TVL, the amount of crypto deposited in DeFi protocols, highlight this shift, as activity is moved to L2s where lower fees and quicker confirmations make everyday DeFi far more practical.\n``Warner likens Ethereum\u2019s place in the ecosystem to a wire transfer in traditional finance: trusted, secure and used for large-scale settlement. Everyday transactions, however, are migrating to L2s \u2014 the Venmos and PayPals of crypto.\n``\u201cEthereum was never going to be a monolithic blockchain with all the activity happening on it,\u201d Warner told CoinDesk. Instead, it\u2019s meant to anchor security while enabling rollups to execute faster, cheaper and more diverse applications.\n``Layer 2s, which have exploded over the last few years because they are seen as the faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum, enable whole categories of DeFi that don\u2019t function as well on mainnet. Fast-paced trading strategies, like arbitraging price differences between exchanges or running perpetual futures, don\u2019t work well on Ethereum\u2019s slower 12-second blocks. But on Arbitrum, where transactions finalize in under a second, those same strategies become possible, Warner explained. This is apparent, as Ethereum has had fewer than 50 million transactions over the last month, compared to Base\u2019s 328 million transactions and Arbitrum\u2019s 77 million transactions, according to L2Beat."

                "body": "While Ethereum (ETH) is cementing itself as the backbone of decentralized finance, a dark horse token is rapidly taking center stage. Underdog token Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new lending and borrowing DeFi protocol, is trending with its staggering 5000% ROI potential. Mutuum Finance has already done 5 presales with the sixth one still ongoing with a price of $0.035. Investors purchasing tokens will have a humongous ROI once the coin has been available in the open markets.\nPresale already has 16320 holders and more than $15.80 million. While Ethereum continues to serve as the underlying layer for DeFi infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as more than yet another project riding on the industry trend. Its innovative model and real-life application are turning MUTM into the story investors can\u2019t afford to miss.\nEthereum Price Consolidates Amid Rate Cuts and Market Rotation\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at $4,665.94 with a 24hr range of $4,614.47 and $4,739.56. Despite recent spikes, ETH has entered a consolidation phase in which most of its price appreciation has been restrained by profit-taking and overall market caution. Its application in DeFi, staking, and smart contracts continues to underpin longer-term demand, particularly with macroeconomic factors such as expected rate cuts acting as tailwinds.\nWith its large market cap and sophisticated infrastructure, ETH\u2019s upside in the coming cycle may be far-reaching but slower-paced than that of smaller, faster-growing protocols. In contrast, newer DeFi platform Mutuum Finance are being eyed by traders as having the potential for more hyperbolic gains in today\u2019s market environment.\nCertiK and Mutuum Finance launch $50,000 Bug bounty\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program to encourage developers, security experts and ethical hackers to come and engage in bug hunting for the project. When they identify and report the vulnerabilities which can compromise the security of the protocol that they are, they are rewarded.\nThe reward will depend on the seriousness of the problem, from simple bugs to serious vulnerabilities. This will not only secure the protocol but also users and increase confidence in the investors.\nLiquidity Management, Volatility and Market risk\nIt is a more sophisticated model that Mutuum Finance has integrated in an attempt to reduce the market risk, volatility, and stability of their systems even under liquidity pressure. Liquidity depth and Loan to Value (LTV) will be changed based on the context of the market. The policies are conservative when there is high volatility in an attempt to reduce the risk exposure and less elastic under stability.\nThe deployment of reserve funds also prescribes, and it increases proportionally with the level of risks to insure the stakeholders.\nBuilding a Borderless, Interoperable and Open-source Ecosystem\nBesides technical security, Mutuum Finance will also establish a community-oriented DeFi platform. Its presale buy, system security audits and reward mechanisms are all targeted at the duality of the project i.e. long-term solidity and participatory community activity. Mutuum Finance is a safe and scalable DeFi platform.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the thunder from Ethereum (ETH) with its growth prospects. Stage 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, with over $15.80M raised and 16,320 holders established already. 5000% ROI post-listing are predicted by analysts, fueled by its dual lending model, $50K CertiK bug bounty, and advanced liquidity management. As Ethereum holds firm at approximately $4,665, with consistent long-term appreciation, MUTM provides early-in value that\u2019s difficult to dismiss. Lock in Stage 6 tokens today, before prices increase during the next stage.\nFor further information on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance"

                "body": "The financial world has witnessed a seismic shift with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) landmark approval of Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These approvals, unfolding in January and July of 2024 respectively, have not only opened the floodgates for billions in institutional capital but have also unequivocally legitimized crypto assets within the hallowed halls of traditional finance. This transformative development marks a new chapter for digital assets, integrating them into mainstream investment portfolios and signaling a profound evolution in how Wall Street views the decentralized future of money.\nA New Era of Accessibility: What Happened and Why It Matters\nThe journey to this pivotal moment was protracted, marked by over a decade of rejections and persistent advocacy from the crypto industry. The U.S. SEC finally approved the listing and trading of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024, with trading commencing the very next day. This decision followed intense pressure, including a significant legal victory by Grayscale (OTCQX: GBTC) against the SEC, which forced the agency to reconsider its stance. Major players like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Fidelity (NYSE: FDEL), and ARK 21Shares were among the first to launch these products.\nThe approval for spot Ethereum ETFs followed a two-step process. The SEC first greenlit the \"19b-4\" rule change applications on May 23, 2024, allowing for the listing and trading of these ETFs. Subsequently, the final \"S-1\" registration statements were approved on July 22, 2024, enabling trading to begin on July 23, 2024. Approximately eight spot Ether ETFs were approved, including offerings from Grayscale, Bitwise, and BlackRock. Notably, these Ethereum ETFs were amended to preclude any staking of Ether, addressing specific regulatory concerns.\nThe immediate impact has been staggering. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a collective trading volume of $4 billion on their first day and attracted over $50 billion in institutional money within the first quarter of 2025, climbing to $134.6 billion in assets under management (AUM) by the third quarter. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone amassed over $50 billion in assets within 11 months, setting a record for the fastest ETF growth in history. Ethereum ETFs, while newer, have mirrored this success, drawing $3.87 billion in net inflows by August 2025 and pushing their total AUM to a new peak of $12.1 billion by July 2025. These inflows have significantly bolstered market sentiment, propelling Bitcoin and Ethereum prices to new highs and validating their status as serious investment vehicles.\nThis regulatory embrace has profoundly legitimized crypto assets. By providing a regulated and accessible pathway through traditional brokerage accounts, these ETFs address previous concerns about custody, security, and transparency. This accessibility has attracted a broader range of investors, from traditional asset managers to pension funds, dismantling the \"wild west\" stigma once associated with cryptocurrencies. Digital assets are now increasingly treated as strategic asset classes, comparable to gold or equities, marking a structural shift that firmly integrates them into mainstream financial portfolios.\nThe Shifting Sands: Winners and Losers in the ETF Era\nThe advent of Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has created a clear delineation of winners and those facing new challenges across the financial ecosystem.\nLeading the charge among the winners are the asset management firms that launched these pioneering ETFs. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) has emerged as a titan in this space, with its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) quickly surpassing $80 billion in AUM and generating substantial fee revenue. BlackRock has also become a key player in Ethereum ETFs with its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). Fidelity (NYSE: FDEL) with its Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Grayscale (OTCQX: GBTC), despite initial outflows from its converted Bitcoin "

This strategic pre-positioning by \"smart money\" underscores a profound shift in how traditional finance views high-performance Layer 1 blockchains, validating Solana's technological prowess and its burgeoning ecosystem. This wave of institutional capital is not merely speculative; it signals a long-term belief in Solana's potential to become a cornerstone of the digital economy, promising enhanced liquidity, legitimacy, and potentially substantial price appreciation for SOL in the coming months and years.\nInstitutional Frenzy: Why Giants are Betting Big on Solana\nA remarkable shift in institutional investment strategy is currently underway, with major players aggressively building their Solana holdings. This institutional embrace is a direct precursor to the expected U.S. spot Solana ETF approval, mirroring the capital inflows that preceded the greenlighting of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.\nLeading this charge are several prominent firms, each making substantial commitments:\n- Forward Industries (NASDAQ: FORD): This Nasdaq-listed company has aggressively pivoted its strategy, acquiring and staking over 6.8 million SOL tokens, valued at approximately $1.58 billion. This makes Forward Industries the largest publicly listed corporate holder of Solana. Their initiative, backed by contributions from Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, aims to build and manage the world's largest Solana treasury and deploy corporate funds into Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, signaling a long-term commitment.\n- Galaxy Digital: Led by Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital has embarked on a significant Solana buying spree, accumulating over $1.5 billion worth of SOL (approximately 6.5 million tokens) in a short period, including a single-day purchase of $306 million. Galaxy Digital also played a leading role in Forward Industries' $1.65 billion private placement. Novogratz has expressed strong optimism, characterizing the current period as the \"season of Solana.\"\n- Pantera Capital: The venture capital firm has committed $1.1 billion to Solana, making SOL its largest position in digital assets, surpassing even Bitcoin and Ethereum. Pantera's CEO, Dan Morehead, highlighted Solana's superior performance and efficiency, and the firm is also involved in the Helius Solana Treasury, supporting SOL as a reserve asset for public companies.\nBeyond these examples, Solana treasuries have collectively accumulated nearly 9 million SOL, amounting to approximately $2 billion, since April 2025, representing 1.55% of Solana's total circulating supply. Overall, Solana-based corporate treasuries now exceed $4 billion, holding 17.11 million tokens, or nearly 3% of the total circulating supply, demonstrating widespread institutional confidence.\nThis robust accumulation is intricately linked to the growing anticipation of a U.S. spot Solana ETF. The pattern mirrors historical institutional interest preceding Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals, with market observers viewing Solana as the next in line. Such an ETF would validate Solana's legitimacy, enhance accessibility for traditional investors, and is expected to unleash a \"torrent of institutional capital,\" potentially boosting SOL's price by 30-50% in the immediate aftermath of approval.\nA New Hierarchy: Winners and Losers in the Solana Surge\nThe institutional accumulation of Solana (SOL) and the impending approval of a U.S. spot Solana ETF are poised to dramatically redraw the lines of competition and opportunity within the cryptocurrency landscape, creating clear winners and challenging existing structures.\nThe most direct beneficiary is Solana (SOL) itself and its expansive ecosystem. Increased accessibility through an ETF will drive demand, boosting SOL's liquidit"

The network's recent achievement of reaching $34 billion in Total Value Locked represents a significant milestone that underscores its growing dominance in the decentralized finance space and provides a strong foundation for future price appreciation.\nSolana (SOL) Price Strengthens with DeFi Expansion\nSolana keeps proving its strength as a top DeFi network. The latest numbers show Solana's TVL has hit a record $34 billion - that's almost 200% growth from last year. This massive jump shows people are really confident in what Solana can do.\nCrypto analyst @CryptosRUs pointed out that this isn't just good news for the ecosystem - it's also a solid reason why SOL's price could keep climbing. The steady increase in DeFi activity suggests Solana might be hitting a new level of mainstream adoption that could drive the price even higher.\nSOL Price Outlook: Ecosystem Leaders Drive Growth\nSolana's success comes from its top protocols growing fast. Circle, Kamino, Jupiter, Jito, and Sanctum are leading the charge, while established names like Raydium, Marinade, Drift Protocol, and Orca keep providing solid liquidity options. Big institutional players like BlackRock, VanEck, and PayPal joining the ecosystem makes it even more credible.\nThis variety of apps is crucial for keeping Solana's growth going without relying too heavily on just one protocol. Analysts think if this pace continues, Solana's TVL could hit $40 billion soon, putting it in an even stronger position against Ethereum and other major blockchains.\nBesides the TVL numbers, Solana has built a reputation as one of the fastest and cheapest blockchains out there. Its ability to process tons of transactions quickly and cheaply has attracted developers, DeFi projects, and even traditional finance companies looking into digital assets.\nFor investors, the picture is pretty clear: Solana's $34 billion TVL milestone shows exponential growth, making a strong case for SOL's price to keep rising. If market conditions stay positive, analysts believe Solana could be entering a new bull run powered by its rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem."

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite failed to score any fresh gain Tuesday too, after closing at record on Monday.\nCytokinetics' shares rose roughly 1% in after-hours trading on Tuesday, shortly after the biopharmaceutical company announced it plans to raise up to $550 million through an offering of convertible senior notes due in 2031.\n\u2014 Liz Napolitano\nStocks could fall if the Fed adopts a less dovish stance than expected over the coming months, Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates at Societe Generale, said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Fast Money.\"\n\"You could see an unwind\u2026if there's a sense that the Fed is not willing to act as aggressively as the market is pricing in,\" Rajappa said.\nThe Fed will provide more insight into its rate outlook this week when it releases its widely followed \"dot plot\" grid.\n\u2014 Liz Napolitano\nStock futures were little changed Tuesday night to start the session, as traders braced for the Fed's key policy announcement.\nContracts tied to the major averages hovered around the flatline after a session in which the S&P 500 hit an intraday high.\n-- Fred Imbert"

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will wrap up two days of deliberations on Wednesday and deliver what is broadly expected to be the Fed\u2019s first interest rate cut since pausing rate moves in January.\nRate cuts incoming, but how many?\nA quarter-point interest rate cut is widely anticipated this week, but the key datapoint for markets will be the FOMC\u2019s update to its Summary of Economic Projections, or dot plot of policymakers\u2019 own interest rate expectations. Three straight rate cuts through the rest of the year are baked into interest rate markets, and investors will be looking for the Fed to play ball.\nUS Retail Sales came in much stronger than expected, rising 0.6% for the second month in a row in August. Core Retail Sales also accelerated to 0.7% MoM. However, Retail Sales data doesn\u2019t differentiate between price changes or an actual increase in sales volume. August\u2019s retail data pleased both sides of the interest rate discussion: strong retail activity, coupled with slumping hiring data, gives the Fed more runway to cut interest rates. Meanwhile, the no-cut camp will point to retail upswings to show that a tariff-fueled resurgence of inflation is a real and growing problem within the US economy.\nDow Jones daily chart\nDow Jones FAQs\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the oldest stock market indices in the world, is compiled of the 30 most traded stocks in the US. The index is price-weighted rather than weighted by capitalization. It is calculated by summing the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing them by a factor, currently 0.152. The index was founded by Charles Dow, who also founded the Wall Street Journal. In later years it has been criticized for not being broadly representative enough because it only tracks 30 conglomerates, unlike broader indices such as the S&P 500.\nMany different factors drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The aggregate performance of the component companies revealed in quarterly company earnings reports is the main one. US and global macroeconomic data also contributes as it impacts on investor sentiment. The level of interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve (Fed), also influences the DJIA as it affects the cost of credit, on which many corporations are heavily reliant. Therefore, inflation can be a major driver as well as other metrics which impact the Fed decisions.\nDow Theory is a method for identifying the primary trend of the stock market developed by Charles Dow. A key step is to compare the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) and only follow trends where both are moving in the same direction. Volume is a confirmatory criteria. The theory uses elements of peak and trough analysis. Dow\u2019s theory posits three trend phases: accumulation, when smart money starts buying or selling; public participation, when the wider public joins in; and distribution, when the smart money exits.\nThere are a number of ways to trade the DJIA. One is to use ETFs which allow investors to trade the DJIA as a single security, rather than having to buy shares in all 30 constituent companies. A leading example is the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA). DJIA futures contracts enable traders to speculate on the future value of the index and Options provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the index at a predetermined price in the future. Mutual funds enable investors to buy a share of a diversified portfolio of DJIA stocks thus providing ex"

Shares fell 3.4%, leading pharma and biotech stocks down 2.6% and putting pressure on the broader FTSE 100, which edged 0.12% lower. A firmer pound added extra weight, hitting export-focused companies. But good news wasn\u2019t entirely in short supply: Sainsbury\u2019s shares jumped to a four-year high\u2014up 5%\u2014after dropping talks to sell Argos to JD.com, while AO World soared 11.3% on its first-ever share buyback and brighter profit outlook. With the FTSE 250 benefiting from this domestic confidence and investors gearing up for key central bank decisions, focus is shifting to how the Bank of England will steer policy amid ongoing inflation.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Retail resilience shines through pharma worries.\nAstrazeneca\u2019s retreat cast a shadow over the FTSE 100 and made clear just how much heavyweight sectors can stir up the broader market. But domestic momentum has been strong: positive updates from Sainsbury and AO World helped the FTSE 250 outperform, offering a glimpse of optimism even when blue-chips stumble. Central bank decisions could fuel ongoing volatility, but resilient retailers show there\u2019s still upside if you know where to look.\nThe bigger picture: Investment signals point to bigger UK shifts.\nThe UK\u2019s ability to attract blockbuster investment is under scrutiny as big pharma pump the brakes on growth, putting a spotlight on the need for clear policies and attractive business conditions. Meanwhile, new tech and civil nuclear deals with the US\u2014and negotiations over steel tariffs\u2014reflect an effort to strengthen global economic ties. These shifts, combined with looming monetary policy decisions, could steer how the UK navigates capital inflows and economic challenges moving forward.\nNew York\u2019s the city that never sleeps.

It jumped to a record high of \u00a39.343, up by over 23% from its lowest level this week. This article highlights some of the top catalysts that may drive the Footsie Index this week.\nUK jobs, inflation, and retail sales data\nCopy link to sectionThe first main catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming UK consumer jobs numbers on Tuesday. Economists expect the upcoming jobs report to show that the economy added 158k jobs in the three months to July, much lower than the previous 238k.\nThey expect the data to reveal that the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.7%, while the average earnings rose by 4.8%.\nThe other main catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming UK consumer inflation data on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the upcoming data to reveal that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 3.9% in August from 3.8%, while the core CPI slowed to 3.7%.\nThese numbers will confirm that the UK is in a period of stagflation, which is characterized by a high inflation rate and slow economic growth. It is normally a central bank\u2019s worst nightmare because there is usually no good response mechanism.\nThe ONS will then publish the latest retail sales data on Friday. These numbers will provide more information about the health of the economy.\nBank of England interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision on Thursday.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the bank to take the UK inflation and jobs numbers into consideration when making these decisions.\nMost analysts see the bank leaving interest rates unchanged at 4% as cutting interest rates to boost the economy will likely have a negative effect on inflation.\nThere will be two key drivers for the FTSE 100 and sterling in this decision. First, they will react to a news on quantitative tightening in the UK, with analysts expecting the annual figure to be between \u00a3380 billion and \u00a3550 billion this year.\nSecond, the vote split will be watched closely as investors reflect on what to expect later this year. Market participants expect either one or no interest rate cuts this year.\nRead more: Bank of England cuts rates to 4% in historic split vote\nUK Gilt yields\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index is the performance of the UK bond market, commonly known as gilts.\nData shows that the 10-year yield has eased to 4.65%, while the 30-year one dropped to 5.48%, down from the year-to-date high of 5.75%.\nA hawkish Bank of England decision will likely lead to higher yields, which will likely impact the stock market. Historically, investors tend to move to the bond market when yields rise.\nFederal Reserve interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index is the upcoming Federal Reserve interest decision on Wednesday.\nThis will be an important decision as it will be the first time that the central bank slashes interest rates this year.\nA Fed cut may positively impact American and global equities. However, the risk is that the interest rate cuts have already been priced in."

An election within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pick a new leader is expected Oct. 4. Candidates include Shinjiro Koizumi, the farm minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Another is Sanae Takaichi, who could become Japan's first woman prime minister.\nIt's not clear if the chosen ruling party chief can become the nation's leader, as the party does not have a majority in Parliament and must forge a coalition with smaller parties.\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.3% to 8,877.70.

He did not disclose the terms of the agreement.\nThe market\u2019s main event for the week will arrive on Wednesday. That\u2019s when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. A rate cut could give a kickstart to the job market, which has been slowing. But markets are in for a disappointment if the cut doesn't come.\nThe next economic update will arrive Tuesday, when the U.S. government will say how much shoppers spent at U.S. retailers last month.\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell 18 cents to $63.12 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 19 cents to $67.25 a barrel.\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 147.08 Japanese yen from 147.33 yen.

                "body": "Stocks ended slightly lower Tuesday, a day before the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both ended down roughly 0.1% after each set a fresh all-time intraday high soon after markets opened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3% lower.\nWall Street is overwhelmingly confident that the Fed will lower borrowing costs for the first time this year when it concludes its policy meeting Wednesday. Traders are pricing in a 96% chance that central bankers will cut the rate by a quarter of a point, to 4.00%-4.25%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data.\nBefore markets opened Tuesday, Census Bureau data revealed U.S retail sales rose 0.6% month-over-month in August, while economists had anticipated a 0.3% rise, further evidence that tariffs haven't yet significantly weighed on consumer spending. Retail sales figures for July were revised up to 0.6% growth from the initial reading of 0.5% last month.\nOracle (ORCL) shares closed up 1.5% on expectations the tech giant would be involved in a deal that would allow Chinese-owned TikTok to avoid being banned in the U.S. Oracle chair and co-founder Larry Ellison has close ties to President Donald Trump.\nTesla (TSLA) shares rose 2.8% following a 3.6% advance Monday after a regulatory filing showed CEO Elon Musk bought $1 billion of stock, which was seen as a demonstration of Musk's commitment to the electric vehicle maker. Tesla's board recently proposed awarding Musk a pay package that could top $1 trillion.\nShares of Alphabet (GOOGL) ended 0.2% lower following yesterday's 4.5% surge that pushed its market capitalization above $3 trillion, making it the fourth company to achieve the milestone.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which affects borrowing costs on a variety of consumer and commercial loans, slipped to 4.03% from 4.04% at Monday's close. Gold futures hit a fresh all-time high Tuesday and were up 0.2% to above $3,725 at 4 p.m. ET. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were 2% higher at around $64.55. Bitcoin was more than 1% higher at nearly $117,000. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, was down 0.6% to 96.69.\nBiggest S&P 500 Movers on Tuesday\nDecliners\n- Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares tumbled 6.2%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock. With the downturn on Tuesday, the stock gave back a portion of the massive gains posted last week after reports that industry rival Paramount Skydance (PSKY) was considering a buyout bid. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) criticized the potential takeover, and TD Cowen analysts downgraded Warner Bros. Discovery stock to \"hold\" from \"buy,\" noting the recent run-up may not be sustainable if a deal between the two media giants fails to materialize. Paramount Skydance shares dropped 5.7%.\n- Shares of Emerson Electric (EMR) declined 4.9% after the industrial automation firm said it now expects full-year sales to come in at the low end of its previous forecast. The company cited headwinds in China and Europe as factors behind its more modest expectations.\nAdvancers\n- Crude oil futures moved higher as strikes on key Russian production facilities by Ukrainian drones raised concerns about global supply and traders positioned themselves ahead of this week's anticipated interest-rate cuts. Shares of exploration and production APA Corp. (APA) surged 7% to log the day's top performance in the S&P 500. Shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) were up 5%, and other oil producers also rose.\n- Steel Dynamics (STLD) issued stronger-than-expected outlook for its third quarter, and its shares jumped 6.1%. The steelmaker highlighted strong demand in the residential construction, automotive, energy, and industrial sectors, along with an anticipated boost to profitability from a more favorable metal spread, with scrap raw material costs falling faster than aver"

                "body": "Who Makes Decisions About Vaccine Policy Now?\nFor decades, as an activist, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. resisted the scientific consensus that vaccines are safe and necessary to prevent serious disease. Now at the helm of the nation\u2019s health department, he has begun to put his extreme views into practice, ousting veteran scientists and installing allies across the nation\u2019s health agencies to enact major shifts in vaccine policy.\nSome of Mr. Kennedy\u2019s hires are activists who have worked for years alongside him. Others are scientists who say they broadly support vaccines but publicly criticized Covid shots or mandates during the pandemic. Many of these scientists have begun to question the safety or value of other shots, reflecting the views of Mr. Kennedy. The following account is based on previous statements made by these officials and on interviews with current and former health agency leaders.\nThe agency\u2019s new vaccine lead and chief medical officer, Dr. Vinay Prasad, has called himself an \u201cextreme pro-vaccine person,\u201d and Dr. Marty Makary, the agency\u2019s commissioner, said last week that \u201cwe believe in vaccines.\u201d\nBut the two officials, who sharply criticized vaccine mandates as academic researchers during the pandemic, have expressed doubts about the safety and necessity of Covid boosters for healthy children and adults. This summer, Dr. Prasad overrode some agency scientists who favored widespread access to Covid shots, narrowing the vaccine\u2019s eligibility to those 65 and older and to younger people with underlying medical conditions.\nLast week, Dr. Makary echoed the views of Mr. Kennedy when he publicly questioned the longstanding recommendation to give the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. That shot is credited with nearly eliminating the transmission of the disease from mother to infant.\nDr. Prasad replaced a veteran at the agency, Dr. Peter Marks, who resigned in March and said that Mr. Kennedy\u2019s aggressive stance on vaccines posed a danger to the public.\nIn June, Mr. Kennedy fired all 17 members of a powerful C.D.C. expert panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Insurance companies and government programs like Medicaid are required to cover the vaccinations that the panel recommends.\nMr. Kennedy handpicked eight new members that month, half of whom had expressed skepticism of vaccines at some point. (One has since stepped down.) Others have little expertise in immunology or vaccines.\nOn Monday, Mr. Kennedy appointed five more members, just days before the group meets to review recommendations for multiple vaccines. Some of the newly selected members have been critical of Covid vaccines or vaccine mandates.\nDr. Robert Malone is a controversial figure. He performed early experiments using mRNA in the 1980s but gained notoriety during the pandemic for claiming that Covid vaccines were unsafe, contradicting volumes of studies.\nMartin Kulldorff, a biostatistician, has been generally supportive of vaccines but opposed Covid vaccination for children and vaccine mandates. Vicky Pebsworth, a nurse with a doctorate in public health, serves on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, a nonprofit that disseminates misinformation about the risks of vaccination.\nDr. Malone and Dr. Kulldorff have served as paid expert witnesses in legal cases against vaccine makers. Dr. Pebsworth claimed in a lawsuit that a survey of families of unvaccinated children supported a hypothesis that a rise in the number of recommended childhood vaccines explained an epidemic of chronic disease.\nAnother panel member, Retsef Levi, is a management and health analytics expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has been critical of a variety of vaccines and has called for Covid vaccines to be pulled from the market.\nDr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician and gynecologist, questioned the safety and effectiveness of Covid vaccines in a hearing in the Louisiana House of Representatives in 2021.

                "body": "A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying until age 4 the hepatitis B vaccine that\u2019s currently given to newborns, according to two former senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials.\n\u201cThere is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life,\u201d said Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. \u201cApparently this is a priority of the secretary\u2019s.\u201d\nThe vote is expected to take place during the next meeting of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled for Sept. 18-19.\nFor more than 30 years, the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended for infants shortly after birth. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Pediatricians warn that waiting four years for the vaccine opens the door to more children contracting the virus.\n\u201cAge 4 makes zero sense,\u201d pediatrician Eric Ball said. \u201cWe recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It\u2019s really the best way to keep our entire population healthy.\u201d\nIn addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel will also discuss and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine and covid-19 vaccines. Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, leaving them vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.\nTypically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.\n\u201cThis is an atypical situation. There\u2019s been no work group to discuss it,\u201d Daskalakis said.\nThe second former senior official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on the condition of anonymity.\nIn response to questions from KFF Health News, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote, \u201cACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science.\u201d\nThe draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public less than a week before it is scheduled to begin.\nAt the last ACIP meeting, in June, Martin Kulldorff, the chair and one of seven new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread. Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for opposing some public health measures during the pandemic.\n\u201cUnless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use,\u201d he said.\nThe virus spreads via direct exposure to an infected bodily fluid like blood or semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers have hepatitis B or are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.\nProtection From Birth\nIn 1991, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. While parents may opt out of the shots, many day care centers and school districts require proof of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.\nThe prospect of ACIP\u2019s altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus "

                "body": "Fantasy Football: Brian Thomas Jr.'s worrisome start has a silver lining, and 9 other stats from Week 2 that stood out\nEach Monday, fantasy football analyst Joel Smyth will go over 10 important stats that you may have overlooked from Sunday. With so much going on, what keys to fantasy success are dug up that the masses may miss?\n35.7%\nBrian Thomas Jr\u2019s target share after Jarrian Jones left the game. Jones is a starting CB for Jacksonville, which, in most cases, usually doesn\u2019t affect fantasy stock when an injury happens to your own team\u2019s corner. However, in this case, it is notable that Travis Hunter started playing a majority of the Jaguars\u2019 defensive snaps due to the injury.\nCall me crazy, but I\u2019m not completely out on Thomas after the first couple of weeks. Twelve targets, two end-zone targets and 258 air yards in Week 2 is as good of volume as it gets.\nThe result wasn\u2019t pretty, but it wasn\u2019t for the same reason as Week 1. Last week, Trevor Lawrence only delivered three catchable targets to Thomas, whereas this week, plays were available to be made but just came up short in big moments.\nThe chemistry and on-field communication need improvement. The talent is there, though, and the Jaguars are still adapting to a fresh offense. Although on the surface it doesn\u2019t look like it, I believe Game 2 was a step in the right direction.\n9.5%\nMark Andrews targets per route this season. Bad. It\u2019s hard to find the silver lining when the excuses are no longer there. Andrews is healthy, running plenty of routes and is playing without TE2 Isaiah Likely. Andrews' route percentage increased from a very low 59% in 2024 to his old regular 76% in 2025.\nPart of it comes from natural TD regression. He scored nine touchdowns on nine end-zone targets last year, so already not scoring on his end-zone target Sunday is somewhat expected. But it\u2019s much more than that. He has been completely limited to a safety option rather than a downfield target.\nThrough two games, his air yards sit at 10. Ten air yards. Most players get that on a single target.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be this bad for the entire season, but with Likely returning and Andrews being ultra-TD-dependent, I\u2019ll look elsewhere at the position in fantasy.\n[Upgrade to Fantasy Plus and gain your edge in player projections and much more]\n55.5%\nBhayshul Tuten\u2019s touches per snap. Not all backup running backs are the same. Some, say LeQuint Allen Jr., are on the field to give the starter a breather, maybe have a pass-blocking role or take the 3rd & 15 carries. That is NOT Bhayshul Tuten. He only played 25.7% of snaps in the first game without RB Tank Bigsby, but when he was on the field, he was the focal point of the offense.\nHe wasn\u2019t just giving Travis Etienne Jr. a breather. He played in the red zone at points, got a designed screen and started the second drive of the game. The point? His usage was not an accident. I by no means think Etienne is done for, but I do believe Tuten\u2019s role will only grow from here.\n100%\nQuinshon Judkins plays with a route or carry. Another rookie as the focal point. Judkins was very similar to Tuten, playing only 18 snaps, where on the eight passing plays in which he wasn\u2019t given the rushing attempt, he ran 100% of routes and was targeted three times. He led the team in touches despite Jerome Ford playing two times the RB snaps.\nRookie RB Dylan Sampson looks to be no more than a backup as he saw half the amount of Judkins\u2019 touches on the same amount of snaps. Judkins should lead the committee RB room in a shaky offense. The upside potential as a talented rookie is there, but I would be hoping his usage increases to make him a flex value, rather than believing he can be a fantasy RB1.\n3\nHolding calls for TreVeyon Henderson. The Patriots promised he would get more touches, but when a rookie makes this many mistakes, it\u2019s hard to blame the coaches. Henderson came in as the perfect RB to avoid these types of issues, as he had no fumbles in college and was seen as a great pass-block"

                "body": "Chip shares lift Japan's Nikkei in countdown to Fed decision\nJapan's Nikkei share average edged higher on Wednesday, with chip-sector shares tracking an overnight rally among U.S. peers, ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve interest rate decision later in the day.\nThe tech-heavy Nikkei NI225 was up 0.2% at 44,977.44, as of 0140 GMT, inching back towards the previous session's record-high level of 45,055.38.\nThe broader Topix TOPIX, though, eased 0.4% to 3,155.67, after marking a record high on Tuesday.\nOvernight, the closely watched Philadelphia SE semiconductor index SOX rose 0.3% to an all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite IXIC and S&P 500 SPX also renewed record peaks, but closed the day lower.\nStocks have soared globally as traders cemented bets for a series of near-term U.S. rate cuts, beginning with one later on Wednesday. Market-implied odds signal at least two quarter-point cuts by year-end, and 96 basis points of reductions by end-March.\n\"The arithmetic is simple: the Fed needs to back up the dovishness currently discounted into the rates curve to keep stocks chugging along,\" said Kyle Rodda, an analyst at Capital.com.\n\"If the requisite dovishness is absent, that's when things could get spicy in the markets.\"\nChip-making equipment manufacturer Tokyo Electron 8035 climbed 6.3% on Wednesday to be the Nikkei's top performer. Shares of smaller peer Disco 6146 gained 2.8%.\nChip-testing equipment maker Advantest 6857 recovered from early losses to trade 0.5% higher.\nDespite a stronger yen against the U.S. dollar, which tends to weigh on exporters as it erodes the value of overseas revenue, Sony 6758 gained 1.3% and Toyota Motor 7203 rose 0.4%."
