Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre joining us now with the trading day takeaways. Jared.\nThank you, Josh. We had a couple of streaks end, they are no more. So that's my first bullet point here. Nasdaq Composite had six record closes in a row. This is a one-month chart, each little candlestick is one day, and here was the streak, boom, but that is over now. It just closed slightly in the red there. And the Nasdaq 100 had a streak of nine days. They weren't all records, but that is gone too. And I wanted to show you something else. Utilities had been up for five days, and then we got this today, and I didn't really see a huge catalyst there, but uh it might be something we're going to talk about next.\nYeah, let's talk dollars.\nYes. It was a pretty bad day for the dollar. So that's my point number two. The dollar nosedoved. I think that's the proper past tense. Nosedoved. But let's check out some of the charts here because the dollar has been hovering around three, four-year lows here and so we'll tackle that first, but there's a lot of stuff going on. Uh we know that it's been under pressure for the for quite some time. Here's the year to date, down 11.63%. That is a large amount for any currency to be down, not to mention the reserve currency of the world. But let's check out a five-year chart and you can see we are just touching the lowest level since about uh, go, since about 2022. And you can see there's not much keeping it from going lower there. So if we take the inverse of that, and this is going to be the euro versus the dollar, if you're planning on going to Europe, guess what, vacations are getting more expensive. 11, 12% more expensive already, and they could easily head, this exchange rate could go from 1.1868 up to 1.2, 1.25 pretty easily. So there are a lot of ramifications here. What's going on? Uh, real yields are coming down. There's the Fed which is in easing mode, and so you also have questions of Fed independence. I would note that Stephen Myron was just confirmed today, and so all of this is feeding into that dollar weakness. And foreigners, they still like US assets, they still like our stocks, but they are hedging, and so they're trying to prevent themselves from losing out on our gains by hedging that dollar risk, and that eats into the returns.\nSo if we talk to dollars, should we check out gold?\nYes, sir. And that brings me to my third point here, because gold hit another record and it finally crossed 3,700. So just inching closer day by day to that 4,000 mark. And let's plot what's going on there with the yellow metal. And it's not just gold, it's also some other things. We saw with big dollar weakness, you typically see commodities do fairly well. This is a five-year chart. I wasn't even planning on showing this, but that shows the 90% run-up that it's had in that time. Over the last year, up 40, 44%. And here is where that big breakout happened just uh under a month ago when it screamed higher after that nice consolidation. So we got gold heading higher. Silver futures were down today, but they've also been net up over the last year. You can see they kind of took off with gold up 40% and you can throw some other commodities in there as well.\nSo if we're talking gold, what about digital gold?\nAll right. I'm glad you said Bitcoin. I'm glad you almost said Bitcoin. All right, so Bitcoin has actually doubled over the last year. and uh 100% is nothing to sneeze at, but we haven't had a record high in"

The Fed is poised to lower the cost of money even though inflation stayed stubbornly high at an annual rate of 2.9% in August. In the past quarter century, gold has never declined in price when the central bank eases monetary policy at the same time as inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target, according to Bank of America's commodity analysts. \"In fact, even if we disregard the Global Financial Crisis , gold has returned around 13% annually during 'inflationary easing,'\" analysts led by Michael Widmer told clients in a report on Monday. Bank of America forecasts gold will hit $4,000 an ounce in 2026. Gold futures have gained more than 40% in 2025 alone, to reach $3,729 per ounce as of mid-morning Tuesday. Gold is also seeing strong demand from central banks, which now hold more of the precious metal than U.S. Treasuries, the analysts said. Global monetary authorities are increasingly worried about Fed independence under President Donald Trump, which has encouraged the acquisition of gold reserves, they said. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has slumped more than 10% in 2025 against a basket of leading trading partners' currencies .

The solutions we launch today will empower enterprises on their journey toward intelligence and globalization, ensuring sustainable and scalable growth.\u201d\nAt the summit, Tencent Cloud unveiled its Agent Development Platform 3.0, enabling companies to create autonomous AI agents and integrate them into operations such as customer service, marketing, inventory management, and research. The company also introduced its Agent Runtime infrastructure, designed to provide a robust environment for developing and deploying these agents.\nTencent expanded its SaaS+AI suite, adding advanced office collaboration tools. These include AI Minutes within Tencent Meetings, which recorded 150% year-on-year growth, and Learn Share, now used by more than 300,000 clients with a 92% accuracy rate. Another highlight was Code Buddy, an AI programming tool that cuts coding time by 40% and boosts R&D efficiency by 16%.\nThe company also launched new models in its Hunyuan 3D series, offering advanced 3D content generation for media and gaming. With more than 2.6 million downloads on Hugging Face, Hunyuan has become the most widely adopted open-source 3D model series.\nOver the past year, the Hunyuan ecosystem has expanded with more than 30 models, including translation tools covering 30+ languages, as well as image, video, and 3D content generation tools.\nExpanding global footprint\nTencent Cloud reported that its international customer base has doubled in the past year, with double-digit growth across Asia over the last three years in markets such as Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and Japan. More than 90% of China\u2019s leading internet companies and 95% of its top gaming firms now rely on Tencent Cloud to power their overseas growth.\nDay one of the summit featured discussions with global partners including UAE-based e&, Indonesia\u2019s Dana, GoTo Group, and MUFG Bank (China). Executives highlighted the importance of adopting AI and cloud solutions to drive global competitiveness.\nTencent also announced a series of new partnerships across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Europe, and North America. Notably, it revealed plans to invest $150 million in its first Middle East data center in Saudi Arabia, while building a third data center in Osaka, Japan, alongside a new regional office.\nAlongside its technology push, Tencent plans to raise about $1 billion by issuing offshore yuan-denominated \u201cdim sum\u201d bonds in three tranches (5, 10, and 30 years).

With the U.S. interest rate outlook more influential on the pair\u2019s recent movements than yield differentials or shifts in outright European yields, whether the Fed can meet or exceed dovish market pricing may determine whether a retest of the July highs sinks or swims.\nEUR/USD Tests Final Hurdle before July Highs\nHaving traded in a sideways range for more than a month following the release of the July U.S. nonfarm payrolls report at the start of August, the latest leg higher kicked off following a bounce from the intersection of the 50-day moving average and uptrend running from the August lows, delivering a bullish key reversal candle on the daily. The signal proved to be a reliable one, seeing EUR/USD push higher in the subsequent days, testing the July 24 high of 1.1788 in Asia on Tuesday.\nSource: TradingView\nThat\u2019s the first topside level of note, with a clean break above putting the pair on a potential collision course with the July high of 1.1832. Should EUR/USD fail at 1.1788, uptrend support is found at 1.1700 today. Considering the coiling pattern of recent weeks resembles a bear wedge, a break of the latter points to a possible deeper flush, putting the 50-day moving average, 1.1600 support, or even the July swing low in play.\nMomentum indicators favour upside over downside, with RSI (14) continuing to trend higher above 50, a bullish signal confirmed by MACD which has already staged a bullish crossover in positive territory. The message is one of building bullish momentum, improving the odds of topside breaks sticking.\nWhile the European calendar is relatively busy on Tuesday, most events screen as noise rather than signal when it comes to near-term directional risks. What\u2019s more important for EUR/USD is today\u2019s U.S. retail sales report and the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday. With markets priced for the funds rate to bottom around 3% this cycle, it may require either the Fed to communicate a need to push rates into stimulatory territory\u2014which seems unlikely\u2014or a definitive signal from U.S. economic data that activity is rolling over, to spark a meaningful leg higher for the euro.\nStoneX Europe Ltd may make third party material available on this website which may contain information included but not limited to the conditions of financial markets.

The pair has rallied nearly 2% from last Friday's lows, as investors anticipated a quarter-point rate cut to be announced at 18:00 GMT and one or two more reductions before the end of the year.\nThe weak US labour data seen in recent weeks, coupled with moderate inflationary pressures, has boosted monetary easing bets. The ball is now in the Fed's court, and a rate cut is pretty much a done deal, but the dovishness of the bank's forward guidance might be overestimated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to refuse to commit to a certain rate path, which might jolt the risk rally. The Fed rate decision will be released at 18:00 GMT, while Powell's press conference will start at 18:30 GMT.\nUS data released on Tuesday revealed that Retail Sales increased more than expected in August, although the loosening labor market, the deteriorating outlook of the economy, and the increasing prices stemming from higher trade tariffs are weighing on consumer spending.\nIn Europe, the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) slowed down to a 0.1% monthly growth and 2% yearly advance in August, against market expectations of steady 0.2% and 2.1% respective readings. The core inflation, more relevant from the monetary policy perspective, has grown at 0.3% on the month and 2.3% year-on-year, unchanged from July.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily digest market movers: A cautious Fed stance might snap the risk rally\n- The US Dollar has been battered over the last few days as investors ramped up their bets for a dovish turn by the Federal Reserve. At this point, investors might be disappointed if the Fed fails to commit to investors' expectations and maintains that further monetary policy decisions will be data-dependent.\n- The Fed Board of Governors will include the former Trump economic advisor, Stephen Miran, who swore in on Tuesday, replacing Adriana Kugler. Governor Lisa Cook will also be on the board as a US court of appeals dismissed US President Donald Trump's bid to oust her.\n- On the macroeconomic front, Tuesday's data showed that US Retail Sales grew 0.6% in August and 5% from the same month last year, beating expectations of a 0.2% monthly increase and a 4.1% year-on-year growth. July's data was revised up to a 0.6% increase and a 4.1% yearly increment from previous estimations of 0.5% and 3.9%, respectively.\n- In Europe, the German ZEW Economic Sentiment Index improved to 37.3 in September from 34.7 in August, against the market consensus of a decline to 27.3. The Current Situation Index, on the other hand, deteriorated to -76.4 from -68.6 in the previous month, below the -75 reading forecasted by market analysts.\n- Likewise, the Eurozone's September ZEW Economic Sentiment Index showed an unexpected improvement to 26.1 from 25.1.

A smaller group of traders is positioning for a larger reduction.\nInvestors are focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference following the policy decision.\nHis remarks, along with the updated Summary of Economic Projections and the \u201cdot plot,\u201d will provide guidance on the rate path. \u201cThe dollar is trading with a heavy tone as investors brace for a dovish message from the Fed,\u201d said Karl Schamotta, Chief Market Strategist at Corpay.\nWeaker US employment indicators, including slower job growth and easing wage pressures, have added to the case for monetary easing. Market sentiment suggests the Fed will prioritize supporting growth, limiting near-term upside for the dollar.\nIn Europe, shifting dynamics in the Russia-Ukraine conflict have provided mixed support. Occasional safe-haven flows into the dollar may occur, but the dominant driver remains Fed policy expectations.\nTraders will look to Wednesday\u2019s decision and Powell\u2019s comments for direction. Until then, DXY remains vulnerable to downside pressures.\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is showing signs of a short-term rebound after touching support near 96.56. On the 4-hour chart, price is attempting to recover but remains capped below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at 96.87. The next resistance levels to monitor are 97.06 and 97.21, aligned with the 0.382 and 0.5 retracement zones.\nThe RSI is near 31, signaling oversold conditions, though momentum is still weak. A sustained move above 97.21 could shift sentiment toward a broader recovery, while failure to hold above 96.56 risks retesting lower supports around 96.20 and 95.99. Overall, the index remains in a downtrend but may see corrective upside in the near term.\nThe GBP/USD pair is holding within an upward channel, trading near $1.3640 after testing resistance around $1.3677. The price action shows momentum supported by the 50-period EMA at $1.3565, while the 200-period EMA remains lower at $1.3502, reflecting a bullish structure.\nThe RSI is hovering at 66, close to overbought territory, suggesting that upside momentum is strong but stretched. If buyers sustain control above $1.3640, the next target sits near $1.3713.\nOn the downside, a break below $1.3592 could trigger a correction toward $1.3551. Overall, the pair is trending higher, but resistance overhead may prompt consolidation before further gains.\nEUR/USD is trading around $1.1842, softening after testing resistance near $1.1878, which aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the recent swing. The pair earlier confirmed a breakout from a rising wedge, and that former resistance zone is now acting as support, reinforcing the broader bullish structure.\nThe RSI at 70 indicates overbought conditions, suggesting the potential for short-term consolidation. Immediate support is seen at $1.1811 and $1.1790, where the 50-EMA at $1.1749 also provides a dynamic floor.\nHolding these levels keeps buyers in control, with upside targets at $1.1912 and $1.1946.

Even though many of the levels will be cannon fodder for whatever the Fed meeting dishes up, it provides something akin to a blueprint for traders to assess potential setups before the release of Australia\u2019s August employment report, an event that has flown under the radar this week despite being a key data point that may determine whether the RBA cuts rates again.\nFOMC Vote Key\nA lot has already been written and said about the September FOMC decision, but with so many variables to consider, whether it will be useful to traders is questionable, so I\u2019ll keep it quick. With six cuts priced by the end of next year, markets are looking for very dovish forecasts and commentary to accompany what is likely to be a 25bp cut. Recent price action in rates and the USD says as much.\nSource: TradingView\nThat has arguably created asymmetric risks. Put simply, it may only take a modest hawkish surprise relative to pricing to spark a sizeable reversal of recent trends. But many traders already recognise that. Where this meeting differs from those in the past is the composition of the FOMC.\nWe saw a split in voting along political lines at the July meeting, with Trump appointees Waller and Bowman dissenting in favour of a 25bp cut. With Stephen Miran, another Trump appointee, voting this time, there is a perceived risk we could see the three members dissent in favour of a supersized cut if the rest of the committee opts for 25bp.\nIt\u2019s pure speculation, but even if the Fed\u2019s forecasts and commentary are less dovish than market pricing, a bloc of members voting along political lines could easily override the messaging. That may weigh on the USD and back end of the Treasury curve, fuelling concerns that policy will be set for reasons other than economics moving forward. But if those dissents don\u2019t materialise, a relief rally in U.S. assets hit hard by Fed independence concerns could be epic!\nUnless we see a 50bp move, the vote\u2014rather than the dot plot or Powell\u2019s press conference\u2014may prove the key piece of information to trade off.\nDon\u2019t Dismiss Aussie Jobs Impact\nAfter the Fed, attention among AUD/USD traders will quickly turn to the August jobs report. Labour force surveys often pass without fuss, but with the RBA\u2019s inflation forecasts underpinned by unemployment not exceeding 4.3% through 2027, the bar is low for more cuts should labour market conditions deteriorate. If unemployment were to rise, it would risk inflation undershooting. The opposite would apply if unemployment fell.\nSource: Bloomberg\nOn the back of stronger household consumption and sticky price pressures, swaps traders have pared expectations for how much easing the RBA will deliver this cycle. A 25bp cut in November is still highly favoured at 88%, with a full move priced by December. An additional cut beyond that is not yet deemed a lock. That\u2019s why, outside of quarterly CPI prints, labour market releases are now arguably the most important domestic reports.\nSource: Trading View\nIn August, employment is forecast to rise by 22,000, leaving the unemployment rate at 4.2% on unchanged participation at 67.0%. After a solid run for the Aussie against the dollar and crosses, directional risks now appear skewed towards a weaker outcome, sparking a larger market move.\nAUD/USD Calm Before Calamity\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at AUD/USD on the hourly chart, many of the clean lines will likely be destroyed "

Investors are cutting US Dollar short holdings ahead of the Fed decision, which is pushing most USD peers lower from relevant highs.\nAustralian Dollar trims gains as risk appetite falters\nThe Aussie rallied about 2.7% over the last two weeks as weak US employment data prompted investors to ramp up their bets on Fed monetary easing for the following months. Future markets are fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday, and the chances of two more cuts in October and December have risen beyond 70% from about 35% one month ago.\nUS data released on Tuesday showed that retail consumption remains resilient. August\u2019s Retail Sales increased 0.6%, beyond market expectations of a 0.2% growth, and July\u2019s data was revised up to a 0.6% rise from the 0.5% previously estimated.\nIn Australia, the focus is on the August Employment release, due on Thursday, for further insight into the RBA\u2019s next monetary policy decision. The Unemployment rate is expected to have remained steady at 4.2% but net employment growth is seen slowing down to 22K from 24.5K in July.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Traders are bracing for the Federal Reserve to deliver a 25bp cut while signalling the path for future easing, with market pricing leaning towards another 50bp of cuts by year-end. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan\u2019s upcoming meeting could add further volatility for the yen. Against this backdrop, USD/JPY shows signs of a bearish breakdown, while EUR/JPY and AUD/JPY retain bullish momentum.\nView related analysis:\n- EUR/USD and GBP/USD Outlook: Bullish Patterns Form as Dollar Wavers\n- USD/CAD, EUR/CAD Outlook: Canadian Dollar Bulls Flex Ahead Inflation\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD, GBP/AUD\n- EUR/USD, USD/JPY, VIX, Gold, Crude oil: COT Report Analysis\n- USD/JPY and Yen Crosses Analysis: Jobs Revision, Fed Cuts, Technical Outlook\nUS Dollar Weakness and Market Expectations for the Fed\nThe US dollar was the weakest FX major on Tuesday, with traders front-running expectations of a dovish Fed cut at this week\u2019s meeting. This, of course, raises the risk of a sharp bullish reversal in the USD should the Fed fail to support current market pricing of another 50bp of cuts this year, alongside the expected 25bp cut on Wednesday. That said, I do not expect the Fed to deliver a 50bp cut at this meeting\u2014partly to save face amid Trump\u2019s persistent pressure to cut, but mostly to avoid triggering unnecessary, widespread panic. Traders would likely view a 50bp cut as confirmation that the Fed is indeed behind the curve.\nSwiss Franc Strength: USD/CHF Hits Lowest Since 2015\nThe Swiss franc (CHF) was the strongest FX major, sending USD/CHF down 1% to its lowest level since January 2015\u2014the infamous day the Swiss National Bank (SNB) removed the franc\u2019s peg to the euro. This places the Swissy firmly below levels where the SNB has previously intervened to support its currency.\nEUR/USD Breaks Higher on Strong Data and Dovish Fed Bets\nEUR/USD reached a near four-year high on Tuesday on stronger-than-expected European data and pre-emptively dovish Fed bets against the US dollar ahead of the FOMC meeting. Germany\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment rose to 37.3, beating the 25.3 estimate and above the 34.7 prior. This marked its fifth consecutive expansion and places it well above its long-term average of 21.1.\nThe euro\u2019s 0.8% gain was its best day in over three weeks, bringing the July and October 2021 highs near 1.1908 and the 1.20 handle into focus for bulls, in line with my bullish bias. EUR/USD bulls have enjoyed a clean breakout from the inverted head and shoulders pattern.\nFX Majors Rundown\n- GBP/USD broke higher from its own inverted head and shoulders pattern, reaching a 2.5-year high.\n- AUD/USD rose 0.2% to its highest level since November, though resistance was predictably met around the 200-day averages and November high.\n- NZD/USD climbed to a 22-day high, though resistance at the August high of 0.5996 is nearby.\n- USD/JPY fell -0.6% and saw its most bearish daily close level since 23 July\n- USD/CAD continued lower in line with my bearish bias, with a move down to at least 1.36 now on the cards. While CPI came in below expectations\u2014keeping the Bank of Canada (BoC) on track for a 25bp cut later today\u2014it remains elevated enough to warrant caution on future cuts.\n- US dollar index (DXY) fell 0.7% to a two-month low, with a break of the July trough at 95.61 now in focus for bears.\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nFor several weeks I have noted that USD/JPY has been ranging between two weekly volume points of control (VPOCs). As is often the case with ranges, there have been several twists and turns around these hidden support and resistance levels, each with their broken promise of a bullish or bearish breakout. But with USD/JPY printing its lowest daily close of the range\u2014and volumes rising during yesterday\u2019s selloff\u2014I am once again on guard for a bearish breakout. Only a less-dovish"

                "body": "USD/JPY forecast: traders bet on yen ahead of the BoJ, Fed decisions\n- The USD/JPY exchange rate slipped ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision.\n- The Bank of Japan will deliver its interest rate decision on Friday.\n- The BoJ and Fed divergence favors the Japanese yen.\nThe USD/JPY exchange rate pulled back this week as focus shifted to the upcoming Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan (BoJ) interest rate decision. It fell to a low of 146.25, down by almost 3% from its highest level in July.\nFederal Reserve interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe USD/JPY exchange rate pulled back sharply as traders waited for the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision.\nAll indications are that the bank will cut interest rates by 0.25% in this meeting as they make a strategic shift from focusing on inflation to the labor market.\nData released earlier this month showed that the economy created just 22,000 jobs in August as the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. Wage growth momentum also stalled during the month.\nMore jobs numbers have painted to an economy that is not doing too well. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of job vacancies in the UK has slowed in the past few months.\nAdditionally, a recent revision showed that the economy lost jobs in June for the first time since the pandemic era.\nCompanies have been reluctant to employ in the past few months because of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have increased costs across the board.\nThe USD/JPY exchange rate slump has coincided with the ongoing decline in US bond yields, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.02% and the five-year yield to 3.65%. Also, it has coincided with the ongoing stock market rally, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices jumping to a record high. The gold price has also jumped.\nBank of Japan interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other notable catalyst for the USD/JPY exchange rate is the upcoming Bank of Japan interest rate decision on Friday.\nUnlike the Federal Reserve, the BoJ is taking a different route on interest rates this year. While economists expect the bank to leave interest rates unchanged, there is rising expectation that the bank will hike interest rates at least once this year.\nThe BoJ has been concerned about the stubbornly high inflation despite the recent improvement. Recent data showed that the country\u2019s inflation dropped to 3.1% in July, the lowest level since March this year. While the drop was notable, it remained much higher than what analysts were expecting.\nAs such, in theory, a situation where the Fed is cutting rates and the BoJ is cutting would benefit the Japanese yen, which explains why many investors have taken the position. In a note, BlueBay Asset Management, which has taken the position, said:\n\u201cWe do think an October move is possible or likely. And so we think this is a more attractive moment to be long the yen, as long as Koizumi is the victor in the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s leadership contest.\u201d\nUSD/JPY technical analysis\nCopy link to sectionThe daily timeframe shows that the USD/JPY exchange rate has pulled back in the past few months, moving from a high of 150.96 in August to 146.5p today. It recently dropped below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\nThe pair is now attempting to drop below the important support level at 146.30, a level it has failed to move below since July. This price is also along the bottom of the trading range of the Murrey Math Lines tool.\nThe MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators have continued falling in the past few weeks. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the pair continues falling as sellers target the ultimate support level at 144."

The Loonie pair gains marginally ahead of monetary policy outcomes by the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) during New York trading hours.\nBoth the BoC and the Fed are expected to cut interest rates amid mounting labor market conditions in their respective economies. Inflationary pressures in the Canadian economy have cooled down, emerging as another reason behind the BoC\u2019s dovish expectations. However, the Fed is expected to start the monetary-easing campaign despite the United States (US) inflation remaining higher.\nInvestors will closely monitor press conferences from both Fed Chair Jerome Powell and BoC Governor Tiff Macklem to get cues about whether there will be more interest rate cuts in the remainder of the year.\nAccording to analysts from Barclays, the Fed\u2019s latest median projections for interest rates are likely to call for three interest rate cuts by 2025.\nAhead of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, holds onto Tuesday\u2019s losses near 96.60.\nUSD/CAD forms a Head and Shoulder chart pattern, which indicates a bearish reversal. The neckline of the above-mentioned chart pattern is plotted near 1.3715.\nThe near-term trend of the pair remains bearish as it stays below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which trades around 1.3800.\nThe 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) slides to near 40.00. A fresh bearish momentum would emerge if the RSI falls below that level.\nGoing forward, the asset could slide towards the round level of 1.3600 and the June 16 low of 1.3540 if it breaks below the August 7 low of 1.3722.\nOn the flip side, a recovery move by the pair above the August 22 high of 1.3925 would open the door towards the May 15 high of 1.4000, followed by the April 9 low of 1.4075.\nUSD/CAD daily chart\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The NY Empire State Manufacturing Survey showed that businesses conditions were far weaker than expected. Then news broke that Trumps former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors Stephen Miran, was confirmed as a Fed Governor and will vote at the FOMC meeting that starts today.\nCanadian inflation is expected to have risen to 2.7% y/y from 2.6% in July while Core CPI ticks up to 2.7% from 2.6%. The results won\u2019t stop the BoC from cutting rates by 25 bps tomorrow, but they may encourage a more hawkish outlook from policymakers.\nToday\u2019s US data releases are unlikely to shift expectations. Retail sales are projected to rise 0.2% in August compared to 0.5% in July, while capacity utilization, industrial production, and inventories are expected to show little change. Regardless of the results, markets remain convinced that the Fed will ease policy.\nAsian markets ended mixed overnight. Japan\u2019s Topix gained 0.25% and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 rose 0.28%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng closed flat.\nIn Europe as of 7:30 am, sentiment is cautious. The German DAX is down 0.56%, the UK FTSE 100 has lost 0.20%, and the French CAC 40 is unchanged. US futures are modestly positive with the S&P 500 up 0.16%. The dollar index has slipped to 97.05 and the US 10-year yield is at 4.035%.\nEURUSD climbed to the top of its 1.1757\u20131.1818 overnight range in early New York trade. The move was supported by weak NY Empire State data and speculation that Miran\u2019s Fed confirmation could accelerate the pace of rate cuts. Traders brushed aside political tension in France and weak German survey data. The uptrend from August 1 remains intact as long as prices hold above 1.1680.\nGBPUSD followed the euro higher, rallying to 1.3646 from 1.3597. The move was underpinned by broad dollar selling and reinforced by UK labor data, which showed cooling but not enough to push the Bank of England into an immediate rate cut. Technicals stay bullish above 1.3560 with room to extend through 1.3680 toward 1.3900.\nUSDJPY weakened as the pair traded in a 146.70\u2013145.54 band overnight. Diverging Fed and BoJ policies remain the driver, with Japan\u2019s election keeping the BoJ on hold while the Fed is expected to trim rates by 25 basis points tomorrow. Lower US tariffs on Japanese exports, including autos, also take effect today.\nAUDUSD edged higher in a narrow 0.6660\u20130.6676 range, buoyed by softer US yields and broad dollar weakness. RBA Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter noted that risks to the domestic outlook are balanced, suggesting no change to rates at the September 30 policy meeting."

The recovery came after downbeat inflation figures from Canada and upbeat retail sales numbers from the US.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about ETF brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nThe dollar recovered slightly against the Canadian dollar on Tuesday after data revealed robust consumer spending in the US. Retail sales rose by 0.6%, well above the estimate of a 0.2% increase. It reflected some resilience in the US economy despite a weak labor market. Nevertheless, it was not enough to dampen Fed rate cut expectations.\nAt the same time, data from Canada showed that inflation eased by 0.1%. Meanwhile, economists had expected no change. The report reinforced bets that the Bank of Canada will resume its monetary easing.\nNotably, both the Bank of Canada and the Fed will meet on Wednesday. Markets expect the BoC to cut rates by 25 bps to support an economy that has shown weakness, especially in the labor market. However, policymakers will likely not be as dovish as Fed officials.\nThe Fed remains behind the curve in lowering borrowing costs. Moreover, the US labor market has shown sudden weakness, which could pressure the central bank to adopt a more dovish tone. Meanwhile, traders are almost entirely pricing a 25-bps move.\nUSD/CAD key events today\n- Bank of Canada policy meeting\n- Fed policy meeting\nUSD/CAD technical forecast: Decline pauses at the 1.3750 key support\nOn the technical side, the USD/CAD price has punctured the 1.3750 support and is threatening to push below the level again.

The price has fallen sharply since it broke out of its bullish channel.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about Canada forex brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nAfter such a sharp drop, bears are facing the 1.3750 key support level. At the same time, bulls have made a brief comeback. If bearish momentum remains strong, the price will likely break below this level to continue the decline. Such an outcome would clear the path for USD/CAD to retest the 1.3651 key level.\nOn the other hand, if bulls return at the current support, the price will likely bounce higher to retest the 30-SMA resistance. If it holds firm, bears will resume the decline. Meanwhile, a break above the SMA would signal a shift in sentiment.\nLooking to trade forex now?

The release reduced expectations of further ECB easing after last week\u2019s meeting, where policymakers held rates steady and described risks as \u201cbalanced\u201d with the outlook in \u201ca good place.\u201d At the same time, the US dollar softened as traders positioned for a dovish Fed cut later today. Together, these dynamics left EUR/USD looking more constructive than GBP/USD, helping EUR/GBP extend gains as the pound lagged behind.\nView related analysis:\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD, GBP/AUD\n- EUR/USD and GBP/USD Outlook: Bullish Patterns Form as Dollar Wavers\n- GBP/USD, EUR/GBP: COT Data Appears Favourable to British Pound Bulls\n- USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, AUD/JPY Outlook: Dollar, Yen Weakness Into FOMC, BOJ\nEUR/GBP Outlook: Euro Favoured as Dollar Weakens, Pound Lags\nThe euro was a strong performer on Tuesday, buoyed by an upbeat ZEW report for Germany and the broader eurozone. With the ECB leaving rates unchanged last week, describing risks as \u201cbalanced\u201d and the outlook as \u201cin a good place,\u201d expectations of further cuts have diminished \u2013 reinforcing the view that the easing cycle is likely over. At the same time, traders are positioning for a dovish Fed cut later today, leaving the US dollar weaker and allowing EUR/GBP to outperform GBP/USD.\nEUR/USD vs GBP/USD: Diverging Inverted Head and Shoulders Patterns\nI previously highlighted the potential inverted head and shoulders patterns forming on the daily charts of EUR/USD and GBP/USD. The structure on the euro\u2019s chart looks far more convincing, whereas I remain sceptical of the validity of the pattern on the British pound. This makes EUR/USD the more attractive option for bulls compared to GBP/USD in my view, and also underpins my near-term bullish bias on EUR/GBP.\nIt is worth noting that the daily RSI (2) is overbought for both EUR/USD and GBP/USD, warning of near-term overextension to the upside. However, their respective RSI (14s) confirm the move higher without yet being overbought. In both cases, dips may appeal to bulls \u2013 though EUR/USD appears to stand the better chance of reaching its inverted head and shoulders target, which sits around 1.21.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView EUR/USD, GBP/USD\nEUR/GBP Technical Analysis: Euro vs British Pound\nMuch of this year\u2019s volatility for EUR/GBP was concentrated between March and May, during the peak of Trump-tariff concerns. Its current high-to-low range of 6.5% has already exceeded those of the previous two years, with more than a quarter of the year still to play out.\nThe weekly chart shows momentum turning higher. A series of lower wicks formed around the rising 10-week EMA, and at current levels EUR/GBP is on track to post a bullish outside week.\nThe question now is whether this proves to be a smaller bounce ahead of a sharper move lower, or the prelude to a breakout above the 2025 high. Futures positioning suggests the latter.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView EUR/GBP\nEUR/GBP Trader Positioning \u2013 COT Report Analysis\nAlthough the weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report has dedicated data for EUR/GBP futures, liquidity in this market is relatively low. To better gauge sentiment, I have built a higher-liquidity proxy by subtracting GBP/USD futures positioning from EUR/USD futures data. This method provides a reasonable measure of relative bullish and bearish exposure between the euro and the pound against the US dollar.\nThe proxy COT charts for EUR/GBP show net-long exposure continuing to rise, driven by an increase in gross-longs and a reduction in gross-shorts. This trend is consistent across both large speculators and asset managers.\nIt could be argued that asset managers net-long exposure is approaching a sentiment extreme, but that could still allow for a rise of bullish "

Focus will shift toward the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy decision due later in the day.\nHowever, a look at the daily chart suggested the GBP/JPY cross is remaining within an ascending channel pattern, suggesting the market sentiment is bullish. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), a key momentum gauge, is positioned slightly above the 50 mark, signaling bullish bias is in play. Additionally, the currency cross is remaining above the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), suggesting the market sentiment is stronger.\nOn the upside, the GBP/JPY cross is testing its immediate barrier at the psychological level of 200.00, followed by the 200.75, the highest since July 2024, which was reached on September 15. A break above this level could lead the currency cross to explore the region around the ascending channel\u2019s upper boundary at 203.10.\nThe immediate support appears at the nine-day EMA of 199.79, followed by the lower boundary of the ascending channel around 199.50. A break below the channel would weaken the bullish bias and put downward pressure on the GBP/JPY cross to test the 50-day EMA at 198.61.\nGBP/JPY: Daily Chart\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "The US dollar and Japanese yen both weakened on Tuesday, leaving JPY crosses in focus ahead of pivotal central bank decisions. Traders are bracing for the Federal Reserve to deliver a 25bp cut while signalling the path for future easing, with market pricing leaning towards another 50bp of cuts by year-end. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan\u2019s upcoming meeting could add further volatility for the yen. Against this backdrop, USD/JPY shows signs of a bearish breakdown, while EUR/JPY and AUD/JPY retain bullish momentum.\nView related analysis:\n- EUR/USD and GBP/USD Outlook: Bullish Patterns Form as Dollar Wavers\n- USD/CAD, EUR/CAD Outlook: Canadian Dollar Bulls Flex Ahead Inflation\n- British Pound Price Action Setups: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD, GBP/AUD\n- EUR/USD, USD/JPY, VIX, Gold, Crude oil: COT Report Analysis\n- USD/JPY and Yen Crosses Analysis: Jobs Revision, Fed Cuts, Technical Outlook\nUS Dollar Weakness and Market Expectations for the Fed\nThe US dollar was the weakest FX major on Tuesday, with traders front-running expectations of a dovish Fed cut at this week\u2019s meeting. This, of course, raises the risk of a sharp bullish reversal in the USD should the Fed fail to support current market pricing of another 50bp of cuts this year, alongside the expected 25bp cut on Wednesday. That said, I do not expect the Fed to deliver a 50bp cut at this meeting\u2014partly to save face amid Trump\u2019s persistent pressure to cut, but mostly to avoid triggering unnecessary, widespread panic. Traders would likely view a 50bp cut as confirmation that the Fed is indeed behind the curve.\nSwiss Franc Strength: USD/CHF Hits Lowest Since 2015\nThe Swiss franc (CHF) was the strongest FX major, sending USD/CHF down 1% to its lowest level since January 2015\u2014the infamous day the Swiss National Bank (SNB) removed the franc\u2019s peg to the euro. This places the Swissy firmly below levels where the SNB has previously intervened to support its currency.\nEUR/USD Breaks Higher on Strong Data and Dovish Fed Bets\nEUR/USD reached a near four-year high on Tuesday on stronger-than-expected European data and pre-emptively dovish Fed bets against the US dollar ahead of the FOMC meeting. Germany\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment rose to 37.3, beating the 25.3 estimate and above the 34.7 prior. This marked its fifth consecutive expansion and places it well above its long-term average of 21.1.\nThe euro\u2019s 0.8% gain was its best day in over three weeks, bringing the July and October 2021 highs near 1.1908 and the 1.20 handle into focus for bulls, in line with my bullish bias. EUR/USD bulls have enjoyed a clean breakout from the inverted head and shoulders pattern.\nFX Majors Rundown\n- GBP/USD broke higher from its own inverted head and shoulders pattern, reaching a 2.5-year high.\n- AUD/USD rose 0.2% to its highest level since November, though resistance was predictably met around the 200-day averages and November high.\n- NZD/USD climbed to a 22-day high, though resistance at the August high of 0.5996 is nearby.\n- USD/JPY fell -0.6% and saw its most bearish daily close level since 23 July\n- USD/CAD continued lower in line with my bearish bias, with a move down to at least 1.36 now on the cards. While CPI came in below expectations\u2014keeping the Bank of Canada (BoC) on track for a 25bp cut later today\u2014it remains elevated enough to warrant caution on future cuts.\n- US dollar index (DXY) fell 0.7% to a two-month low, with a break of the July trough at 95.61 now in focus for bears.\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nFor several weeks I have noted that USD/JPY has been ranging between two weekly volume points of control (VPOCs). As is often the case with ranges, there have been several twists and turns around these hidden support and resistance levels, each with their broken promise of a bullish or bearish breakout. But with USD/JPY printing its lowest daily close of the range\u2014and volumes rising during yesterday\u2019s selloff\u2014I am once again on guard for a bearish breakout. Only a less-dovish"

                "body": "After a volatile August, Bitcoin has been regaining momentum in September, gaining about 5.6% month to date. Growing institutional adoption, a weakening greenback and interest rate cuts by the Fed pave the way for a highly optimistic future for the digital asset, outweighing any concerns over volatility.\nIncreasing interest from institutional investors is sending a positive signal to the market, reflecting the confidence of the world\u2019s largest institutions in digital currency. Additionally, pro-crypto moves by the Trump administration are another key tailwind for the asset.\nBitcoin Rallies on Growing Rate Cut Expectations\nThe main reason behind Bitcoin\u2019s surge is strong market expectations of Fed easing. With the Fed widely expected to cut rates at its September meeting, the key question is the size of the move. Markets largely anticipate a 25-bps cut, which is already priced in. However, a surprise 50-bps reduction could trigger a sharp rally in Bitcoin.\nAccording to Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, the key driver will be the Fed\u2019s tone on future policy moves, as quoted on Forbes. Kuptsikevich also stated that if the Fed shows willingness to ease further, Bitcoin may push into record territory.\nFurther Fed interest rate cut could boost investor risk appetite, potentially leading to increased exposure to digital currencies. Additionally, lower interest rates would leave investors with more capital, often leading to increased interest in cryptocurrency.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are anticipating a 74.8% likelihood of interest rates falling to 3.75-4% in October and a 69.7% likelihood of interest rates falling to 3.5-3.75% in December.\nDollar Weakness Boosts Bitcoin Appeal\nCryptocurrency, an alternative to traditional currencies, tends to gain from a weaker greenback. The greenback continues to remain under heavy pressure this year, following its weakest first-half performance since the 1970s.\nAccording to TradingView, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen 1.22% over the past month and 10.57% year to date. The index has recorded an all-time decline of 19.10%.\nBitcoin\u2019s Path Looks Northbound\nPer TradingView, top financial institutions maintain an overwhelmingly positive stance on Bitcoin\u2019s price. Standard Chartered projects the digital currency to reach $200,000 by the year\u2019s end, driven by institutional adoption and clearer regulatory frameworks, marking a rise of about 73% from Bitcoin\u2019s current price level.\nAccording to VanEck, Bitcoin is forecasted to reach $180,000 by this year, supported by institutional flows over the long term. Additionally, VanEck also projects a long-term price target of $2 million by 2050."

Institutional holdings reach 2.88M BTC, setting up a breakout toward $124,500 if the Fed confirms easing | That's TradingNEWS\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs Post $2.3 Billion Weekly Inflows, Strongest Since June\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded $2.3 billion in net inflows during the week of September 8\u201312, the biggest weekly tally in three months. Leading the surge was BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which added over $1 billion. Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured nearly $850 million, while Ark Invest\u2019s ARKB pulled in $181.7 million. Together, the three managers absorbed over $2 billion, confirming that institutional demand is consolidating around the largest issuers.\nDaily Flows Highlight Structural Demand for Bitcoin Exposure\nCapital flows into Bitcoin ETFs showed remarkable consistency throughout the week. Monday saw $364 million, Tuesday slowed to $23 million, then Wednesday exploded with $742 million in a single session. Thursday contributed $553 million, and Friday closed with $642 million. This sustained accumulation pattern is the most significant since mid-July, indicating institutions are not simply speculating but strategically allocating.\nETF Holdings Reach 6.6% of Bitcoin Market Cap\nThe combined net asset value of Bitcoin ETFs now sits at $151.72 billion, representing 6.6% of Bitcoin\u2019s $2.3 trillion market capitalization. Lifetime cumulative inflows into Bitcoin products stand at $57.09 billion. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT dominates with $60.04 billion in historical inflows, while Fidelity\u2019s FBTC has built $12.63 billion. Bitwise\u2019s BITB registered $18.8 million in outflows during the week, but its total net inflows remain positive at $2.33 billion.\nFederal Reserve Rate Cuts Provide the Key Macro Catalyst\nThe CME FedWatch Tool shows a 96% probability of a 25 bps rate cut at the September 17 FOMC meeting, with markets speculating whether the Fed will go further. Lower rates weaken the U.S. dollar, improve liquidity conditions, and drive demand for risk assets. For Bitcoin ETFs, which rely on institutional appetite, dovish monetary policy is a direct tailwind. Any confirmation of an easing cycle into 2026 could keep inflows strong and send BTC-USD toward $124,500, its all-time high.\nBTC-USD Price Action Battles Resistance at $118,000\nBitcoin is consolidating around $115,300, recovering nearly 9% from the September 1 low of $107,270. The critical zone lies between $117,500\u2013$118,000, where liquidation data shows heavy supply and stop clusters. Breaking this resistance could unleash momentum toward $124,500, while rejection risks a pullback to $110,000\u2013$112,000. Despite the challenge, Bitcoin remains up 90% year-over-year and continues to outperform 93 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, supported by trading above its 200-day moving average.\nStrategic Reserves and ETF Holdings Expand by 30% in 2025\nBitcoin ETF and corporate treasury holdings have surged from 2.24 million BTC in January to 2.88 million BTC in September, a 30% increase year-to-date. This means that nearly 14% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply is now locked in institutional vehicles, reducing exchange liquidity and magnifying price reactions to incremental demand. This structural consolidation has shifted market dynamics, embedding ETFs as a core driver of Bitcoin\u2019s valuation.\nEthereum ETFs Join the Rally but Remain Smaller in Scale\nEthereum ETFs also attracted significant inflows, led by BlackRock\u2019s ETHA with $363.2 million in a single day, lifting its AUM to $17.09 billion. Fidelity\u2019s FETH saw $13.5 million outflows, but overall ETH products gained $646 million over four days. Despite this rebound, Ethereum ETF flows remain far smaller than Bitcoin\u2019s, which captured $2.4 billion last week alone. BTC retains dominance in the ETF flow race, though ETH\u2019s rebound highlights a growing diversification trend.\nWhale Accu"

                "body": "Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain two of the most influential blockchains in decentralized finance. Both are competing for developer attention, user adoption, and the capital that flows through decentralized applications. Evaluating total value locked, developer activity, and transaction costs shows where each chain stands in mid-2025.\nTotal Value Locked\nEthereum continues to lead in total value locked (TVL), supported by established protocols, institutional trust, and the maturity of its DeFi ecosystem. Major lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoin infrastructure still default to Ethereum as the first choice for liquidity.\nSolana, while smaller in absolute terms, has shown impressive growth in niches like NFTs, gaming, and high-velocity retail trading. Its TVL has expanded quickly as low-cost transactions attract projects that cannot operate efficiently on Ethereum's base layer.\nDeveloper Activity\nEthereum maintains the largest developer base in crypto. Tooling, security, and documentation are robust, and its ecosystem has weathered multiple market cycles. This gives Ethereum resilience and consistency, especially when attracting long-term capital and regulatory attention.\nSolana is expanding its developer community at a rapid pace. The chain's performance characteristics make it attractive for applications that need high throughput and low latency. Growth in DeFi protocols and consumer-facing apps shows Solana's ability to carve out its own market share.\nTransaction Costs and Speed\nEthereum's base layer remains slower and more expensive to use, particularly during periods of congestion. Layer-2 solutions are critical to scaling and reducing gas fees, but they add complexity to the user experience.\nSolana offers a different trade-off. Transactions are extremely fast and inexpensive, often costing less than a cent. This makes the chain ideal for frequent or micro-transactions, though the network has faced reliability challenges in the past.\nThe Outlook\nEthereum continues to dominate in terms of liquidity depth, institutional adoption, and developer resources. Solana, however, is proving that speed and cost efficiency can drive rapid growth in emerging segments of the crypto economy.\nFor investors and builders, the competition is less about a single winner and more about fit. Ethereum is positioned as the foundation for large-scale DeFi projects with long-term stability, while Solana is becoming the platform of choice for cost-sensitive, high-frequency applications. Both ecosystems reflect different sides of the same market opportunity.\nBenzinga Disclaimer: This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

Our editorial content is created independently of our marketing partnerships, and our ratings are based solely on our established evaluation criteria. Read More\nEthereum (ETH) continues to dominate crypto headlines, but not for the reasons many were hoping. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again delayed decisions on Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to staking, including BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust and Franklin Templeton\u2019s proposal. With deadlines now pushed back to late October, institutional investors will need to wait longer before gaining regulated access to ETH.\nAt the same time, traders are looking toward other parts of the market for momentum. One project drawing increasing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol currently in presale, where the token is priced under $0.05 and has shown notable fundraising progress.\nEthereum\u2019s Regulatory Roadblocks\nEthereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at more than $545 billion, with ETH trading in the $4,510\u2013$4,520 range. Its role as the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts is unchanged, but the delay in ETF approvals highlights ongoing regulatory scrutiny.\nFor institutions, regulated ETH products would represent a major milestone, but with the SEC\u2019s decision postponed until October 30, 2025, the short-term outlook has become less certain. While ETH could still move toward the $5,000 level, the timeline for such moves may now depend on developments outside of Ethereum\u2019s technology and ecosystem.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM)\nMutuum Finance is developing a non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol designed to bring lenders, borrowers, and liquidators into one system. The project\u2019s presale has raised more than $15.9 million to date, with over 16,350 holders. It is currently in Phase 6 at $0.035, with the launch price set at $0.06, representing a near 2x increase from the current stage and around 250% growth compared to the opening phase at $0.01.\nAccording to the roadmap, Mutuum plans to release a beta version of its platform at the same time as the token lists, meaning core lending and borrowing features could be available from day one. This approach may also improve the token\u2019s prospects for exchange listings once trading begins.\nSecurity has been another focus, with the protocol undergoing a CertiK audit where its smart contracts received a Token Scan score of 90/100. In addition, a $50,000 bug bounty program and a $100,000 community giveaway are in place, signaling efforts to strengthen trust and broaden participation.\nWhy Traders Are Paying Attention\nThe protocol is designed around two complementary lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) liquidity pools for mainstream assets such as ETH or stablecoins, and a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace for niche or high-risk tokens like SHIB or DOGE. Borrowers can choose between variable rates that adjust with liquidity levels or stable-rate options that offer predictability, while lenders receive mtTokens, yield-bearing assets that accrue interest in real time.\nA portion of the protocol\u2019s fees will be used to buy MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to participants, a design that could add buying demand over time as usage expands. Compared to projects with limited use cases, this structure has drawn attention for embedding utility and demand into the token\u2019s design.\nEthereum continues to anchor the broader DeFi ecosystem, but regulatory hurdles have slowed near-term developments for institutional investors.

                "body": "Dubai, UAE, September 17th, 2025, Chainwire\nSwap.io today announced the launch of a Solana-based cryptocurrency exchange that compares results across multiple routing services to present competitive available quotes in a single interface. The platform focuses on multi-router aggregation rather than proprietary routing, addressing structural constraints within Solana where transaction instruction limits and differing algorithmic optimizations can affect execution outcomes.\nSwap.io's core functionality evaluates quotes across supported routing options and selects the most favorable available rate at the time of execution. The approach is designed to reduce exposure to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) by using protected routing paths where available. The interface removes advanced configuration steps, enabling single-click swaps without manual slippage adjustments or specialized node settings. The platform currently operates without platform fees; this policy may evolve as the service develops.\nThe meta-aggregation methodology allows different routing strategies to compete for each transaction instead of relying on a single framework. This is relevant for a range of trading scenarios across token pairs and trade sizes, where distinct algorithms may perform differently due to liquidity distribution, price volatility, and transaction-size considerations.\nThe platform serves multiple user segments within the Solana ecosystem. Retail participants can access simplified swaps with automated quote selection. Larger traders can benefit from diversified routing strategies that may help limit slippage and reduce sensitivity to single-router behavior. To improve transparency, Swap.io provides visual route explanations that outline how a transaction is executed and which categories of protocols facilitate each step.\nThe launch reflects a broader trend in decentralized finance infrastructure: optimizing existing protocols through aggregation rather than introducing duplicate execution logic. As liquidity sources proliferate, multi-router aggregation may play a growing role in improving overall swap accessibility and operational clarity across blockchain networks.\nAbout Swap.io\nSwap.io operates a Solana-based cryptocurrency exchange specializing in multi-router aggregation. The company develops infrastructure solutions aimed at simplifying token swaps and improving operational transparency in decentralized finance. Swap.io is headquartered in Dubai, UAE. Additional information is available at https://swap.io"

(Nasdaq: DFDV) (the \u201cCompany\u201d) the first public company with a treasury strategy built to accumulate and compound Solana (\u201cSOL\u201d), today announced the acquisition of 62,745 SOL. This purchase brings the Company\u2019s total holdings to 2,095,748 SOL, valued at approximately $499 million.\nBelow is a summary of DeFi Dev Corp.\u2019s current SOL position and key per-share metrics as of September 16, 2025:\n- Total SOL & SOL Equivalents Held: 2,095,748\n- Total SOL & SOL Equivalents Held (USD): Approximately $499 million\n- Total Shares Outstanding as of September 16, 2025: 25,670,108\n- SOL per Share (\u201cSPS\u201d): 0.0816\n- SPS (USD): $19.44\nThe newly acquired SOL will be held long-term and staked to a variety of validators, including DeFi Dev Corp.\u2019s own Solana validators to generate native yield.\nNote on Share Count and SPS: The reported share count reflects only issued and outstanding shares as of today. None of the pre-paid warrants from the recent equity financing are included in the current figure. Including warrants from that transaction, the adjusted share count would be approximately 31.5 million. SPS will fully reflect this in future updates, alongside the deployment of the remaining cash proceeds from the equity financing into additional SOL purchases. Based on current expectations, the Company does not anticipate SPS falling below the pre-financing level of 0.0675, even after full warrant impact \u2014 reinforcing continued SPS growth.\nAbout DeFi Development Corp.\nDeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: DFDV) has adopted a treasury policy under which the principal holding in its treasury reserve is allocated to SOL. Through this strategy, the Company provides investors with direct economic exposure to SOL, while also actively participating in the growth of the Solana ecosystem. In addition to holding and staking SOL, DeFi Development Corp. operates its own validator infrastructure, generating staking rewards and fees from delegated stake. The Company is also engaged across decentralized finance (\u201cDeFi\u201d) opportunities and continues to explore innovative ways to support and benefit from Solana\u2019s expanding application layer.\nThe Company is an AI-powered online platform that connects the commercial real estate industry by providing data and software subscriptions, as well as value-add services, to multifamily and commercial property professionals, as the Company connects the increasingly complex ecosystem that stakeholders have to manage.\nThe Company currently serves more than one million web users annually, including multifamily and commercial property owners and developers applying for billions of dollars of debt financing per year, professional service providers, and thousands of multifamily and commercial property lenders, including more than 10% of the banks in America, credit unions, real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d), debt funds, Fannie Mae\u00ae and Freddie Mac\u00ae multifamily lenders, FHA multifamily lenders, commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d) lenders, Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) lenders, and more.

                "body": "Dow Jones futures remain steady near 45,750 during European hours on Wednesday, ahead of the United States (US) market open. Moreover, the S&P 500 futures decline 0.20% to trade near 6,600, while Nasdaq 100 futures depreciate 0.10% to trade around 24,2500. Wall Street will likely watch the US Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision later in the day.\nUS stock futures struggle despite the Fed is widely expected to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut in response to signs of a cooling labor market and subdued inflation. The Fed\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the \u2018dot plot,\u2019 will be eyed, where each member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects the federal funds rate in the near future.\nHowever, US markets may draw gains amid rising likelihood of multiple Fed interest rate cuts, with strong retail sales and labor data outweighing hotter inflation. Additionally, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank projected 25-basis-point reductions at each of the Fed\u2019s meetings in September, October, and December.\nThe US Senate narrowly confirmed US President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to the Fed Board, Stephen Miran, in a Monday evening vote, clearing the way for him to participate in policy decisions this week. Meanwhile, an appeals court rejected Trump\u2019s bid to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud, ensuring she remains on the board while legal proceedings continue.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the oldest stock market indices in the world, is compiled of the 30 most traded stocks in the US. The index is price-weighted rather than weighted by capitalization. It is calculated by summing the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing them by a factor, currently 0.152. The index was founded by Charles Dow, who also founded the Wall Street Journal. In later years it has been criticized for not being broadly representative enough because it only tracks 30 conglomerates, unlike broader indices such as the S&P 500.\nMany different factors drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The aggregate performance of the component companies revealed in quarterly company earnings reports is the main one. US and global macroeconomic data also contributes as it impacts on investor sentiment. The level of interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve (Fed), also influences the DJIA as it affects the cost of credit, on which many corporations are heavily reliant. Therefore, inflation can be a major driver as well as other metrics which impact the Fed decisions.\nDow Theory is a method for identifying the primary trend of the stock market developed by Charles Dow. A key step is to compare the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) and only follow trends where both are moving in the same direction. Volume is a confirmatory criteria. The theory uses elements of peak and trough analysis. Dow\u2019s theory posits three trend phases: accumulation, when smart money starts buying or selling; public participation, when the wider public joins in; and distribution, when the smart money exits.\nThere are a number of ways to trade the DJIA. One is to use ETFs which allow investors to trade the DJIA as a single security, rather than having to buy shares in all 30 constituent companies. A leading example is the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA). DJIA futures contracts enable traders to speculate on the future value of the index and Options provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the index at a predetermined price in the future. Mutual funds enable investors to buy a share of a diversified portfolio of DJIA stocks thus providing exposure to the overall index."

Shares fell 3.4%, leading pharma and biotech stocks down 2.6% and putting pressure on the broader FTSE 100, which edged 0.12% lower. A firmer pound added extra weight, hitting export-focused companies. But good news wasn\u2019t entirely in short supply: Sainsbury\u2019s shares jumped to a four-year high\u2014up 5%\u2014after dropping talks to sell Argos to JD.com, while AO World soared 11.3% on its first-ever share buyback and brighter profit outlook. With the FTSE 250 benefiting from this domestic confidence and investors gearing up for key central bank decisions, focus is shifting to how the Bank of England will steer policy amid ongoing inflation.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Retail resilience shines through pharma worries.\nAstrazeneca\u2019s retreat cast a shadow over the FTSE 100 and made clear just how much heavyweight sectors can stir up the broader market. But domestic momentum has been strong: positive updates from Sainsbury and AO World helped the FTSE 250 outperform, offering a glimpse of optimism even when blue-chips stumble. Central bank decisions could fuel ongoing volatility, but resilient retailers show there\u2019s still upside if you know where to look.\nThe bigger picture: Investment signals point to bigger UK shifts.\nThe UK\u2019s ability to attract blockbuster investment is under scrutiny as big pharma pump the brakes on growth, putting a spotlight on the need for clear policies and attractive business conditions. Meanwhile, new tech and civil nuclear deals with the US\u2014and negotiations over steel tariffs\u2014reflect an effort to strengthen global economic ties. These shifts, combined with looming monetary policy decisions, could steer how the UK navigates capital inflows and economic challenges moving forward.\nNew York\u2019s the city that never sleeps. So it only makes sense that you should be able to trade some of America\u2019s biggest stocks round the clock.\nNow you can trade the Magnificent Seven 24/7 \u2013 that\u2019s Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla.

Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) nudged 0.1% lower.\n(YM=F)\nInvestors are keeping their powder dry in anticipation that the Fed will start the switch to easing hinted at last month by Chair Jerome Powell. A labor market slowdown is expected to convince policymakers to switch to easing, despite an uptick in inflation. Traders are pricing in a 96% chance of a 25 basis point cut and a 4% chance of a bigger move when the decision arrives at 2:00 p.m. ET.\nThe bigger question for Wall Street is how many more cuts could be on the way. The hunt for clues will focus on the \"dot-plot\" of predictions from each Fed official, as well as on Powell's remarks at a press conference 30 minutes after the rate announcement.\nThe decision comes amid growing concerns over the Fed's independence. While President Trump has lambasted Powell, he may soon be able to exert more direct influence over policymakers. The Senate confirmed his nominee to the Fed on Monday, enabling Stephen Miran to vote this week. But at the same time, Lisa Cook took part in the policy decision after an appeals court rebuffed Trump's attempt to oust the Fed governor.\nMeanwhile, MBA data showed the interest rate on a 30-year mortgage sank to its lowest since October 2024, while refinancing applications spiked almost 60% to their highest since March 2022.\nOn the corporate front, China has told its biggest tech companies including Alibaba not to buy the Nvidia (NVDA) AI chip tailor-made for the country, effectively banning tens of thousands of orders, the Financial Times reported.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were also stalling in premarket trading. All three indexes closed lower in the previous session.\nThe central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is due to make its decision at 2 p.m. Eastern time after a second day of deliberation in a two-day meeting that has been under scrutiny for political as well as economic reasons.\nPresident Donald Trump has loomed large over proceedings. He attempted to remove Fed Gov. Lisa Cook from the central bank\u2019s board and an appeals court said Monday she can keep her job for now. The president said he will fight the latest decision. Trump\u2019s Fed pick Stephen Miran will also attend the meeting after the Senate narrowly passed his nomination on Monday evening with a vote of 48-47.\nThe president has been pushing for rate cuts and criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not making any. He is likely to get his wish with a quarter-point reduction widely expected.\nDiscussions and individual member voting will be key, with Powell potentially facing dissent on the anticipated quarter-point cut. Officials aligned with Trump\u2019s view will likely argue against tighter monetary policy, saying it is holding back the economy and may push for a bumper half-percentage point cut. While some regional Fed bank presidents have indicated they are uneasy about stimulating the economy when inflation has stalled out well above the central bank\u2019s target.\n\u201cA wide range of arguments exist that support a steady benchmark or a jumbo 50 [basis points cut]. The significant disagreements across the economic arena are poised to produce frowns throughout the committee, with some voting members worried about inflation while others exhibit labor health nervousness,\u201d wrote Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive brokers.\nThe so-called \u2018dot plot\u2019\u2013projections showing where each official expects interest rates to be in the months ahead\u2013will be closely scrutinized along with any comments from Powell in his press conference.\nAmong equities, StubHub\u2019s initial public offering will be watched keenly. The popular marketplace for ticket resales begins trading today, after pricing its IPO in the middle of its expected range. It\u2019s the latest in a string of recent IPOs and the company plans to sell 34 million shares, priced at $23.50 each, valuing StubHub at $8.6 billion.\nElsewhere, China remains in focus as negotiators from Washington and Beijing thrash out the details of a deal to keep TikTok active in the U.S. The arrangement, discussed by U.S. and Chinese negotiators in Madrid this week, would create a new U.S. entity to operate the app, with American investors holding a roughly 80% stake and Chinese shareholders owning the rest, according to a Wall Street Journal report that cited people familiar with the matter.\nIt is seen as a precursor to a trade agreement between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and a potential meeting between Trump and China\u2019 leader Xi Jinping later this year.\nIn other market news, the two-year Treasury yield was trading at 3.507%, the 10-year yield was at 4.023%, while the 30-year yield traded at 4.643%, according to Tradeweb.\nThe DXY dollar index was rising 0.1% against a basket of currencies after hitting a two-month low yesterday."

Surveillance video from the incident last month \u2014 since widely shared online \u2014 captured what happened next: A hail of bullets. People scrambling for cover. A body sprawled on the pavement.\nThe video was replayed over and over on YouTube after it was posted by an account called Hood War Stories. Operated anonymously, the account is one of several with large followings that are dedicated to chronicling gang culture across Los Angeles, offering a combustible mix of news and wild speculation.\nWhile drawing fans by providing an insider\u2019s view of a shadowy world, the content fans flames of simmering beefs, increasing the potential for retaliation, critics say.\nHood War Stories identified the man gunned down in the strip mall shooting last month by the nickname \u201cChipmunk,\u201d and called the killing \u201ca tipping point that set the streets on fire.\u201d Four others were wounded, with city officials saying victims were between the ages of 19 and 45.\nThe shooting brought out the city\u2019s mayor and police chief, who, while standing before a bank of TV cameras, condemned the senseless taking of life.\nBut the specifics of who was responsible for the shooting and why it happened were left unsaid, with authorities remaining tight-lipped in the weeks since.\nIn the absence of official information, the bustling corner of the internet devoted to L.A. gangs has offered up theories.\nMany said the shooting was the latest flare-up in a long, bloody struggle between different sets of the Hoover and Main Street Crips.\nHood War Stories reported that the Main Street Crips were \u201cseemingly taking credit for\u201d the violence, which followed a provocative broadcast live on social media.\nThe former officer, Eric Halem, was already under investigation over allegations that he ran an insurance fraud scheme.\nAccording to the podcast, several Main Street members had filmed themselves on social media walking through their rivals\u2019 territory, a common tactic among younger gang members trying to demonstrate their fearlessness and goad rivals into a confrontation.\nWhen clips from the livestreams surfaced on Hood War Stories and elsewhere, word quickly spread on the street that the decades-old conflict was heating back up.\nThe strip mall shooting on Aug. 26 marked the beginning of a tit-for-tat spree of shootings.\nHours later that same night in the 600 block of 80th Street \u2014 another block claimed by a Hoovers set \u2014 three people were struck, one fatally, by a hail of gunfire.\nTelevision news picked up on the story as well, running an interview that reverberated on social media. A relative of a woman who was killed said she had left behind eight children and 10 grandchildren.\nLater that night in a parking lot near Century Boulevard and Main Street \u2014 a reputed Main Street hangout \u2014 a 25-year-old Long Beach man was killed and a 51-year-old man was wounded.\nThe spasm of violence saw 14 shootings across the city over a 48-hour span, though authorities cautioned that not all of them were related to the Hoover-Main Street dispute.\nSo far this year, Los Angeles has been safer than at any point in recent history. Statistics from the LAPD show the city is on pace for 50-year lows in homicides and other types of violent crimes. Shootings are down nearly 8% from this time last year, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said during his regular crime briefing on Tuesday, and violence continues to plummet from the peak of the gang wars that occurred in the early 1990s.\nExperts say the city and other parts of the country may be in the midst of the sharpest decline in k"

In the previous session, the benchmark index advanced to a record-high level of 45,055.38.\nThe broader Topix TOPIX slid 0.7% to 3,145.83, after marking a record high on Tuesday.\nThe outperformance of chip-sector shares made the difference, as they took cues from the closely watched Philadelphia SE semiconductor index SOX, which rose 0.3% to an all-time high on Tuesday.\nThe Nasdaq Composite IXIC and S&P 500 SPX also renewed record peaks, but closed the day lower.\nStocks have soared globally as traders cemented bets for a series of near-term U.S. rate cuts, beginning with one later on Wednesday. Market-implied odds signal at least two quarter-point cuts by year-end, and 95 basis points of reductions by end-March.\n\"The arithmetic is simple: the Fed needs to back up the dovishness currently discounted into the rates curve to keep stocks chugging along,\" said Kyle Rodda, an analyst at Capital.com.\n\"If the requisite dovishness is absent, that's when things could get spicy in the markets.\"\nChip-making equipment manufacturer Tokyo Electron 8035 jumped 5.4% on Wednesday to be the top performer in the Nikkei. Shares of smaller peer Disco 6146 gained nearly 2%.\nBy contrast, chip-testing equipment maker Advantest 6857 ended a roller-coaster session with a 1.8% loss.\nDespite a stronger yen against the U.S. dollar, which tends to weigh on exporters as it erodes the value of overseas revenue, Sony 6758 gained 1.1% and Toyota Motor 7203 rose 0.6%.\nOf the Nikkei's 225 components, only 58 advanced, 164 fell, and three traded flat."

Investors are eager to see if policymakers hint at more cuts to come or keep things cautious. Meanwhile, Japan\u2019s latest trade data only adds to the uncertainty: exports fell for the fourth straight month in August, taking the country to a 242.5 billion yen trade deficit. Shipments to the US saw a hefty 13.8% drop, led by falling orders for vehicles and steel. Still, Japanese corporations are doubling down on innovation to sidestep headwinds\u2014Takeda is pivoting to AI for speedier forecasting, Cancer Research UK is kicking off new clinical trials with Nxera Pharma, and Mitsubishi Logistics is using blockchain to streamline supply chains.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Markets weigh every signal.\nInvestors are staying on their toes, with muted performance in Japan\u2019s top stocks reflecting jitters about global rate cuts and export slowdowns. If the Fed\u2019s tone skews cautious, sectors sensitive to interest rates\u2014both in Japan and abroad\u2014could see further ups and downs. Export-dependent stocks may struggle to regain momentum until there\u2019s a steadier outlook.\nThe bigger picture: Japan pushes ahead with digital moves.\nWith export growth stalling, Japanese firms are leaning harder on digital tools and tech partnerships to steady the ship. From AI-driven planning to blockchain-backed logistics, businesses are betting these upgrades will help soften external shocks and keep Japan\u2019s economic prospects resilient as global markets shift.\nNew York\u2019s the city that never sleeps.
