                "body": "Asia stocks slide tracking Wall St losses; China top loser amid tariff worries\nMost investors don\u2019t have direct exposure to the currency mix that makes up the Dollar Index (DXY), but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s irrelevant. Far from it. DXY offers a useful lens through which to view the broader forces shaping the dollar\u2019s direction. And because it\u2019s an index, it tends to trend more clearly than the individual currencies it comprises.\nSo far in 2025, the Dollar Index has been on a rollercoaster. It is having its worst year in more than 20 years. The Dollar Index fell roughly 12.5% in the first three quarters of the year, dropping from around 110 in mid-January to a low near 96.35 by July 1. It made a marginal new low on September 17, coinciding with the Fed\u2019s rate cut, but since then, it\u2019s mostly traded in a range up to about 100. The bounce may have ended.\nInterest rates remain an important driver. The 60-day correlation between changes in DXY and the two-year Treasury yield is currently around 0.55. That\u2019s decent, but not overwhelming. It hasn\u2019t been much above 0.60 since early 2023, and there have been periods of notable divergence. In late March, for example, the rolling correlation slipped below 0.10\u2014the weakest since mid-2022. That kind of breakdown suggests the dollar isn\u2019t always dancing to the Fed\u2019s tune.\nLong-term rates tell a similar story. The 60-day correlation between DXY and the 10-year yield is also hovering near 0.55. The high for the year\u2014just above 0.60\u2014came about a week before the September FOMC meeting. But in May, the correlation briefly inverted, the first time since the March\u2013May 2022 stretch. Before that, the relationship was inverse throughout 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, during the pandemic\u2019s peak dislocations.\nGold offers another angle. With talk of dollar debasement bubbling up in the media, it\u2019s worth noting that the 60-day rolling correlation between gold and DXY is about -0.45. That inverse relationship has held since mid-May 2022, with only a brief exception in early February. But this year, the correlation has been more volatile than in the past two years, swinging from -0.72 to just above zero. It\u2019s now sitting a little below -0.44, suggesting gold is still moving in opposition to the dollar, but not in lockstep.\nValuation models add another layer. If we take the DXY\u2019s component weights and adjust them using the OECD\u2019s purchasing power parity (PPP) model, the index appears overvalued by about 43%. That\u2019s a hefty premium. A more grounded approach might be to look at long-term averages. The 10-year moving average is around 98.50, while the 20-year average is closer to 90.35. That puts today\u2019s levels in a historically elevated zone.\nZooming out, the bigger picture may be the unwinding of the dollar\u2019s super-cycle. These are multi-year swings in the foreign exchange market, and the DXY has already come a long way. It hit a record low near 70.70 during the Great Financial Crisis, then peaked in September 2022 just shy of 114.80. Since then, it\u2019s retraced to the 38.2% Fibonacci level around 98.00. The 50% retracement sits at 92.75, and the 61.8% level is near 87.50.\nIn my view, the 50% retracement is too close\u2014only about 6% away\u2014given the scale of Fed easing expected over the next 14 months. The 61.8% retracement, roughly 11.5% below current levels, seems a more reasonable target. DXY hasn\u2019t traded below 88.00 in a decade. It held above 88.25 in February 2018 and found support near 89.20 in early 2021.\nThe takeaway? The dollar may be entering a new phase. The bounce off the lows may have already run its course, and the broader downtrend may be resuming. With monetary policy shifting, correlations wobbling, and valuation metrics flashing red, the Dollar Index is worth watching\u2014not for its composition, but for what it tells us about the broad trends.\nWhich stocks should you consider in your very next trade?\nSuccessful investors know to check multiple angles before making their move.

                "source": "FinancialContent",
                "url": "https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-16-gold-rockets-past-4300-a-golden-era-fueled-by-fed-hopes-and-global-turmoil",
                "body": "In an unprecedented financial spectacle, gold prices have shattered all previous records, surging past an astonishing $4,300 per ounce in mid-October 2025. This historic rally, seeing the precious metal climb nearly 60% year-to-date, marks a profound recalibration of global financial strategies and investor psychology, driven by a powerful confluence of anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, escalating global uncertainties, and intensifying US-China trade tensions. The yellow metal's ascent signifies a growing lack of confidence in traditional financial instruments and a fervent flight to safety amidst a volatile global landscape.\nThe immediate implication of this golden surge is a seismic shift in investment portfolios, with capital flowing rapidly into safe-haven assets. This rally is not merely a fleeting market phenomenon but reflects deep-seated concerns about economic fragility, persistent inflationary pressures, and a geopolitical environment fraught with risk. For public companies and the broader market, this means a re-evaluation of strategies, as some sectors stand to gain immensely, while others face significant headwinds.\nThe Unstoppable Ascent: Gold's Historic Rally to New Heights\nGold's journey to over $4,300 per ounce has been a relentless upward trajectory throughout 2025. The metal breached the significant $4,000 per ounce mark on October 8, 2025, a mere 36 days after crossing $3,500. By October 14, it reached an all-time high of $4,179.48, and on October 15, prices climbed above $4,200. The ultimate breach of $4,300 occurred on October 16, 2025, with spot gold touching $4,291.89 and Comex gold futures peaking at $4,254.80 per ounce, marking an almost 60% year-to-date gain.\nThis remarkable ascent has been underpinned by a series of events and market sentiments. The Federal Reserve's signaling of an interest-rate-cutting cycle in late August ignited retail investor interest, leading to robust inflows into gold-backed Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Central banks globally have also continued their sustained purchases, diversifying away from dollar-denominated reserves. The rally has also spurred a parallel surge in silver prices, which have likewise hit new all-time highs above $53 per ounce, indicating broad-based precious metals strength.\nKey players driving this rally include central banks, large institutional investors seeking portfolio diversification, and individual retail investors looking for a hedge against inflation and economic instability. Initial market reactions have been overwhelmingly bullish, with analysts from major financial institutions like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs revising price targets upwards, some projecting gold to reach $5,000 per ounce by 2026. The U.S. dollar has also experienced downward pressure, making gold more attractive to international buyers.\nWinners and Losers in the Golden Rush\nA sustained gold rally to over $4,300 per ounce creates a clear delineation between beneficiaries and those facing increased costs or reduced demand. Companies directly involved in gold production, streaming, and investment are poised for substantial gains.\nGold Mining Companies are the most direct beneficiaries. Higher gold prices translate directly to increased revenue and expanded profit margins, assuming stable production costs. This can lead to higher dividends, share buybacks, and increased exploration budgets. Major players like Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM), the world's largest gold producer, and Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD, TSX: ABX), the second largest, stand to benefit significantly. Other prominent miners such as Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE: AEM, TSX: AEM), Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE: KGC, TSX: K), and B2Gold Corp. (NYSE: BTG, TSX: BTO) will also see their fortunes rise.\nPrecious Metals Streaming and Royalty Companies also thrive in this environment. These firms, such as Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE: WPM, TSX: WPM) and Franco-Nevada Corporation ("

(There is increased electrification in transport, for one thing, and a trade war, which has dimmed global growth and thus oil demand expectations.) There could be even more OPEC+ oil coming down the pike, now that Iraq can export crude through Turkey again. And that return of ample supplies is coming at a time when other oil producers, including the United States, Brazil, and Guyana, are also filling up the bathtub. The result is what clearly seems to be an oversupplied market, perhaps one reason why oil prices have fallen 11 percent in just three weeks.\nBut that gusher is set to continue next year, leading some forecasters to expect benchmark oil prices in the $50s a barrel range, down even from today\u2019s sliding low $60s and a far cry from the nearly $80s a barrel oil briefly flirted with during the June escalation in the Middle East. That could be especially intense in the always weak first quarter of the year, when demand flags globally. Making things even more dire for Russia is that Urals, the grade of crude it markets, sells at a whopping discount to that\u2014about $12 a barrel cheaper or even more when shippers need to evade sanctions and convince wary buyers.\nGiven that even Russia\u2019s revised budget for next year is predicated on the price of its Urals oil getting more, not less, expensive (to $59 a barrel), it appears that the Kremlin\u2019s optimistic fiscal plans for 2026 are facing a painful reality check.\n\u201cTheir current budget framework reminds me of August 2022, when they expected spending to decline in 2023, but then the war didn\u2019t go the way they were hoping,\u201d Simola said. \u201cIf the war keeps not going well, they may need to increase, not decrease, defense spending next year, and that combined with an optimistic take on oil revenues\u201d could lead to a budget deficit of 3 percent of GDP, the highest since the war began.\nThat\u2019s a small number in a European\u2014let alone U.S.\u2014context, where runaway annual budget deficits are already 6 percent of GDP before the impacts of the Trump administration\u2019s latest spending bill become apparent. But the United States can still borrow quite cheaply; Russia cannot.\n\u201cIn the Russian context, [3 percent] is a lot. For Russia, it is different because it is restricted in borrowing, has no f"

(There is increased electrification in transport, for one thing, and a trade war, which has dimmed global growth and thus oil demand expectations.) There could be even more OPEC+ oil coming down the pike, now that Iraq can export crude through Turkey again. And that return of ample supplies is coming at a time when other oil producers, including the United States, Brazil, and Guyana, are also filling up the bathtub. The result is what clearly seems to be an oversupplied market, perhaps one reason why oil prices have fallen 11 percent in just three weeks.\nBut that gusher is set to continue next year, leading some forecasters to expect benchmark oil prices in the $50s a barrel range, down even from today\u2019s sliding low $60s and a far cry from the nearly $80s a barrel oil briefly flirted with during the June escalation in the Middle East. That could be especially intense in the always weak first quarter of the year, when demand flags globally. Making things even more dire for Russia is that Urals, the grade of crude it markets, sells at a whopping discount to that\u2014about $12 a barrel cheaper or even more when shippers need to evade sanctions and convince wary buyers.\nGiven that even Russia\u2019s revised budget for next year is predicated on the price of its Urals oil getting more, not less, expensive (to $59 a barrel), it appears that the Kremlin\u2019s optimistic fiscal plans for 2026 are facing a painful reality check.\n\u201cTheir current budget framework reminds me of August 2022, when they expected spending to decline in 2023, but then the war didn\u2019t go the way they were hoping,\u201d Simola said. \u201cIf the war keeps not going well, they may need to increase, not decrease, defense spending next year, and that combined with an optimistic take on oil revenues\u201d could lead to a budget deficit of 3 percent of GDP, the highest since the war began.\nThat\u2019s a small number in a European\u2014let alone U.S.\u2014context, where runaway annual budget deficits are already 6 percent of GDP before the impacts of the Trump administration\u2019s latest spending bill become apparent. But the United States can still borrow quite cheaply; Russia cannot.\n\u201cIn the Russian context, [3 percent] is a lot. For Russia, it is different because it is restricted in borrowing, has no f"

The pair appreciates as the Euro (EUR) receives support after France\u2019s government survived a no-confidence vote, as Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu\u2019s pledge to suspend a key pension reform won backing from some left-wing lawmakers.\nAdditionally, the Euro also draws support from the dovish outlook, contrasting with European Central Bank (ECB) projections, which suggest interest rates are likely to remain unchanged. ECB policymaker and Central Bank of Malta Governor Edward Scicluna said late Thursday that the central bank must not rush further interest-rate cuts. Scicluna added that it\u2019s not clear whether higher trade tariffs will be disinflationary or inflationary, and we shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions as this is crucial.\nECB Governing Council member Martin Kocher said on Thursday, \u201cI believe that we have reached the end of the interest rate reduction cycle or are at least very close to it.\u201d Kocher further noted that it is \u201cimportant to keep powder dry for potential crises.\u201d\nThe EUR/USD pair rises as the US Dollar (USD) declines due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which will continue into next week after the Senate once again failed to pass a Republican bill to extend funding and end the stalemate, marking the tenth unsuccessful attempt on Thursday, the 16th day of the impasse.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy an"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar Extends Gains to 1.1655 and Weakness Lift Euro\nThe euro surges after breaking key resistance at 1.1630, while DXY sinks to 98.60 amid 94% Fed easing odds, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown, and renewed U.S.\u2013China trade tensions | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Holds Firm Above 1.1650 as Dollar Weakens on Fed Cut Bets and Political Risks\nThe EUR/USD pair is regaining momentum, trading near 1.1655, as the euro extends its rebound amid a weakening U.S. dollar and a decisive shift in market expectations toward Federal Reserve rate cuts. After bottoming near 1.1540, the pair broke through key resistance at 1.1630, confirming a double-bottom reversal pattern that signaled the end of its recent downtrend. The neckline breakout, supported by improving momentum and strong participation from European buyers, suggests that the euro is regaining its footing after weeks of defensive trading. The 50-day EMA at 1.1633 has now turned from resistance into support, while the 200-day EMA near 1.1679 serves as the next critical barrier. A clean daily close above 1.1680 could set the stage for an extended move toward 1.1720 and 1.1778, reinforcing a short-term bullish bias.\nThe macro backdrop amplifies the bullish tone for EUR/USD. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen to 98.60, a one-week low, marking its third consecutive day of losses as traders nearly fully price in two 25-basis-point rate cuts \u2014 one expected in October and another in December. The dovish stance has been reinforced by the Fed\u2019s Beige Book, which revealed slower economic growth, weak labor market data, and rising input costs. These findings fueled the narrative that the central bank\u2019s next moves will prioritize stability over inflation containment. CME FedWatch currently shows a 94.6% probability of a rate cut to the 3.50%-3.75% range before year-end, weakening the dollar\u2019s yield advantage against the euro.\nFed Easing Bets and Political Uncertainty Deepen Pressure on the Greenback\nThe decline in the U.S. dollar is not solely monetary\u2014it\u2019s also political. The prolonged U.S. government shutdown, now entering its third week, has compounded investor uncertainty. The standoff over federal funding and spending priorities has raised concerns about potential rating downgrades and fiscal gridlock in Washington. Historically, such episodes have weakened dollar demand as investors seek stability in alternative currencies, and the euro has become one of the prime beneficiaries.\nMoreover, renewed U.S.-China trade frictions are undermining global risk sentiment. President Trump\u2019s 100% tariff announcement on Chinese rare earth exports and Beijing\u2019s retaliatory remarks have reignited fears of a prolonged trade standoff. This escalation comes at a time when the Fed is signaling policy easing, creating a perfect storm of factors driving capital away from the dollar. Traders are rotating toward assets with perceived lower political exposure\u2014most notably the euro and gold, both of which have posted sharp gains in recent sessions.\nTechnical Structure Signals a Potential Trend Reversal Toward 1.18\nFrom a technical lens, EUR/USD shows signs of a confirmed bullish reversal. The pair has not only reclaimed the neckline of the double-bottom formation at 1.1630 but also broken above the descending channel that constrained price action since late September. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed to 59, reflecting renewed buying interest but still shy of overbought territory, allowing for further upside without significant resistance. A sustained move above 1.1680 would likely invite momentum traders targeting 1.1730, with 1.1800 emerging as the ultimate short-term resistance level.\nMoving averages are converging, a technical signal often preceding trend transitions. The 100-day SMA, currently below the 200-day SMA, indicates that bearish pressure is fading. The narrowing gap between these two moving averages implies a potential bullish crossover, reinforcing "

UK data came in more or less above expectations, bolstering the Pound Sterling (GBP) as it extends a technical rebound from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near 1.3270.\nCable is now facing a fresh technical ceiling near the 50-day EMA at 1.3450, but momentum remains in favor of GBP bulls as US data remains a limited affair.\nMarket-driving data evaporates, headline chasing in its place\nThere is little of note on both sides of Friday\u2019s data docket, with the UK data pool now empty and the US side dark amid the ongoing government shutdown, which has caused the release of official datapoints to dwindle down to functionally nothing.\nHowever, the silver lining for markets is that the Federal Reserve (Fed), lacking a consistent flow of inflation-sensitive data, has little else to do but hold steady on its current pace of interest rate cuts. Rate markets have fully priced in two more rate cuts before the end of the calendar year, with another rate cut expected next March.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\nAuthor\nJoshua Gibson\nFXStreet\nJoshua joins the FXStreet team as an Economics and Finance double major from Vancouver Island University with twelve years' experience as an independent trader focusing on tec"

This is the highest reading since November 2021. Meanwhile, Employment Change came in at 14.9K, missing forecasts of 17K, following 11.8K job losses in August. The report confirmed softer labor demand, reinforcing speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could resume monetary easing in the coming months.\nRBA Governor Michele Bullock said on Wednesday that a pickup in household spending and stronger readings in some inflation components prompted policymakers to remain cautious before implementing additional rate cuts. Meanwhile, RBA Assistant Governor Christopher Kent noted that financial conditions are now \u201cless restrictive\u201d after recent rate reductions and that policy is \u201cwithin a broad, uncertain neutral range,\u201d pending further data.\nAccording to ING analyst Francesco Pesole, the rise in unemployment does not necessarily mean the RBA will act immediately. He argued that the central bank is likely to wait for third-quarter inflation data due later in October before deciding on the next move: \u201cWe think a rate cut in December remains the most likely scenario,\u201d he said.\nAt the same time, the US Dollar (USD) remains subdued as the partial US government shutdown drags on and markets grow more confident that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will continue easing monetary policy.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Australia\u2019s unemployment rate increased to 4.5% in September, the highest since November 2021. This rise in unemployment has led to heightened expectations for further rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).\nThe AUD/USD dropped by 0.38% on Thursday, trading around 0.6490, dipping below the 0.6500 mark. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that employment change was 14.9K, missing forecasts of 17K, following 11.8K job losses in August.\nMonetary Policies Impact\nRBA Governor Michele Bullock mentioned a careful approach due to household spending and inflation. Assistant Governor Christopher Kent noted financial conditions are \u201cless restrictive,\u201d awaiting further data. An ING analyst suggested a rate cut might occur in December, pending inflation data due later in October.\nThe US Dollar remains subdued due to the partial government shutdown in the US and expectations that the Federal Reserve will maintain dovish monetary policy. Australian Dollar has shown strength against the US Dollar, according to a currency percentage change table. The heat map indicates the Australian Dollar\u2019s performance against other major currencies.\nWith Australian unemployment hitting 4.5%, a level we haven\u2019t seen since the post-pandemic recovery began in late 2021, the case for more rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia is getting stronger. This confirms the trend of economic cooling we\u2019ve observed since the aggressive rate hikes of 2023. For us, this solidifies a bearish bias on the Australian dollar heading into the final quarter of the year.\nThe RBA is holding back for now, waiting for the third-quarter inflation data before making its next move. This creates a period of tension, as we know the jobs market is weakening but the official inflation story is still pending. We should anticipate a significant spike in volatility around that inflation release later this month, as it will likely be the final trigger for a rate cut decision.\nMarket Reactions and Opportunities\nLooking at the US dollar side, its own weakness from the government shutdown and a dovish Federal Reserve is capping the downside for the AUD/USD pair. This isn\u2019t a simple case of Aussie weakness, but rather a contest between two currencies with loosening monetary policies. This environment suggests that while the direction for the Aussie may be down, the path will likely be choppy and volatile.\nGiven this setup, we see value in buying AUD/USD put options that expire after the inflation data release. This allows us to position for a potential sharp drop if inflation comes in soft, confirming a rate cut, while limiting our maximum loss if the data surprises to the upside. The current uncertainty is likely keeping option premiums reasonable, presenting a good risk-reward opportunity.\nWe should also look at cross-currency pairs to isolate the Australian dollar\u2019s weakness more effectively. For example, considering a short AUD/NZD or short AUD/CAD position could be a cleaner trade. The central banks of New Zealand and Canada may not be as dovish as the RBA and the Fed, potentially offering a smoother downward trend for the Aussie."

Investors now seem worried about economic risks stemming from signs of strain in US-China trade relations, rising geopolitical tensions, and a prolonged US government shutdown. This is evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets and is driving safe-haven flows towards the JPY.\nMeanwhile, the collapse of the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) coalition with the Komeito eased concerns about Japan\u2019s fiscal health. This, in turn, keeps hopes alive for an imminent Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike and offers additional support to the JPY. The USD, on the other hand, is pressured by dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations, which contribute to the USD/JPY pair's downfall. That said, political uncertainty in Japan remains elevated and warrants caution for the JPY bulls.\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Japanese Yen bulls retain control amid safe-haven buying\n- The US and China started charging additional port fees on vessels linked to each other\u2019s fleets. This comes after the US broadened tech restrictions and China outlined tighter export controls on rare earths, fueling concerns about an all-out trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n- US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to work toward ending the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Trump is set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House later this Friday.\n- In the meantime, Russia launched hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, as well as glide bombs on Thursday, hitting gas facilities in eastern Ukraine. This keeps geopolitical risks in play and weighs on investors' sentiment, driving some safe-haven flows towards the Japanese Yen.\n- The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) split with the Komeito jeopardized Sanae Takaichi's bid to become Japan's first woman Prime Minister. Takaichi advocated the former Premier Shinzo Abe's policy of heavy spending and monetary stimulus to support the economy.\n- The latest political developments eased concerns about Japan\u2019s fiscal health, and the reversal of the Takaichi trade turns out to be another factor underpinning the JPY. Apart from this, expectations for an imminent Bank of Japan rate hike by the year-end further benefits the JPY.\n- BoJ Kazuo Ueda said this Friday that the impact of tariffs on global, US economy is being delayed which is keeping growth resilient. Ueda added that the BoJ will adjust degree of monetary support in accordance to the likelihood of our growth, inflation forecasts materializing.\n- In contrast, traders have been pricing in two more rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in 2025.

The repeated failure to pass the stopgap bill underscores a deadlock in Congress and fuels concerns about the economic effect of a prolonged government closure.\n- In the absence of any relevant US macro data, traders will continue to take cues from speeches by influential FOMC members to grab short-term opportunities.

                "body": "JPY can recover further as political landscape becomes clearer\nJPY: BoJ rate hike still plausible by year-end\nThe yen continues to slowly recover from the initial sell-off sparked by the political uncertainty created by the surprise victory in the LDP leadership election for Sanae Takaichi. From an intra-day high of 153.27 last Friday, USD/JPY has declined by 1.5% with the prospect of a Takaichi victory no longer fuelling further yen selling. The collapse of the New Komeito coalition altered the landscape somewhat and ultimately weakened Takaichi\u2019s position which could well undermine her ability to pursue her policy agenda that was viewed as being yen negative. The LDP is continuing to push for a PM vote in the Diet next Tuesday and the LDP has now entered discussions with Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) on entering a coalition agreement. This will be crucial as a successful agreement would put to bed the idea of an opposition block by CDPJ, DPP and Ishin putting forward its own candidate for PM. A coalition with Ishin is certainly more plausible from a policy perspective and indeed one reason we believed Koizumi would win the leadership election was due to him being well positioned to form a coalition with Ishin. There are policy differences however and the LDP will likely have to compromise in order to reach a deal. One key Ishin policy is the suspension of the sales tax on food until March 2027. While not an LDP policy, it is a more manageable sales tax cut in that it is food only and has a clear end-date. The other main parties have more aggressive sales tax cut plans. Ishin while supporting increased spending does also promote fiscal sustainability and aims for consolidation over the medium term. Ishin is also an Osaka-based political party and believes in policies to decentralise certain government decision-making roles to Osaka and to restructure Osaka into special wards as in Tokyo. Takaichi has expressed scepticism on these policies so this is likely another area where compromise will be required.\nOn BoJ policy it\u2019s likely that Ishin would support leaving policy decisions to the BoJ and is viewed as being supportive of the gradual removing of monetary easing. A coalition agreement with ad-hoc support from New Komeito would likely be viewed as a reasonable outcome based on the options prior. We still suspect it will be US economic developments and Fed policy that will prove most important for USD/JPY. BoJ policy board member Naoki Tamura spoke today and being one of the members who voted to hike in September it was no surprise that his comments today were consistent with supporting a rate hike going forward. Finance Minister Kato stated overnight in Washington that he was seeing \u201crapid FX moves in a weak yen direction\u201d and would watch for \u201cexcessive, disorderly moves\u201d. Renewed yen weakness is not in Japan\u2019s interest and will only undermine Japanese household support for the new government and threaten relations with the US \u2013 so yen downside risks from here look to be receding. Still, that will only become clearer once the political uncertainty over the PM vote clears next week.\nLONG-TERM JGB YIELDS HAVE STABILISED\nSource: Bloomberg, Macrobond & MUFG GMR\nEUR: Lower front-end yields curtailing EUR upside\nThe lack of top-tier economic data from the US has not stopped front-end yields from declining with expectations remaining firm that the FOMC will deliver two additional rate cuts this month and in December. From an intra-day high on 25th September to the low yesterday, the 2-year UST note yield has dropped 20bps with a big move on Monday in response to the increased trade tariff risks. Over the same period the Germany 2-year yield is down around 15bps. The German 2-year yield is just 8bps below the ECB\u2019s policy rate while the 2-year UST note yield is 60bps below.\nThe messaging from the ECB has been indicative of no policy change going forward although we do see risks building that the ECB\u2019s rhetoric could start to change"

The US Dollar (USD) softens against the Canadian Dollar (CAD) as global trade tensions and signs of weakening in the US economy bolster the case for further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed).\nConcerns over trade tensions and the ongoing US government shutdown drag the Greenback lower against the CAD. US President Donald Trump began a trade war with China, raising concerns about long-term impacts on the economy, even as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a longer truce before raising tariffs further.\nUS federal shutdown will extend into next week as the Senate failed to advance the GOP funding bill for a tenth time. The White House said on Wednesday that it will likely lay off at least 10,000 federal workers during the US government shutdown as Trump steps up pressure on Democrats.\nAdditionally, the prospect of Fed rate cuts in the remainder of the day might contribute to the USD\u2019s downside. Fed Governor Christopher Waller noted that he is on board with another interest rate cut at the Fed\u2019s policy meeting later this month due to the mixed readings in the labor market. The Fed's newest Governor Stephen Miran reiterated support for more aggressive rate cuts at the October meetings than the one favored by some of his colleagues.\nNonetheless, a fall in crude oil prices could undermine the commodity-linked Loonie and cap the downside for the pair. It\u2019s worth noting that Canada is the largest oil exporter to the US, and lower crude oil prices tend to have a negative impact on the CAD value.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money.

                "body": "The Canadian dollar is stuck in neutral this week, unable to shake off its slump even as a few fundamentals have turned in its favor. The USD/CAD pair is holding steady around 1.4045, hovering near six-month highs as traders wait for something new to drive momentum. The markets seem to be anticipating more Canadian dollar weakness \u2014 and continue to shrug off every piece of positive Canadian economic news. Stronger-than-expected Canadian job growth, firmer oil prices, and dovish talk from the U.S. Federal Reserve should have given the Loonie a lift, but so far, investors aren\u2019t biting.\nPolicy divergence keeps the Loonie on its back foot\nThe biggest factor working against the Canadian dollar right now is the widening monetary policy gap between the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Federal Reserve. Markets expect the BoC to trim rates by roughly 33 basis points over the next year \u2014 essentially one cut with a slim chance of a second. The Fed, on the other hand, is projected to slash rates by over 100 basis points across four potential cuts, with traders even pricing in a 50/50 shot at a fifth.\nNormally, the expectation of faster U.S. easing would weaken the greenback, but that hasn\u2019t been the case. The USD remains well-bid, with investors treating it as the safer bet amid mixed global data and political uncertainty. Even dovish remarks this week from Fed officials \u2014 Miran, who said the central bank may be \u201cadjusting too slowly,\u201d and Waller, who backed continued quarter-point cuts \u2014 weren\u2019t enough to pull USD/CAD lower.\nAt the moment, markets see a 99.8% chance of a Fed cut at the October 29 meeting compared to just 52% odds for the BoC. That imbalance continues to anchor the pair near the top of its recent range.\nEconomic calendar: plenty of data, limited conviction\nTraders will have no shortage of data to digest this week. On Thursday, look for the Eurozone trade balance, U.S. PPI and retail sales, weekly jobless claims, Philly Fed manufacturing index, Canadian housing starts, plus a speech from BoC Governor Tiff Macklem.\nFriday brings another round of key releases: Eurozone inflation, U.S. building permits and housing starts, non-farm payrolls, unemployment rate, industrial production, and factory orders. However, some of the U.S. numbers could be delayed due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has added another layer of uncertainty to markets.\nThe backdrop: oil, jobs, and sentiment\nCanada\u2019s job market has been surprisingly resilient. The latest report showed an addition of about 60,000 jobs, a strong beat that briefly pushed the Loonie higher. Yet, as Reuters noted, the move quickly faded, with traders focusing instead on global growth concerns and the Fed\u2019s policy path.\nOil \u2014 one of Canada\u2019s most important exports \u2014 has rebounded modestly after India announced a pause in Russian energy imports, but the bounce hasn\u2019t translated into real strength for the CAD. Meanwhile, the ongoing government shutdown in Washington and lack of progress on trade discussions with China have kept risk appetite subdued.\nTechnically, USD/CAD looks overbought, but the pair continues to find support around 1.4020, with resistance sitting near 1.4080. As some analysts point out, momentum indicators \u2014 which measure how quickly prices are moving \u2014 suggest the pair may be due for a pause before its next move.\nOutlook: overvalued, but still resilient\nFrom a valuation perspective, USD/CAD feels stretched, and some traders believe the market is pricing in too much pessimism for the Canadian dollar. Still, as long as the Loonie fails to capitalize on good news, the path of least resistance remains more weakness for the Canadian dollar.\nIf Canadian data softens or oil prices retreat, USD/CAD could break above 1.41.

                "body": "On Thursday (October 16), USD/CAD remained near the opening price, stabilizing after retreating from a six-month high of 1.4079. The pair was trading at 1.4054 during the session, up 0.10%, with a monthly gain of 0.90%.\nComplex Trade Situation\nThe weakness of the Canadian dollar is primarily attributed to uncertainties surrounding U.S.-Canada trade negotiations, particularly regarding sectoral agreements in the automotive and energy sectors, prompting caution among investors. Low oil prices (WTI crude around $58 per barrel) further weigh on Canada's export-driven economy, intensifying depreciation pressures on the Canadian dollar.\nThis dynamic has reinforced the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, potentially limiting the Canadian dollar\u2019s rebound space in the short term.\nEscalating U.S.-China tensions have raised investor concerns, putting downward pressure on the U.S. dollar across the board. However, persistently low crude oil prices, Canada\u2019s main export commodity, have constrained upside potential for the Canadian dollar, preventing it from appreciating despite the weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nBank of Canada Policy and Rate Cut Expectations\nBank of Canada (BoC) Governor Tiff Macklem is scheduled to deliver remarks today, with markets expecting him to reiterate the economic outlook. The probability of a rate cut at the October 29 policy meeting stands at approximately 60%.\nThe BoC has cumulatively cut interest rates by 175 basis points this year, with market pricing pointing to a further reduction to 2.75% by 2025, reflecting growth concerns and the impact of trade frictions. This accommodative trajectory diverges from potential hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to exacerbate the Canadian dollar\u2019s weakness, especially amid political uncertainties such as the no-confidence vote at the end of 2024 and the 2025 general election risks. Overall, this factor supports an upward trend in USD/CAD.\nTechnical Analysis: Downward Correction Within a Bullish Trend\n(USD/CAD 4-hour chart Source: Yi Hui Tong)\nThe current pullback in the US dollar is considered a corrective movement following the uptrend initiated from near the low of 1.3930 last week. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) is retreating from overbought levels, and the aforementioned support level at 1.4020 continues to restrain downside attempts in the exchange rate.\nIf the exchange rate falls further below the 1.4020 support level, it will test the rising trendline support around the 1.4000 level. Below that, the October 10 low stands at 1.3980, while the key support range lies between the October 8-9 lows, specifically within 1.3930 to 1.3940.\nConversely, if the exchange rate attempts an upward move, resistance is likely to emerge at 1.4060 (Wednesday\u2019s high) and near 1.4080 (October 14 high). A successful break above these resistance levels would shift focus to the 161.8% Fibonacci extension of the late-September uptrend, located near 1.4145.\nThe recent breakout above the psychological threshold of 1.40 has placed significant pressure on the Canadian dollar. It is worth noting that the daily USD/CAD chart formed a shooting star candlestick pattern last Tuesday, indicating market resistance after the breakout and difficulty sustaining further upward momentum. However, this pullback is expected to provide buying opportunities for the US dollar, which remains strong not only against the Canadian dollar but also across other currency pairs. The USD/CAD pair is projected to eventually rise to the 1.42 level. Nevertheless, achieving this target in the short term may prove challenging unless major economic data or events cause market turbulence.\nOverall, the US dollar\u2019s trend remains bullish, with particularly pronounced strength against the Canadian dollar."

The pair faces selling pressure as the Japanese Yen (JPY) outperforms its peers despite uncertainty surrounding the monetary policy announcement by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) later this month.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

For example, if you pick the Japanese Yen from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent JPY (base)/USD (quote).\nEarlier in the day, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that he needs more data before deciding on whether the central bank will raise interest rates this month. \u201cI would like to keep gathering more information and scrutinise various data that comes out leading up to our October policy meeting,\u201d Ueda said in a news conference in Washington, according to Reuters.\nOn the political front, Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Sanae Takaichi continues to persuade her opposition leaders to support her for the prime ministerial role in voting expected next week.\nMeanwhile, the Pound Sterling (GBP) exhibits a mixed performance against its peers, with investors seeking cues on how much United Kingdom (UK) Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves will raise taxes and cut spendings to meet her fiscal targets. Reeves confirmed in an interview on Thursday that she would raise taxes to maintain a decent fiscal buffer, but denied plans of raising wealth tax.\nOn the monetary policy front, Bank of England (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Catherine Mann has argued against reducing interest rates further, citing that labor market conditions are weakening only at a moderate pace. \u201cWhat has transpired is that the labour market has modestly loosened but it is not falling off of the cliff,\u201d Mann said in an event in Washington on Thursday, Reuters reported.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating proje"

This marks the sharpest single-day withdrawal since the post-tariff flash crash last week. At the same time, Ethereum ETFs absorbed $169.6 million, led by BlackRock\u2019s ETHA, signaling a short-term rotation of institutional liquidity from Bitcoin into altcoin exposure.\nThe divergence follows the unprecedented 15% Bitcoin plunge to $100,000 during last Friday\u2019s flash crash triggered by former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.

None of the remaining U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows that day.\nCumulative data since Friday show Bitcoin funds suffering $332.3 million in total redemptions, reducing net ETF assets to roughly $151.3 billion. Trading activity remained heavy, with $4.56 billion in turnover, indicating repositioning rather than a full investor exit. Analysts at K33 Research described the trend as \u201ca structural deleveraging phase\u201d likely to persist until liquidity stabilizes.\nETHEREUM FUNDS CAPTURE MOMENTUM AMID BITCOIN LIQUIDITY RETREAT\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs faced redemptions, Ethereum products gained $169.6 million, mostly via BlackRock\u2019s ETHA ($164.3 million), Bitwise\u2019s ETHW ($12.3 million), and Fidelity\u2019s FETH ($1 million). Only 21Shares\u2019 CETH reported modest outflows of $8 million.\nInstitutional preference appears to be temporarily shifting toward Ethereum\u2019s staking yield and lower volatility. Total net assets in ETH funds stand at $27.4 billion, with two-day cumulative inflows nearing $200 million.

Solana (-6.8% to $192) and XRP (-5.5% to $2.39) led losses, while Tron (+0.4% to $0.3216) was the only major gainer.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRIGGERS: MACRO POLICY AND FUTURES DELEVERAGING\nThe late-week meltdown stemmed from renewed U.S.\u2013China trade tensions after Trump\u2019s tariff announcement, prompting a global sell-off in risk assets.

                "body": "In top crypto news today, Ethereum (ETH) remains at the forefront of headlines with investors projecting strong recovery in Q4 through renewed action in the DeFi market and expansion in the area of layer-2 in 2025. But though Ethereum\u2019s long-term fundamentals remain solid, new Ethereum-built DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming a top crypto to invest in this year.\nIn phase 6 presale, the project is valued at $0.035 and already sold out more than 65%. Mutuum Finance has already generated $17.4 million in funds and gained over 17,200 investors. Its expanding network and utility-focused model have experts terming it the next big DeFi phenomenon on Ethereum, and possibly one of the standout performers in 2025 across the altcoin space.\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Bounces Back Towards $4,500 as Bulls Maintain Momentum\nAfter temporarily dropping below the $3,800 mark, Ethereum (ETH) is showing a solid reversal signal, popping back above $4,150 and closing out the key bearish trend line at about $4,100. The action also took ETH through the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the $4,758 top and $3,423 low, which suggests newfound momentum to the upside within the marketplace.\nPrimary upside targets in this situation lie at $4,250, then $4,320, and potentially a breakout to the $4,400\u2013$4,500 region, levels which may bolster broader investor confidence. A reversal at $4,250 may, on the other hand, begin the short-term correction back into $4,120\u2013$4,100 region with deeper support near $4,020 and $3,950. Although speculative traders remain focused upon Ethereum\u2019s technical recovery, long-term investors also eye new projects within the burgeoning DeFi space such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which suggests capital again is going into innovation throughout the Ethereum network.\nMutuum Finance Attracting Greater Presale Hype\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to trend in the DeFi sector and headlines in crypto news with strong interest building among investors. The sixth presale phase of the project is already 65% subscribed, which indicates strong market momentum. Over 17,200 investors have invested $17.4 million in total so far, both all-time highs for MUTM, which highlights the continually growing global appetite for its long-term decentralized finance vision and ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is a top crypto to buy today.\nDuring its recent development update, Mutuum Finance announced it would be launching its lending and borrowing protocol in the near term, another significant move in the expansion of its decentralized architecture. The platform\u2019s Version 1 (V1) is set to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The Initial Release would see it launch with a solid set of DeFi building blocks such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot which all combined will be used in the development of the comprehensive, efficient, and scalable decentralized finance infrastructure.\nMutuum Finance Leaderboard Sparks Investor Interest\nThe Mutuum Finance leaderboard is fueling a wave of excitement among investors with its daily competition and reward system. Over the last 24 hours, the top five investors have collectively purchased $8,860, $8,339, $1,187, $949, and $408 worth of MUTM tokens respectively, a clear sign of the community\u2019s growing enthusiasm and engagement in the ongoing presale.\nEach member who asserts the top spot receives on a daily basis a $500 MUTM token reward aiming at acknowledging regularity, dedication, and active involvement. To be eligible for the prize, users must undertake at least one transaction in the course of 24 hours.\nMUTM has drawn $17.4 million in funds across over 17,200 investors in Phase 6, which is currently 65% sold out. Record-highest daily purchases of $8,860 and $8,339 signal strong momentum and community engagement. With its lending/borrowing protocol coming soon, MUTM encapsulates innovation, scalability, and DeFi utility in one package as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Get your tokens now a"

                "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonegilsson/2025/10/16/how-the-secs-ethereum-nod-could-unlock-a-trillion-dollar-market/",
                "body": "\u201cI do believe we\u2019re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets \u2014 from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board,\u201d said Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, in an interview with CNBC. Coming from the world\u2019s largest asset manager, it\u2019s a strong signal.\nIn parallel, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took a quieter but equally telling step: a nod to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-3643 standard, a framework that encodes regulatory compliance directly into digital tokens.\nIn plain terms, it means law can now travel with the asset \u2014 every share, bond, or fund can carry its own rules, embedded directly in its software code \u2014 the smart contract. That shift is dramatically accelerating a trillion-dollar tokenized asset market, where law and regulatory compliance move with the asset and live on the blockchain.\nWhen the SEC Chair explicitly refers to a blockchain token standard, it\u2019s a sign that finance itself is changing. In a recent speech, Paul S. Atkins described how compliance requirements could be written directly into smart contracts \u2014 citing ERC-3643, the Ethereum-based standard that embeds regulatory safeguards into tokenized securities.\nIt was a subtle but historic moment: a top U.S. regulator recognizing code itself as a tool to ensure regulatory compliance on-chain.\nHow Law Learned to Code\nThe idea behind ERC-3643 is simple but radical \u2014 make regulation part of the token itself. Each token carries its own rulebook: who can hold it, where it can trade, and when it can be redeemed. Every transfer automatically checks both sides for legal eligibility; if conditions aren\u2019t met, the transaction never happens.\nWhen I met Luc Falempin, co-author of the protocol and co-founder of Tokeny, he recalled the problem that started it all. \u201cFinancial institutions loved blockchain but couldn\u2019t use it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tools were outdated, and compliance was manual. We made the rules part of the asset.\u201d\nThat insight led to T-REX \u2014 short for Token for Regulated EXchanges \u2014 developed through real-world projects tokenizing equities and real estate with regulators involved from the start. Formalized in a 2018 whitepaper, it became ERC-3643 in 2021: the Ethereum standard for permissioned tokens that can move peer-to-peer yet remain fully compliant.\nWhere DeFi Meets Regulation\nEthereum\u2019s open standards power everything from stablecoins to NFTs. ERC-3643 adds a missing layer \u2014 a framework for regulated assets that embeds compliance directly into code. It lets law move with the asset.\nBuilt on Ethereum\u2019s familiar architecture, ERC-3643 adds identity checks and transfer rules where required by law. Instead of building closed systems, institutions can plug into the same open infrastructure that powers DeFi.\n\u201cStablecoins and NFTs changed what could exist on-chain,\u201d said Falempin. \u201cERC-3643 changes who can hold it and how. It connects innovation to regulation.\u201d\nWhile most institutions were experimenting with private blockchains, Falempin\u2019s team built openly on Ethereum. \u201cThe public EVM ecosystem gave us the libraries, the community, and the speed we needed,\u201d he said.\nThat choice saved years of development and ensured ERC-3643 works across networks. By encoding compliance in open standards rather than proprietary systems, Tokeny showed that transparency can scale faster than control \u2014 and that open source can win in finance just as it did in technology.\nWhen the Regulator Cited the Code\nIn his July 2025 address, SEC Chair Paul Atkins outlined how tokenized assets could comply through \u201cprinciples-based conditions\u201d rather than rigid, outdated rules \u2014 including \u201cverified-pool\u201d functionality and token standards with built-in compliance features such as ERC-3643.\nThe head of the world\u2019s most powerful securities agency cited an Ethereum standard as a model for how law itself can operate on-chain. Regulation, once a brake on innovation\u2014 is now becoming part of the SEC\u2019s code.\nWhen legal scholar Lawrence Lessig warned that \u201ccode is law,\u201d he meant that softw"

(ticker DFDV) has acquired an additional 86,307 SOL, worth $16 million, according to The Block\u2019s price page.\nThe move increases the Nasdaq-listed firm's SOL horde by nearly 5%, totaling over 2 million tokens worth about $426 million, according to a release on Thursday.\nDeFi Development Corp. purchased its latest tranche for an average price of $110.91 per SOL.\nWith about 28 million shares outstanding, the firm is reporting its \"SOL per Share\" metric is about $14.67 in dollar terms. This is down from its SOL per Share figure of $19.44, with approximately 25 million shares outstanding, recorded in September.\nFounded earlier this year by a team of former Kraken employees, DeFi Development executes a strategy of buying and staking SOL and Solana-related tokens, like the Dogwifhat memecoin. It also offers validator services, including for crypto exchange Kraken.\nDeFi Development is one of the five largest public Solana holders, according to The Block\u2019s data.

                "body": "TLDR\n- DFDV adds $9.6M in Solana, lifting holdings to 2.19M SOL.\n- Shares fall 7.28% despite strong crypto-backed balance sheet.\n- Staking strategy grows yield via Solana validator operations.\n- Treasury value climbs, reinforcing long-term SOL exposure.\n- Clear SPS metrics highlight steady expansion amid volatility.\nDeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: DFDV) closed 7.28% lower on October 15, 2025, ending the session at $13.95.\nDeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: DFDV)\nThis decline came as the company disclosed a significant Solana (SOL) acquisition worth approximately $9.6 million. The market appeared unimpressed despite the announcement boosting total treasury holdings to around $426 million.\nThe firm confirmed its purchase of 86,307 SOL at an average price of $110.91 per SOL, representing a 4.7% increase in its position. The overall SOL and SOL-equivalent holding now stands at 2,195,926, positioning the company as a major SOL holder. Despite the solid asset base, the sharp dip suggests that share price decoupled from underlying treasury strength during the trading session.\nWith the broader market mixed, DFDV\u2019s performance highlighted volatility tied to digital asset-aligned equities. While the company\u2019s strategy aligns with Solana\u2019s long-term growth, price sentiment lagged behind treasury performance. Even so, DeFi Development Corp. continues expanding its stake in the Solana ecosystem through strategic accumulation.\nSOL Holdings Strengthen Treasury Strategy\nDeFi Development Corp. remains focused on its core treasury strategy centered around SOL accumulation and staking. The latest acquisition brings the company\u2019s holdings to a reported 2,195,926 SOL, reinforcing its blockchain-aligned capital allocation model. Additionally, the company disclosed that the newly purchased tokens will be staked across various validators.\nNotably, a portion of the SOL will be directed to its own validator nodes to capture yield from Solana\u2019s proof-of-stake framework. This method enables the firm to generate passive income while further integrating its infrastructure into the Solana network. By compounding yield through self-operated validators, the company aims to grow treasury value over time.\nManagement continues to deploy funds raised from earlier equity financing into targeted SOL purchases. While the current purchase represents a partial use of proceeds, more acquisitions may follow. This steady buying strategy supports DeFi Development Corp.\u2019s vision of SOL as a core treasury asset.\nKey Per-Share Metrics and Share Structure Impacts\nAs of October 15, the firm reported a Solana-per-share (SPS) value of 0.0760, with a USD equivalent of $14.67. The total share count stands at 28,888,178, which includes exercised pre-funded warrants. There remain 2,978,578 warrants unexercised, potentially raising the fully diluted share count.\nIncluding all warrants, the adjusted share base could rise to approximately 31.9 million shares. Despite this increase, the company stated its SPS is expected to remain above the pre-financing level of 0.0675. The firm indicated future SPS updates will reflect both warrant exercises and additional SOL acquisitions.\nThis structured approach aims to maintain upward momentum in per-share asset exposure. The long-term holding and staking strategy also positions the firm for sustained treasury growth. Moreover, the transparent share count disclosure supports clarity around potential dilution and SPS impact."

Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) shares jumped 22% to lead the S&P 500 after stronger-than-expected results; and Nestl\u00e9 shares soared 9% in Swiss trading after the chocolate maker announced it would be laying off about 16,000 workers as part of its cost-cutting efforts.\nNoteworthy S&P 500 Movers on Thursday\nDecliners\n- Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and Regions Financial (RF) were among the S&P 500's biggest decliners, with both stocks sliding about 6% after Zions Bancorporation (ZION) said it was taking a $50 million third-quarter charge-off to cover a pair of bad loans, and Western Alliance (WAL) said it was dealing with a fraudulent borrower. Western Alliance shares fell close to 11% and Zions plunged 13%.\n- Kenvue (KVUE) shares also sank about 13%. A lawsuit filed this week in the United Kingdom claimed that the consumer health company's baby powder caused cancer and other diseases. Kenvue completed its spin-off in August 2023 from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which has been ordered to pay $966 million in damages after a jury in the U.S. found the company liable for similar claims.\n- Shares of cybersecurity firm F5 (FFIV) plummeted nearly 11%. The provider of application delivery and security services said Wednesday that it had been the target of a major cyberattack, which it attributed to a nation-state actor.\nAdvancers\n- The S&P 500's top performance Thursday came from shares of J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT), which motored 22% higher after the logistics company topped third-quarter sales and profit estimates. Improvements in efficiency and network balance helped drive growth in the company's intermodal business, "

                "body": "Dow Jones Industrial Average declines 330 points as sentiment shudders\n- The Dow Jones has found a fresh consolidation patch in the 46,200 region.\n- Earnings weeks, despite opening on a strong note, has given way to additional investor concerns.\n- Market headwinds are starting to pile up as traders see cracks forming everywhere.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) grappled in the middle of a deepening consolidation zone on Thursday, churning on both sides of 46,200 before declining around 330 points on the day. Investors are still tilting toward the bullish side on expectations that current political and structural issues will eventually be resolved, but market sentiment continues to take regular hits as fissures grow wider. The US government shutdown remains an ongoing issue that looms over investors, and traders caught a fresh bout of risk-off jitters amid rising concerns of risky loans on bank balance sheets.\nBig banks up, small banks down\nInvestment bank earnings bolstered broad-market sentiment during the midweek, but now regional and smaller-scale lenders are dragging investor confidence lower. Regional banks including Zions (ZION) and Western Alliance (WAL) tumbled on Thursday on faulty loans and concerns of borrower fraud. An undercurrent of weakness in regional banks adds onto growing market fears of the clear-as-mud private credit industry, which saw two auto-industry lending companies collapse recently.\nUS-China trade tensions are still simmering in the background, and investors are awaiting some sort of resolution from the Trump administration. US President Donald Trump threatened a new wave of triple-digit tariffs on China after China played a strong hand in the ongoing tariff dispute, imposing strict export controls on rare earth minerals produced in China, which remain a critical resource for many of the US\u2019s key industries, especially tech and computing hardware.\nEverything is fine\nThe US government shutdown continues to roll on with little sign of a fix, and official US datasets remain dark for the time being. The Federal Reserve (Fed), lacking a consistent flow of inflation-sensitive datasets, has little else to do but hold steady on its current pace of interest rate cuts. Rate markets have fully priced in two more rate cuts before the end of the calendar year, with another rate cut expected next March.\nDow Jones daily chart\nDow Jones FAQs\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the oldest stock market indices in the world, is compiled of the 30 most traded stocks in the US. The index is price-weighted rather than weighted by capitalization. It is calculated by summing the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing them by a factor, currently 0.152. The index was founded by Charles Dow, who also founded the Wall Street Journal. In later years it has been criticized for not being broadly representative enough because it only tracks 30 conglomerates, unlike broader indices such as the S&P 500.\nMany different factors drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The aggregate performance of the component companies revealed in quarterly company earnings reports is the main one. US and global macroeconomic data also contributes as it impacts on investor sentiment. The level of interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve (Fed), also influences the DJIA as it affects the cost of credit, on which many corporations are heavily reliant. Therefore, inflation can be a major driver as well as other metrics which impact the Fed decisions.\nDow Theory is a method for identifying the primary trend of the stock market developed by Charles Dow. A key step is to compare the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) and only follow trends where both are moving in the same direction. Volume is a confirmatory criteria. The theory uses elements of peak and trough analysis. Dow\u2019s theory posits three trend phases: accumulation, when smart money starts buying or selling"

That tiny uptick gives the government some breathing room ahead of November\u2019s budget, but persistent questions remain about possible tax hikes as yearly growth lags. With the highest inflation rate among developed countries, the pressure\u2019s on the Bank of England, especially with a crucial inflation update coming soon. Investors are eyeing whether policymakers will hold off on any rate cuts until late 2025 or beyond. On the corporate side, Whitbread\u2019s disappointing profits pulled travel and leisure shares lower, AstraZeneca dipped after a Deutsche Bank downgrade, and Croda International and XPS Pensions Group bucked the trend with upbeat results. Still, nerves are running high, with companies like Travis Perkins feeling the pinch from shrinking margins and conservative revenue forecasts.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Uncertainty keeps investors on their toes.\nStalled growth and sticky inflation are weighing on UK stocks, with the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 mirroring that cautious mood. Markets are holding their breath for the next inflation data, which could determine whether rate cuts come soon\u2014or get kicked further down the road. Some sectors, especially travel, leisure, and retailers, are feeling the pressure, but industries like chemicals and pensions are offering rare pockets of strength. Until the economic picture clears up, expect volatility and defensive positioning to stick around.\nThe bigger picture: Inflation challenges risk weighing on recovery.\nThe UK\u2019s high inflation is proving a tough nut to crack for policymakers, making it harder for the economy to find its groove again. Ongoing debates about tax increases and rate cut timing inject more uncertainty, which could put a damper on both business investment and consumer confidence. The split between struggling and resilient sectors highlights just how uneven the recovery is right now. The Bank of England\u2019s next steps will be key, with big consequences for industries and the overall economic outlook heading into 2025.\nYou now have the chance to back Prospero.ai: the award-winning AI platform with trading signals that have outperformed the S&P 500 by 67% over the past four years.\nProspero.ai is embedding itself in retail investors\u2019 routine.

                "body": "GBP/USD, DAX Forecast Two trades to watch\nGBP/USD rises after the UK economy returns to growth\n- UK GDP rose 0.1% MoM in August\n- USD slips on Fed rate cut expectations\n- GBP/USD tests the rising trendline resistance\nGBP/USD is rising amid a weaker U.S. dollar, as data showed the UK economy returned to growth in August, albeit marginally.\nData showed that the UK economy grew 0.1% MoM in August after falling 0.1% in July, which could offer some relief to Chancellor Rachel Reeves as she prepares for her budget in November.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the UK economy is on track to have the second-fastest growth among G7 nations in 2025 after the US. However, that 1.3% growth is not enough to avoid the need for tax increases in the November budget.\nRecent PMI data have suggested that after a strong summer, confidence and momentum faded in September due to concerns over the potential budget implications. The economy's regaining momentum hinges on restoring business confidence and reducing uncertainty.\nToday's data followed earlier figures that showed unemployment at its highest level in over 4 years, rising to 4.8%.\nMeanwhile, the US dollar is slipping lower as investors continue to weigh up the US-China trade tensions and as Federal Reserve rate cut expectations ramp up following Powell's speech earlier in the week.\nThe markets are pricing in a 93% probability of two rate cuts before the end of the year.\nHowever, the Federal Reserve is now in its blackout, which, combined with a lack of U.S. data owing to the ongoing government shutdown, means investors will be lacking fresh catalysts.\nGBP/USD forecast- technical analysis\nGBP/USD fell away from its mid-September high of 1.3725, falling below its rising trendline and 1.3350 support zone to a low of 1.3250. The hammer candlesticks hint at a bullish reversal, and the price has recovered above 1.34.\nBuyers will look to extend the recovery above the rising trendline resistance at 1.3440 to bring 1.36 and 1.37 into focus.\nImmediate support is evident at the 1.3350 zone, with 1.3250 coming into play below.\nDAX slips amid trade jitters & ahead of Lagarde\u2019s speech\n- US-China trade war jitters linger\n- ECB President Lagarde will speak later\n- DAX tests trendline support\nEuropean stocks open mixed on Thursday as choppy trading continues. While the FTSE is down around 1%, the DAX is falling 0.3% and the French CAC is down 0.2%.\nThe mood remains cautious as investors continue to weigh up escalating China-U.S. trade tensions. Rhetoric between the two sides has been ramping up, with Trump declaring a trade war with China. Although Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has played this down, saying it could all be resolved in a meeting between the two leaders later this month in South Korea.\nInterestingly, the latest trade measures are scheduled to take effect in November after Trump and Xi meet. This could mean that some of last week's measurements may be toned down or unwound if the meeting is successful.\nOn the data front, attention will be on the eurozone trade balance and a speech by ECB president Christine Lagarde later today.\nChristine Lagarde has previously said that the central bank sees the economy in a good place; however, she can't declare an end to interest rate cuts just yet.\nThe IMF published new forecasts and sees GDP rising 1.2% this year and 1.1% in 2026, largely in line with the ECB's projections.\nDAX forecast - technical analysis\nThe DAX hit a record high of 24,775 in early October before easing back. The price is testing the rising trendline support at 24,000, as well as the 50 SMA. The RSI is neutral.\nShould the support hold, buyers will look to rise back towards 24,775 to reach fresh record highs.\nShould sellers break below 24,000, this brings 23,350 support into focus. Below here, sellers could gain traction.\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country. It is not intended for distribution to residents in any "

Kennedy Jr. is no longer the host of a parasitic, brain-eating worm\n- The Curb Your Enthusiasm actress was a guest on The View, where she clarified prior comments made by the politician about his health\n- In a 2012 deposition, Kennedy detailed how doctors determined that his severe memory loss and brain fog were due to a worm that had eaten a portion of his brain\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is free and clear of brain-eating worms, according to his wife.\nDuring a Tuesday, Oct. 14 visit to The View to promote her upcoming book Unscripted, Cheryl Hines, 60, let the ladies know her husband is no longer the carrier of a parasitic worm that ate a portion of his brain more than a decade ago.\n\u201cCan we just clear one thing before you go? So we don\u2019t have to make any jokes about it,\u201d Joy Behar , 83, asked Hines.\nThe Curb Your Enthusiasm alum agreed to the line of questioning.\n\u201cDoes he or does he not have a brain worm?\u201d Behar inquired.\nAfter pausing to take a deep breath, Hines replied, \u201cIt ate just a little bit of his brain and died. So, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nHines's response prompted even more questions from both Behar and her co-host, Whoopi Goldberg, as she hinted they\u2019d find more answers on the alleged brain worm if they check out Unscripted: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to read my book.\u201d\nRelated Stories\n\u201cThat was just one, tiny headline in a mountain of crazy,\u201d the Ugly Truth actress added.\nTheir conversation was based on a May 2024 report from The New York Times, stating that in a 2012 deposition, the now 71-year-old United States Secretary of Health and Human Services and son of the late former United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy disclosed multiple health issues, including some neurological symptoms he began experiencing in 2010.\nKennedy sought the advice of doctors after dealing with severe memory loss and brain fog, reportedly leading to a scan of his brain that showed a dark spot in the imagery.\nBelieving it was a tumor, the politician was scheduled to undergo surgery to have it removed.\nBefore the surgery could happen, a doctor at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital told Kennedy that they believed the mass was actually the remains of a dead parasite.\nIn his deposition, the anti-vaccine activist said the dark image that showed up on his brain scans was \u201ccaused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died,\u201d The Times reported. Kennedy also said he was unsure of how he contracted the worm but believed it happened while he was on a trip to Southeast Asia.\nDuring his interview with the outlet, Kennedy said the parasitic brain worm, which PBS referred to as \u201ca pork tapeworm larva lodged in his brain,\u201d died on its own, and Kennedy did not require treatment.\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nSwine are the usual intermediate host for the parasite, but it can appear in humans \u201cfrom the fecal-oral route (ingestion of eggs), not via the ingestion of cysticerci (the larval stage of the pork tapeworm) in undercooked pork,\u201d according to the Centers for Disease Control."

She went on The View on October 14 to promote her upcoming book, Unscripted, out on November 11, and while she was there, Joy Behar dedicated her final question to the one thing we all really care about the most. \u201cDoes he or does he not have a brain worm?\u201d Behar asked, slamming her hand down on the table.\n\u201cIt ate just a little bit of his brain and died,\u201d Hines responded. \u201cSo don\u2019t worry.\u201d The other women of The View were confused, seemingly not having heard of the famous Kennedy brain worm, which was first reported on by the New York Times in May 2024. \u201cWait, what died?\u201d asked an incredulous Whoopi Goldberg. \u201cThe brain died?\u201d Hines said that they\u2019ll have to read her book.\nMost of the appearance saw Hines defending her husband. Sunny Hostin pushed Hines on her relationship with Donald Trump and whether she supports access to vaccines. \u201cThey both want access to vaccines,\u201d Hines said, to which Behar countered that it seemed as though Kennedy and Trump were \u201ccasting doubt on the efficacy of the vaccine.\u201d \u201cSo my question is, Can we do better?\u201d Hines repeated vaccine disinformation, wondering, \u201cCan we make them safer? Can we listen to parents who say, \u2018My child got the vaccine and changed and stopped hitting markers, stopped developing the way they were developing.\u2019\u201d Vaccine research overwhelmingly rejects the idea that vaccines are connected to autism.\nHines also defended Kennedy\u2019s lack of qualifications for his current role, saying, \u201cOne of Obama\u2019s secretaries of HHS was an economist,\u201d referring to Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who had previously worked as the president of the global-development program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, focusing on ending world poverty. Goldberg, meanwhile, pointed out that Kennedy is often \u201cspeaking not with the best information.\u201d And Hostin noted, in response to Hines, that Kennedy is the \u201cleast qualified\u201d to hold the position. \u201cI just wanted to follow up because Bobby\u2019s background, everything I have seen him do \u2014 he has dedicated his career to suing big corporations because of toxins that have been affecting people\u2019s health,\u201d she asserted of his law experience. \u201cHe was part of the team that sued Monsanto because of Roundup, a pesticide that was causing cancer. GMOs, right?\u201d At the end of the episode, Goldberg invited Hines to \u201ccome back\u201d on the show. \u201cReally?\u201d Hines retorted, making a face. Especially if she can bring the worm."
