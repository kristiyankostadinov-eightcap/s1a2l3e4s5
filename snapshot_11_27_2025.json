                "body": "Asia stocks rise tracking Wall St; China property jitters, stimulus in focus\nYesterday\u2019s market action confirmed all three setups described in previous Lab Notes with near-perfect precision\nThe USD Index broke down below key technical levels, while both silver and gold rallied directly into their projected upside targets. These price movements not only validate the outlined scenarios but also open the door for the next strategic decision points across metals.\nLet\u2019s start with the USD Index\nDaily Chart\nYesterday\u2019s close below the psychological barrier of 100 and the lower border of the green rising wedge carries strong technical and psychological implications: a close below them may signal a broader trend shift (however, only if follow-through selling confirms the break).\nToday\u2019s candle shows an attempted bounce back into the wedge - similar to the price behavior seen on Nov 13\u201314. But unless price closes back inside the wedge any optimism here remains premature.\nOn the indicator side, both CCI and Stochastics printed clean sell signals, increasing the likelihood of continued downside unless bulls reclaim lost ground quickly.\nMy takeaway: The daily chart signals a cautionary phase for USD bulls with 100 as the new battle line.\nH4 Chart\nFrom this perspective, we see that the index exited the orange consolidation zone to the downside and promptly fulfilled the minimum measured move, landing at the 50% Fibonacci level (exactly as predicted in yesterday\u2019s Lab Note).\nIndicators are now showing early signs of potential bullish divergence. If buy signals emerge here, bulls may reclaim control. In that case, a return to the lower border of the orange consolidation becomes likely, which would also invalidate yesterday\u2019s breakdown under the wedge and re-open the path toward the November highs or even to the major resistance zone discussed in the previous Lab Note.\nMy takeaway: bears won the first round, but the bulls have a technical setup to fight back. If current bounce gathers strength, the invalidation of the breakdown could be a game-changer. However, if bulls hesitate or fail here, we may see continuation of yesterday\u2019s decline to deeper Fibonacci levels (78.6% or lower). Therefore, in my opinion, the next 24h will likely determine who takes control.\nYesterday\u2019s USD weakness gave precious metals exactly the breathing room they needed - especially silver, which responded sharply. Let\u2019s now turn to the charts and examine how this played out...\nDaily Chart\nThe most obvious development: price has rallied straight into a short-term resistance zone created by the bearish price gap that previously rejected bulls on November 19. Therefore, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see sellers\u2019 step in again - especially with multiple technical elements converging to defend their last line before the November high.\nPsychologically, this is the kind of zone where very short-term traders tend to lock in profits, increasing the chances of a pause or short-term rejection.\nH4 Chart\nFrom this perspective, we see that yesterday\u2019s pullback (after the U.S. market open) was sharp, but it landed exactly where it needed to\u2026 at the combination of the upper border of the red declining channel and the upper edge of the orange consolidation.\nThis double support zone held perfectly and became the launchpad for a continuation move into the north. The measured move projection from the orange consolidation mentioned was not only completed but extended into a cluster of major resistance levels, including:\n- The 61.8% Fib retracement\n- November 19 highs\n- November 13 lows\n- and the same bearish price gap noted on the daily chart\nIndicators: CCI and Stochastics are firmly in overbought territory and RSI is approaching 70, which suggests buying momentum may be nearing exhaustion (a potential early warning to watch for divergences or bearish signals).\nH1 Chart\nThe measured move following the earlier upside breakout from the pennant pattern (discussed in Lab Note #7) wasn\u2019t just"

                "body": "Gold Price Today, Nov 26: Rises on Weaker Dollar and Inflation Concerns\nGold prices have surged as of November 26, driven by a weaker US dollar and growing inflation concerns across global markets. Currently, gold serves as a safe haven for investors looking to shield their portfolios from currency fluctuations and inflation. The trend is particularly noticeable in Switzerland, where the demand for gold continues to rise. It\u2019s crucial for investors to understand the underlying dynamics impacting gold prices today.\nImpact of a Weaker US Dollar on Gold Prices\nThe decline of the US dollar against major currencies has been a critical factor in the recent rise in gold prices. Typically, a weaker dollar makes gold more affordable in other currencies, boosting demand globally. According to Trading Economics, when the dollar weakens, investors seek refuge in tangible assets like gold. This correlation between the dollar and gold is well established. For Switzerland, this situation imposes an opportunity for investors to hedge against currency risk.\nInflation Concerns Drive Gold Demand\nGlobal inflation has been rising due to various economic factors, including increased energy prices and supply chain disruptions. As reported by Kitco, inflation remains a primary concern for investors worldwide, prompting many to turn to gold as a hedge. The intrinsic value of gold tends to hold during inflationary periods, providing stability to investment portfolios. In Switzerland, inflation fears also impact consumer decisions, increasingly favoring gold-inclusive investments.\nIs Gold a Good Investment Now?\nFor many investors, gold offers security amid economic uncertainty. Its lack of counterparty risk and universal acceptance make it an attractive option. In today\u2019s financial environment, gold\u2019s appeal grows stronger as worries about inflation and currency devaluation persist. Swiss investors, in particular, find value in integrating gold into diverse portfolios. This strategic move helps mitigate risks and balance investments for both short-term security and long-term growth.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe rise in gold prices as of November 26 highlights the metal\u2019s role as a haven in uncertain economic times. Driven by a weakening US dollar and escalating inflation concerns, gold remains an appealing investment, particularly in Switzerland. This trend underlines the importance of considering gold as part of a broader investment strategy. Meyka\u2019s AI-powered platform can provide further insights, helping investors navigate these market changes effectively and make informed decisions about incorporating gold into their portfolios.\nFAQs\nGold is viewed as a safe haven because it maintains its value during economic downturns and inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, it doesn\u2019t rely on governmental or corporate entities, which adds to its stability.\nA weaker US dollar makes gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies, thereby increasing its demand. This inverse relationship often results in higher gold prices when the dollar declines.\nYes, gold is traditionally a strong hedge against inflation. As inflation increases, gold tends to retain or even increase in value, thereby protecting purchasing power.\nDisclaimer:\nThe content shared by Meyka AI PTY LTD is solely for research and informational purposes.

                "body": "Asia stocks rise tracking Wall St; China property jitters, stimulus in focus\nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) has reported an unexpected increase in US crude oil inventories, indicating weaker demand and potentially impacting crude prices. The weekly change in the number of barrels of commercial crude oil held by US firms is considered a significant indicator of the health of the oil industry.\nThe actual increase in crude inventories was reported at 2.774 million barrels. This figure starkly contrasts with the forecasted decrease of 1.300 million barrels. The unexpected rise in inventory levels implies a weaker demand for crude oil, which is generally bearish for crude prices.\nComparing the actual increase to the previous data, the difference is even more pronounced. The previous week saw a decrease of 3.426 million barrels, meaning this week\u2019s data represents a significant swing in the opposite direction. This dramatic shift could potentially have a substantial impact on inflation and the price of petroleum products.\nThe level of crude oil inventories can directly influence the price of petroleum products, which in turn can impact inflation. If the increase in crude inventories is more than expected, it implies weaker demand and is bearish for crude prices. Conversely, if the increase in crude is less than expected, it implies greater demand and is bullish for crude prices.\nIn this case, the unexpected increase in inventories suggests a weaker demand for crude oil. This could potentially lead to a drop in crude prices, which would have a knock-on effect on the price of petroleum products and could potentially influence inflation rates.\nIn conclusion, the unexpected rise in EIA crude oil inventories signals a weaker demand for crude oil, which could have significant implications for the oil industry, inflation rates, and the wider economy.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

This is guided by Yokogawa\u2019s corporate brand slogan, \"Co-innovating tomorrow,\" and involves a commitment to solving social and environmental issues through its core competencies in measurement, control, and information technology.\n\u201cOn sustainability, Yokogawa focuses on three goals \u2013 well being, net zeroing and circular economy,\u201d he continues, \u201cand when it comes to in-country value, we are committed to contributing to the societies where we operate.\u201d\nProgressing autonomous operations\nDiscussing Yokogawa\u2019s recent successes on the innovation and AI front, he shares that in the UAE Yokogawa has conducted three proof of concepts (POCs) for its new FKDPP technology, an autonomous control AI protocol that makes use of reinforcement learning technology. It can control and autonomise areas of plant operations that have up to now necessitated manual operation. Nadeem notes that these have led to potential savings and value additions in net zeroing, energy management as well as quality and safety, given the elimination of the requirement for human intervention and therefore of human error and subjectivity. One of these POCs is for an AI-powered autonomous control room for Borouge\u2019s Ruwais facility, where Yokogawa is using AI-based technologies to analyse data, identify patterns, and predict anomalies, enabling faster corrective actions and reducing unplanned shutdown risks. The POC is also exploring how autonomous control room operations can enhance efficiency and plant performance.\n\u201cWe have had similar successes recently in Saudi Arabia as well,\u201d Nadeem adds, referring to the implementation at the Fadhili gas plant, where Yokogawa has successfully deployed multiple autonomous control AI agents working together to autonomously control and optimise acid gas removal (AGR) operations at the plant. Initial results demonstrate a 10% to 15% reduction in its amine and steam usage, around 5% reduction in power usage, improved process stability, and a significant decrease in operator manual intervention, despite ambient condition changes. \u201cThe client is very happy with the ROI,\u201d he comments.\nThis combination of multiple AI involves not only agents but also some of the drivers, such as robotics. \u201cIf you can send machines into an oilfield which has a lot of sulphur content, you can save lives,\u201d he stresses.\nHe adds that Yokogawa is no longer a control company but an autonomous company, as reflected in its mission statement, and is system agnostic.\nEvolution of AI\nOn the progress of AI, Nadeem comments that we have passed the \u201ccrawling\u201d stage and are on the \u201cwalk to run\u201d phase. Referring to the opening remarks at ADIPEC of Dr Sultan Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and CEO of ADNOC, he said, \u201cPeople understand that without AI, as Dr Al Jaber said today, you will be nowhere. You cannot ignore it. We have moved beyond the proof of concept stage to proof of value. In fact, we are actually on the borderline between proof of value and full-flight deployment. Yokogawa has moved beyond proof of value \u2013 we are now talking about the reoccurring model, where we have already given the concept the value and it is now running. I go back to what Dr Al Jaber said this morning; we are not here to give the vision or the dream, we are here for deliver"

                "body": "Geopolitical tensions have pushed WTI crude toward $58 per barrel, its lowest level in five weeks, as signs of a possible diplomatic breakthrough raise expectations of increased global supply. A potential easing of restrictions on a major oil-producing nation has amplified concerns about oversupply at a time when production already exceeds consumption.\nAdding to the mixed signals, US crude inventories declined by 1.9 million barrels last week, the first draw after three straight builds, offering only limited support. The combination of shifting geopolitical dynamics and evolving supply conditions continues to shape the near-term outlook for oil and natural gas markets.\nNatural gas is trading near $4.48 after slipping below its ascending channel, signaling a shift in momentum. Price is struggling to reclaim the 20-EMA, while the 200-EMA now acts as resistance around $4.56.\nRSI remains weak, hovering below mid-range with no signs of bullish divergence, which suggests buyers are still hesitant.

Price continues to move inside a descending channel, with each rebound capped by the upper band. The 20-EMA remains below the 200-EMA, keeping downside pressure intact.\nA break above $59.05 would be the first sign of strength, opening room toward $59.96.

This can make the industry more resilient to international price swings\u2014but never fully resilient and never for very long. The pain from the prolonged price depression is beginning to bite in.\nBack in October, Kpler warned that U.S. oil production could shed 700,000 barrels daily if international oil prices slid lower than $60 per barrel. The analytics firm cited drilled but uncompleted well data showing the inventory of these wells had shrunk by between 25% and 30% in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford basins since the start of 2025.\nNow, Reuters is reporting that the Permian is also feeling the pinch, with towns dependent on the oil industry starting to suffer the economic consequences of a downturn. The publication interviewed industry executives and local business owners to find that the key industry of the region is retrenching, spending less, and idling rigs.\nEveryone has, of course, heard about the layoffs in Big Oil majors. The majors themselves have framed it as part of a long-term strategy to become leaner. Reuters suggests that they are having trouble maintaining the workforce, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing that overall employment in the U.S. oil industry declined by 4,000 between January and July this year. Over the same period, however, production of crude oil has continued to grow, creating a perhaps confusing picture.\nThe confusion goes away once focus shifts to those drilling efficiency gains that Bloomberg\u2019s Javier Blas detailed earlier this month, noting supermajors\u2019 race to lower drilling costs in the shale patch by researching cheaper proppants, for instance, and surfactants that help the oil flow more easily from the rock. The focus, he wrote, citing the industry, was to maximize recovery rates from existing wells.\n\u201cThe best place to find oil is where you already know you've got oil,\u201d Chevron\u2019s chief executive, Mike Wirth, told Blas in an interview. \u201cWe know where the oil is. If we left 90% of the oil behind, it would be the first time in history that we didn't figure out how to do it.\u201d\nSo, that\u2019s one reason drilling rigs are down\u2014while production keeps climbing higher\u2014but it is not the only reason, based on what Reuters reports from the Permian. \u201cWe've had dialogue with the administration, letting them know that oil prices in the low to mid $50s make returns increasingly difficult for investment. This will eventually make current production levels unsustainable,\u201d the chief executive of Admiral Permian Resources told Reuters.\nMeanwhile, as international prices decline, the cost of drilling a well has gone up by between 5% and 10% from last year, according to the boss of Latigo Petroleum. \u201cThe economics are completely upside down from where they were just in January. It's more expensive to drill a well and you're getting 20% less for your oil,\u201d Kirk Edwards told Reuters.\nIronically, the pervasive perception of unrelenting production growth in the U.S. shale patch has become the chief reason for bearish oil price predictions, expecting supply to exceed demand for oil for a prolonged period of time. Analysts regularly cite record-breaking output numbers as evidence that oil supply keeps growing despite price movements, suggesting that U.S. shale is more resilient than what the industry itself says it is.\n\u201cInvestment returns at $55 to $60 per barrel are not what they were at the same price five years ago because the best wells have been drilled,\u201d Admiral Permian Resources\u2019 CEO told Reuters, which also noted a slowdown in oilfield service activity as evidence of a broader downturn in the shale industry\u2014even if the number of barrels per day produced by that industry are still climbing.\nIn fairness, that trend emerged earlier in the year as reported by the biggest oilfield service providers\u2014every one of them reported slower business in North America and stronger business abroad.

                "body": "Asia stocks rise tracking Wall St; China property jitters, stimulus in focus\nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) has reported an unexpected increase in US crude oil inventories, indicating weaker demand and potentially impacting crude prices. The weekly change in the number of barrels of commercial crude oil held by US firms is considered a significant indicator of the health of the oil industry.\nThe actual increase in crude inventories was reported at 2.774 million barrels. This figure starkly contrasts with the forecasted decrease of 1.300 million barrels. The unexpected rise in inventory levels implies a weaker demand for crude oil, which is generally bearish for crude prices.\nComparing the actual increase to the previous data, the difference is even more pronounced. The previous week saw a decrease of 3.426 million barrels, meaning this week\u2019s data represents a significant swing in the opposite direction. This dramatic shift could potentially have a substantial impact on inflation and the price of petroleum products.\nThe level of crude oil inventories can directly influence the price of petroleum products, which in turn can impact inflation. If the increase in crude inventories is more than expected, it implies weaker demand and is bearish for crude prices. Conversely, if the increase in crude is less than expected, it implies greater demand and is bullish for crude prices.\nIn this case, the unexpected increase in inventories suggests a weaker demand for crude oil. This could potentially lead to a drop in crude prices, which would have a knock-on effect on the price of petroleum products and could potentially influence inflation rates.\nIn conclusion, the unexpected rise in EIA crude oil inventories signals a weaker demand for crude oil, which could have significant implications for the oil industry, inflation rates, and the wider economy.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

                "body": "By David Wethe and Kevin Crowley\nA pumpjack and drill rig over an oil well in the Permian Basin near Midland, Texas. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg\nUS shale companies are forging ahead with their production plans, adapting to $60 oil prices while grinding out small increases and setting up the industry to add to next year\u2019s record supply glut.\nDiamondback Energy Inc., Coterra Energy Inc. and Ovintiv Inc. this week announced plans to raise output slightly for this year or 2026 despite oil prices falling close to the threshold needed for many US shale wells to break even. Last week, Exxon Mobil Corp. cemented its position as the biggest Permian Basin operator by lifting its 2025 production guidance by 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, more than some small companies\u2019 total output.\nIt\u2019s all thanks to advancements in recent years that have made producers more efficient, allowing them to pump more crude for every dollar spent.\n\u201cShale has to a large extent become a technology story, not in the Silicon Valley sense but in a drilling technology sense,\u201d said Ben Hoff, global head of commodity strategy at Societe Generale SA. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed the industry to keep barrel outputs relatively constant while tackling the other side of the ledger, which is costs.\u201d\nThe resiliency of US oil production stands in stark contrast to earlier this year, when crude prices tumbled 15% in less than a week after President Donald Trump announced a raft of tariffs in April. With OPEC increasing supplies, American oil executives at the time raised the possibility of shrinking US production if prices fell toward $50 a barrel, below the break-even point for most of the industry.\nBut those prices were short-lived. And shale\u2019s years-long efficiency push was helping to lower costs, driving US oil output near 13.8 million barrels a day in August, a fresh record, according to the Energy Information Administration. Some of the increases were caused by higher output from the US Gulf, where several projects many years in the making recently came online.\nSource: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nNote: Survey of executives in March 2025; oil price is West Texas Intermediate\nBut it\u2019s also clear that small technical gains in shale are adding up.\n\u201cNever underestimate the American engineer,\u201d Diamondback Chief Executive Officer Kaes Van\u2019t Hof said in a letter to shareholders Monday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find a way to make more money despite macro headwinds,\u201d he said on a call with analysts.\nFaster drilling and improved pumping methods reduced Diamondback\u2019s break-even oil price to about $37 a barrel, 8% lower than two years ago. Coterra raised the potential of growing 5% next year to about 168,000 barrels a day while spending \u201cmodestly\u201d less. The savings will come in part from installing microgrids in West Texas to reduce power costs, according to the company\u2019s output guidance.\nSqueezing more oil from the ground with fewer resources is taking a toll on employment. The number of drilling rigs in the Permian is down almost 30% since the start of 2024. The number of crews that blast water, sand and chemicals to complete a new well is down 20%. The reduction in workers is becoming noticeable in Midland, Texas, the Permian\u2019s unofficial capital.\n\u201cActivity has definitely been slowing down out here,\u201d Will Hickey, co-chief executive officer at Midland-based Permian Resources Corp., said on a call with analysts Thursday. \u201cYou can feel it on the streets of Midland.\u201d\nAnd still, companies are finding ways to pump more oil.\nOvintiv, a Denver-based shale producer with assets stretching from western Canada to the Permian, raised the midpoint of its guidance for this year by less than 1% to 209,000 barrels per day and kept its previously reduced spending plans intact.\nBut the biggest gains are coming from Exxon, which hiked its 2025 output guidance by 7% to 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. The increase alone is as much as the entire company-wide output of a small independent p"

The momentum is sponsored by the prevalent selling bias surrounding the US Dollar (USD), and lifts spot prices closer to a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) pivotal resistance.\nThe USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, slides to an over one-week trough amid dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. In fact, traders are now pricing in around an 85% chance that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs again in December, and the bets were lifted by recent comments from several Fed officials. Moreover, a mixed set of economic indicators released this week does little to temper expectations. This, along with the upbeat market mood, is seen undermining the safe-haven buck and, in turn, acting as a tailwind for the EUR/USD pair.\nThe shared currency, on the other hand, draws some support from the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) cautious monetary policy outlook. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos sounded slightly more positive on growth and said on Wednesday that the current level of rates is the correct one. Adding to this, Croatian central bank chief Boris Vujcic noted that the ECB should only cut rates again if price growth is heading below target without rebounding. Furthermore, ECB's Chief Economist Philip Lane said that a slowdown in non-energy inflation is needed to keep overall price growth near the 2% target.\nMeanwhile, a majority of economists expect that the ECB will hold its deposit rate this year and see no change by the end of next year. This, in turn, favors the Euro (EUR) bulls and suggests that the path of least resistance for the EUR/USD pair is to the upside. However, it will still be prudent to wait for a sustained strength beyond the 200-day SMA barrier, currently pegged near the 1.1625 region, before positioning for any further appreciating move. Furthermore, relatively thin trading volumes on the back of the Thanksgiving Day holiday in the US warrant some caution for bullish traders.\nUS Dollar Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies this week.

The pair has now reclaimed critical levels between 1.1550\u20131.1600, breaking above its descending channel for the first time since October. This marks a structural shift in momentum as markets assign 84% probability to a Fed rate cut in December, the highest this year, according to CME FedWatch data.\nThe euro\u2019s strength is primarily supported by weakening U.S. data, with retail sales rising only 0.2% in September versus the 0.4% consensus, core PPI easing to 2.6% from 2.9%, and consumer confidence collapsing to 88.7, its weakest reading since May. These indicators collectively signaled a slowing U.S. economy and triggered broad pressure on the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which has fallen 0.6% over the past three days to trade near 103.1.\nTechnical positioning confirms a momentum shift. The pair now trades above its 20-day EMA at 1.157, while the 100-day EMA sits just below current price at 1.156, offering short-term support. The 50-day EMA at 1.160 represents the next key barrier, and the RSI at 57 indicates steady, controlled momentum rather than overextension. A decisive breakout above 1.1600 could open the door toward 1.1650 and 1.1710, levels corresponding to the 0.5 and 61.8 Fibonacci retracements from July highs.\nMacro Pressure on USD: Weak Data, Yield Drop, and Political Transition\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell below 4.02%, reinforcing market conviction that monetary policy is about to pivot. Reports suggest that Kevin Hassett, a known advocate for rate cuts, could replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair in May \u2014 a political development that\u2019s adding pressure to the greenback. The combination of deteriorating economic data and leadership uncertainty has triggered a significant sentiment shift in favor of the euro.\nMarkets are now positioning for two potential rate cuts in the first half of 2026, while the ECB maintains a stable stance. The Bundesbank\u2019s Joachim Nagel confirmed ongoing inflation pressures in services but reiterated that policy would remain data-dependent, not preemptively dovish. This divergence between the Fed\u2019s expected easing and the ECB\u2019s cautious tone provides a structural tailwind to the euro through year-end.\nECB Stability Review and Lagarde\u2019s Warning Temper Enthusiasm\nDespite the technical breakout, the European Central Bank\u2019s Financial Stability Review injected caution into the market. The ECB warned of \u201celevated risks to financial stability in Europe,\u201d particularly from high sovereign debt levels in southern economies. These remarks capped the euro\u2019s upside early Wednesday and kept price action limited below 1.1600. ECB President Christine Lagarde and board member Philip Lane are expected to comment further later this week, and traders are watching closely for any policy hints.\nNevertheless, EUR/USD continues to find buyers on dips. Improved geopolitical sentiment \u2014 particularly reports of progress in Russia-Ukraine peace discussions, with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff expected to meet Vladimir Putin next week \u2014 has bolstered risk appetite. The market reaction has favored the euro, as a stable geopolitical backdrop reduces dollar demand for safety.\nTechnical Outlook: EUR/USD Builds Support Base and Faces 1.1600 Resistance\nThe EUR/USD daily structure has turned decisively constructive. The pair\u2019s reclaim of 1.1480, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, confirmed a short-term reversal. A move above 1.1560 has place"

The pair is stable around these gains at the time of writing this analysis, amidst mixed results from the US economic releases, led by the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Retail Sales figures. Today, the currency pair will be watching a new round of US economic releases, led by weekly unemployment claims and durable goods orders, scheduled for 03:30 PM Egypt time. Later, there will be new statements from European Central Bank (ECB) Governor Lagarde.\nEUR/USD Forecast: Prices Remain Steady Near 1.15\nAccording to Forex currency market trading, the EUR/USD exchange rate tested the 1.15 level, as market volatility and fading expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December contributed to lifting the value of the US Dollar. Regarding the future of the EUR/USD price, global banks remain divided, with near-term pressures contrasting with medium-term expectations pointing to a recovery above the 1.20 psychological resistance level.\nTop Forex Brokers\nNow, Financial markets are focused on the uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policy and changing interest rate differentials to assess the next move. Following initial currency weakness, Danske Bank expects EUR/USD to rise to 1.22 over a 12-month period. For its part, Morgan Stanley sees the potential for EUR/USD to rise to 1.23 by the second quarter of 2026 before receding to 1.16 by the end of 2026. They anticipate further net losses to 1.14 by the end of the following year.\nThe movement of the technical indicators on the daily chart is still in the bearish territory: the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around a reading of 47, below the neutral line of 50, and at the same time, the MACD indicator lines are still on their downward slope. Over the same timeframe, the 1.1800 psychological resistance will remain the key to changing the overall trend to ascending.\nUS Monetary Policies and Their Impact on Currency Prices\nRegarding the factors influencing currency prices: Following the US jobs data and Federal Reserve minutes, expectations for a Fed rate cut at the December monetary policy meeting saw a further decline, which supported the US currency. In this regard, Danske Bank commented: \"We still see EUR/USD on an upward trajectory in the medium term, supported by narrowing interest rate differentials, a recovery in the European asset market, reduced global demand for restrictive policies, continued tailwinds from hedge ratio adjustments, and reduced confidence in US institutions.\"\nOverall, a high degree of uncertainty remains regarding the US Federal Reserve's policy in the medium term. Regarding the future of the bank's policies, UBS Bank commented: \"The appointment of a new Fed Chairman could also change policy expectations, potentially leading to lower US interest rates than currently expected. Additionally, the continuation of the US double deficit means the country must continue to attract external funding, which could put further pressure on the US Dollar, especially in the scenario mentioned above.\"\nTrading Advice:\nDo not be deceived, as EUR/USD gains are still limited and unstable and need more stimulus to become stronger and sustained.\nReady to trade our Forex daily analysis and predictions?

However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) noted that this room remains \u201climited\u201d relative to its projections.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the"

The market is currently pricing in an 80% chance of a BoE rate cut in December.\nThe USD is falling further on rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. Weaker-than-expected US retail sales, consumer confidence, and cooler PPI data support the view that the Fed could reduce rates by 25 basis points next month.\nAttention is on US durable goods and weekly jobless claims for further clues on the health of the US economy. With Thanksgiving tomorrow, volumes could be low.\nGBP/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nGBP/USD fell from 1.3725 on September 17 to a low of 1.30 on November 5. The price recovered from this support and is testing resistance at 1.32, the falling trendline, and the November 13 high. The 50 SMA is crossing below the 200 SMA in a death cross bearish signal.\nShould the price face rejection at 1.32, support is seen at 1.31 and 1.30. A break below here could spur a deeper selloff towards 1.27.\nShould buyers break above 1.32 this exposes the 200 SMA at 1.33. A rise above 1.3350 puts the pair on more stable ground.\nOil falls to a 5-week low on Ukraine-Russia peace hopes\nOil prices fell to $58 on Wednesday, around a five-week low, pressured by signs that the Ukraine-Russia peace agreement may be approaching, which could lead to sanctions on Russia being lifted.\nPresident Trump said the negotiations were nearly complete with just a few remaining issues, while Ukraine's top aide in Geneva said the talks had a promising start.\nShould Russia and Ukraine reach a peace agreement, sanctions on Russia, a major oil supplier, could be lifted, potentially boosting supply and intensifying concerns over a supply glut next year, where production continues to outpace consumption.\nUS crude oil inventories fell by 1.9 million barrels last week, marking the first draw after three consecutive weekly gains.\nEIA oil inventories are due later today.\nOil forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nOil continues to trade in a descending channel dating back to early July. The price faced rejection at the 50 SMA and is being guided lower by this dynamic resistance, dropping to a monthly low of 57.10. The RSI is below 50.\nSellers will look to extend the downward trend towards 56.00, the October low ahead of 55.00, the 2025 low.\nAny recovery higher would need to rise above 60.00, the round number, and 60.50, the 50 SMA. A rise above 62.75 creates a higher high and exposes the 200 SMA at 64.22 and 65.00.\nBy Fiona Cincotta\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

Technicals target 1.3230\u20131.3300 near-term breakout | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD (British Pound \u2013 U.S. Dollar) Holds Firm Above 1.3190 as Dollar Weakens, U.K. Budget and Fed Outlook Drive Next Move\nSterling Consolidates Gains Above 1.3190 Amid Dollar Slide and Policy Shifts\nGBP/USD trades at 1.3192, holding steady after three consecutive sessions of gains as both macro and technical drivers align to support the British pound\u2019s rebound. The pair surged through the 1.3150 resistance earlier this week and is now consolidating above 1.3185, marking its highest weekly close since early October. The momentum comes as U.S. inflation, retail, and labor data all softened, forcing a reassessment of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December rate cut probability, which has risen to 85%.\nThe Dollar Index (DXY) trades at 99.55, down 0.03%, its weakest level in nearly four months. This broad dollar retreat has fueled gains across major currencies, but sterling\u2019s rise is particularly pronounced due to improved U.K. economic data and anticipation surrounding Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 Autumn Budget, due later today.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to downgrade growth forecasts for 2026 by up to \u00a325\u201330 billion, but strong fiscal headroom \u2014 approximately \u00a322 billion \u2014 gives Reeves space to balance spending without triggering a gilt selloff. The market interprets this as stabilizing for sterling assets, with GBP/USD traders viewing the fiscal adjustment as net positive for medium-term credibility.\nU.S. Data Weakness Accelerates Fed Rate-Cut Bets\nDollar softness is the central theme driving GBP/USD higher. U.S. Retail Sales rose just 0.3%, while Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation eased to 2.6% YoY from 2.9%, confirming disinflation trends. The ADP employment report showed an average job loss of 13,500 in early November, the sharpest deterioration since mid-2023. With inflation moderating and employment cooling, markets now price in two potential Fed rate cuts by March 2026, weakening the greenback further.\nThe market\u2019s dovish recalibration has driven U.S. Treasury yields lower, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.05%, its lowest since August. The decline has reduced demand for the dollar\u2019s safe-haven appeal, allowing the pound to climb even in a low-growth backdrop. Traders note that unless the next U.S. Durable Goods Orders or Chicago PMI data reverses this trend, dollar weakness will persist into early December.\nU.K. Fiscal Outlook and Autumn Budget Impact\nIn London, sterling traders are closely watching Chancellor Reeves\u2019 Autumn Budget. Market leaks suggest the government will avoid immediate tax increases, focusing instead on capital investment and tightening spending on non-essential projects. The U.K. budget deficit is projected to widen modestly, but the avoidance of aggressive austerity reassures investors that growth support will continue.\nMeanwhile, U.K. labor market data remains stable. Unemployment holds at 4.2%, while services PMI rose to 51.3, signaling mild expansion. The Bank of England (BoE) faces a dilemma \u2014 inflation cooled to 3.8% YoY, but wage growth remains sticky at 6.1%, preventing an outright dovish pivot. Nonetheless, futures markets price an 80% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December, following the Fed\u2019s expected move.\nThis macro alignment between the BoE and Fed is critical: synchronized easing cycles often neutralize one another, but since the Fed is perceived to be ahead of the curve, GBP/USD benefits as relative rate expectations shift in favor of the pound.\nTechnical Structure: Bulls Maintain Control Above 1.3150\nFrom a technical standpoint, GBP/USD is in short-term recovery mode with clear bullish structure above 1.3150.

The AUD/USD pair gains ground as the US Dollar (USD) struggles amid rising odds of Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut bets in December.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released Private Capital Expenditure on Thursday, which rose by 6.4% quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter, accelerating from a 0.2% gain in Q2 and surpassing the 0.5% expected. On Wednesday, ABS reported the first \u201ccomplete\u201d monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI), which climbed by 3.8% year-over-year (YoY) in October. The reading surpassed the market consensus of a 3.6% rise and a 3.5% increase prior.\nThe AUD gained ground after the first monthly CPI boosted the cautious sentiment surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy outlook. The RBA is expected to maintain the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 3.6% in December as inflation remains above RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target range. RBA officials noted that the unemployment rate has risen slightly, but the job market remains healthy and is expected to continue doing so.\nThe ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures showed, as of November 26, the December 2025 contract trading at 96.41, implying a 6% chance that the RBA will cut the cash rate to 3.35% from 3.60% at its upcoming Board meeting.\nUS Dollar declines amid increasing Fed rate cut bets\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is losing ground and trading around 99.50 at the time of writing. The Greenback extended its losses amid reinforcing expectations of a more accommodative policy stance, driven by reports that the White House has narrowed its search for the next Fed chair to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. Investors see Hassett as supportive of US President Donald Trump\u2019s preference for lower interest rates.\nThe CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in a more than 84% chance that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, up from the 30% probability that markets priced a week ago.\nThe US Department of Labor (DOL) reported on Wednesday that Initial Jobless Claims fell to 216,000 for the week ending November 22, down 6,000 from the previous week\u2019s revised figure. The result was stronger than the market expectation of 225,000. Meanwhile, the 4-week moving average eased by 1,000 to 223,750.\nThe US Producer Price Index (PPI) remained steady at 2.7% year-over-year in September, matching expectations and August\u2019s reading and suggesting that inflationary pressures have stabilized. Core PPI eased to 2.6% from 2.9%, undershooting the forecast of 2.7%.\nThe US Retail Sales rose by 0.2% month-over-month (MoM) in September, slowing from the 0.6% increase seen in August, indicating more cautious consumer spending. Separately, the Conference Board reported a sharp deterioration in household sentiment, with Consumer Confidence sliding 6.8 points to 88.7 in November from 95.5 in October.\nFed Governor Christopher Waller told Fox Business on Monday th"

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerated to 3.8% YoY in October, above market expectations of 3.6% and the previous 3.5%. The stronger reading highlights the persistence of price pressures, a factor likely to keep the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cautious ahead of its December policy decision.\nRBA officials have recently emphasized that, although labor market conditions have softened slightly, overall employment remains healthy, reducing the urgency for monetary easing.\nMinutes from the November meeting confirmed the central bank\u2019s preference to keep the cash rate at 3.6% for an extended period as long as inflation remains above the 2%-3% target. This stance is in line with comments from Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter, who warned that monthly inflation data can be volatile and that a single reading will not trigger a policy reaction.\nIn the United States (US), the US Dollar (USD) continues to struggle, weighed down by signs of economic deceleration. The US Dollar Index (DXY) holds near 99.80 at the time of writing, after modest declines, pressured by growing expectations of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in December.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, the chance of a 25-basis-point reduction now exceeds 84%, up from 50% just one week ago. September Producer Price Index (PPI) data showed easing core inflation, while consumer spending has begun to cool, with Retail Sales rising only 0.2% MoM. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment deteriorated sharply, with the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index dropping to 88.7 in November.\nSeveral Fed officials, including Governor Christopher Waller and Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams, signaled that conditions may justify rate cuts in the near term, citing a weakening labor market and softer underlying inflation. Fed Governor Stephen Miran also expressed support for a December cut, adding that he would vote for a 25-bp reduction if decisive.\nAgainst this backdrop of persistent inflation in Australia and increasing signs of slowdown in the United States, the Australian Dollar maintains a short-term bullish bias against the US Dollar. Shifts in monetary-policy expectations are likely to remain the main driver of AUD/USD in the coming days as markets look ahead to fresh US macroeconomic data.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Asia stocks rise tracking Wall St; China property jitters, stimulus in focus\n- CPI beats across headline and trimmed mean, both above target\n- Housing and services inflation remain stubbornly high\n- Market pricing slashes cut expectations, hints at hike risk\n- AUD/USD rebound modest but technicals signal upside potential\nSummary\nAustralia\u2019s latest inflation shock has upended the RBA outlook, killing near-term cut hopes and even raising the prospect of a hike. With underlying pressures entrenched and market pricing turning hawkish, AUD/USD may be entering a new phase. Technical signals point to fading bearish momentum, adding to upside risks if global conditions stay supportive.\nUncomfortably Hot\nAustralia\u2019s first full monthly CPI release delivered an uncomfortable reality check for those banking on further RBA rate cuts. Headline inflation accelerated to an annual pace of 3.8%, above the 3.6% expected, while trimmed mean\u2014the measure the RBA places the greatest weight on\u2014jumped to 3.3%, well above the 3.0% forecast. Both readings sit not only above the top of the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target band but are moving further away from it, suggesting the recent downtrend in inflation has likely bottomed.\nSource: ABS\nThat\u2019s significant because the RBA\u2019s inflation mandate is anchored around the 2.5% midpoint, and its policy framework assumes underlying inflation leads headline, not the other way around. Today\u2019s data reinforces that assumption in the worst possible way: underlying pressures are firming, not easing, making it harder to argue for near-term policy relief.\nThe composition adds to the discomfort. Housing inflation, the largest weighting in the CPI basket and highly sensitive to economic conditions, strengthened further. Rents rose 4.2% over the year, up from 3.8% in September, with the increase partly reflecting a smaller offset from Commonwealth Rent Assistance compared to a year ago.\nExcluding those adjustments, rents would have risen 4.5%, underscoring persistent tightness in rental markets. New dwelling prices also firmed, rising 1.7%. Combined with surging electricity costs, these trends point to housing pressures that are not going away quickly.\nSource: ABS\nBeyond housing, the broader picture is equally troubling. Services prices are running at 3.9%, while non-tradables inflation is even hotter at 4.8%. Both are heavily influenced by domestic factors rather than international ones, and they sit alongside other major categories growing at annual rates above the RBA target range. This mix suggests that price stickiness is not confined to a few sectors but embedded across the economy, making it harder to keep inflation low and stable even with subdued growth.\nOne caveat regarding the data was this was the first time we\u2019ve seen a monthly release in Australia, which introduces some uncertainty around the signal. Even so, it aligns with the strength seen in the Q3 inflation report, meaning the trend is real. While the RBA will continue to lean on quarterly data for now, this print is hard to ignore. For those hoping for rate cuts, this is a setback\u2014the inflation fight looks far from over.\nRBA Easing Cycle Seen Over\nSource: Bloomberg\nIf the inflation data wasn\u2019t enough to unsettle rate-cut expectations, market pricing certainly drives the point home. Swaps now imply a maximum of 11 basis points of easing by May 2026, with a small risk that the next move in the cash rate could actually be higher six months later. That\u2019s a dramatic hawkish repricing compared to just a few months ago when the cash rate was seen bottoming below 3%. Now, no further easing is favored over another cut.\nThe residual pricing for cuts looks more like insurance than conviction\u2014hedging against an unexpected negative shock, such as unemployment rising far beyond the RBA\u2019s forecasts or a major global downturn. With inflation running hot and underlying pressures entrenched, the only realistic path to near-term cuts would be a sharp deterioration in the labor market or "

                "body": "USD/JPY slides to 156.00; remains close to one-week low amid contrasting BoJ-Fed outlooks\n- USD/JPY attracts fresh sellers on Thursday and is pressured by a combination of factors.\n- Intervention fears and reviving BoJ rate hike bets underpin the JPY, weighing on the pair.\n- Dovish Fed expectations keep the USD depressed and also exert pressure on spot prices.\nThe USD/JPY pair struggles to capitalize on the previous day's bounce from the 155.65 area, or a one-week low, and meets with a fresh supply during the Asian session on Thursday. Spot prices drop to the 156.00 mark in the last hour and seem poised to prolong a one-week-old retracement slide from the highest level since mid-January, touched last week.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) draws some support from speculations that authorities would step in to stem further weakness in the domestic currency and a relatively hawkish Bank of Japan (BoJ) outlook. In fact, Reuters reported on Wednesday that the BoJ is preparing markets for a possible interest rate hike as soon as next month. This, along with a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD), is seen exerting some downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair.\nInvestors now seem convinced that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs again at its December meeting. The expectations were reaffirmed by the US Producer Price Index (PPI) on Tuesday, which pointed to signs of cooling inflation. This, to a larger extent, offsets a mixed set of economic indicators released this week and keeps the USD depressed near a one-week low and further contributes to the offered tone surrounding the USD/JPY pair.\nHowever, the prevalent risk-on environment and concerns about Japan's worsening fiscal position, amid Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s pro-stimulus stance, could act as a headwind for the safe-haven JPY. Traders might also refrain from placing fresh directional bets around the USD/JPY pair amid relatively thin trading volumes on the back of the Thanksgiving Day holiday in the US. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop seems tilted in favor of bearish traders.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

This depreciation persists even as reports suggest that the BoJ is preparing markets for an interest rate hike as early as December, signaling an imminent shift from ultra-loose policy.

Initial jobless claims came in at 216K, better than the 225K forecast, but the prior figure was revised up to 222K, reflecting softening momentum. Retail sales have weakened, producer prices moderated, and consumer confidence continues to erode, reinforcing expectations that the Fed may pivot sooner than markets initially anticipated. Conversely, the BoJ is under pressure to restore currency stability and contain imported inflation, as energy and raw material costs remain elevated in Yen terms.\nJapanese Wage Dynamics And Leading Indicators Suggest A Turning Point\nWage negotiations across Japan\u2019s largest corporations have strengthened expectations of a December rate hike, supported by early reports indicating significant base pay increases for 2026. The Leading Economic Index (LEI) is projected to rise from 107.0 in August to 108.0 in September, suggesting improving sentiment among manufacturers and consumers. A recovery in the LEI from April\u2019s 104.2 two-year low underscores improving trade conditions, especially following the U.S. tariff reduction to 15% on Japanese goods in September. The soft Yen has so far offset the profit impact of tariffs, but its extended weakness is drawing political pressure. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi reiterated that Japan\u2019s government \u201cwill take appropriate measures\u201d if currency volatility exceeds economic fundamentals, renewing fears of direct intervention around the 155\u2013156 zone.\nTokyo CPI And Fiscal Pressures Define Next BoJ Decision Window\nThe next pivotal data release is Thursday\u2019s Tokyo CPI, expected to show moderating inflation but still above the 2% BoJ target, while Japan\u2019s unemployment rate and retail spending figures will shape the outlook for Q4 consumption. Persistent core inflation alongside rising wage costs could give the BoJ justification to signal policy normalization. Domestic fiscal risks remain elevated: Japan\u2019s public debt exceeds 260% of GDP, and interest rate normalization could sharply raise servicing costs, forcing policymakers to move cautiously. Still, a measured 10\u201315 basis-point hike would demonstrate intent without triggering financial instability. Markets now assign roughly a 45% probability of a December adjustment, compared with just 20% earlier in November.\nUSD/JPY Technical Outlook Shows Tight Compression Near Key Resistance\nTechnically, USD/JPY remains in a consolidation band, supported at 155.65\u2013155.70 and capped near 157.20\u2013157.90, where sellers repeatedly defend overhead resistance.

                "body": "- BOJ considers rate hike amid yen weakness.\n- USD/JPY nears critical \u00a5156 level.\n- Policy shift could impact global FX markets.\nYen Under Pressure as BOJ Signals Shift\nThe Japanese yen continues to weaken, with the USD/JPY pair nearing the critical \u00a5156 level. This decline has drawn the attention of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which is now reportedly preparing to raise interest rates. The move, if confirmed, would mark a major shift for the central bank, which has maintained ultra-low rates for decades.\nThe BOJ has long been known for its dovish stance, focused on stimulating growth through low borrowing costs. However, the sharp depreciation of the yen\u2014down significantly against the US dollar\u2014has raised concerns about inflation and the cost of imports. As a result, policymakers are now openly discussing the potential need to raise interest rates to stabilize the currency.\nRate Hike Could Mark End of Easy Money Era\nIf the BOJ proceeds with a rate hike, it would be one of the most significant changes to Japan\u2019s monetary policy in years. The central bank has held short-term rates near zero or even negative since 2016. A rate increase would suggest that Japan\u2019s economy is strong enough to handle tighter financial conditions and could be the start of a more hawkish trend.\nA stronger yen could ease inflationary pressures from imported goods, which have surged in cost due to the weak currency. At the same time, the move might help restore investor confidence in the yen, which has lagged behind other major currencies amid global interest rate hikes led by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nWhat This Means for Global Markets\nTraders and investors around the world are watching closely. A rate hike by the BOJ could impact global forex markets, especially in Asia. It could also influence capital flows, as higher Japanese yields may attract foreign investment.\nHowever, the BOJ is expected to move cautiously. Officials are likely to study market reactions carefully before making any bold decisions. But with USD/JPY pushing toward the \u00a5156 threshold, the pressure is clearly building.\nRead Also:\n- White House Projects Record Tax Refunds in 2026\n- Spain\u2019s Sumar Party Proposes 47% Crypto Tax Hikekj.\n- Level Up with #7Up: Bybit\u2019s 7th Anniversary Shares a $2.5 Million Thank-You with Nearly 80 Million Traders Worldwide\n- Bank of Japan Eyes Rate Hike as USD/JPY Nears \u00a5156\n- HTX Records $391M Net Inflows in 30 Days"

                "body": "Canadian Dollar Forecast: the USD/CAD Begins to Pull Back Amid Fed Uncertainty\nDespite the strong buying pressure that has dominated USD/CAD over recent months, in the most recent two trading sessions the Canadian dollar has begun to recover gradually. Currently, the pair shows a short-term decline of around -0.3%. This bearish bias has strengthened as expectations rise for lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve, which has weakened the U.S. dollar and allowed the Canadian dollar to gain ground. If this scenario continues, USD/CAD may experience a more pronounced weakness in its movements over the next sessions.\nNew Weakness in the U.S. Dollar?\nThe past few weeks have been especially relevant for U.S. dollar fluctuations due to the constant shifts in expectations about what the Federal Reserve may decide in its final December meeting. This change is clearly reflected in the CME Group probability table, where a month ago the probability of a 0.25% rate cut exceeded 91%, last week it fell to 30%, and this week it has risen again to 80%. These movements show a marked indecision, driven by speculation regarding how the central bank is interpreting the economic data recently published for September in the United States.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nThis uncertainty is also reflected in 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, whose yield recently rose to 4.2%, but has since returned to the neutral area near 4.00%. When bonds offer less interest, demand for U.S. fixed income declines, which shifts confidence away from the dollar. This is clearly visible in the behavior of the DXY index, which just weeks ago remained above 100 points, but has now fallen toward 99.70, showing a short-term structural weakness in the U.S. dollar.\nFuente: TradingEconomics\nAltogether, this uncertainty surrounding the Fed\u2019s direction has limited short-term demand for U.S. dollars and allowed the Canadian dollar to gain ground. If this weakness in the U.S. dollar persists, it could lead to more consistent selling pressure on USD/CAD in upcoming sessions.\nWhat Can Be Expected from the Bank of Canada?\nThe general outlook of the Bank of Canada during the second half of 2025 has clearly focused on lowering the interest rate progressively. Since August, when the rate was at 2.75%, cuts have continued until reaching the current 2.25%, reflecting that in the short term the bank\u2019s stance remains tilted toward lower rates. For its final decision of the year, scheduled for December 10, a new 0.25% cut is expected, mainly because recent data shows a slowdown in inflation. After peaking at 2.4% in September, inflation dropped to 2.2% in October, moving again toward the Bank of Canada\u2019s 2.00% target.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nGiven this, the decline in inflation reinforces the idea that the bank may continue cutting rates to counteract economic slowdown. However, a crucial point will be whether the Bank of Canada plans to maintain this easing cycle into 2026, since its current rate is lower than that of the United States. A wider rate differential in favor of the USD could restore dollar strength and generate dominant buying pressure on USD/CAD, especially if the Canadian central bank adopts a more aggressive tone in the coming months.\nUSD/CAD Technical Forecast\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend remains relevant: Despite the recent bearish corrections, USD/CAD has managed to maintain a solid upward trendline since approximately July 25, dominating much of the market movement in the second half of the year. However, as the price approaches a consistent resistance area, a more marked neutrality has emerged, which could open the door to short-term bearish corrections.\n- RSI: The RSI shows a downward slope approaching the neutral level of 50, suggesting a balance between buying and selling momentum. If this continues, a period of indecision may consolidate in the next sessions.\n- MACD: A similar scenario is seen in the MACD, whose histogram remains oscillating around the zero line, indica"

The RBNZ Shock: A \"Hawkish Cut\" (NZD +1.32%)\nThe New Zealand Dollar (Kiwi) was the undisputed top performer of the day, surging 1.32% to 0.5694.\nThe Catalyst: The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 2.25%, as widely expected.\nThe Twist: Despite the cut, the move was interpreted as \"hawkish\" because the RBNZ explicitly signaled that the easing cycle is effectively over. Governor Christian Hawkesby\u2019s committee indicated that rates are likely to remain on hold throughout 2026, defying market expectations for deeper cuts.\nMarket Reaction: This \"one-and-done\" signal forced a massive repricing of interest rate expectations, triggering a short squeeze that propelled the Kiwi significantly higher against the Greenback and the Aussie.\n2. Sterling and the Budget (GBP +0.49%)\nThe British Pound (Cable) staged a solid recovery, rising 0.49% to 1.3231, as markets reacted positively to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Autumn Budget.\nBudget Summary: The Chancellor delivered a \"growth-focused\" budget that avoided the worst-case tax scenarios feared by the City. Key points included:\nNo new bank taxes: A decision to avoid a fresh tax squeeze on the banking sector reassured investors.\nFiscal Headroom: The release (inadvertently leaked early by the OBR) revealed a larger-than-anticipated fiscal buffer, signaling fiscal responsibility alongside investment.\nLack of 2026 Tax Hikes: The absence of aggressive future tax hikes for the coming year calmed \"budget jitters.\"\nMarket Reaction: The combination of fiscal prudence and growth initiatives triggered a relief rally. Gilt yields eased, and the Pound moved higher as the \"uncertainty risk premium\" that had weighed on the currency in recent weeks evaporated.\n3. Broader Currency Moves\nUSD/JPY (+0.27% to 156.46): The Yen was an outlier, weakening slightly against the Dollar. This move largely reflects improved global risk sentiment (equity markets recovering, fueled by reports of a potential Ukraine-Russia peace framework), which reduced demand for safe-haven assets like the Yen. The lower JPY also occurred despite expectations that the BOJ may look to raise rates in reaction to the weaker JPY. Well the JPY was weaker today.\nUSD/CAD (-0.41% to 1.4038): The Canadian Dollar strengthened (pushing USD/CAD lower) despite oil prices "

Spot prices currently trade below the 207.00 mark, down 0.10% for the day, though the near-term bias seems tilted in favor of bullish traders.\nInvestors remain alert amid the possibility that Japanese authorities could step in to stem any further weakness in the domestic currency. This, along with reviving bets for an imminent interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) in December, provides a modest lift to the Japanese Yen (JPY) and turns out to be a key factor that prompts some intraday selling around the GBP/JPY cross.\nIn fact, BoJ board member Asahi Noguchi reiterated earlier today that if economic activity and prices develop in line with the outlook, the central bank will gradually adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. Moreover, Japan's Services Producer Price Index suggested that inflation was on the cusp of durably meeting the 2% target and backs the case for a further BoJ policy tightening.\nHowever, the prevalent risk-on environment, along with concerns about Japan's worsening fiscal position amid Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s pro-stimulus stance, acts as a headwind for the safe-haven JPY. The British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, gains traction on the back of the long-awaited UK budget, which offered a larger-than-expected fiscal buffer, and supports the GBP/JPY cross.\nHowever, rising bets for an interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) next month mark a big divergence in comparison to the BoJ's hawkish outlook. This might hold back traders from placing fresh bullish bets around the GBP/JPY cross. The market focus now shifts to the release of the latest consumer inflation figures from Tokyo, Japan's capital city, due during the Asian session on Friday.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Aztec Network Overview\nWhat Is Aztec Network?\nFounded in 2018 by Zac Williamson, a former software engineer at Rothschild & Co., and Tom Walton-Pocock. Aztec is an innovative ETH L2 that has the ambitious vision to build a fully private blockchain while at the same time fully supporting complex smart contracts and decentralized applications. This was a novel concept as most privacy-focused blockchains (such as Monero) were only limited to simple transfers and token swaps, never the full suite of DeFi products (such as lending, perps and more).\nTo do this, Aztec introduces several key innovations:\n1. Privacy-First Architecture Using zkSNARKs\nAt its core, Aztec uses zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) \u2014 a form of cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove they know certain information without revealing the information itself.\nHere's a simple analogy: imagine you want to prove to a bouncer that you're over 21 without showing them your ID with your name, address, and exact birthdate. A zkSNARK would let you prove \"I am over 21\" without revealing any other personal information. That's the power of zero-knowledge proofs.\nAztec uses zkSNARKs to:\n-\nHide transaction amounts: No one can see how much value is being transferred.\n-\nHide sender and receiver identities: The parties involved in transactions remain confidential.\n-\nEnable private smart contract execution: The inputs, outputs, and state of smart contracts can remain encrypted.\n2. Programmable Privacy: The Best of Both Worlds\nUnlike privacy-focused blockchains like Zcash or Monero, which primarily focus on private transfers, Aztec offers programmable privacy. This means developers can build complex decentralized applications \u2014 like lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, or voting systems \u2014 with built-in privacy.\nThink of it as the difference between having a private messaging app (which only does one thing) versus having a private smartphone operating system (where any app can be built with privacy by default).\n3. Layer 2 Scalability\nAztec functions as a Layer 2 solution (a secondary network built on top of Ethereum that processes transactions off the main chain to reduce costs and increase speed). This means Aztec inherits Ethereum's security while offering:\n-\nLower transaction costs compared to Ethereum mainnet.\n-\nHigher transaction throughput (more transactions per second).\n-\nFinal settlement on Ethereum for maximum security.\n4. Encrypted Public Blockchain\nAztec describes itself as building the first \"encrypted public blockchain\". This might sound like a contradiction \u2014 how can something be both encrypted and public? Here's what it means:\n-\nPublic: Anyone can participate, verify proofs, and run nodes.\n-\nEncrypted: The actual data (transaction amounts, smart contract states, user balances) remains encrypted despite being publicly available.\n5. Compliance-Friendly Privacy\nUnlike some privacy solutions that operate in legal gray areas, Aztec is designed with selective disclosure in mind. This means users can maintain privacy by default but provide specific information to regulators or auditors when required. This is important as privacy projects often face scrutiny from regulators as they can potentially enable cyber criminals to evade surveillance.\nFor example, a business using Aztec could keep its transactions private from competitors but still prove to tax authorities that it paid the correct amount of taxes. This makes Aztec suitable for institutional adoption where regulatory compliance is non-negotiable.\nUse Cases for Aztec Network\nAztec's technology enables several compelling use cases that weren't previously possible on public blockchains:\nPrivate Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\nCurrently, using DeFi protocols on Ethereum means exposing your entire financial activity to the public. Anyone can see:\n-\nHow much you've deposited.\n-\nYour trading strategies.\n-\nYour portfolio holdings.\n-\nYour borrowing and lending activity.\nFor ind"

Stolen funds were sent to unidentified external wallets. Upbit immediately suspended deposits and withdrawals for the Solana network to limit further losses and safeguard user funds.\nSponsoredExchange Responds With Emergency Measures\nAccording to Upbit\u2019s announcement, Upbit promptly halted all deposit and withdrawal services for Solana-based assets. The exchange began emergency inspections to assess the damage and reinforce security. Multiple urgent updates were posted on the Upbit customer center between November 26 and 27, 2025, documenting each step of their rapid response.\nThe breach affected a broad range of Solana ecosystem tokens. Beyond SOL and USDC, the incident also impacted popular DeFi and meme tokens, including BONK, Jupiter (JUP), Raydium (RAY), Render (RENDER), Orca (ORCA), and Pyth Network (PYTH). The spread suggests attackers targeted Upbit\u2019s hot wallet infrastructure, which handles active trading and withdrawals.\nUpbit immediately suspended all deposit and withdrawal services in the morning after detecting abnormal withdrawal activity, and entered an emergency inspection. The company also disclosed all wallet addresses involved in the \u201cirregular outflow\u201d.\nSecurity experts monitoring the breach confirmed that Upbit suspended Solana token services to protect user assets. The exchange took swift measures to prevent further losses while forensic teams investigated. However, the incident raised concerns about vulnerabilities within hot wallet systems that stay connected for operations.\nSponsoredParty-Spoiler Ruins Dunamu\u2013Naver Merger Celebration\nThe incident occurred on the same day that Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, announced a plan to seize global market leadership through AI- and Web3-based collaboration with Naver, South Korea\u2019s largest portal company. Naver and Dunamu, together with Naver Financial, plan to invest 10 trillion won over the next five years to foster the domestic AI and Web3 technology ecosystem.\nThe 54 billion KRW loss, roughly $36 million, places the Upbit breach among the year\u2019s largest for exchanges. Nevertheless, it remains smaller than several of the industry\u2019s historic hacks. Most losses involved Solana network assets, pointing to a targeted attack rather than a cross-chain incident.\nThe company stated, \u201cWe have identified the exact amount of digital assets that were leaked, and we will fully cover the loss with Upbit\u2019s own assets so that customers are not affected in any way.\u201d\nSix Years After the Last Upbit Hack\nThis is not the first time Upbit has been hacked. In November 2019, hackers stole 342,000 ETH from the South Korean exchange. The breach caused a loss of about 58 billion won, or roughly $50 million at the time. That amount now stands at approximately $1.04 billion.\nFive years later, in November last year, Korean police officially confirmed that the perpetrators were alleged North Korean hacking groups Lazarus and Andariel. According to the National Office of Investigation, the conclusion was based on evidence such as the use of North Korean IP addresses and North Korea-specific terminology (including phrases used for trivial tasks), as well as data obtained in cooperation with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nOf the stolen Ethereum, the hackers converted 57% into Bitcoin through three cryptocurrency exchanges they had designed themselves and immediately cashed out the proceeds. Hackers laundered the remaining 43% through 51 exchanges across 13 countries. These countries included China, the United States, Hong Kong, and Switzerland.\nIn October 2024, Korean authorities sought cooperation from Swiss judicial authorities and recovered 4.8 BTC, which they returned to Upbit.

The broader Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), however, is trading down 0.3% premarket.\nMeanwhile, trade negotiations with China are on the rocks once again.

Setting a price target of $260 a share, BofA analyst Ronald Epstein observed that President Trump is using Boeing as a tool in trade negotiations, accepting orders for Boeing planes (which helps the U.S. balance of trade) in exchange for U.S. tariffs concessions.

                "body": "In response to today\u2019s Budget, Schroders\u2019 economic and investment experts share their views.\nOn UK macro, David Rees, Head of Global Economics, said:\n\u201cOn paper, today\u2019s Budget has done enough to put the UK public finances back onto a sustainable path and may allow the Bank of England to cut rates a bit further, but we suspect it will not be long before the government is forced to come back with more fiscal consolidation.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s poll ratings meant the Chancellor backed away from plans to raise income tax, instead opting for a range of smaller, back-loaded measures to raise revenues in order to rebuild headroom of around \u00a320 billion. Those less efficient policies mean revenues are likely to fall short of the government\u2019s expectations as we head into the next general election. At the same time, pressure will remain for the Chancellor to keep spending as the government is buffeted from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\u201cMoreover, we remain concerned that contagion from global fiscal worries \u2013 Japan is stimulating again, President Trump wants to write cheques to households and France\u2019s budget worries are reaching a crescendo \u2013 could put upward pressure on gilt yields and quickly eliminate the UK\u2019s headroom.\u201d\nOn UK equities, Duncan Green, UK All-Cap Fund Manager, said:\n\u201cThe Budget has weighed on business investment and consumer confidence, and while today\u2019s announcement brings some clarity, markets remain cautious given fiscal tightening has been largely pushed out to later years and a slight downgrade to the UK growth outlook.\n\u201cImportantly though, the Chancellor avoided the inflationary missteps of previous Budgets. The new measures align with the Bank of England\u2019s goal to bring inflation sustainably back to target, with planned energy-bill reductions helping. The Chancellor also secured a larger fiscal buffer than expected, which markets welcome as a sign of discipline.\n\u201cThe sectoral impacts are mixed. Housebuilders received little direct support, and gambling firms face higher duties, while banks were spared new taxes. With attractive valuations and continued underperformance versus the FTSE 100 and global peers, UK mid- and small-caps could be well positioned as stability returns.\u201d\nOn UK Fixed Income, Marcus Jennings, Fixed Income Strategist, Global Unconstrained Fixed Income, said:\n\u201cAlthough the Chancellor delivered a Budget that was close to market expectations, providing a short-term relief rally, it has likely fallen short of allaying more long-term fiscal concerns for some investors.\n\u201cUltimately the back loaded nature of the fiscal tightening announced today, combined with the lack of any bold moves to control the debt trajectory in the short run, will leave some investors not fully convinced of the UK\u2019s long term debt trajectory. This is demonstrated by the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasting higher fiscal deficits in the next few years compared to projections from both earlier in the year, and prior to today\u2019s Budget.\n\u201cFor now, we prefer long UK duration positions towards the front end of the curve. This is based on our view that the Bank of England is likely to ease policy more aggressively, due to subdued growth, a sluggish labour market and continued disinflation, the latter of which was helped at the margin by today\u2019s Budget.\u201d"

We\u2019ve been on quite a journey since then.\nOn 12 November, the Footsie closed at all-time highs of 9,911.42 points. Fears of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble and a possible stock market crash then pushed it sharply lower.\nHowever, the FTSE 100\u2019s picked up momentum again. And today it\u2019s just 4% away from reaching five-figure territory.\nCould it really reach the magic 10,000 point marker before the end of 2025?\nPound pressure\nOne potential driver could be another fall in the value of the pound.\nThis could be sparked by a negative reaction to the Autumn Budget later on Wednesday (26 November). Other possible catalysts include fresh rounds of poor UK economic data, and if markets begin pricing in faster or deeper Bank of England interest rate cuts.\nA reversing pound often has a powerful effect on where the FTSE heads next. This is because it\u2019s packed with multinationals that earn most of their revenues overseas.\nWhen these are translated back to sterling, the weaker pound provides a bottom-line boost that can lift the index.\nBargain hunt\nThere\u2019s also a strong chance the FTSE 100 will hit 10k if Christmas bargain-hunting ignites.\nDespite its 16% gain in 2025, the index still offers terrific value. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 18.8 times. Compare that with readings of 29.6 times for the S&P 500, for instance, or 23.3 for the Nikkei.\nHSBC (LSE:HSBA) is just one blue-chip bargain that festive shoppers can consider. The bank\u2019s forward P/E ratio is 9.9 times, while its price-to-earnings growth (PEG) multiple is just 0.9.\nAny sub-1 reading shows a share that\u2019s undervalued.\nOn top of this, HSBC\u2019s prospective dividend yields a market-beating 5.1%.\nThis low valuation could set the stage for fresh share price gains before Christmas and into the New Year. The HSBC share price has risen 34% so far this year, though the impact of trade tariffs on its Asian markets remains severe.\nThe bank has so far remained resilient to such pressures \u2014 underlying pre-tax profit rose 3% in the last quarter. I think earnings could accelerate as personal wealth levels boom across its emerging markets.\nTime to invest?\nGuessing the near-term direction of stock markets is risky business, as we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks. And threats remain that could limit the FTSE 100\u2019s momentum for the rest of the year.\nYet history shows the long-term direction of stock markets is ultimately upwards. It\u2019s a matter of time before the UK\u2019s flagship index hits 10,000 points, in my view.\nSo for long term investors, I think now is a good time to consider buying FTSE-listed shares. I\u2019m building a shopping list of my own before the festive period gets into full swing."

                "body": "Ahead of today\u2019s (26 November) Autumn Budget, I was reminded of a Ronald Reagan quote. In 1986, the former US President said the nine scariest words in the English language were: \u201cI\u2019m from the government, and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\nAnd in my opinion, all the leaks and speculation in the run up to the Chancellor\u2019s speech were far from helpful. Indeed, Andy Haldane, the former chief economist at the Bank of England recently said that the government\u2019s approach to the Budget has been \u201csucking all life\u201d out of the economy. Not good.\nBut now that Rachel Reeves has sat down in the House of Commons, we finally have some clarity. And although there will inevitably be some losers from any Budget, I think the UK\u2019s housebuilders could be among the net beneficiaries.\nThat\u2019s because early indications are that the gilt market approves of the Chancellor\u2019s package of measures. When the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s report was accidentally published too early, the yield on 10-year government debt increased. But since then, it\u2019s started to fall, which suggests bond investors are more relaxed about the Budget than initially feared.\nOne to consider\nChanges in gilt rates generally feed through to the cost of mortgages. And this should help Persimmon (LSE:PSN). If borrowing costs fall it\u2019s likely to help the housing market, which is starting to show signs of picking up after its post-pandemic slowdown.\nThe most recent report from the Bank of England revealed that net borrowing of mortgage debt by individuals rose by \u00a31.2bn to \u00a35.5bn in September. This was the highest since March 2025. The central bank also noted that the interest rate on newly drawn mortgages was the lowest since January 2023. This is likely to fall further if the current gilt market trend continues.\nIn its November trading statement, Persimmon said it was on target to meet the 2025 market consensus of 11,293 completions and an underlying profit before tax of \u00a3429m.\nEarly during the Chancellor\u2019s speech, investors marked down the share prices of the UK\u2019s housebuilders. I suspect they were disappointed that she didn\u2019t announce any changes to stamp duty or introduce measures to help first-time buyers.\nAlternatively, they may think the housing market recovery could stall. Also, they might be concerned that inflation is continuing to erode margins in the sector. I acknowledge these are both risks.\nHowever, I remain optimistic about Persimmon\u2019s prospects. Its properties have a lower average selling price than its peers. Also, its balance sheet is debt-free. In addition, it\u2019s got plenty of plots on which to build. And with a yield of 4.6%, it\u2019s good for income too.\nThat\u2019s why, on balance, I think Persimmon could be worth considering.\nOn reflection\nFinally, I think it\u2019s worth noting that, from April 2027, the annual Cash ISA limit will be cut from \u00a320,000 to \u00a312,000 (for under-65s only). The government wants to encourage people to put more of any spare cash they have into a Stocks and Shares version.\nPersonally, I think that\u2019s a good idea. Inflation is permanently eroding the value of cash and history tells us that by investing in quality stocks over the long term, the returns are likely to be greater. And in my opinion, there are plenty of these to choose from."

                "body": "Berlin \u2013 November 26, 2025\nGermany\u2019s latest GDP figures confirm what many households and businesses have felt for years: Europe\u2019s largest economy is still barely moving. The second estimate for third\u2011quarter 2025 shows zero quarter\u2011on\u2011quarter growth, cementing the country\u2019s longest stretch of stagnation in the post\u2011war era \u2013 even as the IMF, Bundesbank and markets start to talk about a tentative recovery in 2026 and beyond. [1]\nAt the same time, the IMF today praised Berlin\u2019s huge spending plans but warned that money alone won\u2019t fix Germany unless it is paired with deep structural reforms. [2]\nKey points at a glance\n- Q3 2025 GDP: 0.0% quarter\u2011on\u2011quarter, 0.3% year\u2011on\u2011year \u2013 confirming an earlier preliminary reading. [3]\n- Demand breakdown: Private consumption fell, exports shrank, while government spending and investment provided the only support. [4]\n- \u201cLongest stagnation since WWII\u201d: Since late 2022, Germany has recorded only two quarters of positive growth, averaging a small contraction each quarter. [5]\n- IMF today: Sees GDP growth of about 0.2% in 2025, rising to around 1.0% in 2026 and 1.5% in 2027, but says recovery will stall without tax, labour\u2011market and productivity\u2011boosting reforms. [6]\n- Official forecasts: The European Commission expects growth of 0.2% in 2025 and 1.2% in both 2026 and 2027, driven increasingly by public spending and rising real wages. [7]\n- Markets: The DAX index climbed nearly 1% after the GDP release, as investors bet on future policy support despite weak data. [8]\nQ3 2025: Second estimate confirms another quarter of zero growth\nGermany\u2019s statistics office has confirmed that GDP was flat (0.0% q/q) in the third quarter of 2025, following a 0.2% contraction in Q2. In annual terms the economy grew a modest 0.3% \u2013 barely above stall speed. [9]\nDetailed expenditure data show a familiar pattern:\n- Private consumption: down 0.3% q/q, the first decline since late 2023, as households cut back particularly on services such as restaurants and accommodation.\n- Government consumption: up 0.8%, reflecting higher spending on defence, social programmes and infrastructure.\n- Gross fixed capital formation: up 0.3%, with equipment investment (machinery, tools, vehicles) rising 1.1%, partly offset by a 0.5% fall in construction investment.\n- Exports: down 0.7%, while imports were flat, meaning foreign trade subtracted from growth. [10]\nPut simply, the state and corporate investment are propping up an economy dragged down by cautious consumers and struggling exporters.\nING economist Carsten Brzeski describes this as part of Germany\u2019s \u201clongest economic stagnation\u201d since World War II, noting that since the fourth quarter of 2022 the economy has, on average, contracted slightly every quarter and grown in only two. [11]\nExports and household spending: the twin drags\nTrade under pressure from tariffs and competition\nExports \u2013 historically the pride of the German model \u2013 are now a clear weak spot. The third\u2011quarter fall in exports comes on the heels of a turbulent year:\n- Germany enjoyed a brief export surge in Q1 2025 as firms rushed shipments to the US ahead of announced tariff hikes.

                "body": "When companies post strong earnings, the stock generally performs well, just like Global-E Online Ltd.'s (NASDAQ:GLBE) stock has recently. Our analysis found some more factors that we think are good for shareholders.\nZooming In On Global-E Online's Earnings\nIn high finance, the key ratio used to measure how well a company converts reported profits into free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio (from cashflow). The accrual ratio subtracts the FCF from the profit for a given period, and divides the result by the average operating assets of the company over that time. This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.\nFor the year to September 2025, Global-E Online had an accrual ratio of -0.42. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. In fact, it had free cash flow of US$193m in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of US$7.33m. Global-E Online's free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On Global-E Online's Profit Performance\nAs we discussed above, Global-E Online's accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is a positive for the company. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that Global-E Online's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And one can definitely find a positive in the fact that it made a profit this year, despite losing money last year. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. While it's really important to consider how well a company's statutory earnings represent its true earnings power, it's also worth taking a look at what analysts are forecasting for the future. At Simply Wall St, we have analyst estimates which you can view by clicking here."

                "body": "FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker explains \"emotional decision\" to leave role over Mamdani's mayoral win\nFor the first time, FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker is explaining why he decided to announce his resignation just one day after Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.\n\"Look, it's a complicated, emotional decision to leave. But ideologically, there's no doubt that the mayor and I disagree on some very fundamental things to me,\" Tucker, who was appointed to the role in August 2024, told \"CBS Mornings\" in his first interview since handing in his resignation letter on Nov. 5.\nIn a closely-watched decision last week, Tucker's police counterpart, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Mamdani's offer to stay in her role. Months before the election, Mamdani softened his sharp criticism of the NYPD and clarified that he is \"not running to defund the police,\" distancing himself from old social media posts.\nDespite his public apology to the NYPD, Tucker said Mamdani still has some work to do when it comes to winning over the support of first responders. Beyond that, some of Mamdani's stances, like his refusal to support Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, have alarmed many Jewish New Yorkers.\n\"I think it's a factor [in my decision to resign], no doubt,\" said Tucker, who is Jewish. \"And I don't want to tell you that it's the only factor. But I believe that the things that I have heard the mayor say would make it difficult for me to continue on in such a senior executive role in the administration.\"\nAccording to exit polls, 31% of Jewish New Yorkers voted for Mamdani, with 65% voting for independent opponent Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani won every borough but Staten Island.\nIn an October debate, Mamdani, who will make history as New York City's first Muslim mayor, vowed to \"be the mayor who doesn't just protect Jewish New Yorkers, but also celebrates and cherishes them.\"\nHowever, Tucker and some prominent Jewish leaders \u2013 like Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the senior rabbi at New York City's Central Synagogue \u2013 aren't convinced by the mayor-elect's words of reassurance. In an October sermon, Buchdal accused Mamdani of contributing \"to a mainstreaming of some of the most abhorrent antisemitism.\"\n\"More importantly than hearing it, we want to see it,\" Tucker said.\nHe pointed to Mamdani's response to a protest last week outside of an Upper East Side synagogue hosting an event to support Jewish emigration to Israel, during which activists shouted threats. A Mamdani spokesperson was later quoted saying he \"discouraged the language,\" adding in an apparent nod of support to the protesters that \"these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.\"\nTucker said Mamdani should have come out quickly to condemn the behavior and rhetoric.\n\"You know, I don't know that the public has heard appropriately from him,\" he said.\nInside headquarters in Brooklyn, where the FDNY coordinates responses to emergencies across America's biggest city, Tucker says they're still waiting for outreach from Mamdani.\n\"I haven't had any personal conversations with the mayor-elect. I haven't heard from anyone in his incoming administration, nor has the department. And so I only hope that is not an indicator of their feelings about the FDNY. I'd like to think they think everything is going so well here that they don't need to transition so fast,\" he joked.\nMamdani and his team have not responded to CBS News' requests for comment on this story."

Hanover, behind the AM/PM convenience store. The store was blocked off for some time.\nDue to the severity of the fire and the conditions of the house, the fire department said the crew had a difficult time getting inside the home.\nWhen they were finally able to break through, the firefighters found two victims inside.\nThey were able to get the fire under control within 40 minutes of arriving, and the fire was extinguished later in the evening. Crews were at the scene for several hours.\nThe cause of the fire is currently unknown, but the State Fire Marshal has been called in to investigate, in collaboration with the Cape Girardeau Fire and Police Departments.\nWhen our crew was at the scene, we saw that William Street was also blocked in the area for some time because of a fire hose stretched across the road.\nCopyright 2025 KFVS.

So the store tucked in Santee Alley, where 24-year-old Osorio works selling cowboy boots and other Western-style clothing, was the perfect stop for fans.\nOsorio expected, or perhaps hoped, the store would see similar traffic at the start of the Thanksgiving holiday week.\nAfter the tumult of President Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, that remains to be seen. Over the summer, several raids in the neighborhood sparked protests. But the mass arrests and fears of deportation turned the Fashion District into a ghost town for several weeks after, with storefronts shuttered and frightened workers staying home.\nThe story was the same in other business districts that cater to immigrants. Although conditions have improved in recent months, merchants are still feeling the pain and in desperate need of a holiday retail miracle.\nLocal officials and activists are encouraging people to shop on Black Friday and beyond, including by holding a festival over the weekend. But it remains unclear how many will feel safe enough to come out.\nSome merchants are \u201cliving sale to sale, customer to customer,\u201d said Anthony Rodriguez, president of the Fashion District\u2019s business improvement district, a private group of property owners in the area.\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t big-box stores,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThese are family-owned and, in some cases, generational businesses that more than ever need L.A.\u2019s support. If people can come down and just spend $10 to $15 ... that\u2019s how we can make a difference.\u201d\nOn Monday, Osorio said she made just one sale: a pair of utility boots.\nShe opened the store at 9:30 a.m. and sold the boots at around 2 p.m. They had been marked down $30 from their typical price of $160 because customers have been so reluctant to spend money, she said.\n\u201cWe are waiting for the good times,\u201d Osorio said. \u201cHonestly, I felt like it was going to be better this week, but it\u2019s been really, really slow. We just pray and keep the faith. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\nSmall businesses in the area \u2014 which includes the historically vibrant, bustling open-air shopping corridor Santee Alley, known for bargain prices \u2014 are looking for ways to recoup some of their losses through holiday sales.\nFoot traffic in the area is back at levels seen before federal immigration raids began in Los Angeles in early June, according to the business improvement district.\nBut Rodriguez said traffic fluctuates day to day and is \u201cat the mercy\u201d of rumors, at times false, of federal enforcement operations circulated among group chats of merchants and community members.\nSuch alerts prompt businesses to shut down at a moment\u2019s notice with \u201cpeople literally running from their stores,\u201d Rodriguez said. He said that, one day, agents from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service were conducting an investigation in the area and were confused for Customs and Border Protection officers.\nRodriguez said there are \u201cvery valid reasons\u201d to pay attention to alerts but that minimizing their harmful effects is crucial for economic recovery.\nVisitors to stores and businesses in the Fashion District dropped dramatically in the week or so after the initial raids on June 6. Foot traffic in the Fashion District dropped 33% while visitors to Santee Alley specifically dropped by 50%, according to the business improvement district.\nRodriguez said it took at least three weeks to recover foot traffic, and even so, vendors are struggling because \u201cpeople are not spending like they used to.\u201d\nAnd the typical holiday boost has yet to make an appearance, Rodriguez said.\n\u201cAs of right now, we are not seeing the holiday spike we have seen in previous years,\u201d he said.\nIn May, the Fashion District saw some 1.98 million visitors, while in June that number dropped to 1.2 million, "

AUD/USD rose 0.7% during its best day in three months.\nYen Crosses Strengthen as Risk-On Tone Builds\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: Tradingview\nWall Street rose for a fourth day heading into Thanksgiving, and the risk-on tone left the yen as the weakest major currency. This opens the door for further upside across several yen crosses if sentiment remains buoyant.\n- AUD/JPY formed a bullish engulfing candle above its 20-day EMA and closed back above the 10-day EMA. A move towards 103 now looks plausible.\n- CHF/JPY printed a bullish engulfing day at its 20-day EMA and appears poised to retest cycle highs. A break above 196 assumes continued trend strength at record levels.\n- EUR/JPY bounced cleanly from its 10-day EMA and is edging closer to its cycle high, with a break above the 182 handle implied.\n- CAD/JPY formed a bullish engulfing candle between the 10 and 20-day EMAs and prior highs around 110.64, putting a run towards 112 on the radar for bulls.\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nI outlined the importance of the February high at 155.89 as a potential pivotal level yesterday, and so far it is holding as support. USD/JPY printed its most bullish candle in five sessions around this level, forming a two-bar bullish reversal (bullish piercing line) and hinting at a swing low around the 10-day EMA.\nHowever, volatility is likely to be low today as we head into Thanksgiving in the US. Using data since 1992, the average range for USD/JPY on Thanksgiving Day is just 0.55%, with a median of 0.44% \u2014 making it the least volatile session across the three days either side of the holiday. Average and median returns are slightly negative (but effectively flat) at -0.01% and -0.03%.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nThe Friday after Thanksgiving shows an average return of 0.09% and a median of 0.18%, with the highest win rate of the seven days monitored at 66.7%.\nSo we could be in for a quiet session today, with the potential for a retracement within Wednesday\u2019s range before bulls re-emerge tomorrow if the seasonal Thanksgiving pattern plays out.\n- A break beneath Wednesday\u2019s low (155.65) assumes a deeper pullback to the 155 area, near the weekly VPOC an"

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group 8316 advanced 2% and Mizuho Financial Group 8411 gained 0.26%.\nSwap rates indicated a 33.9% chance of a rate hike to 0.75% on December 19, when the Bank of Japan concludes its two-day policy meeting.\n\"In the previous meetings, two board members dissented to the hold decision and instead proposed raising rates, but looking at the recent BOJ communication, there could be at least four members who may support a rate hike,\" said Yasuda.\nOf the more than 1,600 stocks trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's prime market, 69% rose, 25% fell and 4% traded flat."
