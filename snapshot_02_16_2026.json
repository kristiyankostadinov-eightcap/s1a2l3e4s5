                "body": "Silver plummets after Trump taps Kevin Warsh to chair Federal Reserve\nThe price of silver plummeted Friday, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he will nominate economist Kevin Warsh to chair the Federal Reserve.\nSpot silver prices had dropped by more than 37% just before 5 p.m. ET, to around $84.63 a troy ounce. Precious metals trade nearly 24 hours a day.\nFriday\u2019s plunge put an abrupt halt to silver\u2019s red-hot run over the last 12 months. Analysts attributed the drop to investors selling their silver for high returns at what could be the end of its juggernaut.\nBut even accounting for Friday\u2019s losses, silver is still up more than 150% since this time last year.\nSpot gold prices also fell in Friday trading, although not nearly as steeply as silver. The price of gold was down around 11% shortly before 5 p.m. ET, to around $4,864 a troy ounce.\nAdvertisement\nLike silver, gold has made remarkable gains over the past year, as investors flocked to \u201csafe haven\u201d assets like precious metals as a hedge against uncertainty in financial markets and the global economy. After Friday\u2019s hit, gold was still up more than 70% over the past year.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar traded higher Friday, reversing a downward trend that gained steam on Tuesday, when the U.S. currency had its worst day since April 2025.\nThe twin dynamics on Wall Street of investors selling their safe haven metals, while pushing up the dollar, signals an increase in confidence. This is likely due in part to the popular view that Warsh would be an experienced hand at the wheel of the Fed.\nWarsh is also a longtime monetary \u201chawk\u201d who, during his time on the Fed board, generally opposed lowering interest rates as a way to turbo charge economic growth.\nWarsh has pivoted somewhat over the past year, as he carefully positioned himself in Trump\u2019s camp, criticizing the current Fed and sounding open to lowering rates.\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed slightly down Friday, investors weighed other factors, such as Friday\u2019s unexpectedly sharp rise in the Producer Price Index."

Meanwhile, in international markets, Spot silver was down 0.6% at $76.92 per ounce, after a 3% rise on Friday.\nThe U.S. dollar index rose on Monday. The dollar index inched up 0.10% to 97, making greenback-backed bullion expensive for buyers in overseas currencies. Meanwhile, data released by the Labor Department on Friday showed that the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% in January, undershooting economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.3% increase, after an unrevised 0.3% rise in December. Softer inflation readings typically bolster expectations of interest rate cuts.\nOn the other hand, Gold also declined today. MCX gold April contracts dropped by 0.74% to \u20b91,54,743 per 10 grams. Whereas, in the international markets, Spot gold fell 0.4% to $5,020.10 per ounce by 0111 GMT after gaining 2.5% in the previous session.

Spot platinum shed 0.4% to $2,054.35 per ounce, while palladium rose 0.4% to $1,692.23.\nAccording to Gaurvav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk, gold and silver in 2026 are witnessing a volatile corrective phase after last year\u2019s sharp rally, though the broader multi-year bullish trend remains intact.\n\"MCX gold is consolidating around \u20b91.55\u20131.58 lakh per 10g, while silver has shown sharp two-way moves near \u20b92.41 lakh/kg despite being below earlier peaks.

It's a tug of war between bears and bulls this week, and the volatility will continue in the week ahead,\u201d Mallya added.\nInternational trends and market drivers\nIn the international market, Comex gold futures gained $84, or 1.7 per cent, during the week, while silver edged up marginally to close at $77.27 per ounce.\nMer said gold prices moved between gains and losses through most of the trading sessions but managed to end the week higher.\n\u201cGold prices see-sawed between gains and losses for most part of the trading session, but managed to close the week in positive and above $5,000 per ounce in the overseas market.\n\u201cThe bullions are passing through a phase of consolidation amid a lack of clarity among traders as they remain divided over the price direction and look for fresh fundamental triggers,\u201d he said.\nAnalysts noted that central bank buying, safe-haven demand amid a sharp sell-off in global technology and AI stocks, and a softer dollar index provided support to bullion prices.\nHowever, mixed physical demand from India and China, profit-booking by ETF investors and strong US macroeconomic data capped the upside.\nMer said silver also experienced two-way price movements during the week.\n\u201cThe white metal was weighed by corrections in industrial metals and profit-booking after failing to breach key technical resistance. It also faced pressure from the tech-led global equity sell-off, which reduced risk appetite across asset classes,\u201d he added.\nAnalysts said both gold and silver are likely to remain range-bound in the near term as investors await clearer signals on the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy trajectory and broader global economic trends."

                "body": "In November, Opec published an article titled, \u201cThe IEA\u2019s rendezvous with reality\u201d. It criticised the International Energy Agency for predicting an imminent peak in oil demand. With a huge gap between the market views of the duelling agencies for this year, one or both are due a rethink.\nThe IEA forecasts a massive surplus in the oil market this year, which would presumably cause a crash in prices. Its latest monthly outlook, published on Thursday, trimmed demand growth estimates for this year to 850,000 barrels per day, after relatively high prices last month. Conversely, Opec predicts 1.4 million bpd of demand expansion.\nThe two groups also differ in expectations on supply from outside the Opec+ alliance: 1.4 million bpd of growth from the IEA, 0.8 million bpd forecast by Opec. Since the Paris-based agency believes the market was already in serious oversupply last year, this year\u2019s implied glut would be huge, reaching 3.7 million bpd, a Covid-era style blowout.\nConversely, Opec sees demand for the wider alliance\u2019s crude growing this year. This would allow the group to resume production increases from the second quarter.\nThe EIA\u2019s middle ground\nThe third major international forecaster, the US\u2019s Energy Information Administration, is stuck in the middle of this awkward trio. It predicts essentially no change to market balances this year, with what it sees as last year\u2019s modest oversupply persisting. It more or less agrees with Opec on demand growth, and with the IEA on supply. Perhaps its moderation will turn out to be wisdom.\nSince the IEA has not yet provided its short-term outlook for 2027, next year has an illusory sense of greater predictability. The EIA and Opec both see reasonable demand growth of 1.3 million bpd and much weaker non-Opec+ supply expansion of 0.7 million bpd.\nFutures prices cannot be readily taken as predictions. But current Brent futures decline from about $67.50 per barrel for prompt prices, to $64 one year out, then gradually rise to $65.50 per barrel for prices three years in the future. The level of these prices has shifted up and down over the past month, but the shape of the curve has remained the same. Read simplistically, this does at least suggest a relatively weak market this year and an improvement next.\nAgainst such deep uncertainty and conflicting opinions, what is the best course?\nFirst is to think through scenarios. What would make material differences to these balances?\nRisks on the supply side\nBeyond significant shocks to economic growth, geopolitical risks hover over the supply side. These have not quite materialised, whether around Russia, Venezuela or Iran. If anything, resolutions to these conflicts could add a few hundred thousand barrels of supply in the near-term.\nBut domestic protests and US naval motions around Iran last month did push up prices by several dollars. A major conflict in the Middle East that seriously disrupts oil supplies is unlikely but its consequences would be major. Opec\u2019s spare capacity would be sufficient to replace losses of Iranian exports, but only as long as other regional exporters are not seriously affected. An escalation in the Black Sea, damaging Russian and Kazakh exports, would be easier for the Gulf Opec members to cover for.\nTwo other factors, though, do provide some counterbalancing stability. China built up its crude stockpiles busily last year, at an average rate of about 0.75 million bpd. As long as prices remain reasonable, and especially while cheap sanctioned crude is available from Iran and Russia (though not now from Venezuela), it will keep buying.\nAnd most global supply growth outside the Opec+ alliance last year came from the US and Latin America. Both of these should slow this year, with lower prices taking a toll on shale producers, and Brazil\u2019s offshore development having a quieter year.\nSecond is to look beyond the headline numbers. The different agencies\u2019 views have some important commonalities. For instance, they all see that de"

                "body": "Global oil prices remained steady on Monday as markets closely watch upcoming talks between United States and Iran. While concerns over potential disruptions in oil supply due to US-Iran tensions kept prices stable, OPEC+ is considering increasing production from April. The day saw Brent crude futures slightly down at $67.72 per barrel, while US WTI crude stood at $62.86.\nThe market's cautious stance comes ahead of crucial negotiations between Washington and Tehran in Geneva on Tuesday. These talks aim to resolve their long-running dispute over Iran's nuclear program. Both benchmarks had declined last week after US President Donald Trump suggested a possible deal with Iran within a month.\nAn Iranian diplomat revealed that Iran seeks a nuclear agreement offering mutual economic benefits, including investments in energy and mining sectors, along with aircraft purchases. However, market analyst Tony Sycamore said, \"With both sides expected to hold firm on their core red lines, expectations are low that a deal can be reached and this is likely to be the calm before the storm,\" as quoted by Reuters.\nMilitary tensions have escalated, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the region.\nHowever, Iran's Revolutionary Guards have threatened to retaliate against US military bases if their territory is attacked.\nMeanwhile, OPEC+ is considering resuming oil production increases after a three-month pause to meet summer demand. \"The market reacted reasonably well to those reports,\" Sycamore commented, adding \"If that geopolitical premium or support wasn't there, crude oil would likely be trading sub $60 this morning.\"\nTrading activity is expected to be quiet on Monday with several Asian markets, including China, South Korea, and Taiwan, closed for holidays."

                "body": "In November, Opec published an article titled, \u201cThe IEA\u2019s rendezvous with reality\u201d. It criticised the International Energy Agency for predicting an imminent peak in oil demand. With a huge gap between the market views of the duelling agencies for this year, one or both are due a rethink.\nThe IEA forecasts a massive surplus in the oil market this year, which would presumably cause a crash in prices. Its latest monthly outlook, published on Thursday, trimmed demand growth estimates for this year to 850,000 barrels per day, after relatively high prices last month. Conversely, Opec predicts 1.4 million bpd of demand expansion.\nThe two groups also differ in expectations on supply from outside the Opec+ alliance: 1.4 million bpd of growth from the IEA, 0.8 million bpd forecast by Opec. Since the Paris-based agency believes the market was already in serious oversupply last year, this year\u2019s implied glut would be huge, reaching 3.7 million bpd, a Covid-era style blowout.\nConversely, Opec sees demand for the wider alliance\u2019s crude growing this year. This would allow the group to resume production increases from the second quarter.\nThe EIA\u2019s middle ground\nThe third major international forecaster, the US\u2019s Energy Information Administration, is stuck in the middle of this awkward trio. It predicts essentially no change to market balances this year, with what it sees as last year\u2019s modest oversupply persisting. It more or less agrees with Opec on demand growth, and with the IEA on supply. Perhaps its moderation will turn out to be wisdom.\nSince the IEA has not yet provided its short-term outlook for 2027, next year has an illusory sense of greater predictability. The EIA and Opec both see reasonable demand growth of 1.3 million bpd and much weaker non-Opec+ supply expansion of 0.7 million bpd.\nFutures prices cannot be readily taken as predictions. But current Brent futures decline from about $67.50 per barrel for prompt prices, to $64 one year out, then gradually rise to $65.50 per barrel for prices three years in the future. The level of these prices has shifted up and down over the past month, but the shape of the curve has remained the same. Read simplistically, this does at least suggest a relatively weak market this year and an improvement next.\nAgainst such deep uncertainty and conflicting opinions, what is the best course?\nFirst is to think through scenarios. What would make material differences to these balances?\nRisks on the supply side\nBeyond significant shocks to economic growth, geopolitical risks hover over the supply side. These have not quite materialised, whether around Russia, Venezuela or Iran. If anything, resolutions to these conflicts could add a few hundred thousand barrels of supply in the near-term.\nBut domestic protests and US naval motions around Iran last month did push up prices by several dollars. A major conflict in the Middle East that seriously disrupts oil supplies is unlikely but its consequences would be major. Opec\u2019s spare capacity would be sufficient to replace losses of Iranian exports, but only as long as other regional exporters are not seriously affected. An escalation in the Black Sea, damaging Russian and Kazakh exports, would be easier for the Gulf Opec members to cover for.\nTwo other factors, though, do provide some counterbalancing stability. China built up its crude stockpiles busily last year, at an average rate of about 0.75 million bpd. As long as prices remain reasonable, and especially while cheap sanctioned crude is available from Iran and Russia (though not now from Venezuela), it will keep buying.\nAnd most global supply growth outside the Opec+ alliance last year came from the US and Latin America. Both of these should slow this year, with lower prices taking a toll on shale producers, and Brazil\u2019s offshore development having a quieter year.\nSecond is to look beyond the headline numbers. The different agencies\u2019 views have some important commonalities. For instance, they all see that de"

While concerns over potential disruptions in oil supply due to US-Iran tensions kept prices stable, OPEC+ is considering increasing production from April. The day saw Brent crude futures slightly down at $67.72 per barrel, while US WTI crude stood at $62.86.\nThe market's cautious stance comes ahead of crucial negotiations between Washington and Tehran in Geneva on Tuesday. These talks aim to resolve their long-running dispute over Iran's nuclear program. Both benchmarks had declined last week after US President Donald Trump suggested a possible deal with Iran within a month.\nAn Iranian diplomat revealed that Iran seeks a nuclear agreement offering mutual economic benefits, including investments in energy and mining sectors, along with aircraft purchases. However, market analyst Tony Sycamore said, \"With both sides expected to hold firm on their core red lines, expectations are low that a deal can be reached and this is likely to be the calm before the storm,\" as quoted by Reuters.\nMilitary tensions have escalated, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the region.\nHowever, Iran's Revolutionary Guards have threatened to retaliate against US military bases if their territory is attacked.\nMeanwhile, OPEC+ is considering resuming oil production increases after a three-month pause to meet summer demand. \"The market reacted reasonably well to those reports,\" Sycamore commented, adding \"If that geopolitical premium or support wasn't there, crude oil would likely be trading sub $60 this morning.\"\nTrading activity is expected to be quiet on Monday with several Asian markets, including China, South Korea, and Taiwan, closed for holidays."

Activity is likely to remain muted, with United States (US) markets closed for the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday, while Mainland China is also shut for the week-long Lunar New Year break.\nLosses in the EUR/USD pair may be limited as the US Dollar (USD) could ease following softer January Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures, which reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could cut rates later this year.\nUS CPI rose 2.4% year-over-year (YoY) in January, slowing from 2.7% in December and coming in below the 2.5% forecast. On a monthly basis, consumer inflation moderated to 0.2%, down from 0.3% previously and under market expectations of 0.3%.\nMoreover, recent data showed that Nonfarm Payrolls increased by the most in over a year, while the Unemployment Rate unexpectedly declined, pointing to a stabilizing labor market. Markets widely expect the Fed to keep rates unchanged in March before delivering two 25-basis-point cuts by year-end.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, investors now assign nearly a 90% probability to the Fed holding rates steady at its March meeting, up from 81% a week earlier. Markets are pricing in roughly two 25-basis-point cuts by the end of the year, with the first move seen in June at around a 52% probability.\nMeanwhile, the Euro (EUR) found support amid signals that the European Central Bank (ECB) remains largely unconcerned about the currency\u2019s recent appreciation. ECB President Christine Lagarde, who stated that the euro area\u2019s inflation outlook is in a \u201cgood place,\u201d cautioned against overreacting to short-term or volatile data.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro.

It is currently trading around 97.0 \u2014 roughly 15% below its mid-2022 peak and about 1.5% beneath its 10-year average. Westpac\u2019s baseline view is that the dollar will settle somewhere between current levels and its 20-year average, but risks are skewed to the downside.\nImportantly, Westpac is not bearish on the US economy. The bank expects another year of above-trend growth in 2026, led by resilient consumer spending and continued investment in technology infrastructure. It anticipates the labour market will remain effectively fully employed, with wage growth continuing to outpace inflation.\nHowever, Westpac argues that inflation risks remain elevated. Capacity constraints across housing, transport, energy and healthcare, alongside the lagged effects of tariffs, are likely to keep price pressures above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. This underpins its expectation for only one additional rate cut from the Federal Open Market Committee, a more cautious stance than current market pricing for at least two cuts this year.\nSo why the softer dollar outlook? Westpac points to improving opportunities elsewhere. It argues that the strong run in US equities may limit further relative outperformance, while growth narratives in Europe and Asia are increasingly focused on structural expansion rather than trade risks.\nThe bank expects the euro to rise toward $1.22 and sterling toward $1.41 by mid-2027.

                "body": "EUR/USD expected to continue uptrend after recent short-term correction\nTHE euro is the second most traded currency by volume globally and forms the most actively traded currency pair with the US dollar. It is also widely held as a global reserve currency, serving as the common legal tender across the eurozone. Rising geopolitical risks in the United States have fuelled discussions around de-dollarisation, positioning the euro as a potential alternative reserve currency.\nThe EUR/USD reflects the relative strength of both currencies, with trading themes often revolving around the psychologically significant 1:1 parity level.\nHistorically, EUR/USD generally trades above the 1.00 level, meaning one euro is worth more than one US dollar. In 2022, however, the pair fell below the parity level and before recovering to the 1.05 range by year-end. It was approaching towards parity again in early 2025 but subsequently rallied sharply towards 1.18. The recent high of 1.204 marks a level close to a five-year high, largely driven by evolving geopolitical and macroeconomic developments in the US.\nThe US dollar\u2019s strong depreciation\nIn 2025, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates from 4.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent, while the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered interest rates from 3.15 per cent to 2.15 per cent. The lower US interest rates have led to investors moving funds into other currencies and foreign-denominated funds for a higher interest differential. US inflation currently hovers around 2-3 per cent while the eurozone\u2019s latest inflation data stands at 1.7 per cent. The ECB\u2019s inflation target also faces challenges amid the strong appreciation of the euro as it is currently lowering interest rates to stimulate inflationary growth.\nOne of the contributions to depreciation of the US dollar is the growing political risk. The US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has more than doubled compared to levels seen during the Covid period. Protectionist tariffs and immigration restrictions have led to supply chain disruptions contributing to inflation in the US. While the eurozone is not immune to US trade policies, stronger-than-expected GDP growth in recent quarters has demonstrated relative economic resilience, further supporting the euro\u2019s recent strength.\nNavigate Asia in\na new global order\nGet the insights delivered to your inbox.\nBullish EUR/USD scenario\nThe key technical level is still 1.18. In 2025, prices rebounded from the 1.18 level on three separate occasions, with only one brief breakout above this level before retreating within two days. The recent high above 1.20 now serves as a reference point for potential upside movement in EUR/USD, supported by the broader recovery seen across equities, commodities and metals. The dollar index has also reversed from its recent peak of 98 and is currently trending lower in the short term, supporting the upside movement of EUR/USD.\nEUR/USD dipped below 1.18 recently but remained above the 20-day moving average (MA). The latest candlestick has opened above the 1.18 level, signalling the continuation of the broader uptrend after the recent short-term correction. EUR/USD is trading within its 10-day MA and 20-day MA with the 10-day MA still above the 20-day MA. The stochastic oscillator also indicates a possible start of the reversal, with the %K line crossing above the oversold region.\nBearish EUR/USD scenario\nIf prices fail to sustain above the 1.18 level, the next immediate support lies at 1.16. The upward trendline covers the 1.16 from the last rally in January 2026. The next support level below 1.16 would be 1.14 and 1.115. These levels previously acted as strong reversal zones where buyers stepped in to hold prices.\nAdditionally, if inflation persistently undershoots the ECB\u2019s target, further monetary easing in the eurozone could potentially weaken the euro to the 1.14 level.\nNote: This article was written on Feb 9\nThe writer is dealer, contract for differences, at Phillip Securities\nDec"

                "body": "British Pound flat lines vs. USD as traders await key UK macro data and FOMC minutes\n|- GBP/USD lacks any firm intraday directional bias as traders await this week\u2019s important releases.\n- The UK jobs data, along with the CPI report, will influence BoE rate cut bets and influence the GBP.\n- The FOMC minutes will drive the USD demand and provide some meaningful impetus to the major.\nThe GBP/USD pair kicks off a new week on a subdued note and oscillates in a narrow range, just below mid-1.3600s, during the Asian session. Moreover, the mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution for aggressive traders as the market focus now shifts to this week's important releases from the UK and the US.\nThe UK jobs report is due on Tuesday and will be followed by the latest consumer inflation figures on Wednesday. The crucial data would influence market expectations about the Bank of England's (BoE) policy outlook amid bets for a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in March. This, in turn, will play a key role in driving the British Pound (GBP). Apart from this, traders will take cues from the FOMC Minutes on Wednesday for more cues about the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-cut path, which would provide a fresh impetus to the US Dollar (USD) and the GBP/USD pair.\nFurthermore, the release of UK monthly Retail Sales data on Friday, along with flash PMIs from the UK and the US, might contribute to producing short-term trading opportunities during the latter part of the week. In the meantime, Friday's softer US consumer inflation figures lifted odds that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in June. Moreover, traders have been pricing in the possibility of at least two Fed rate cuts in 2026. This, along with threats to the central bank's independence and the bullish sentiment, acts as a headwind for the safe-haven Greenback.\nApart from this, easing UK political jitters offer some support to the GBP/USD pair, warranting some caution for bearish traders or positioning for any meaningful depreciating move. In fact, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received backing from his cabinet and Labour MPs following the fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein files, which led to Morgan McSweeney's resignation as chief of staff.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. O"

Capacity constraints across housing, transport, energy and healthcare, alongside the lagged effects of tariffs, are likely to keep price pressures above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. This underpins its expectation for only one additional rate cut from the Federal Open Market Committee, a more cautious stance than current market pricing for at least two cuts this year.\nSo why the softer dollar outlook? Westpac points to improving opportunities elsewhere. It argues that the strong run in US equities may limit further relative outperformance, while growth narratives in Europe and Asia are increasingly focused on structural expansion rather than trade risks.\nThe bank expects the euro to rise toward $1.22 and sterling toward $1.41 by mid-2027. It sees more gradual gains for the Canadian dollar and yen, and anticipates further appreciation in the renminbi as Asia\u2019s growth prospects strengthen.\n- USD/CAD projected to ease to 1.34 by mid-2027 and 1.30 by mid-2028\n- USD/JPY 145 by end-2026 and 139 by mid-2028\n- USD/CNY seen advancing toward 6.35 over the next two years"

                "body": "LONDON, May 21, 2025 \u2013 The GBP/USD currency pair, a critical barometer of transatlantic economic sentiment, has entered a phase of pronounced consolidation. Market activity has notably diminished as traders worldwide adopt a cautious stance. This period of relative calm precedes the release of two pivotal market-moving events: key UK macroeconomic indicators and the latest minutes from the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Consequently, the British Pound\u2019s value against the US Dollar remains tightly range-bound, reflecting the market\u2019s collective anticipation and risk-averse positioning.\nBritish Pound USD Dynamics in a Holding Pattern\nThe Cable pair, as GBP/USD is colloquially known, currently exhibits minimal volatility. This stability is not indicative of market disinterest but rather strategic hesitation. Major institutional desks and algorithmic trading systems have reduced their exposure. They are awaiting clearer directional signals from fundamental data. Historically, such periods of low volatility often precede significant price movements. The current trading range represents a delicate equilibrium between competing economic narratives from the United Kingdom and the United States.\nSeveral technical factors contribute to this flatlining trend. Firstly, the pair is trading near a major psychological support level. Secondly, moving averages have converged, indicating a lack of strong momentum in either direction. Finally, trading volume has declined significantly over the past five sessions. This technical setup suggests that the next major data release could trigger a decisive breakout. Market analysts widely reference the 1.2500 to 1.2650 range as the immediate zone of contention.\nThe Crucial UK Macroeconomic Data on the Horizon\nAll eyes are firmly fixed on the upcoming slate of UK economic reports. These data points will provide the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) with critical evidence for its next interest rate decision. The most significant releases include the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for inflation, employment and wage growth figures, and retail sales data. Each metric carries substantial weight for the Pound\u2019s valuation.\n- Inflation (CPI): The primary driver of central bank policy. A reading above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target could revive expectations for a more hawkish stance, potentially strengthening the Pound.\n- Wage Growth: Sustained high wage increases can fuel persistent inflation, pressuring the BoE to maintain higher interest rates for longer.\n- Retail Sales: A measure of consumer confidence and domestic economic strength. Strong sales may signal resilient demand, while weak data could point to economic contraction.\nMarket consensus, as surveyed by major financial institutions, suggests a mixed but cooling picture for the UK economy. However, any significant deviation from these forecasts will likely cause immediate volatility in the GBP/USD pair. Traders are meticulously comparing current data trends against the Bank of England\u2019s last quarterly projections.\nExpert Analysis: Interpreting the Data for Currency Impact\nFinancial strategists emphasize the nuanced relationship between data releases and currency movement. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about whether a figure beats or misses expectations,\u201d notes a senior currency analyst at a leading London investment bank. \u201cThe market\u2019s reaction depends heavily on the perceived implications for the future path of monetary policy. For instance, a slightly hot inflation print coupled with softening employment data creates a policy dilemma for the BoE, which the market may interpret as neutral or even bearish for Sterling.\u201d This expert perspective underscores the complexity of modern forex trading, where algorithms parse data and central bank commentary simultaneously to execute trades in milliseconds.\nAnticipating the FOMC Minutes: The US Dollar\u2019s Fate\nSimultaneously, the US Dollar\u2019s trajectory hinges on insights from the Federal Reserve.

Updated forecasts imply scope for additional hikes this year, and Governor Bullock has reiterated that 3% inflation remains \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nUnless the minutes reveal a stronger internal push for immediate tightening, they may not meaningfully shift rate pricing.\nAustralia PMIs Trending Higher\nFlash PMIs are due Friday at 09:00 AEDT. While not always major AUD/USD movers, their policy implications are growing more relevant.\nManufacturing, services and composite PMIs are expanding at a faster pace, and their 12-month averages continue trending higher.

                "body": "Australian Dollar remains close to three-year top vs. USD; AUD/USD eyes 0.7100 mark\n- AUD/USD gains some positive traction on Monday amid a combination of supporting factors.\n- The divergent Fed-RBA policy expectations lend support to the AUD amid a positive risk tone.\n- Hopes for more stimulus from China benefit the Aussie and back the case for further upside.\nThe AUD/USD pair attracts some buyers in the vicinity of mid-0.7000s during the Asian session on Monday and, for now, seems to have stalled its corrective pullback from a three-year high, touched last week. Spot prices currently trade around the 0.7080 region, up 0.10% for the day, and seem poised to appreciate further amid a supportive fundamental backdrop.\nThe US Dollar (USD) continues with its struggle to attract any meaningful buyers and extends its sideways consolidative price in a familiar range held over the past week or so amid dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. In fact, traders ramped up their bets that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in June following the release of softer US consumer inflation figures on Friday.\nMoreover, the Fed is expected to deliver at least two 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2026. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will hike interest rates again in May, which continues to act as a tailwind for the Australian Dollar (AUD) and validates the constructive outlook for the AUD/USD pair amid a positive risk tone.\nMeanwhile, China's inflation figures released last week fueled concerns that deflationary pressures continue to weigh on the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The data raised hopes for more fiscal and monetary stimulus from China, which further benefits the China-proxy Aussie. The focus shifts to the release of the FOMC Minutes on Wednesday and Australian employment details on Friday.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Ir"

Spot prices, for now, appear to have snapped a five-day losing streak, reaching a two-week low last Thursday, although the upside potential still seems limited.\nData published by Japan\u2019s Cabinet Office revealed that the economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to a 0.7% contraction recorded in the previous quarter. The reading, however, was below market expectations and tempered bets for an immediate interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Apart from this, the underlying bullish sentiment exerts some downward pressure on the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and assists the USD/JPY pair to gain some positive traction at the start of a new week.\nMeanwhile, the data is likely to give Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi impetus to announce more stimulus. Market players, however, remain hopeful that Takaichi could be fiscally responsible. and that her policies will boost the economy. This might prompt the BoJ to stick to its policy normalization path, which should act as a tailwind for the JPY.

In fact, the headline US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2%, while the core gauge increased 0.3% last month.

Rising bets on an April Bank of Japan rate hike, softer US inflation, and Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s landslide election victory sent the pair sharply lower.\nHowever, on Monday, February 16, Japanese GDP data cooled speculation about an April BoJ rate hike, dampening demand for the yen.\nNevertheless, ongoing expectations of an H1 2026 BoJ rate hike, intervention threats, and hopes that Prime Minister Takaichi will pursue prudent fiscal policy continue to support the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nOn February 16, Japanese economic data tempered expectations of an April BoJ rate hike. The Japanese economy expanded 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q4 after contracting 0.7% in Q3. Economists expected the economy to grow by 0.4%.\nImproving external demand and a continued upswing in private consumption contributed to the quarterly GDP growth. Private consumption increased 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q4 after rising 0.2% in Q3. Meanwhile, external demand stalled quarter-on-quarter in Q4 after falling 0.2% in Q3.\nCrucially, resilient private consumption fuels demand-driven inflation, supporting a medium-term path to policy normalization. Additionally, external demand avoided a quarterly decline, aligning with the BoJ\u2019s view that the effect of US tariffs has abated, another positive signal.\nUSD/JPY reacted to the softer-than-expected GDP figures, briefly dropping to a low of 152.758 before climbing to a high of 153.057 early in the Monday session. While weaker-than-forecast, the Q4 data reaffirmed the bearish short- to medium-term price outlook.\nThis week\u2019s upcoming January trade data will be key to the outlook, given the softer Q4 external demand numbers. Economists forecast exports to soar 12% year-on-year, up from 5.1% in December, and imports to rise 3% (Dec: 5.3%).\nWhile Japanese GDP data weighed on demand for the yen, US economic indicators and Fed commentary on monetary policy will influence expectations of a June Fed rate cut. Later on Monday, FOMC voting member Michelle Bowman is scheduled to speak following last week\u2019s US jobs and CPI reports. Support for a June rate cut on cooling inflation would weaken demand for the US dollar, sending USD/JPY lower.\nLast week\u2019s inflation data overshadowed a hotter-than-expected US jobs report, raising bets on a June Fed rate cut. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a June cut rose from 64.6% on February 12 to 68.6% on February 13, after the data release. However, Friday\u2019s US Personal Income and Outlays Report, Services PMI numbers, and GDP data are likely to be key for US dollar demand.\nMarket expectations of a more dovish Fed policy stance and a hawkish BoJ rate path would reaffirm the negative short- to medium-term outlook.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, traders should closely track technical indicators, key economic indicators, government policy announcements, and central bank chatter.\nOn the daily chart, USD/JPY trades below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), but remains above the 200-day EMA. The EMA positions signal a bearish near-term but bullish longer-term bias. Nevertheless, favorable yen fundamentals align with the short-term technicals, indicating a bearish medium-term outlook.\nA sustained break below the 200-day EMA would signal a bearish trend reversal, bringing the 150 support level into play. If breached, 145 would be the next key support level.\nImportantly, a sustained fall through the EMAs would reinforce the negative medium- to longer-term price outlook.\nIn my view, expectations of BoJ rate hikes and rising Fed rate cut bets support a negative price outlook. However, upside risks to the bearish outlook include:\nThese scenarios would send USD/JPY higher. Nevertheless, yen intervention warnings are likely to cap further upside near 160.\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including"

The filings include a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ether ETF alongside a Truth Social Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF that would generate returns through staking rewards.\nThe\nBitcoin and\nEthereum fund would provide exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with an expected 60-40 split favoring Bitcoin. The structure aims to track performance of both assets while offering staking rewards from the Ethereum position to fund holders.\nCrypto(dot)com will serve as digital asset custodian, liquidity provider, and staking services administrator for both products if approved. Foris Capital US LLC, the SEC-registered broker-dealer affiliated with Crypto(dot)com, would handle distribution responsibilities.\nCrypto(dot)com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek said the company is pleased to provide custody, liquidity, and staking services for the Truth Social Funds ETFs. He described the digital asset products as having strong value propositions that Crypto(dot)com supports.\nThe Cronos-focused ETF represents a notable development for its inclusion of yield-generating mechanisms. The fund would invest in and stake\nCronos tokens, earning rewards by helping secure the proof-of-stake Cronos blockchain network.\nThis approach could position the product differently from passive spot ETFs that dominate the current cryptocurrency fund landscape. Staking rewards provide ongoing returns separate from price appreciation, adding a yield component typically absent from basic crypto exposure products.\nTruth Social first indicated its cryptocurrency investment ambitions in June 2025 with an S-1 registration statement for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The firm followed with a Blue Chip Digital Asset ETF filing in July 2025 targeting large-cap altcoins, though neither product has launched yet.\nPresident Donald Trump, a primary owner of Trump Media & Technology Group which owns Truth Social, faces political challenges related to personal business ties in the crypto sector. These connections remain among primary obstacles for advancing the U.S. Senate's Digital Asset Market Clarity Act governing crypto market oversight.\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expects the previously filed Truth Social cryptocurrency funds to launch sometime in the next few months. Trump Media shares finished Friday trading at $10.98, up approximately 0.9%, though the stock has fallen nearly 39% over the past six months.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).

                "body": "It seemed for a while that a meteoric\u2014if uneven\u2014rise in Bitcoin was all but inevitable, as the top cryptocurrency flew past the $100,000 threshold midway through 2025. However, an October high couldn't last, and despite making a modest recovery to end the year, BTC is once again plummeting early in 2026. In fact, Bitcoin has shed about a quarter of its value since the start of the year and has now sunk to just above half what it traded for only a few months back.\nLongtime \"HODL-ers\" might be willing to ride out a potential prolonged drop in the price of Bitcoin, but more active investors seeking to stop the bleeding are perhaps more likely to find a way to win gains even as the cryptocurrency market is falling. One of the best ways to make a direct bet against Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency is through a unique crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a short strategy. Though these funds tend to be highly risky, in the right circumstances, they can turn a bad day for Bitcoin into a win for individual investors.\nLiquid and Popular Fund Aiming For -1X Bitcoin Performance\nOne of the more straightforward ETFs shorting the cryptocurrency space is the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF NYSEARCA: BITI. BITI aims for a -1x relationship to the daily performance of Bitcoin, meaning that when the price of Bitcoin falls in a single day, BITI should replicate that in the positive direction. The effect is similar to what many investors may seek with crypto margin trading or exchange-traded futures contracts, but it comes with a significantly lower hurdle for investors unfamiliar with those strategies.\nProShares Short Bitcoin ETF Today\nBITIProShares Short Bitcoin ETF\n$27.78 -1.51 (-5.16%) As of 02/13/2026 04:10 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $16.58\n\u25bc\n$30.93 - Assets Under Management\n- $132.05 million\nBITI uses a portfolio of futures and swaps to replicate the inverse of the performance of Bitcoin and does not actually short Bitcoin directly. As such, the fund's strategy is somewhat risky, and it is not designed to correspond to the price movement of Bitcoin over a longer period than one day. This makes it appropriate only for investors trading actively and with a fairly high tolerance for risk.\nGiven the unique nature of BITI's investment strategy, investors may be willing to tolerate its high expense ratio of 1.01%. The fund also provides monthly distributions, with a dividend yield of 2.26% as an added bonus. The fund also has a one-month average trading volume above 3 million, helping to ensure that investors don't run into liquidity issues.\nHighly Risky Double Inverse Approach For Investors Willing to Take the Chance\nProShares Ultra Short Bitcoin ETF Today\nSBITProShares Ultra Short Bitcoin ETF\n$60.86 -6.94 (-10.24%) As of 02/13/2026 04:10 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $23.60\n\u25bc\n$76.55 - Dividend Yield\n- 0.67%\n- Assets Under Management\n- $167.01 million\nInvestors finding that BITI doesn't give them enough exposure may take a chance on the ProShares UltraShort Bitcoin ETF NYSEARCA: SBIT. SBIT takes a very similar approach to BITI above, but it aims for -2x returns rather than -1x. While this can magnify gains on a day in which Bitcoin drops in price, it can also double losses if the crypto heads in the other direction. As such, SBIT is even riskier than BITI.\nSBIT comes with a slightly lower annual fee of 0.95% and with comparable trading volume, so liquidity should not be a concern in this case either. Its dividend yield is not as compelling as BITI's, though, at just 0.61%.\nDistributions may not be the primary appeal here, as investors targeting SBIT are likely doing so on a strong conviction that Bitcoin is headed downward on any given day.\nEther Alternative, But Trading Volume Is a Red Flag\nProShares Short Ether ETF Today\nSETHProShares Short Ether ETF\n$55.28 -4.10 (-6.90%) As of 02/13/2026 04:10 PM Eastern\n- 52-Week Range\n- $29.20\n\u25bc\n$121.64 - Dividend Yield\n- 6.01%\n- Assets Under Management\n- $16.76 million\nBitcoin still commands a strong gravita"

With assets under management at roughly $12.27 billion, the latest redemption wave represents about 0.85% of the fund\u2019s capital, a meaningful pullback for a single trading day.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading at $70,575.64 after a bruising three-month stretch in which it has shed about 27.85% of its value. Short-term momentum remains negative, with the 1-day technical signal flashing Sell, a backdrop that likely emboldened profit-taking and risk reduction in FBTC.\nThe scale of the outflow suggests that some institutional and retail holders are locking in prior gains or cutting exposure rather than adding on weakness. Still, with more than $12 billion in AUM, FBTC retains a substantial footprint in the spot Bitcoin ETF arena, leaving open the possibility that flows could quickly reverse if price action stabilizes or macro sentiment turns.\nFor a more detailed analysis and real-time sentiment trends, check the live cryptocurrency prices here."

Events that once centered purely on protocol upgrades now include discussions about compliance frameworks and legislative clarity.\nA warning to regulators\nAt the same time, Paller warned Organizers say policy is no longer something the industry can ignore.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not turn this into a mega regulated centralized business opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we lose decentralization and censorship resistance, what are we building.\u201d\nMore news:\nHe described the current moment as a turning point rather than a crackdown. Engagement with lawmakers, he argued, is beginning to produce tangible progress.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made more progress in the past year than the past eight,\u201d Paller said.\nFor ETHDenver, the presence of policymakers reflects an industry entering a new phase. Regulation is no longer an external force operating in opposition to crypto. It is becoming part of the conversation shaping its next stage.\nETHDenver is a free event.

The new offering will support trading for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\nThe move mirrors aggressive expansion by traditional finance (TradFi) competitors.

Sign up now!\nVibe Check: Ethereum is in one of those classic crypto moments where the charts look wild, the narratives are loud, and nobody agrees on what happens next. Price action has been swinging with aggressive moves in both directions, as ETH battles to defend crucial support while eyeing a potential breakout zone above. Volatility is back, gas dynamics are shifting, and the market is clearly positioning for the next big leg, up or down.\nWant to see what people are saying? Here are the real opinions:\n- Watch high-conviction Ethereum price prediction deep dives on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest Ethereum news drops and on-chain charts on Instagram\n- Go viral with short, punchy Ethereum trading alpha on TikTok\nThe Narrative: If you zoom out from the day-to-day noise, Ethereum is sitting at the intersection of four massive storylines: tech, economics, macro, and the long-term roadmap.\n1. The Tech: Layer-2 Wars Are Real, and They Cut Both Ways\nEthereum Mainnet is no longer where most of the action starts \u2013 it is where it settles. That is a huge shift. Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base are turning ETH from a single crowded highway into a full-on multi-layer megacity:\n- Arbitrum is the degen playground, with aggressive DeFi yields, leverage, and a ton of trading volume flocking there to escape Mainnet gas spikes.\n- Optimism is leaning hard into the Superchain vision, trying to connect multiple chains under one umbrella and attract serious builders and governance-driven projects.\n- Base, backed by Coinbase, is laser-focused on bringing normies on-chain with cleaner UX, social apps, and easier fiat on-ramps.\nThese Layer-2s are not competing against Ethereum \u2013 they are amplifying it. Most of these L2s settle back to Mainnet, paying fees in ETH, using ETH as collateral, and bootstrapping DeFi and NFT ecosystems that ultimately rely on Ethereum security.\nBut here is the double-edged sword: as activity migrates to cheaper L2s, Mainnet gas fee spikes are less frequent. That can reduce fee revenue and slow down ETH burn in quiet periods. Instead of constant gas fee chaos on Mainnet, we now get more cyclical bursts of activity, especially during hype waves (NFT mints, big DeFi launches, or market-wide liquidations).\nSo the risk is clear: if L2 scaling wins but usage stagnates, Ethereum could become efficient but boring \u2013 low fees, lower burn, weaker Ultrasound Money effect. If, however, L2 adoption explodes with real users, games, social dApps, and institutional-grade DeFi, Mainnet could turn into a high-value settlement layer with fewer but much more meaningful, high-fee transactions. That is when ETH as a tech platform and a monetary asset both win.\n2. The Economics: Ultrasound Money or Just Fancy Marketing?\nThe Ultrasound Money meme is simple but powerful:\n- ETH issuance goes down after the Merge (validators instead of miners).\n- ETH burn goes up thanks to EIP-1559, which destroys a portion of transaction fees.\n- If burn > issuance, ETH becomes net deflationary over time.\nIn bullish phases, when on-chain activity spikes, the burn machine roars. DeFi, NFTs, memecoin mania, and L2 settlement traffic all help kick ETH into deflationary mode. Supply slowly shrinks, while demand (staking, collateral, speculation, and fees) pressures the market from the other side.\nIn quiet phases, however, issuance can outpace burn. That flips ETH back toward mild inflation, at least temporarily. And that is the key risk: Ultrasound Money is not a guaranteed state \u2013 it is a function of demand and activity. No activity, no burn. No burn, no Ultrasound.\nStaking compounds the economic dynamics. A massive share of ETH is now locked in validators, LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens), and restaking protocols. That:\n- Reduces circulating float, which can intensify moves when narratives shift.\n- Creates a gro"

In this article, we\u2019ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question \u201cHow high can SOL go in 2026 and beyond?\u201d and we\u2019ll try to answer that.\nOverview\nSolana price prediction: Technical analysis\nSolana price analysis: SOL falls to $86\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- Solana price analysis shows bearish momentum as price hovers around $86\n- The altcoin lost 2% of its value across last 24-hours.\n- Support for SOL/USD is at $78.\nAs of February 15, the Solana price analysis reveals bearish momentum as the bulls are rejected from $90.\nSolana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls to $86\nThe one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline has continued into February with the price falling below the $70 mark this week. While the bulls found support and enabled a recovery but faced strong pressure at $90 and declined back to $86.\nThe distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is widening, leading to increased volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $126.28. The indicator\u2019s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $65.29.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the oversold area and trades close to the edge of the neutral level. The indicator\u2019s value has decreased to index 36.45, and its curve suggests a neutral market sentiment at the level. If selling activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected.\nSOL/USD 4-hour price chart\nThe four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows steady bearish activity as the price crashes below the $80 mark. The altcoin\u2019s price then rose above $90 but then declined to the current $86 mark.\nThe Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies decreased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $92.49, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $76.56, indicating support.\nThe RSI indicator is in the oversold region. Currently at 54.03, the RSI curve is pointing higher, suggesting bullish market sentiment at the level. The level of the index suggests an immediate trend correction. We can expect a bounce back to the $92 mark if the bulls defend $86 support.\nSolana technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat to expect from Solana price analysis?\nThe Solana price analysis suggests a bearish prediction based on ongoing market events for the day.

Solana has become a frequent topic of conversation among the developer, analyst, and digital asset watcher segments since it is known as having a high transaction speed and an expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications.\nIn addition to the fluctuations of the short term market, the interest is also directed towards https://bmblockchain.org the organized participation models connected with the further ecosystem of Solana. These structures are geared towards preset participation conditions, brief contract development and automated settlement, which is a general industry shift towards transparency and the visibility of operations.\nThe Development of SOLPrice and the Evolution of the Participation Behavior.\nThe performance of Solana as a network has been linked in many cases to the activity in the network, the growth in applications, and the development of the infrastructure. SOL Price is more and more debated in connection with participation schemes that provide a well-developed set of engagement terms instead of open-ended exposure in 2026.\nAccording to the market analysts, there are those participants who would want structured models whereby the participation amounts, timeframes, and reward calculations are predefined. In this way, the user is in a position to test the participation logic regardless of the volatility of the price on a daily basis.\nThese frameworks are generally placed as participation frameworks and not speculative instruments and such structures are focused on disclosure and set operational guidelines.\nBM Blockchain Adapts the Partaking Organisation in accordance with the market trends.\nIn reaction to those changes, BM Blockchain has increased its organized participation system related to Solana-related activity. The company states that the framework focuses on short participation periods, automatic reward payment and open participation terms.\nAccording to BM Blockchain, its system infrastructure is spread across various geographical areas, which maintain the stability and continuity of the system. The company emphasizes that the participation activities are based on the mentioned platform rules and are not marketed as ensured results that have a direct connection with SOL Price performance. https://bmblockchain.org\nThe main aspects of the platform are outlined as clarity, consistency, and visibility to the user.\nPlatform Access and New User Incentive.\nBM Blockchain is an online asset and blockchain services platform with a high concentration on the infrastructure in the blockchain market. The company is focused on offering computing resources and enabling ecosystem participation frameworks to support sustainable growth and expand network according to publicly available industry disclosures.\nIn its formulation, the platform has cited that there is a potential incentive distribution program of up to 700,000 units, which are to be given to users who come early on the platform and those who come in large numbers to the platform during the developmental process. Moreover, the welcome allocations of up to $108 concerning onboarding have also been announced on its official site (https://www.bmblockchain.org). These pools have been termed as participation awards but not the assured financial rewards.\nThe information used in all the references is purely informational. Participation models based on incentive schemes are often used by early-stage platforms to make the entry point less obstructive and encourage the ecosystem participation, but it is not to be perceived as the financial results guarantees or the guaranteed returns.\nSecurity Disclosure and Framework.\nSecurity and disclosure are one of the major concerns as structured participation models "

Read on for the main highlights of the call.\nPresident's Day Sale - 70% Off\n- Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\n- Stay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nForward Industries\u2019 latest earnings call struck a cautiously optimistic tone, pairing exceptional growth metrics with headline-grabbing losses. Executives pointed to surging revenue, wider margins, and rapid SOL-per-share accretion as proof the Solana treasury strategy is working, even as a massive non-cash mark-to-market hit and rising costs weighed heavily on reported results.\nRevenue Surges as Solana Strategy Drives Margin Expansion\nForward reported revenue of $21.4 million for Q1 FY2026, more than quadruple the $4.6 million posted a year earlier. Gross margin jumped to 78.6% from 24.5%, with management crediting the Solana treasury and staking model for transforming the company\u2019s economics.\nAt-Scale Solana Treasury Positions Forward as Category Leader\nAs of Dec. 31, 2025, Forward held about 6,962,501 SOL, with more than 99% of its position staked. Management claimed this makes the firm\u2019s Solana treasury larger than the next three SOL treasuries combined, underscoring its scale in the ecosystem.\nStaking Yield Fuels SOL-Per-Share Accretion\nNative staking yields ranged between roughly 6.5% and 7.2%, helping generate more than 112,000 SOL in rewards during the quarter. Fully diluted SOL per share increased from 0.0604 to 0.0624, a gain of about 3.3% quarter over quarter, implying an annualized growth rate near 13%.\nmNAV Underscores Embedded Value Versus Market Price\nManagement highlighted a metric they call mNAV of about 0.85 as of Dec. 31, 2025, based on a SOL price of $125 and Forward\u2019s share price of $6.61. The fully diluted share count stood at 111,591,332, including common shares, warrants, and options, providing context for per-share Solana exposure.\nNew Products Deepen Liquidity and Trading Infrastructure\nForward launched its own liquid staking token, fwdSOL, via a partnership with Sanctum, with roughly a quarter of its SOL now represented by fwdSOL. The company also began testing a proprietary automated market maker built with Galaxy and Jump Crypto, integrated into Jupiter and other Solana aggregators.\nOn-Chain Shares Advance Tokenization Agenda\nThe company became one of the first public issuers to have SEC-registered shares live on Solana via Superstate\u2019s Opening Bell platform. This allows real-time on-chain record keeping and, for eligible non-U.S. holders, the potential to use tokenized FWDI in decentralized finance as collateral.\nRiding the Wave of Institutional and Ecosystem Adoption\nManagement emphasized growing Solana adoption across payments, DeFi, and real-world asset experiments, citing activity from players such as Revolut, Western Union, Figure, PayPal, and WisdomTree. Forward argued that its infrastructure and treasury scale position it to benefit as institutional and on-chain use cases accelerate.\nBalance Sheet Cleanliness Provides Strategic Flexibility\nDespite volatility, executives stressed the company ended the quarter with no institutional debt, describing the balance sheet as clean. They suggested this provides room to pursue offensive moves such as M&A or stock-based deals while more leveraged peers may be constrained.\nMassive Non-Cash Loss Dominates Headline Earnings\nForward recorded a loss on digital assets of about $560.2 million plus roughly $33 million of impairment in Q1 FY2026, resulting in a net loss of $585.6 million versus a $0.7 million loss a year earlier. Management framed these charges as accounting-driven, tied to fair value movements in SOL rather than operational deterioration.\nSOL Price Drop Amplifies Mark-to-Market Volatility\nThe company noted that SOL is trading roughly 70% below its all-time high, magnifying mark-to-market swings on its treasury.

We are talking about sharp swings, sudden reversals, and a market that feels like it is one headline away from either a powerful breakout or a brutal rug pull. With mixed earnings, shifting Fed expectations, and macro data all colliding, traders are watching every candle on the US30 like a hawk.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch live Dow Jones trading streams and market breakdowns on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest Wall Street mood swings and chart posts on Instagram\n- Binge viral TikTok tips from day traders and long-term investors\nThe Story: Wall Street right now is a tug-of-war between bullish hope and bearish reality, and the Dow Jones sits right in the center as the boomer index of blue chips. While social media screams about tech memes and speculative growth, the Dow is quietly pricing in what truly matters: Fed policy, real-world earnings, and the strength of the US consumer.\nThe main driver on the macro side is the constant recalibration of where interest rates are headed. Every new inflation print, every labor-market update, every soundbite from the Fed is pushing expectations back and forth between a soft landing and a delayed recession. When traders think the Fed might cut earlier, cyclical names and industrials catch a bid and the Dow looks ready for a rally. When the market decides the Fed has to stay tighter for longer, yields pop, defensive sectors perk up, and the Dow feels heavy again.\nOn the earnings front, it is all about the big, old-school names that actually move the index: banks, industrial giants, healthcare, consumer staples, and a handful of mega-cap tech plays that sit inside the Dow. We are seeing a classic mixed picture: some companies are beating expectations on the bottom line thanks to cost cuts, while their revenue growth is under pressure from a cautious consumer and weaker global demand. Others are guiding more conservatively, signaling that the easy post-pandemic rebound phase is over.\nLayer on top the constant noise about recession fears versus the soft-landing narrative. Some data points look surprisingly resilient: unemployment not exploding, consumer spending holding up in key categories, and corporate credit markets not showing outright panic. At the same time, leading indicators like manufacturing surveys, housing, and some pockets of services are flashing warning signs. That push-pull is exactly why the Dow feels choppy: not full euphoria, not full crash mode, but a dangerous middle lane where both bulls and bears can get wrecked.\nSentiment on social media is split. One camp is screaming \"crash incoming\" every time the Dow has a red day, posting dramatic thumbnails and end-of-the-world captions. The other camp is glued to the \"buy the dip in blue chips\" narrative, arguing that quality names with stable dividends will eventually win as the cycle turns. Under the surface, though, smart money is not chasing hype; it is rotating, hedging, and quietly building positions where risk/reward looks asymmetric.\nDeep Dive Analysis: To understand what the Dow Jones is really doing, you have to zoom out from the 5?minute chart and look at the macro mechanics: bond yields, the dollar, and global liquidity.\nBond Yields: This is the backbone. When US Treasury yields move higher, the discount rate on future cash flows rises, which compresses valuations. Growth stocks usually get hit harder, but blue chips are not immune. Higher yields also mean investors can park money in \"risk-free\" assets with decent returns, so there i"

Several Historically Correlated Events Offer a Clear Answer.\nKey Points\nStatistically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have generated outsize returns with Donald Trump in the White House.\nSeveral historical trends point to a heightened likelihood of weakness in the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq in 2026.\nHowever, historic correlations strongly favor optimistic investors who focus on the long term.\nFrom a statistical standpoint, the stock market has thrived with Donald Trump in the Oval Office. During his first term (Jan. 20, 2017 \u2013 Jan. 20, 2021), the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-inspired Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\nSince Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second, non-consecutive term on Jan. 20, 2025, it's been more of the same. Through the closing bell on Feb. 11, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have respectively risen by 15%, 16%, and 18%.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\nPresident Trump delivering remarks. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead, courtesy of the National Archives.\nAlthough stock market volatility has been off the charts at times with Trump in the White House, his policies, including the permanent lowering of the peak marginal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, have lit a fire under Wall Street and driven record share buybacks.\nBut when things seem too perfect on Wall Street, they often are. Rumblings of a potential stock market crash in year two of President Trump's second term are mounting. Thankfully, several historically correlated events offer clear insight into the likelihood of a stock market crash taking shape.\nHistory often rhymes on Wall Street\nBefore going any further, it's important to note that history can't guarantee that something is going to happen on Wall Street. Although history does tend to rhyme on Wall Street, and certain correlated events have flawless track records of foreshadowing the future, nothing should be taken as a concrete guarantee.\nNevertheless, the following three data-backed correlations provide a historic glimpse of what to expect in year two of Donald Trump's presidency.\nThe second-priciest stock market in 155 years\nThe first historical marker deserving of attention is the time-tested Shiller Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, which is also known as the Cyclically Adjusted P/E Ratio, or CAPE Ratio. The S&P 500's Shiller P/E is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous 10 years and has been back-tested to January 1871.\nThis valuation yardstick is particularly useful in determining the relative cheapness or priciness of Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500. Whereas the Shiller P/E has averaged 17.34 over the last 155 years, it ended the Feb. 11 trading session at 40.35. This is the second-priciest stock market in history, trailing only the dot-com era.\nHistory tells us that CAPE Ratios above 30 signal trouble for stocks. The previous five times the Shiller P/E has topped 30 during a continuous bull market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite eventually shed 20% or more of their value. While the timing of this downturn is anyone's guess, the Shiller P/E has made clear that extended valuations aren't well-tolerated on Wall Street.\nNext-big-thing innovations have a checkered past\nA second historically correlated event that builds on the Shiller P/E discussion has to do with the nature of next-big-thing technologies. For more than three decades, every game-changing technological innovation has endured a bubble-bursting event.\nThe reason bubbles form is that investors overestimate the early stage adoption and/or optimizat"

No clean moonshot, no total meltdown \u2013 more like a nervous, choppy zone where every ECB headline and macro data print can flip the script. German bulls and bears are locked in a tight battle, and the index is hovering around important zones that could either trigger a fresh breakout or a nasty shakeout. For now, think cautious optimism with a big side of event risk.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh DAX 40 breakdowns from top YouTube traders\n- Scroll the latest German stock hype and chart shots on Instagram\n- Swipe through viral DAX trading setups on TikTok\nThe Story: What is really driving the DAX 40 right now? It is not just one thing. It is a messy cocktail of ECB policy, euro moves, German macro data, and a brutal tug-of-war between old economy laggards and modern German tech and industrial champions.\n1. ECB Policy: Christine Lagarde holding the steering wheel\nThe European Central Bank is the main puppet master behind European risk assets, and the DAX is one of the purest ECB plays on the planet. After a long, aggressive tightening cycle to fight inflation, the market is now obsessed with one question: how fast, and how deep, will the rate cuts go?\nEvery press conference, every line from Christine Lagarde is dissected by traders. If the ECB leans more dovish, German blue chips typically benefit: lower rates mean cheaper financing for exporters, a softer euro can make German products more competitive abroad, and equity valuations get some breathing room as bond yields cool down. If the tone flips more hawkish because inflation is proving sticky, risk assets can see a sharp risk-off reaction.\nThe twist: unlike the US, the euro area is struggling with weak growth at the same time as inflation headaches. That puts the ECB in a classic policy trap. Cut too slowly, and Europe stays stuck in stagnation. Cut too fast, and inflation could flare up again. The DAX 40 is trading exactly in that tension zone. That is why moves can look indecisive: sharp green days when cut hopes rise, followed by cautious red sessions on any reminder that the ECB cannot go full turbo just yet.\n2. Euro vs. US Dollar: FX is the silent driver of German stocks\nIf you are trading the DAX and not watching EUR/USD, you are flying half blind. A weaker euro tends to be a tailwind for the index because so many DAX heavyweights are exporters: industrial machinery, autos, chemicals, and tech services like SAP. Their revenues in dollars and other currencies look better when translated back into euros.\nWhen EUR/USD drifts lower, markets often start whispering that Europe is cheap and export-strong, and we can see a supportive undertone under German equities. When the euro rips higher, DAX bulls get a bit nervous: foreign revenue looks smaller in euro terms, and it can pressure margins and competitiveness.\nRight now, EUR/USD is stuck in a messy mid-range zone \u2013 not a total collapse, not a euphoric rally \u2013 which mirrors the DAX 40 vibe: no extreme panic, no full-throttle greed. Instead, you have rotational flows, selective stock picking, and a market that can flip direction quickly on any surprise from the Fed or the ECB. This is the kind of environment where active traders can thrive, but passive FOMO entries without risk management can get punished.\n3. The Macro Backdrop: Germany\u2019s growth hangover\nGermany has gone from the unstoppable export machine of Europe to the \u201cproblem child\u201d of the eurozone narrative. And that shows up clearly in the data that DAX traders obsess over:\n- "

Strip away the noise and you get four core forces: ECB policy, the EUR/USD chess game, German industry weakness, and global risk appetite.\n1. ECB Policy \u2013 Christine Lagarde vs. the Slowdown\nThe European Central Bank is stuck in one of the toughest balancing acts in years. Inflation has cooled compared to the peak, but it is not gone. Growth in Germany \u2013 the DAX\u2019s home turf \u2013 is fragile, with repeated warning signals from manufacturing and business confidence surveys.\nThat leaves the ECB walking a narrow path:\n- Cut too aggressively: the euro can weaken, importing inflation and signaling panic about growth.\n- Stay too tight for too long: the economy risks a deeper slowdown and equity markets start to price in an earnings hit.\nFor DAX traders, every ECB press conference is now a volatility event. When Lagarde hints at patience and data-dependence, DAX bulls often try to push for a relief move, betting that lower yields and a supportive central bank will eventually drip-feed liquidity into equities. When the tone shifts more hawkish, you see quick profit-taking as traders assume funding costs stay elevated and cyclical German names remain under pressure.\n2. EUR/USD \u2013 The Invisible Hand Behind the DAX\nGlobal traders underestimate how much the euro\u2019s level vs. the dollar impacts the DAX:\n- A softer euro: tends to support German exporters, as their products become more competitive globally and foreign revenues translate more attractively back into euros.\n- A stronger euro: compresses export margins and can chill enthusiasm for export-heavy sectors like autos, industrials, and machinery.\nThe current environment is a tug-of-war. US yields, Fed policy expectations, and global risk sentiment drive EUR/USD. When the dollar flexes, DAX bulls suddenly have to fight two fronts: weaker US risk appetite and a currency headwind. When the euro softens, you often see a short-term tailwind for big exporters, which can help the index stage a green rally even without spectacular domestic data.\nIn simple terms: if you are trading the DAX 40 and ignoring EUR/USD, you are playing the game with one eye closed.\n3. Earnings and Narrative \u2013 From Blue Chips to Bottom Lines\nOn CNBC Europe and other major outlets, the recurring themes are clear: German growth concerns, corporate cost-cutting, and cautious guidance. Yet, not all DAX names are equal. Some sectors are quietly holding the index up while others are dragging sentiment down.\nDeep Dive Analysis: This is where the real story is written: autos vs. tech/industrials, and energy vs. manufacturing.\n1. The German Automotive Sector \u2013 From Global Kings to Question Mark\nThe classic DAX backbone \u2013 Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz \u2013 is stuck in a structural identity crisis.\nHeadwinds are stacking up:\n- EV Transition Costs: Massive investment in electric platforms and software, while legacy combustion models still dominate profit pool"

ECB Policy: Why Christine Lagarde Still Owns the DAX Narrative\nThe European Central Bank is still the main puppet master here. Every press conference, every Q&A session with Christine Lagarde, every subtle change in guidance moves European yields and, by extension, German equities.\nThe market is stuck between two competing stories:\n- Story A \u2013 The Dove Pivot: Growth is weak, Germany is flirting with stagnation, and inflation is cooling. That gives the ECB room to lean more dovish over time. For the DAX, that means lower discount rates, a friendlier backdrop for big exporters and growth names, and support for valuations.\n- Story B \u2013 The Stubborn Hawk: Core inflation remains sticky, and the ECB fears losing credibility. If Lagarde keeps rates restrictive for longer, credit stays tight, domestic demand stays sluggish, and cyclical German stocks suffer.\nRight now, traders are treating every ECB meeting as a potential volatility event. When the tone is slightly softer than feared, the DAX experiences a strong relief move. When the tone is colder and more hawkish than expected, we see sharp risk?off waves, with banks and cyclicals taking the hit first.\n2. Euro/USD: The FX Lever on German Equities\nIf you are trading the DAX and not watching EUR/USD, you are flying half blind. A softer Euro tends to be a hidden tailwind for the index, because German giants like BMW, Mercedes, Siemens and SAP earn heavily in dollars and other foreign currencies. A weaker Euro makes their exports more competitive and their foreign revenues more valuable when translated back into Euros.\nWhen the Euro starts sliding, you often see German exporters outperform, and the DAX behaves like a stealth \u201cshort Euro / long Germany\u201d proxy. When the Euro strengthens aggressively, especially on any surprisingly hawkish ECB message, it can be a drag on export?heavy DAX names and cap index rallies.\nRight now, the FX market is basically asking: who blinks first, the Fed or the ECB? That battle defines whether the Euro drifts lower, offering a supportive backdrop to the DAX, or pushes higher, creating another headwind just as the German economy is trying to stabilize.\n3. Sector Check: Autos Under Pressure vs. SAP and Siemens Holding the Fort\nThe DAX is not a monolith. Under the hood, there is a brutal tug?of?war between sectors in structural stress and sectors riding secular tailwinds.\nGerman Auto Industry: The Classic Bulls Are Tired\nVolkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes are facing a multi?front war:\n- "

                "body": "Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) shareholders have seen the share price descend 21% over the month. On the other hand the returns over the last half decade have not been bad. It's good to see the share price is up 65% in that time, better than its market return of 64%.\nWhile this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Nasdaq achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 11% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nWe know that Nasdaq has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Nasdaq will grow revenue in the future.\nWhat About Dividends?\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Nasdaq the TSR over the last 5 years was 77%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nA Different Perspective\nWhile the broader market gained around 12% in the last year, Nasdaq shareholders lost 0.6% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 12% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Nasdaq better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Nasdaq that you should be aware of before investing here."

Anti-vaccine activists and likeminded doctors are petitioning the high court to take up their cases, in hopes that favorable opinions would make it easier for them to communicate their advice to patients and the public without threat of sanctions from medical boards. | Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\nDoctors who give health advice to their patients or community that runs counter to the medical establishment face a rare but very real risk of state sanctions, including losing their license to practice.\nThat could soon change if anti-vaccine activists succeed in getting the Supreme Court to weigh in on how broadly the First Amendment protects doctors\u2019 rights to free speech \u2014 an issue that is central to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Make America Healthy Again movement.\nThe effort, focused on two court cases that began in California and Washington, is happening in tandem with new challenges to state vaccine mandates, illustrating the anti-vaccination movement\u2019s wide-ranging strategy of pursuing its policy goals across all branches and levels of government.\n\u201cThis is a part of a judicial assault on science and public health that basically weaponizes the Covid-19 pandemic for political and ideological benefit,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, a public health lawyer at Georgetown University. \u201cWhat the court is being asked to do and what it may very well do is overturn over a century of established Supreme Court precedent, which will be deeply harmful for the ability of public health to protect the public from major health threats. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how harmful it is.\u201d\nBut Leslie Manookian, whose nonprofit Health Freedom Defense Fund has asked the court to review its pandemic-era challenge to Covid vaccine mandates, said she thinks the courts are more willing now to account for the lingering frustration over Covid-era policies some Americans believe violated their personal freedoms.\n\u201cThey say that politics is downstream from culture,\u201d Manookian said. \u201cWell, I think that, very often, the courts are downstream from culture as well.\u201d\nA Supreme Court decision in favor of broad speech protections for physicians could have far-reaching implications, possibly bolstering Kennedy\u2019s efforts to dismantle long-established public health practices by permitting doctors to speak more freely with patients and to the public about approaches to health care that are outside the mainstream. This includes whether to recommend vaccination.\nSince he took the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services last February, Kennedy has overhauled longstanding vaccine advisory bodies, downgraded childhood vaccine recommendations with scant evidence, promoted alternative and unproven therapies for measles and canceled scores of research grants.\nHe and his allies have disparaged medical societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics and defended doctors whom state medical boards reprimanded for promoting treatments \u2014 like alternative childhood vaccine schedules or ivermectin for Covid infections \u2014 that buck the standard of care.\nThe cases\nIn the coming months, the court is expected to decide whether to take up two cases focused on doctors\u2019 freedom of speech rights; Kennedy was involved in earlier iterations of the lawsuits before entering government. Both center on doctors who were accused by blue states of spreading misinformation about Covid-19 prevention and treatment.\nA third case involving a licensed counselor in Colorado who challenged the state\u2019s law banning so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ patients is actively being considered by the Supreme Court in another lawsuit, Chiles v. Salazar. A majority of justices seemed inclined to strike down the law during oral arguments in October.\nRick "

                "body": "On February 7, 2026, Homer \"Red\" S. Dietz, passed away peacefully at his home in Columbia, PA. He was 88 years old. Homer leaves behind a legacy of love, compassion, community involvement, and hard-working ethics.\nBorn on October 3, 1937 in Columbia, PA, he was one of three children born to Clinton and Lois (Newcomer) Dietz. In 1955, Homer graduated from Kutztown Area High School, and later attended Stevens Technical School for Masonry Construction, graduating in 1958. Soon after, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and proudly served from 1959-1962. Following his service, Homer worked part time doing Masonry Construction for 20 years and full time for Lancaster School District for 34 years as a custodian, retiring in 2007.\nHomer married MaryAnn Musselman on October 1, 1966. As a man of great faith, Homer was a longtime member of St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church. He loved singing in the church choir but was often heard singing and humming outside of church, too. Homer was very involved with the Meals on Wheels program at church and devoted many years helping those in need.\nHomer loved spending time on his back patio feeding and watching the neighbor-hood birds. He had a lifelong love of gardening, growing tomatoes, peppers, yams, snap peas, eggplant and red beets. He was especially known for making \"the BEST\" sauerkraut.\nHomer was a loyal fan of the Boston Red Sox, Celtics and Bruins, and was often heard giving the players advice from his recliner at home. Together, Homer and MaryAnn supported their children and grandchildren's sporting endeavors by attending countless soccer, softball, football and baseball games in rain or shine. One of his favorite family activities was playing a strategic game of Yahtzee.\nHomer is survived by his beloved spouse of 59 years, MaryAnn, and their 2 children: Jodi L. Johnson (Eric) of East Berlin, PA, and Carl \"Duffy\" Dietz (Brandy) of Colorado Springs, CO. His family brought him immeasurable happiness, and he found great joy in being a grandparent to: Megan Peachey (Brandon), Samuel Johnson, Brianna Dietz, Madison Dietz, and Colton Dietz, as well as his two great-grandchildren: Eloise and Beckett Peachey. Homer also leaves behind his sister, Shirley Shimmel. He was preceded in death by his sister Audrey Sellers, and his brother Bruce Dietz.\nFamily and friends are invited to celebrate Homer's life at a memorial service being held on February 20, 2026, at St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, 616 Locust St., Columbia, PA. Service is at 11 AM. Interment will be private and at the convenience of the family. All are invited to a reception following the service.\nIn lieu of flowers, and to honor his spirit of service and love, Homer and his family have requested that all memorial contributions and donations be made to the Meals on Wheels program at St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, P.O. Box 391, Columbia, PA 17512. To send an online condolence, please visit:"

                "body": "Japan's economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the previous three months, narrowly avoiding a technical recession.\nWhile it was a reversal of the 0.7% contraction in the third quarter, the gross domestic product missed expectations of a 0.4% expansion by economists polled by Reuters.\nA technical recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.\nOn an annualized basis, output rose 0.2%, compared with forecasts of 1.6%, following a 2.3% decline in the previous quarter.\nCompared with a year earlier, fourth-quarter GDP expanded 0.1%, slowing from 0.6% in the third quarter. Private consumption drove the modest expansion, offsetting weakness in exports and public spending, according to data from Japan's Cabinet Office.\nFollowing the data release, the Nikkei 225 opened up 0.12%, but the yen weakened 0.25% to 153.06 against the dollar.\nThe Bank of Japan in January raised its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 to 0.9% from 0.7%. It also lifted its fiscal 2026 outlook to 1% from 0.7%.\nThe central bank said it expects moderate expansion as other countries return to growth. The BOJ also said it sees a virtuous cycle of rising prices and wages, supported by the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions.\nThe data also comes as Japan works with the U.S., its second-largest trading partner, on a $550 billion investment pledge under its trade deal with Washington.\nPublic broadcaster NHK reported last Friday that Tokyo and Washington have yet to agree on the first projects tied to the pledge.\nJapan Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa was quoted as saying he hoped the initial projects would be finalized before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi meets U.S. President Donald Trump.\nTrump had announced the meeting with Takaichi just before the Feb. 8 Lower House election, which saw Takaichi lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory.\nAfter her victory, Takaichi said last Monday that she would support economic growth by boosting investment through \"proactive\" fiscal policy, although she did not elaborate.\nShe had earlier pledged to suspend food taxes for two years and boost defence spending to 2% of the country's GDP.\nDefense will be the next major catalyst driving Japanese equities higher, said Bruce Kirk, Chief Japan Equity Strategist and managing director at Goldman Sachs.\nSpeaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" Kirk pointed to Takaichi's upcoming meeting with Trump, saying he expects a \"flurry of announcements\" involving Japanese and U.S. companies across areas such as industrialization, factory automation, and shipbuilding.\nKirk also highlighted a document released by the Trump administration over the weekend that called for the restoration of U.S. maritime dominance and touted cooperation with Japan and South Korea in revitalizing shipbuilding.\nBefore the election, Takaichi had announced a record 122 trillion yen budget for the fiscal year starting April 1, marking a second straight year of record spending and vowing to support households with cost-of-living pressures.\nJapan's inflation had slowed sharply to 2.1% in January, its lowest level since March 2022. Still, prices have remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 45 consecutive months.\n\u2014 CNBC's Martin Soong contributed to this report."

Treasury yields fell, led by the 2-year, as futures markets penciled in multiple cuts over the next year or so. In Japan, the election result eased near-term uncertainty and helped the Nikkei, while the yen and Japanese government bonds held firmer than they might have otherwise. But Japan\u2019s economy is still barely growing, which helps explain why investors aren\u2019t fully buyi..\nng a quick Bank of Japan hike.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rates are still calling the tune.\nFX can swing quickly when inflation data changes the expected path for interest rates. This time, lower Treasury yields did most of the work, pulling the dollar down and supporting the yen while also boosting risk appetite for Japanese equities. Thin holiday liquidity in parts of Asia and the US can exaggerate these moves, so prices may look more dramatic than the underlying news.\nThe bigger picture: Japan needs growth to reset the yen\u2019s story.\nWithout stronger domestic growth, Japan may struggle to sustain a meaningfully stronger currency on its own \u2013 even if the Bank of Japan nudges rates higher. Some strategists still expect the yen to strengthen over time, but they also warn it could keep behaving like a \u201cfunding currency\u201d unless Japan\u2019s rate path turns decisively more hawkish. And Switzerland\u2019s recent franc pullback is a reminder that even safe-haven currencies can run into central-bank pushback when strength threatens inflation goals.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
