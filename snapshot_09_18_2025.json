                "body": "Gold Price Breaks US$3,700, Then Falls as Fed Cuts Rates\nThe Fed made a 25 basis point cut to its benchmark interest rate amid rising inflation, slowing jobs growth and tariff impacts.\nThe US Federal Reserve held its sixth meeting of 2025 from Tuesday (September 16) to Wednesday (September 17) amid slowing growth in the country's jobs market.\nThe central bank met analysts\u2019 expectations by lowering the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to the 4 to 4.25 percent range. It marks the first cut of 2025, after holding at the 4.25 to 4.5 percent range since December 2024.\nDespite August consumer price index (CPI) data showing inflation rose to 2.9 percent from 2.7 percent in July, a weakening labor market became the focus of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.\n\u201cThe case for a persistent inflation outbreak is less, and that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s time for us to acknowledge the risks to the other mandate have grown, and we should move in the direction of neutral,\u201d said Chair Jerome Powell.\nThe most recent US jobs report indicates that August brought an increase of just 22,000 new workers, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent in July. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produced the report, announced a downward revision to June\u2019s figures, showing a loss of 13,000 jobs.\nSimilarly, July\u2019s report, released on August 1, marked a significant weakening in the labor force, bringing the three month average to just 28,000 new jobs after growth of 192,000 in the February to April period.\nFollowing that report, US President Donald Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting the jobs data was \u201crigged\u201d to make his administration look bad. Both the slowing American labor market and rising inflation over the past few months have been blamed on the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs trickling into the economy.\nTrump has been critical of the Fed and Powell in particular, saying they haven't moved quickly enough to lower rates.\nWhile he is unable to remove Powell, in August Trump attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud stemming from mortgage applications where she listed two homes as principal residences. Recent documents have shown those allegations to be false, and that Cook listed one of the homes as a vacation property.\nOn Monday (September 15), an appeals court blocked Cook's removal from the Fed's Board of Governors, allowing her to participate in this week\u2019s meeting. Also this week, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran to the board in a 48 to 47 decision along party lines. He will be replacing Adriana Kugler, who resigned in August.\nMiran is on leave from his position at the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and increases Trump\u2019s influence over the seven member board. The nomination process for a new board member usually lasts months, but Miran\u2019s appointment took just six weeks, allowing him to participate in this week\u2019s meeting.\nThe gold price rose to a record high of US$3,707.34 per ounce shortly after the decision, but quickly fell back to the US$3,650 level. Silver spiked as high as US$42.24 per ounce following the meeting, still trading near 14 year highs.\nEquities were mixed on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (INDEXSP:INX) losing 0.31 percent to reach 6,586. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ:NDX) shed 1.03 percent to come in at 24,036, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX:DJI) gained 0.5 percent, coming to 45,084.\nDon't forget to follow us @INN_Resource for real-time updates!\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Dean Belder, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article."

                "source": "CBS News",

                "body": "Why the price of gold could hit $4,000 this September\nThe price of gold has risen significantly this year, following a remarkable surge from just the start of 2024. At that point, the price of gold per ounce was just $2,063.73. But as of Wednesday, the cost for the same amount of gold was a staggering $3,678.26. That's up almost 80% in just over 18 months, approximately.\nAnd the price surge may not even be over. After moving past $3,600 per ounce earlier this month \u2013 the latest in a series of record-breaking movements \u2013 there's a strong possibility that the price could soon break the $4,000 mark. While this could be good for investors who already have a portion of gold in their portfolio, it should be the motivation for beginners and others who have yet to get started to take action now, before they're priced out of the market entirely.\nTo better understand the motivation for acting promptly, then, it helps to understand the current dynamics that could push the price of gold past $4,000 per ounce, perhaps as soon as this September. Below, we'll examine three influencing factors investors should evaluate now.\nStart exploring your top gold investing options here.\nWhy the price of gold could hit $4,000 this September\nThere are three primary reasons why the gold price could continue to surge this month, potentially even past the $4,000 per-ounce mark. Here's what to consider:\nInterest rate cuts could impact the market\nWhen interest rate cuts are issued, they often cause the price of gold to increase. This tends to make gold a more attractive investment option than those with diminished returns, causing investors to flock to the precious metal, causing the price to rise with it. This cause-and-effect isn't always a sure thing, as gold has risen in price in recent years alongside both interest rate cuts and hikes. But if the Federal Reserve issues another rate cut this month, as widely expected, gold prices could respond by rising a bit closer to the $4,000 per ounce mark and, depending on how the market reacts, soon pass it to another new record.\nGet invested in gold before the price rises again here.\nInflation is heading upward\nA rising inflation rate tends to cause the price of gold to rise. And the latest inflation reading for August, released earlier this month, showed inflation headed upward. Now at a rate of 2.9%, inflation is almost a full percentage point above the Federal Reserve's 2% goal. In this climate, when inflation erodes the purchasing power of the dollar, investors tend to move toward assets that can maintain or even grow in value. That renewed interest often helps gold's price to rise, which could cause it to break through the $4,000 per ounce mark this month, thanks to its historic ability to hedge against inflation.\nMarket uncertainty could cause renewed interest in safe-haven assets\nThe economy is hard to predict right now. The unemployment and inflation rates are up again. But stock market performance is strong. And rates on mortgages and some other products are declining again. Against this market uncertainty, the price of gold could rise again as investors move toward safe-haven assets, of which gold is one of the more conventional ones. All it will take is movement in one of these areas to cause gold's price to surge once again. So, if you know you need the benefits and portfolio protections gold has historically offered, it makes sense to take action promptly.\nThe bottom line\nThe conditions are right for the price of gold to not only rise but for it to grow to a new record level of $4,000 per ounce. While predicting the future price of any asset is inherently difficult to do, recent movements with this asset and the consistently rising price over the past few years make this a somewhat more secure prediction. If you want the hedge against inflation and portfolio diversification that gold can offer, then, consider exploring your gold investment options now. The price may hit the $4,000 per mark even sooner"

                "body": "Gold futures experienced a notable decline in trading today, settling $32.90 lower at $3,694.60, representing a 0.88% decrease from the previous session. The precious metal's retreat came in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to implement a 25 basis point interest rate cut, a move that had been widely telegraphed by market participants and monetary policy observers.\nThe central bank's decision to reduce rates by a quarter percentage point aligned closely with prevailing market expectations, with much of the anticipated policy shift already reflected in gold pricing ahead of the announcement. However, the metal's trajectory shifted following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent commentary, which prompted traders to reassess their positioning despite gold briefly touching a new intraday record immediately after the rate decision was announced.\nForward Guidance Signals Continued Accommodation\nThe Fed's updated dot plot projections provide valuable insight into the central bank's policy trajectory for the remainder of the year. The revised forecasts indicate that policymakers anticipate implementing rate cuts at each of the two remaining Federal Open Market Committee meetings scheduled for this year, suggesting a continuation of the current accommodative monetary stance.\nThis forward guidance carries significant implications for gold's near-term prospects. Historical precedent demonstrates that precious metals often benefit from extended periods of monetary accommodation, as lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets while simultaneously supporting inflationary pressures that enhance gold's appeal as a store of value.\nTechnical Outlook Remains Constructive\nDespite today's pullback, the fundamental drivers supporting gold's recent strength remain intact. Current analytical models suggest that the precious metal retains considerable upside potential, with projections indicating that gold could reach $3,880 by year-end if the Federal Reserve follows through on its signaled policy path.\nThe convergence of continued monetary accommodation, persistent inflationary pressures, and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties creates a supportive environment for gold's continued appreciation. While short-term volatility remains likely as markets digest policy developments and economic data, the longer-term outlook for the precious metal appears favorable under current conditions.\nToday's decline may therefore represent a technical consolidation following gold's recent surge to record highs, rather than a fundamental shift in the metal's underlying trajectory. Investors and traders will likely focus on upcoming economic indicators and Fed communications to gauge whether the central bank maintains its current dovish bias in the months ahead.\nFor those that would like more information about our services click here\nWishing you as always good trading,"

The actual number came in at a decrease of 9.285 million barrels, a stark contrast to the forecasted increase of 1.400 million barrels.\nThis sharp decline in crude inventories implies a stronger demand for crude oil, which is bullish for crude prices according to the EIA\u2019s analysis. The forecasted figure was based on the assumption that the inventory levels would rise, indicating weaker demand. However, the actual data has defied these expectations, potentially signaling a shift in the market dynamics.\nComparing the actual figure to the previous week\u2019s data, the reduction in inventories is even more significant. The previous week saw an increase of 3.939 million barrels in the crude oil inventories. The current week\u2019s decrease of 9.285 million barrels not only reverses the previous week\u2019s increase but also suggests a substantial surge in demand.\nThe level of inventories is a crucial factor influencing the price of petroleum products. As such, this unexpected drop in crude oil inventories could have a ripple effect on inflation. If the demand continues to outstrip supply, it could lead to an increase in the price of petroleum products, thereby exerting upward pressure on inflation.\nGiven the importance of this data, market participants will be closely monitoring the crude oil price trends in the coming weeks. If the inventory levels continue to decline at this rate, it could signal a sustained increase in demand, which would be a positive development for the crude oil market. However, it\u2019s equally important to consider other factors, such as global economic conditions and oil production levels, which also play a key role in determining crude oil prices.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The US Dollar (USD) trades flat against the Euro (EUR) following its plunge to a three-and-a-half-year low as traders assess the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) rhetoric on further interest rate cuts. Traders await the speech from the European Central Bank (ECB) Christine Lagarde later on Thursday.\nThe Fed reduced rates by 25 basis points (bps) at its September meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected, and signaled it will steadily lower borrowing costs for the rest of this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell outlined the recent policy decision as a risk-management reduction in reaction to the weak labor market but stressed that the US central bank does not need to rush easing.\nPowell said that the rate-path views are not commitments, adding that higher inflation is still a risk and the Fed is now in a \"meeting-by-meeting situation\" when it comes to further rate cuts. Less dovish than expected remarks from Powell could provide some support to the Greenback in the near term.\nAcross the pond, the latest inflation figures had supported the ECB\u2019s decision to hold rates unchanged at the latest meeting. Rising expectations that the ECB is done cutting rates could underpin the shared currency against the USD. ECB Governing Council members Martins Kazaks and Gediminas Simkus said on Tuesday that interest rates don\u2019t need to be cut further right now, though neither of them ruled out an eventual move. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Wednesday that the current interest rate is appropriate based on inflation developments and the transmission of monetary policy.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Eu"

With the Fed moving to make its first rate cut in nine months, investors are immediately moving the goalposts to focus on how many rate cuts the Fed is expected to deliver through the remainder of 2025.\nThe Fed's Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) also showed Fed officials expect further Fed rate moves looking forward. According to the dot plot, the majority of Fed policymakers expect interest rates to land somewhere around 3.5-3.75% by year's end, paving the way for two additional rate trims through December.\nEUR/USD lurched into fresh highs on reaction, clawing toward 1.1900 and vaulting into four-year highs.\nmore to come...\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar."

                "body": "EUR/USD Update: The Euro Pauses Its Bullish Momentum Ahead of the FOMC Decision\nThe day of the Federal Reserve has arrived, bringing with it a pause in EUR/USD movements, as the pair records a short-term decline of around 0.23%. The pair has entered a neutral bias, as investors wait closely for the comments that will follow the U.S. central bank\u2019s policy decision. These remarks could act as the main catalyst for the pair\u2019s next moves. If the Fed reinforces the need to keep interest rates lower, buying pressure on the euro, which had stalled in recent sessions, could regain relevance in the coming days.\nFed Decision Day\nAt 2:00 p.m. ET today, the Fed will release its official rate decision, with the market pricing in more than a 90% probability of a 0.25% cut, lowering the reference rate from 4.5% to 4.25%, according to the CME Fed Watch Tool. However, the most important event will be the press conference with Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. ET, where he will explain the reasons behind the decision and, more importantly, provide guidance on whether this cut will be the start of a cycle of reductions that could extend through year-end.\nThe key focus will be on inflation, as the annual CPI has shown steady growth in recent months. It was 2.3% in April and rose to 2.9% in August, moving further away from the Fed\u2019s 2% target. This uptick raises doubts: will the Fed interpret it as a risk strong enough to slow the pace of cuts? If the central bank prioritizes controlling inflation, it could soften its message and adopt a more neutral stance in upcoming decisions. Such a shift would immediately affect confidence in the dollar and, consequently, could begin to weigh on the bullish momentum that EUR/USD has maintained in recent months.\nSource: TRADINGECONOMICS\nThe expectation of lower rates has already weakened the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. The DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s performance against a basket of currencies, continues to show a steady downtrend, approaching 96 points, a level corresponding to its yearly lows. So far, there are no clear signs of a reversal, and this ongoing loss of confidence in the dollar has consistently favored the euro, which has gained ground steadily in recent months.\nSource: TRADINGECONOMICS\nGiven this, the market remains on edge about the Fed\u2019s direction. In one scenario, if it confirms a policy of successive cuts, the dollar could continue losing appeal, boosting the euro and maintaining buying pressure in EUR/USD. In another scenario, if inflation data weigh more heavily on the decision and a pause in cuts is mentioned, the dollar could regain confidence, which would pose a risk to the euro\u2019s recent bullish trend.\nWhat Does the European Central Bank Think?\nMeanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) maintains a clearly neutral stance. The ECB Watch tool shows a 97.3% probability that the deposit rate will remain at 2% at the October 28 meeting, unchanged. This highlights a key divergence compared to the Fed\u2019s stance, which seems headed toward more cuts.\nSource: ECBWATCH\nThis difference in perspectives between the two central banks could benefit the euro in the short term. If the U.S. cuts rates while Europe holds steady, the differential would narrow, increasing the appeal of euro-denominated assets relative to those in dollars. As a result, this divergence in policies could become a key catalyst for EUR/USD to sustain buying pressure in the short term.\nEUR/USD Technical Forecast\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend remains intact: Since early March, EUR/USD has shown a solid bullish structure, with no clear signs of a major correction so far. As long as buying pressure persists, the pair could once again move toward the 1.2000 area in the short term.\n- RSI: The RSI remains in positive territory, with readings above 50, indicating that bullish impulses have dominated the last 14 sessions. This behavior suggests that buying pressure could intensify in the near term.\n- MACD: The MACD histogram co"

In reality, a delayed reaction to the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decision on Wednesday may be the largest source of volatility for GBP/USD, especially as tail risks that could have sparked another wave of dollar selling failed to eventuate.\nNear-Term Rates Path in Focus\nWhile not the tightest relationship, rate differentials have been influential on GBP/USD over the past month, especially at the front of the U.S. and U.K. curves. It\u2019s been the U.S. that has had the strongest influence, with market pricing for Fed rate cuts and two-year yield differentials maintaining a relatively strong correlation.\nTherefore, if you\u2019re looking for clues on what to watch from a fundamental perspective when trading GBP/USD, information that could influence the near-term rate outlook appears key.\nBoE Hold with a Side of Slower QT\nThere\u2019s been plenty of fresh information on both sides of the Atlantic that could influence the path for policy rates, including inflation and labour market data in the U.K. However, the mixed reads have failed to budge what\u2019s been a solid view that the bank rate is likely to remain unchanged at 4% over the remainder of 2025. Swaps markets have only 7 basis points priced by the BoE\u2019s December meeting, with a full 25-basis-point cut not baked in until April 2026.\nSource: Bloomberg\nWith no fresh forecasts from the bank until November, unless the BoE drops a huge surprise by adjusting the bank rate at Thursday\u2019s meeting, it will be left up to the monetary policy statement, including the vote, along with Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s post-meeting press conference to generate volatility.\nOn the vote, it must be remembered the MPC split 5-4 last meeting in favour of reducing the bank rate, requiring a second vote to seal the deal. If we see a decent proportion of the committee vote for another reduction at this meeting (two votes are expected), it may lead to a dovish repricing at the front of the gilt curve, weighing on GBP/USD. If unanimous for a hold, the opposite will likely apply.\nOn the gilt market, with longer tenors flapping around like a windsock on a gusty day at Heathrow given the U.K.\u2019s perilous fiscal situation, it\u2019s widely expected the BoE will slow the pace of its quantitative tightening program. If it doesn\u2019t, it may actually weigh on GBP/USD despite being a hawkish signal, likely pressuring the long end of the gilt curve.\nSting in the Tail from the Fed?\nWhile the BoE will be in focus, I\u2019m interested to see whether we see an extension of the moves seen following the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Considering the median Fed policymaker continues to favour a less aggressive easing cycle than markets have priced in, it was surprising there wasn\u2019t more of a reaction in the USD and Treasury market.\nOutside of Stephen Miran\u2019s (likely) wild forecast for the funds rate to end the year 150bp lower, which would require a significant left-tail risk for the economy to actually play out, some of the most acute concerns surrounding Fed independence failed to materialise. Waller and Bowman\u2014who were appointed by Donald Trump during his first term in office\u2014both voted for a 25-basis-point cut, failing to dissent like the July meeting. Nor was there a meaningful shift lower in the median Fed funds profile, with just one additional cut added in 2025 and none in 2026. The nominal neutral rate remained at 3%.\nUnless you believe Trump will make an imminent announcement about a replacement for Jerome Powell who will be able to convince the remaining FOMC to"

This volatility comes amid diverging central bank actions, with the BoE widely expected to maintain its key interest rate today, following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut borrowing costs for the first time since December.\nThe pair briefly surged above the upper Bollinger Band but failed to secure a daily close above it, indicating potential exhaustion in bullish momentum. The immediate support level at 1.3585 is now in focus. A break below this could expose the mid-Bollinger Band at 1.3525, followed by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at 1.3465, both of which may act as buffers against further downside.\nOn the upside, a rebound from 1.3585 could re-ignite bullish interest, targeting the recent four-year high of 1.3788. However, the July 2021 peak at 1.4000 remains a significant resistance level and may prove difficult to overcome without a strong catalyst.\nMomentum indicators suggest a weakening bullish bias. The RSI is trending lower but remains above the neutral 50 threshold, while the stochastic oscillator has formed a bearish crossover in the overbought zone, reinforcing the likelihood of a near-term pullback.\nSummarizing, GBPUSD retains a bullish undertone in the broader trend, but the failure to close above key resistance and emerging bearish signals from momentum indicators suggest caution.

A hotter print would strengthen expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will hold its rate at 4%. Core CPI has eased slightly to 3.6%, but this aligns with BoE projections. A Reuters poll suggests that economists see at least one more cut before the end of 2025, but near-term data keeps the BoE in wait-and-see mode.\nFederal Reserve Set for First Cut Since December\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver a 25 bps cut, lowering the federal funds rate into the 4.00%\u20134.25% range. The CME FedWatch tool assigns nearly 100% probability to this move. However, some uncertainty remains: Fed Governor Stephen Miran, appointed by President Trump, has argued for a deeper 50 bps cut. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference and the updated dot plot will be critical in signaling whether markets should expect additional reductions in October and December.\nU.S. Data Flow Strengthens Dovish Bets\nUS Retail Sales for August surprised to the upside with a 0.6% MoM increase, beating expectations of 0.2%. Both Retail Sales Control Group and ex-Autos rose 0.7%, confirming strong consumer spending. Yet, housing data showed cracks: Housing Starts plunged 8.5% MoM to 1.307 million, their lowest since May, while Building Permits fell 3.7%. Labor market softness combined with retail strength complicates the Fed\u2019s decision, but dovish pricing remains dominant.\nMarket Positioning and Dollar Weakness\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) hovers near 96.70, weighed by expectations of an extended easing cycle. Markets are pricing up to 75\u2013100 bps of cuts by year-end. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank forecast 25 bps cuts at each Fed meeting in September, October, and December.

While the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% (seasonally adjusted), it has been trending higher since late 2022.\nThese figures are unlikely to trigger immediate easing from the RBA, but they reinforce the central bank\u2019s cautious tone. The AUD/USD dipped around 20 pips on the release, three-year yields fell 4.6 basis points, and the ASX ticked slightly higher \u2014 though still trades down 0.5% post-Fed.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) managed to lift off multi-week lows around 96.50, helped by another uneven session in US money markets.\nStubborn inflation keeps pressure on the RBA\nInflation in Australia is proving harder to tame than hoped. July\u2019s Monthly Consumer Price Index (Weighted Mean) jumped to 2.8% from 1.9% in June. At the same time, Q2 CPI rose 0.7% QoQ and 2.1% over the last twelve months\nThat stickiness explains the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) cautious tone. That said, policymakers remain reluctant to cut rates too aggressively while inflation is still running above comfort levels.\nAustralian economy shows surprising resilience\nDespite global uncertainty, the domestic economy is holding up better than expected. August\u2019s final Manufacturing PMI printed at 53.0, while Services reached 55.8, both in expansion territory.\nRetail sales climbed 1.2% in June, and July\u2019s trade surplus widened to A$7.3 billion. On the investment side, private capital expenditure in Q2 edged up 0.2%. GDP surprised to the upside as well, expanding 0.6% in the April-June period and 1.8% on a yearly basis.\nThe next big test comes with Thursday\u2019s labour market report for August, which will give investors a clearer read on hiring trends.\nRBA keeps it data-driven\nEarlier in September, the RBA trimmed the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3.60% and cut its 2025 growth forecast. Governor Michele Bullock pushed back against calls for deeper easing, emphasising that policy decisions will remain firmly data-dependent.\nMinutes from the latest meeting underscored this stance: The RBA could move faster if the labour market weakens, but if the economy stays resilient, it will take things more slowly.\nMarkets currently expect the OCR to remain unchanged at the September 30 meeting, though pricing still implies about 30 basis points of easing by year-end.\nChina\u2019s recovery remains the wild card\nAustralia\u2019s economic fortunes remain closely tied to China. Q2 GDP there grew 5.2% YoY, with industrial production up by the same margin. But retail sales missed expectations, posting a 3.4% annual growth in August.\nThe latest PMI readings were mixed: manufacturing slipped into contraction at 49.4, while services edged up to 50.3. Deflation worries also linger, with August CPI down 0.4% on the year.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) left Loan Prime Rates (LPR) unchanged in August, the One-Year at 3.00% and the Five-Year at 3.50%, and is expected to keep policy steady at this week\u2019s meeting.\nAUD/USD technical outlook: still range-bound\nAUD/USD continues to challenge its upper end of the consolidative range.\nOn the upside, resistance is defined by the 2025 ceiling at 0.6679 (September 16). If buyers manage to push through this level, the November 2024 peak at 0.6687 (November 7) comes into focus, with the psychological 0.7000 yardstick looming further ahead.\nOn the other hand, decent contention emerges at the August low at 0.6414 (August 21), prior to the key 200-day SMA at 0.6393 and the June trough at 0.6372 (June 23).\nIn addition, momentum signals remain on the positive side: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 66, pointing to further upside potential. Meanwhile, the Average Directional Index (ADX) around 21 suggests that the trend, though still modest, is starting to build momentum.\nAUD/USD daily chart\nShort-term outlook\nIn the near term, AUD/USD looks stuck in its familiar range. Breaking out convincingly would probably require one of three things: stronger data"

The future economic outlook remains cautious because of political uncertainty within Japan and challenges from international trade.\nSource: LSEG\nSource: LSEG\nThe value of the US dollar against the Japanese yen will mainly be affected by the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut. The Bank of Japan's meeting will also have an impact, but it will likely be less significant. However, if Governor Ueda says something unexpected, it could cause a major rise in the value of the yen, breaking its current trading range of 147 to 149.\nThe Anticipated Bank of Japan Policy Decision: Maintaining the Status Quo\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to keep its interest rate at 0.5% this week, a rate it has held since January. This cautious, \"wait-and-see\" approach is due to a few key reasons.\nFirst, there is political uncertainty in Japan, and the central bank wants to avoid making any sudden policy changes that could cause more economic instability. Second, the BOJ is still evaluating the full impact of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal and U.S. tariffs, which are hurting Japanese exports.\nInterestingly, the BOJ is prioritizing economic stability over controlling inflation, even though inflation is running high and outpacing wage growth. This difference between the central bank's policy and the domestic inflation reality could potentially lead to market problems in the future.\nForward-Looking Monetary Policy: The Outlook Beyond September\nThe market expects the Bank of Japan to keep its interest rate unchanged in September but believes they will start raising rates soon. Many traders think there's a strong chance of a rate hike before the end of 2025 and more hikes by the middle of next year.\nSource LSEG\nLooking at the implied rates based on LSEG data, we can see markets are pricing in around 50 bps of cuts through December 2026. Now this may not seem like a lot, but it is the BoJ we are talking about.\nSince no new forecasts will be released at the meeting, the market's reaction will depend entirely on what Governor Kazuo Ueda says at his press conference.\nThe Bank of Japan is known for its vague communication. If Governor Ueda continues to be vague, the market will likely have a small reaction. However, if he sounds surprisingly direct about future rate hikes, it would confirm the market's aggressive expectations. Because of this, his words could cause a large and sudden shift in the market.\nThe Dual-Central Bank Catalyst: Impact on USD/JPY\nThe value of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen is primarily driven by the U.S. Federal Reserve's policies. When investors expect the Fed to cut interest rates, the dollar typically falls against the yen. This is especially relevant this week, as a Fed rate cut has been delivered as expected.\nThe market generally expects the US to cut rates while Japan eventually raises them, a situation that would likely cause the dollar to weaken against the yen. While the Bank of Japan's decision is also important, its effect will be largely shaped by the Fed's actions. The Fed's influence on the currency pair is much stronger.\nGiven that market expectations are for 50 bps of rate cuts from the Fed before the year-end on top of the 25 bps delivered this week, the Yen could be poised for gains moving forward over the medium term.\nSource: Google Gemini\nTechnical Analysis USD/JPY\nUSD/JPY from a technical standpoint has been giving signs of a bullish rally, but the potential effects of rate differentials could come into play.\nOn a weekly timeframe, the long-term descending trendline had been broken a while ago and since then USD/JPY has been trapped in a range between 145.00 and 150.00 handle with a brief foray higher being met by swift selling pressure.\nThere is also an ascending trendline from the April lows ju"

The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by 25 bps to 4.00%\u20134.25%, with futures pricing in as much as 50 bps more easing before year-end, while the Bank of Japan debates further tightening. The pair\u2019s move below its 50-day EMA and the lowest daily close since late July underscore rising bearish momentum.\nFed Rate Cuts Narrow the U.S.\u2013Japan Yield Spread\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield slid to 4.02%, while the 5-year fell to 3.65%, pushing capital away from the dollar. A 25 bps cut on Wednesday is almost fully priced in, with the CME FedWatch tool showing a 96% probability, but a surprise 50 bps cut would accelerate downside for USD/JPY toward 145.00 or even 144.00. U.S. labor data has reinforced the case for easing: Nonfarm Payrolls revisions erased 919,000 jobs from the past year, while August payrolls showed only 22,000 additions and unemployment climbing to 4.3%. Trump\u2019s tariffs have further weakened hiring momentum, amplifying dollar vulnerability.\nJapan\u2019s Trade and Inflation Data Fuel BoJ Hawkish Bets\nJapanese exports fell 0.1% in August, extending weakness after July\u2019s -2.6%, with shipments to the U.S. down 13.8% and exports to China lower by 0.5%. Imports contracted 5.2%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand. Despite the trade softness, Japan\u2019s inflation remains at 3.1%, well above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. With core prices sticky, traders increasingly expect a 0.25% hike later this year, which would lift short-term rates from 0.50% to 0.75%. Such a shift would mark the first policy divergence in decades favoring the yen against a dovish Fed.\nTechnical Signals Point to 145\u2013144 as Key Downside Targets\nThe rejection of USD/JPY near 147.90, aligned with a Fair Value Gap, triggered renewed selling. The pair is now oscillating between 146.57 and 146.21, just above August\u2019s lows. Momentum indicators confirm the bearish tilt: the RSI continues to fall, and cumulative volume delta shows strong seller dominance since the reversal from 147.50. Breaking below 146.20 would expose 145.50 support, with a deeper slide toward 144.00 if U.S. yields retreat further.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both touched record highs, while gold extended its rally, reflecting a broader rotation away from the greenback. Against this backdrop, the yen has gained appeal as both a rate-differential and safe-haven play.

Key Japanese inflation data is also on tap.\nBroader Asian currencies steadied after gaining some ground this week, as growing conviction in lower U.S. interest rates dented the dollar.

The central bank also indicated that more cuts will come to stem any further weakness in the labor market.\nBut the central bank still offered a more balanced outlook on interest rates than what President Donald Trump has demanded, indicating that further easing will not be as aggressive as some market participants are hoping.\nChair Jerome Powell also flagged sustained caution over the economy, especially amid a cooling labor market and persistent inflationary risks.\nTrump\u2019s recently-approved pick for the Fed board of governors, Stephen Miran, was the only dissenting member in the central bank\u2019s 12-member rate-setting committee. Miran called for a 50 bps cut and presented an outlook for interest rates that factored in Trump\u2019s calls for aggressive loosening-- a scenario that other policymakers did not consider.\nBroader Asian currencies were a mixed bag. While the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates does bode well for the sector, increasing risks around the U.S. economy stand to hurt appetite for more risk-driven assets.\nSafe havens such as gold and the Japanese yen firmed on this notion.\nIn Asia, the Chinese yuan\u2019s USD/CNY pair rose 0.1%, with the yuan cooling mildly after racing to near 10-month highs on sustained policy support from Beijing.\nChina this week pledged to roll out more stimulus aimed at boosting private spending, after a series of dismal readings on the economy.\nThe New Zealand dollar was the worst performer among Asia-Pacific currencies, with the NZD/USD pair sinking 0.6% after gross domestic product data showed the New Zealand economy shrank in the second quarter.\nThe Australian dollar\u2019s AUD/USD pair fell 0.1% after rallying to 10-month highs.\nThe Indian rupee\u2019s USD/INR pair rose 0.3% but remained below 88 rupees, after hitting a series of record highs in September.\nThe South Korean won\u2019s USD/KRW pair rose 0.3%, while the Singapore dollar\u2019s USD/SGD pair rose 0.1%.\nWhich stocks should you consider in your very next trade?\nThe best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried amo"

This is the first interest rate cut since March and extends the stop-and-go interest rate cutting cycle that the BOC kicked off last June.\nIn its accompanying monetary policy statement, the BOC made the following tweaks:\n- Downgraded its assessment of the global economy, noting that its now showing signs of slowing under \u201csharply higher US tariffs and ongoing uncertainty.\u201d\n- Identified that \u201cinflation has picked up in recent months as tariffs are being passed on to consumers.\u201d\n- Downgraded the performance of the Canadian economy, citing declining business investment, restrained household spending, increasing slack in the economy, and more broad declines in in employment along with easing wage growth\n- Warned about the risks of tariffs driving uncertainty and raising inflationary risks for consumers\nIn his accompanying press conference, BOC Governor Tiff Macklem noted that there was a \u201cclear consensus\u201d to ease monetary policy. Within the committee, there was a \u201cclear sense that the balance of risks had changed\u201d but that the central bank is \u201cnot expecting a recession\u201d and is instead forecasting 1% growth in H2.\nOn balance, traders are viewing the press conference as (slightly) less dovish than expected, with the market-implied odds of another interest rate cut in October falling from 52% to 42%, though ultimately economic data and trade policy will be the primary factor that tips the scales for the BOC.\nCanadian Dollar Technical Analysis: USD/CAD Daily Chart\nSource: StoneX, TradingView\nIn the wake of the as-expected BOC decision, USD/CAD has seen choppy, low volatility trade in the mid-1.3700s. The pair is carving out a potential head-and-shoulders top formation over the last 6 weeks, though the lack of a meaningful uptrend heading into the pattern may lessen its significance.\nRegardless, the key support level for USD/CAD traders to monitor is at 1.3725, with a more neutral bias appropriate above that level and a break below that level potentially setting the stage for a quick drop the mid- or lower-1.3600s. Later today, the Federal Reserve will (in all likelihood) deliver a 25bps interest rate cut of its own, but depending on Jerome Powell and Company\u2019s outlook for further interest rate cuts, USD/CAD may yet see a big central bank reaction today.\n-- Written by Matt Weller, Global Head of Research\nCheck out Matt\u2019s Daily Market Update videos on YouTube and be sure to follow Matt on Twitter: @MWellerFX\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

Yesterday\u2019s soft inflation report, paired with the ugly jobs data earlier in the month, leaves little doubt about a 25 bp rate cut. Policymakers are also expected to signal that more easing could follow given the lack of meaningful growth.\nWTI oil moved within a 63.84-64.67 band, consolidating Tuesday\u2019s gains while traders weighed the fallout from the FOMC and the impact of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian facilities. Concerns over supply risks from Russia are being balanced by higher OPEC output. At home, Canadians will welcome a break at the pumps, with gas prices expected to fall as much as 10 cents per liter as the seasonal switch to winter blends kicks in.\nThe FOMC meeting promises some drama as it\u2019s the first with new governor Stephen Miran, a Trump loyalist, casting a vote. He might make a splash by calling for a 1.0% cut. Across the table, Lisa Cook\u2014fired by Trump, reinstated by the courts\u2014could channel her frustrations his way. In the end, none of it changes the fact that a 25 bp cut is already priced in.\nAsian markets slipped ahead of the decision. Japan\u2019s Topix dropped 0.71% and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 fell 0.67%, while upbeat chatter from the China/US meeting in Madrid lifted Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng by 1.78%.\nAs of 7:20 am EDT, European bourses have given back early gains and are in negative territory except for the FTSE 100 index which is up 0.21%. The German DAX is down 0.14%, and the CAC 40 has lost 0.31%. S&P 500 futures are flat. The US Dollar Index sits at 96.77 and the 10-year Treasury yield is 4.01%.\nEURUSD traded in a 1.1833-1.1873 range, consolidating the week\u2019s earlier gains. The pair is supported by heavy FOMC rate-cut speculation even as the ECB holds steady for now. Inflation in the Eurozone eased to 2.0% y/y from 2.1% in July.\nGBPUSD bounced inside a 1.3630-1.3660 band and sat mid-range in early New York dealing. UK inflation data was in line with forecasts but firm enough to lower the odds of BoE cuts this year.\nUSDJPY drifted in a 146.21-146.68 range. The tariff reduction to 15% that took effect yesterday has added pressure, giving the BoJ more space to lift rates. Narrowing spreads between US and Japanese yields weighed on the pair, while trade data out of Japan did little to shift sentiment.\nAUDUSD traded defensively in a 0.6666-0.6690 band, with pre-FOMC US dollar selling countering support from expectations the RBA will hold rates at 3.6% on September 30.\nUS Housing Starts and Building Permits reports are due."

                "body": "Most Read: Bank of Japan (BoJ) Meeting Preview: Maintaining the Status Quo. Implications for USD/JPY\nUSD/CAD is at a crossroads in many ways and the technicals are showing some interesting patterns. Given that both the Fed and BoC chose to cut rates today could the technicals lead the way in the weeks to come?\nThere is a possibility that the technicals could dominate for now but moving forward I expect the pace of rate cuts to come into play as well as the performance of Oil prices, which will impact the Canadian Dollar.\nTechnical Analysis - USD/CAD\nBack to the technicals though and following the trendline breakout at the end of July and rally to just above the 1.3900 mark, USD/CAD has been stuck in a range.\nWe do have the formation of a head and shoulder pattern which has now formed but price is bouncing higher at the time of writing.\nNow a break of the neckline at 1.3723 and candle close below could trigger a potential 200-pip selloff and retest of the 1.3500 psychological level.\nA bounce from here though will face resistance at the 1.3900 handle before the psychological 1.4000 handle comes into focus.\nThe 100-day MA is serving as support at present with the daily candle closing back above after a candle closed below the 100-day MA yesterday.\nLooking at the RSI and it is hovering below the 50 neutral level, a sign that bearish momentum is leading the way for now.\nSo will we get a break or bounce?\nUSD/CAD Daily Chart, September 18, 2025\nSource: TradingView.com (click to enlarge)\nFundamental Factors Ahead - Will Rate Differentials and Trade Agreements Play a Role?\nThe Bank of Canada cut its interest rate by a quarter of a percent today, which was widely expected. They didn't provide much information about what they plan to do in the future. The Bank of Canada's rate is now 2.50%, which is still much lower than the US Federal Reserve's rate is, following the Fed rate cut today.\nIt makes sense that the Bank of Canada is hesitant to promise more rate cuts right now. However, based on their overall view of the economy and inflation risks, it seems likely that this won't be the final rate cut in this cycle.\nHowever the Fed are still expected to cut rates more aggressively than the BoC over the next 12 months. According to the implied rates updated post FOMC and BoC meetings, markets are pricing in around 134.5 bps of rate cuts through September 2026, while for the BoC markets are only expecting 26.9 bps of cuts.\nSource LSEG\nThis should work in favor of Canadian Dollar strength against the US Dollar in the months ahead.\nOf course other factors could come into play such as the performance of Oil prices, tariff developments between the US and Canada including the USMCA renegotiation.\nThe agreement that is in place is protecting Canada from the worst of US tariffs. If the U.S. threatens to pull out of this deal, it would increase business uncertainty and could hurt the job market even more.\nI believe that all the necessary conditions are in place for another interest rate cut in December, and there is even a chance it could happen sooner in October for the BoC.\nFor now, I see this as the final cut of the cycle, but can't completely rule out more easing at this point, especially given the ongoing risks related to trade.\nThis is something which could cap Canadian Dollar gains against the US Dollar moving forward. All in all a lot to consider for USD/CAD traders and interesting times ahead.\nClient Sentiment Data - USD/CAD\nLooking at OANDA client sentiment data and market participants are short on USDCAD with 61% of traders net-short. I prefer to take a contrarian view toward crowd sentiment and thus the fact that so many traders are short means USD/CAD prices could rise in the near-term.\nBest of Luck.\nFor all market-moving economic releases and events, see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar.\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or dir"

                "body": "- GBP/JPY benefits from a weaker JPY, though it struggles to attract any meaningful buyers.\n- Traders opt to move to the sidelines ahead of the latest BoE policy decision this Thursday.\n- The market attention will then shift to the crucial BoJ monetary policy update on Friday.\nThe GBP/JPY cross struggles to capitalize on the previous day's goodish rebound from the 199.50-199.45 area, or a four-day low, and oscillates in a range during the Asian session on Thursday. Spot prices manage to hold above the 200.00 psychological mark as traders keenly await the key central bank events for some meaningful impetus and to determine the next leg of a directional move.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) will announce its policy decision later today and is largely anticipated to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4% amid concerns about still sticky inflation. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported on Wednesday that the headline UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose at the same pace seen in the previous month, by 3.8% over the year in August, or the highest level since January 2024. However, signs of a cooling labour market keep the door open for further policy easing by the UK central bank, which is seen acting as a headwind for the British Pound (GBP) and capping the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, is undermined by the weaker-than-expected release of Core Machinery Orders data from Japan. Moreover, concerns that domestic political turmoil could give the Bank of Japan (BoJ) more reasons to delay raising interest rates, along with the underlying bullish sentiment, undermine the safe-haven JPY and act as a tailwind for the GBP/JPY cross. Investors, however, seem convinced that the BoJ will stick to its policy normalization path. This marks a big divergence in comparison to a relatively dovish BoE outlook and should keep a lid on any further appreciating move for spot prices.\nTraders might also refrain from placing aggressive bets and opt to wait for the BoJ monetary policy update on Friday. Despite the mixed fundamental backdrop, the lack of any meaningful selling suggests that the path of least resistance for the cross is to the upside. Bulls, however, might wait for sustained strength and acceptance above the 200.40 horizontal barrier before positioning for any further gains. The GBP/JPY cross might then surpass the 200.75 region, or the highest level since July 2024 touched earlier this week, and could possibly extend the momentum further beyond the 201.00 round-figure mark.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoE Interest Rate Decision\nThe Bank of England (BoE) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the BoE is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is usually bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP). Likewise, if the BoE adopts a dovish view on the UK economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is seen as bearish for GBP.\nRead more.Next release: Thu Sep 18, 2025 11:00\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 4%\nPrevious: 4%\nSource: Bank of England\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "The SEC just made a move that could speed up how crypto ETFs get approved in the United States. Until now, getting a spot crypto ETF listed was a long process, often dragging on for months. But with the new changes, exchanges like Nasdaq, NYSE, and Cboe can follow a standard rulebook instead of starting from scratch every time. In some cases, that could cut the wait from eight months down to about two and a half.\nWhat\u2019s Actually Changing\nBefore this update, each crypto ETF had to go through a double approval process. The exchange had to get clearance, and the fund manager had to go through their own review. That meant lots of back and forth, uncertainty, and long delays. Now, if a fund checks all the right boxes, it can move through more quickly using preset criteria. That\u2019s a big deal for companies trying to bring ETFs tied to other cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin or Ethereum.\nSEC Approves Generic ETF Listing Standards\nAll crypto ETFs are now auto approved if they meet basic criteria, no more waiting months for individual approvals. \ud83d\udc47\n\ud83d\udd38 Generic listing standards approved (Sept. 17)\n\ud83d\udd38 SOL, XRP, LTC, DOGE ETFs can now launch on fast track\n\ud83d\udd38\u2026 pic.twitter.com/RMOLeqUCJ3\u2014 Blub\ud83e\udd16 (@Crypto_blub) September 17, 2025\nWho Benefits First\nSolana and XRP are the two tokens most likely to get through this new system early. There are already ETF filings based on both, and with these rules now active, they might not have to wait as long. Other tokens could follow, as long as they meet the same requirements. It\u2019s a big shift from how things worked even just a few months ago, when every new ETF was treated like a one-off situation.\nDISCOVER: Best New Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2025\nWhat the SEC Will Be Looking For\nEven with the faster process, there are still rules to follow. The ETF must track a token that is actively traded and has enough volume to avoid manipulation. The exchange needs proper monitoring in place to keep an eye on suspicious activity. And the fund itself has to meet the same standards as any other financial product when it comes to reporting and operations. It\u2019s not a free-for-all, but the road ahead is now a lot clearer.\nWhy This Matters for the Market\nThis could be a turning point. Speeding up approvals means more ETF options on the table, which makes crypto more accessible to regular investors who prefer to stay inside traditional finance platforms. It also opens the door for more creative fund structures and potentially broader adoption. Still, there\u2019s always the risk that a faster process could let weaker products slip through. So while the opportunity is real, so are the stakes.\nDISCOVER: 20+ Next Crypto to Explode in 2025\nWhat\u2019s Happening Right Now\nThe rule change is already live, and exchanges are lining up to take advantage of it. There\u2019s been no official word on which application will be first through the door, but several are already waiting in line. If the process goes smoothly, we could see new crypto ETFs hit the market much sooner than expected.\nWhat Comes Next\nKeep an eye on how the first batch of ETFs performs under the new system. Watch to see if the SEC adds more clarity around what qualifies. And pay attention to how investors respond. If demand is strong and the rollout goes well, this new process could become the norm. If things stumble early, regulators may take a closer look. Either way, the timeline for bringing new crypto ETFs to market just got a lot shorter.\nDISCOVER: 20+ Next Crypto to Explode in 2025\nJoin The 99Bitcoins News Discord Here For The Latest Market Updates\nKey Takeaways\n- The SEC has approved a rule change that speeds up the approval process for spot crypto ETFs on exchanges like Nasdaq, NYSE, and Cboe.\n- The new system allows ETFs to follow preset listing standards, cutting approval time from around eight months to about two and a half.\n- Tokens like Solana and XRP could benefit first, as they already have ETF filings that now face fewer delays.\n- Faster approvals still come with"

                "body": "Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain two of the most influential blockchains in decentralized finance. Both are competing for developer attention, user adoption, and the capital that flows through decentralized applications. Evaluating total value locked, developer activity, and transaction costs shows where each chain stands in mid-2025.\nTotal Value Locked\nEthereum continues to lead in total value locked (TVL), supported by established protocols, institutional trust, and the maturity of its DeFi ecosystem. Major lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoin infrastructure still default to Ethereum as the first choice for liquidity.\nSolana, while smaller in absolute terms, has shown impressive growth in niches like NFTs, gaming, and high-velocity retail trading. Its TVL has expanded quickly as low-cost transactions attract projects that cannot operate efficiently on Ethereum's base layer.\nDeveloper Activity\nEthereum maintains the largest developer base in crypto. Tooling, security, and documentation are robust, and its ecosystem has weathered multiple market cycles. This gives Ethereum resilience and consistency, especially when attracting long-term capital and regulatory attention.\nSolana is expanding its developer community at a rapid pace. The chain's performance characteristics make it attractive for applications that need high throughput and low latency. Growth in DeFi protocols and consumer-facing apps shows Solana's ability to carve out its own market share.\nTransaction Costs and Speed\nEthereum's base layer remains slower and more expensive to use, particularly during periods of congestion. Layer-2 solutions are critical to scaling and reducing gas fees, but they add complexity to the user experience.\nSolana offers a different trade-off. Transactions are extremely fast and inexpensive, often costing less than a cent. This makes the chain ideal for frequent or micro-transactions, though the network has faced reliability challenges in the past.\nThe Outlook\nEthereum continues to dominate in terms of liquidity depth, institutional adoption, and developer resources. Solana, however, is proving that speed and cost efficiency can drive rapid growth in emerging segments of the crypto economy.\nFor investors and builders, the competition is less about a single winner and more about fit. Ethereum is positioned as the foundation for large-scale DeFi projects with long-term stability, while Solana is becoming the platform of choice for cost-sensitive, high-frequency applications. Both ecosystems reflect different sides of the same market opportunity.\nBenzinga Disclaimer: This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

(ticker DFDV) has acquired an additional 62,745 SOL, valued at approximately $14.6 million at today's prices.\nThis bumps the company\u2019s total holdings of SOL to over 2 million SOL, worth nearly $500 million, according to The Block\u2019s price page.\nWith about 25 million shares outstanding, not counting pre-paid warrants, that brings DeFi Development's \"SOL per Share\" metric to about $19.44, in dollar terms. Counting the warrants given during a recent financing round bumps the DFDV share count to 31.5 million.\nLike for its previous acquisitions, the treasury company intends to stake its recently purchased tokens \"to a variety of validators,\" including a Solana validator run in-house.\nFounded earlier this year by a team of former Kraken employees, DeFi Development executes a strategy of buying and staking SOL and Solana-related tokens, like the Dogwifhat memecoin. It also offers validator services, including for crypto exchange Kraken.\nThe company is one of the largest digital asset treasuries (DATs) focused on the Solana ecosystem, alongside Upexi and Sharps. Forward Industries, the recently launched SOL DAT backed by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, is by far the largest holder, according to The Block's data.\nLast month, DeFi Development expanded across the Atlantic to become the \"first Solana-focused public treasury vehicle in the United Kingdom\" through an acquisition of a London Stock Market-listed firm.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

                "body": "Kalshi Launches Blockchain Ecosystem Hub with Solana and Base Partnership\nThe regulated prediction market platform Kalshi announced today the launch of KalshiEco Hub, a new initiative partnering with Solana and Coinbase's Base network to drive blockchain-based prediction market innovation.\nThe hub aims to attract builders, traders, and content creators through grants, technical support, and marketing assistance.\nThis move represents Kalshi\u2019s expansion into blockchain development after establishing itself as the first CFTC-regulated prediction market platform in the United States. The company allows users to trade on real-world event outcomes, from political elections to economic indicators.\nBuilding Bridges Between Traditional Finance and Crypto\nKalshiEco Hub combines Kalshi\u2019s regulatory expertise with crypto-native infrastructure from two major blockchain networks. The partnership brings together Solana\u2019s high-speed transaction capabilities\u2014processing up to 65,000 transactions per second\u2014with Base\u2019s layer-2 scaling technology designed to reduce costs and increase processing speed.\nThe hub offers multiple support services to ecosystem participants. These include financial grants for developers, technical assistance for project building, and marketing support for selected initiatives. Early collaborators include Kalshinomics, a market analytics dashboard, and Verso, which develops professional trading tools for market discovery.\nSource: @Kalshi\nKalshi also announced native support for Solana (SOL) deposits, allowing users to fund accounts directly from their wallets with limits up to $500,000. This builds on the platform\u2019s existing crypto support for Bitcoin, USDC, and Worldcoin through partnerships with Zero Hash for regulatory compliance.\nClosing the Gap with Market Leaders\nThe ecosystem launch comes as Kalshi narrows the trading volume gap with competitor Polymarket. Last month, Kalshi registered $875 million in volume compared to Polymarket\u2019s $1 billion, according to industry data.\nKalshi\u2019s growth trajectory shows significant momentum. The platform reported monthly trading volumes of $13 million in early 2025, with peak volumes reaching $26 million in October 2024. Revenue growth hit 1,220% in 2024, while the company recently completed a $185 million Series C funding round led by Paradigm and Sequoia at a $2 billion valuation.\nThe prediction market sector has attracted major institutional interest. Reports suggest Kalshi is close to raising additional funds at a $5 billion valuation, while Polymarket recently secured $200 million at a $1 billion valuation.\nExpanding Solana\u2019s Utility Beyond Memes and DEX Trading\nFor Solana, the Kalshi partnership creates new use cases beyond decentralized exchange trading and meme coins, which accounted for 65% of the network\u2019s trading volume in May 2025. The integration allows SOL holders to participate in prediction markets without converting to stablecoins first, potentially boosting on-chain demand and market depth.\nThe timing aligns with significant institutional adoption of Solana. In Q2 2025, $1.4 billion in institutional capital flowed into Solana, with public companies staking 1.9 million SOL valued at $320.4 million. Solana\u2019s DeFi total value locked reached $8.6 billion, supported by the launch of the first U.S. Solana staking ETF and growing corporate treasury holdings totaling 3.44 million SOL worth $970 million.\nStrategic Positioning Against Regulatory Headwinds\nKalshi\u2019s regulatory status provides a competitive advantage as prediction markets face scrutiny at state levels. The platform holds CFTC approval across all 50 U.S. states, granting legitimacy with traditional investors and institutions that unregulated platforms lack.\nThe company recently hired crypto influencer John Wang as head of crypto to expand its digital asset presence. Strategic partnerships include collaboration with Robinhood for football prediction markets and integration with World App for Worldcoin users.\nC"

Additionally, futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 50 points, or 0.1%.\nIn extended trading, shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store plummeted after its fourth-quarter earnings missed Wall Street's expectations. The restaurant chain said that it's focusing on enhancing the \"guest experience\" in the wake of its rebrand controversy.\nThe moves follow a volatile day of trading Wednesday after the Fed, as anticipated, slashed its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the lone gainer, rising 260.42 points, or 0.57%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1% and 0.33%, respectively.\nDuring a press conference following the decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell put a damper on investor hopes that the central bank would be on a lengthy rate-cutting path this year, as he called the latest cut \"risk management.\" In fact, policymakers are predicting two more reductions this year, but just one in 2026, while traders had priced in two to three more cuts next year.\n\"The Fed's 25 basis point cut is a clear signal: the softening labor market and stubborn inflation have pushed policymakers to act \u2014 but gradually. This isn't a pivot, it's a measured step,\" Gina Bolvin, president at Bolvin Wealth Management Group, said in a statement.\n\"For investors, this means modest rate relief, not fireworks,\" she added. \"The Fed is walking a fine line, and upcoming inflation and jobs data will determine what comes next.\"\nDespite Wednesday's losses, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are still headed for weekly gains, being up 0.2% and 0.5% in the period, respectively. That puts the broad market index on pace for its sixth positive week in seven and the tech-heavy Nasdaq on track for its third positive week in a row.\nMeanwhile, Wednesday's move higher for the 30-stock Dow puts its week-to-date advance at 0.4%, a move that would signify its second consecutive week of gains, if it holds.\nShares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store slid more than 9% in extended trading Wednesday after the company's fourth-quarter earnings missed analyst estimates.\nThe restaurant chain reported adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share, below the 80 cents per share that analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting for the quarter. However, the company's revenue of $868 million came in better than the consensus estimate of $855 million.\nCracker Barrel's full-year guidance disappointed investors as well, as the company expects revenue for the period of between $3.35 billion and $3.45 billion. Analysts had anticipated $3.52 billion, per LSEG.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) lagged behind, with August drops of 4% or more. Meanwhile, health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) outweighed those underperformers with an index-leading 24.2% price gain.\nLet's check out the rest of the top-performing Dow Jones stocks last month.\n1. UnitedHealth Group (up 24.2%)\nUnitedHealth took a tumble with a weak earnings report at the end of July, but bounced back in August. The stock soared on Aug. 15, as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a brand-new position of 5 million shares in the stock. The $3.3 billion merger with home health specialist Amedisys was completed on the same day, adding fuel to the fires. All told, UnitedHealth's stock moved 0.7% lower across the two-month span of July and August.\n2. Apple (up 11.8%)\niPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) surged 12% in the first week of August. The company addressed tariff concerns by expanding its domestic manufacturing commitments. The four-year commitment of an additional $100 billion includes partnerships with Texas Instruments and Corning.\nAdvertisement\n3. American Express (up 10.7%)\nCredit services giant American Express (NYSE: AXP) sprinted higher by landing several valuable sporting sponsorships in the Miami area. The deals include the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Dolphins football team.\n4. Home Depot (up 10.7%)\nHome improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE: HD) reported modest Q2 results last month. The stock still rose; management said that consumers are just delaying their big-ticket home improvement projects. The financial results should improve over time.\n5. Sherwin-Williams (up 10.6%)\nPaint retailer Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) followed the same themes as Home Depot. Instead of an earnings report, the global company refinanced its credit facilities with better terms in Canada and Europe.\nShould you invest $1,000 in UnitedHealth Group right now?\nBefore you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UnitedHealth Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

                "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisory committee meets this week, with votes expected on whether to change recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox.\nThe meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 18 at 10 a.m. EDT. Watch live in our video player above.\nThe exact questions to be voted on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta are unclear. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions seeking details to a newly posted agenda, although the department announced five additional appointments to the committee Monday.\nWATCH: Ousted CDC head Monarez testifies on agency upheaval under RFK Jr.\nSome public health experts are worried that the votes will \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 raise unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents.\nPerhaps even more consequential would be a vote that restricts a government program from paying for vaccines for low-income families.\n\u201cI\u2019m tightening my seat belt,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.\nThe panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.\nKennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.\nWATCH: As Florida moves to end vaccine mandates, pediatricians fear more states could follow\nHere\u2019s a look at the three vaccines being discussed.\nCOVID-19\nBefore Kennedy was health secretary, ACIP would typically vote in June to reaffirm recommendations for shots against respiratory viruses that sicken millions of Americans each fall and winter.\nThis past June, Kennedy\u2019s ACIP voted to recommend flu shots for Americans but was silent on COVID-19 shots.\nREAD MORE: Can you get a COVID shot? Here\u2019s your fall vaccine guide\nBefore that meeting, Kennedy announced he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC\u2019s recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors\u2019 groups and public health organizations, and prompted a lawsuit by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.\nDays after Kennedy\u2019s announcement, CDC officials said families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government\u2019s Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It\u2019s now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.\nAs with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season\u2019s COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.\nWATCH: Epidemiologist breaks down new restrictions on COVID shots\nFurther complicating the picture: When the FDA last month licensed this fall\u2019s COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and children.\nIf the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then \u201cthat would take away access for roughly half of America\u2019s kids,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nThe pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.\nHepatitis B\nHepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use.\nWATCH: In "

Brookings' Vanda Felbab-Brown discusses the attacks and their effectiveness.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\nWe have a strategic assessment of a U.S. military campaign against boats in the Caribbean. President Trump asserts that the U.S. has blown up, quote, \"three boats\" that left Venezuela in recent days. The Trump administration says they were smuggling drugs, although the proof of that is at the bottom of the sea. One boat carried 11 people, another carried three and the other we don't know. The strikes led some to ask how they are legal, and today we ask if the strikes are practical, if they achieve their stated goal. Vanda Felbab-Brown is at the Brookings Institution and specializes in security and counternarcotics, which makes her the right person to talk about this. Good morning.\nVANDA FELBAB-BROWN: Good morning.\nINSKEEP: What kind of drugs come out of Venezuela?\nFELBAB-BROWN: It is cocaine. So it is not the drug that is killing Americans, which is methamphetamine and, most importantly, fentanyl. There is certainly cocaine consumption in the United States, but that has not led to significant lethal drug overdose.\nINSKEEP: OK. And so there is not any interruption in the fentanyl traffic that's meaningful at all from the U.S. Navy blowing up these boats?\nFELBAB-BROWN: No. So the naval actions in the Caribbean do not affect the flow of fentanyl. Fentanyl is produced in Mexico. It is delivered through mostly the land border, although there is certainly a possibility that it could be, in time, delivered by boats from Mexico. But the naval operations in the Caribbean do not hamper that unless they started catching precursor chemicals that are coming to China. But again, this would unlikely be so far in Latin America. We would be seeing these flows much closer to Mexico.\nINSKEEP: I'm curious about something here. In August, it's believed the president signed an order directing the military to act against cartels. The president of Mexico immediately responded to this and said, don't be invading Mexico. This going to be a real problem if you invade Mexico, which is a thing that Republicans have talked about doing for a long time, sending the military against cartels in Mexico. Is it possible the president instead had the military act in the Caribbean because that was - there would be less chaos as a result of that?\nFELBAB-BROWN: Well, I think it's possible, but really, it's not clear what the mission is. I mean, certainly, the administration has stated that it hopes that the killing of drug smugglers, drug traffickers would create deterrent effects. But many of the people who are manning the boats are low-level traffickers, low-level mules. They are dispensable. They risk their lives anyways. They face a variety of threats, and there are tens of thousands of them available. So it's hard to see how actions around Venezuela could produce deterrence effects to reduce the flow of drugs into the United States.\nINSKEEP: OK. I'm trying to think this through a little bit more because we're talking about boats coming out of Venezuela. I'm not an expert as you are in Caribbean boat traffic, but I'm guessing you could target boats that come out of Colombia or that come out of Panama or any number of other places that may have illegal drugs. Do you find anything interesting that the U.S. Navy has focused specifically on boats leaving Venezuela?\nFELBAB-BROWN: Well, many people in Latin America suspect that this might be an effort to put pressure on the Maduro regime, perhaps provoke a military confrontation that would justify U.S. military action against the Maduro regime. This is widespread expectation. And we have certainly seen the U.S. establishing a new counternarcotics coalition that includes governments such "

That would mark the fifth consecutive meeting without a move.\nBoard members broadly agree that it is premature to raise rates, and markets also anticipate no change. Policymakers are monitoring the impact of recent U.S. tariffs, particularly on exporters like automakers, and how this affects wages, investment, and Japan\u2019s economy. Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino recently warned that tariff risks may be greater than previously assumed and warrant close attention.\n--\nLittle market surprise is expected;\n- yen reaction likely muted unless BOJ signals tariff-driven downside risks\n- for Japanese equities, exporter shares may stay cautious as automakers reassess guidance under tariff pressure\n- for fied interst, steady BOJ policy reinforces divergence with Fed; global yield spreads remain in focus."
