US gold futures for December mirrored the spot price drop, while silver took an even heavier hit\u2014down 6% for the week and marking its worst run since March. Elsewhere, platinum edged up 0.3%, but palladium dropped 1.8%. All eyes are now on the delayed US inflation report, with economists expecting core inflation to hold at 3.1% for September. Most traders still see a 25-basis-point Federal Reserve rate cut at the next meeting, but a hot inflation reading could quickly shift expectations\u2014and pressure gold and other non-yielding assets even further.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Safe havens aren\u2019t always golden.\nGold\u2019s slide highlights investors gravitating toward the US dollar as uncertainty grows. Hopes for eased US\u2013China trade tensions have also given the dollar a boost, sapping demand for defensive assets like gold. If inflation surprises to the upside, delayed rate cuts could send the dollar higher and keep gold, silver, and other metals under pressure.\nThe bigger picture: A changing global game plan.\nGold usually gets a lift during geopolitical stress or when rates are low, but right now, shifting Fed policy and ongoing US\u2013China negotiations are shaking up the landscape. Persistent inflation or a strong dollar could keep metals under pressure, while any dramatic global developments could upend trends and send commodity markets spinning in a new direction.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 18 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

Its price was $4,142 as of 9:30 am ET Thursday. The Silver spot price shed more than 8% on Tuesday, down to about $47.79, and was at $49.20 at 9:30 am ET.\nSinead Colton Grant, the chief investment officer at Bank of New York's wealth division, said that commodities like silver and gold do a \"really good job\" of hedging inflation when there's a shock, but added, \"Over the long term, equities are a much better inflation hedge.\"\nShe laid out 3 reasons BNY is skeptical of gold\nShe said BNY Wealth didn't tactically invest in gold as its price was rising because it viewed the metal as too volatile.\nGold's monthslong rally was partly driven by the falling US Dollar Index, she said, but added, \"That move has probably played out,\" citing the greenback's performance this month. The index has dropped about 11% from the start of the year to September, but is up about 2.4% since mid-September.\nColton Grant added that concern about the depreciation of US Treasurys, which also drove investors into gold, was \"overdone.\" She said it was \"very telling\" that the price of gold slumped on Tuesday after a few days of dollar strength and the 10-year Treasury yield dropping below 4%.\nShe also said BNY Wealth wasn't concerned about a significant increase in inflation in the near term, despite fears that tariffs would raise prices, because they anticipated an economic boost from Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful\" tax bill.\nWhy BNY is bullish on equities\nThe New York-headquartered financial services firm is overweight US equities, Colton Grant said, meaning its analysts are predicting they will outperform the broader market.\nShe said this was because of the strength of America's tech industry and the country's productivity growth, which \"has been more than double that of most of the rest of the developed world.\"\n\"We see the US economy expanding about 1.8% this year to 2% next year,\" Colton Grant added."

Traders remain cautious after a sharp sell-off over the previous sessions. Analysts believe that the end of the Diwali festival in India, the world\u2019s second-largest gold consumer, might reduce physical demand and undermine the precious metal price.\nNonetheless, the prolonged US government shutdown and global trade tensions could boost the safe-haven flows, supporting the yellow metal. The expectation of US interest rate cuts might contribute to Gold\u2019s upside. Lower interest rates could reduce the opportunity cost of holding Gold, supporting the non-yielding precious metal.\nAll eyes will be on the delayed release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data for September, which will be published later on Friday. Economists estimated the headline US CPI to increase by 0.4% MoM in September, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 3.1%. Excluding food and energy, core CPI is expected to show a 0.3% monthly increase and a rise of 3.1% on an annual basis.\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Gold retreats ahead of key US inflation data, US-China trade talks\n- High-level trade negotiations between the US and China are set to begin in Malaysia later on Friday. China's Vice-Premier He Lifeng will participate in the meetings, as well as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.\n- US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet next Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\n- The Trump administration is considering a plan to restrict a broad range of software-driven exports to China to retaliate against Beijing's latest round of rare earth export restrictions, Reuters reported late Wednesday.\n- The US government shutdown on Friday has entered its 24th day, becoming the second-longest federal funding lapse ever, with no end in sight. The GOP-backed stopgap bill failed to pass in the Senate for a 12th time on Wednesday. The 54-46 vote fell mostly along party lines.\n- US President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia for the first time in his second term, targeting oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft.\n- The Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely to lower its key interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) next week and again in the December policy meeting, according to a Reuters poll.\n- The CME FedWatch tool showed a 97% chance of a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut.\nGold clings to a bullish stance in the longer term above the key EMA\nGold price trades on a negative note on the day. According to the daily chart, the positive outlook of the precious metal remains intact as the price holds above the key 100-day Exponential Moving Average. The upward momentum is supported by the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which stands above the midline near 60.0.\nOn the bright side, the first upside barrier to watch is $4,218, the high of October 15. Sustained upside momentum could take XAU/USD back up to the $4,330, the high of October 16. Further north, the next resistance level is located at the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band of $4,365.\nOn the other hand, the initial support level for yellow metal is seen at $4,066, the low of October 23. More bearish candlesticks reflect a continuation of downside pressure, possibly dragging the price down to the next bearish target at the $4,000 psychological level, followed by the October 10 low of $3,947.\nInflation FAQs\nInflation measures the rise in the price of a representative basket of goods and services.

                "body": "In December 2023, Angola stunned global energy markets by announcing it would leave OPEC after 16 years of membership. The decision followed months of tension over production quotas. Angola had been assigned a daily output cap of 1.1 million barrels of oil \u2013 far below what Luanda considered fair. At the time of its withdrawal, however, Angola\u2019s production had already collapsed by almost 40% in 8 years, sliding from 1.7 million b/d to 1.1 million b/d. The decline owed less to OPEC than to geology and high government intake: mature fields were running dry, and new investment had slowed.\nHopes that leaving OPEC would allow a resurgence quickly faded. The government stopped publishing official output figures after November 2023, just weeks before its departure became effective in January 2024, but exports tell the story. Because Angola refines very little oil domestically (with only one operational refinery of 60,000 b/d capacity) and all of the production is offshore, seaborne shipments mirror total output. In 2022, the last year of full reporting, the gap between exports (including deliveries to the Luanda refinery) and overall production was barely 25,000 b/d, and exports have hovered around 1.1 million since 2021. Freedom from quotas brought no boost in output, the volumes remained flat.\nRelated: Trump Reopens Alaska\u2019s Arctic Refuge to Oil and Gas Drilling\nThe main reason is straightforward: Angola\u2019s producing wells are simply running out of oil. The already developed fields are old, and modest discoveries over the past decade have not offset depletion. Of the country\u2019s 20 largest fields, only 5 remain below 70% maturity. The flagship Block 15 Kizomba complex operated by ExxonMobil produces about 200,000 b/d but is 85% depleted. The second largest TotalEnergies\u2019 Kaombo project in Block 32 (around 150,000 b/d) is around 60% mature. With decline rates high and reservoirs getting dry, Angola\u2019s structural problem is in large part geological, not political.\nNaturally, Angola\u2019s oil story is far from over. Numerous offshore blocks are still undeveloped, and exploration in others has barely started, sustaining the interest of international operators. The upstream industry remains dominated by a few big players: Azule Energy \u2013 a joint venture between BP and Eni formed in 2022 \u2013 has become the country\u2019s largest producer, accounting for around 230,000 b/d. Sonangol, the state-owned oil company, ranked second with roughly 200,000 b/d, while ExxonMobil continued to run the vast Kizomba complex in Block 15, and TotalEnergies maintained a broad oil-and-gas portfolio across several deepwater blocks.\nYet even as these companies have kept Angola\u2019s oil flowing, their investments have been shrinking \u2013 and this time the maturity of the fields is not a full excuse. The country\u2019s Production-Sharing Contracts (PSC) imposed a heavy government take \u2013 high royalties, rigid cost-recovery limits, and steep profit-oil shares that left international operators within margins. For years, the fiscal structure spoiled enthusiasm for drilling new wells or redeveloping mature fields. By 2024, policymakers in Luanda had come to a clear realization: the problem wasn\u2019t OPEC \u2013 it was Angola\u2019s own tax regime.\nIn November 2024, the ANPG (the National Oil, Gas and Biofuels Agency, Angola\u2019s state oil regulator) introduced the Incremental Production Decree, a measure designed to attract capital back into mature offshore blocks and undeveloped areas. The new rules cut royalties to 15% (from 20%), capped ANPG\u2019s profit-oil share at 25%, raised the cost-recovery ceiling to 70% of production, and even allowed companies to recover exploration costs from unsuccessful wells. Acreage now had to be classified as \u201cmature\u201d or \u201cundeveloped,\u201d ensuring incentives targeted aging assets. These changes, rather than Angola\u2019s exit from OPEC, finally shifted investor sentiment.\nThe results came quickly. In September 2025, Chevron signed a risk service contract (RSC) for Block 33 in the Lower "

Sonangol, the state-owned oil company, ranked second with roughly 200,000 b/d, while ExxonMobil continued to run the vast Kizomba complex in Block 15, and TotalEnergies maintained a broad oil-and-gas portfolio across several deepwater blocks.\nYet even as these companies have kept Angola\u2019s oil flowing, their investments have been shrinking \u2013 and this time the maturity of the fields is not a full excuse. The country\u2019s Production-Sharing Contracts (PSC) imposed a heavy government take \u2013 high royalties, rigid cost-recovery limits, and steep profit-oil shares that left international operators within margins. For years, the fiscal structure spoiled enthusiasm for drilling new wells or redeveloping mature fields. By 2024, policymakers in Luanda had come to a clear realization: the problem wasn\u2019t OPEC \u2013 it was Angola\u2019s own tax regime.\nIn November 2024, the ANPG (the National Oil, Gas and Biofuels Agency, Angola\u2019s state oil regulator) introduced the Incremental Production Decree, a measure designed to attract capital back into mature offshore blocks and undeveloped areas. The new rules cut royalties to 15% (from 20%), capped ANPG\u2019s profit-oil share at 25%, raised the cost-recovery ceiling to 70% of production, and even allowed companies to recover exploration costs from unsuccessful wells. Acreage now had to be classified as \u201cmature\u201d or \u201cundeveloped,\u201d ensuring incentives targeted aging assets. These changes, rather than Angola\u2019s exit from OPEC, finally shifted investor sentiment.\nThe results came quickly. In September 2025, Chevron signed a risk service contract (RSC) for Block 33 in the Lower "

An exploratory well drilled at the site has achieved a flow rate of 38.64 cubic meters of oil and 10,000 cubic meters of natural gas per day during test production, it said.\nShale oil mainly refers to liquid hydrocarbons trapped in formations of shale rock that can be extracted for refining. It is often found in organic-rich shale and thin interlayers of carbonate rock, sandstone and siltstone. As an unconventional oil and gas resource, it also contributes to stable crude oil production in China.\nSinopec has continued to increase efforts in shale oil exploration and development, having identified three new large-scale shale oil fields. Last year, the company's annual shale oil production reached 705,000 tonnes, up 308,000 tonnes from the previous year.\nHere we are to serve you with news right now.

                "body": "The Euro remains below 1.1600 as the US Dollar strengthens, influenced by concerns about a trade war due to US threats of limiting software exports to China. The Eurozone Consumer Confidence data release garners attention, but market volatility is low, with an eye on US inflation and Federal Reserve actions.\nEUR/USD trades at 1.1590, slightly down from a previous high of 1.1620, reflecting moderate effects from US-China trade tensions. With no key economic reports amid the US government shutdown, trade issues primarily influence market moves, although expectations remain positive for US-Chinese discussions.\nECB Speeches and Data Releases\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) speeches and data releases, including the Eurozone\u2019s Consumer Confidence index, are significant. Meanwhile, US Federal Reserve indicators and officials\u2019 speeches are set to influence USD movements.\nThe US Dollar gains strength on potential software trade restrictions against China, with US leadership expressing optimism about resolving trade disputes. In Europe, ECB Vice President de Guindos comments on balanced inflation risks, and markets await Friday\u2019s delayed US CPI report, predicting 3.1% yearly inflation.\nTechnical analysis indicates EUR/USD hovers above the 1.1580 support area, facing resistance at 1.1620. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD suggest negative momentum, with possible downside targeting 1.1545 and 1.1455 areas, while upside challenges sit at 1.1625, 1.1650, and 1.1728.\nDollar Strength and Trade Fears\nThe EUR/USD pair is struggling below the 1.1600 level, pressured by a stronger US Dollar. This dollar strength comes from renewed US-China trade fears, a dynamic we\u2019ve seen before. The market is quiet for now, but everyone is waiting for US inflation data and guidance from the Federal Reserve.\nThe upcoming Eurozone Consumer Confidence report is unlikely to help the Euro much. Looking back, we see that confidence has been persistently weak, hovering in a dismal range around the -15 level for much of the time since the post-pandemic recovery stalled in 2023. Another weak reading will only confirm the underlying economic sluggishness in the Euro area.\nRenewed threats of US export curbs on China are making the dollar a safe place to be. We saw a similar story play out during the trade disputes of 2018-2019, where uncertainty consistently benefited the dollar. Even though officials are talking, the risk of escalation is pushing capital towards US assets.\nAll eyes are on the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is expected to show inflation remains sticky. After the long battle to bring inflation down from the 9% peaks we saw in 2022, a reading near 3.1% keeps the pressure on the Fed. While the market hopes for an interest rate cut, these inflation numbers make that a difficult decision for the central bank.\nWith market volatility currently low, derivative pricing is relatively cheap. This presents an opportunity for traders who expect a downward move in EUR/USD. Buying put options on the Euro allows for a position that profits from a decline, with risk limited to the premium paid.\nGiven the technical picture, a break below the 1.1580 support level could be a key trigger. Traders could consider using puts or put spreads to target lower levels like 1.1545 or even the channel bottom near 1.1455. This strategy provides a defined-risk way to act on the prevailing bearish sentiment."

With CPI data looming and the ECB signaling no rate moves before 2027, traders eye support at 1.1538 | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Trades Near 1.1590 as Dollar Strengthens Before CPI; Euro Faces Pressure from ECB Caution and Trade Tensions\nThe EUR/USD pair hovered near 1.1590, slipping for the fourth straight session as the U.S. dollar index (DXY) climbed toward 99.00, driven by renewed safe-haven demand ahead of U.S. CPI data and escalating U.S.\u2013China trade friction. The pair has fallen nearly 1.3% from last week\u2019s high of 1.1740, reflecting a stronger dollar tone as traders brace for inflation data expected to steer the Federal Reserve\u2019s path into year-end.\nDollar Strength and Trade Developments Shape Momentum\nReports that Washington plans new export restrictions on software-powered goods to Beijing reignited trade tension and strengthened the dollar. The U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s initiative, seen as retaliation for China\u2019s curbs on rare-earth minerals, has widened the yield gap between U.S. Treasuries and European bonds. The 10-year yield stabilized near 4.62%, maintaining the dollar\u2019s yield advantage and keeping EUR/USD under technical pressure.\nAt the same time, optimism surrounding next week\u2019s Trump\u2013Xi summit in South Korea offered brief relief, as traders weighed the possibility of \u201cseveral agreements\u201d on energy and agricultural trade. Yet markets remain cautious that the talks could fail to ease friction, especially given the White House\u2019s plan to tighten export oversight. This cautious tone has been reflected across risk assets, with Wall Street futures modestly higher but volatility elevated.\nEurozone Economic Conditions Remain Fragile\nThe Eurozone economy continues to lose momentum, with data showing consumer confidence at -14.2, marginally above expectations but consistent with weak household sentiment. A Reuters poll (Oct 15\u201322) found that 57% of economists expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintain its deposit rate at 2% through 2026, with no changes anticipated before 2027. Vice President Luis de Guindos reaffirmed that inflation risks are \u201cbalanced\u201d but growth remains subdued.\nThe market now shifts focus to the ECB\u2019s October 30 policy meeting, where officials are expected to reiterate a data-dependent stance. Traders expect ECB chief economist Philip Lane to highlight slowing credit growth and the need for patience before any policy pivot. The euro\u2019s inability to attract yield-driven inflows underscores its vulnerability against a firm dollar backdrop.\nTechnical Outlook and Market Positioning for EUR/USD\nOn the technical front, EUR/USD trades in a clear descending channel on the 4-hour chart. The pair failed to sustain a rebound above 1.1625, where the 50-day EMA (1.1631) and 200-day EMA (1.1668) capped gains. The RSI near 44 points to continued bearish momentum. Immediate support lies at 1.1538, followed by 1.1470, the lower boundary of the current channel. A decisive break below 1.1538 could open the path toward 1.1460, while a close above 1.1650 would shift sentiment and expose 1.1710 resistance.\nCFTC data shows that speculative euro longs fell 5% last week, suggesting short-term traders are reducing exposure ahead of key data. The volatility index for EUR/USD options rose to 7.8%, its highest since mid-September, signaling heightened positioning ahead of CPI.\nCPI and Fed Outlook Dominate Market Attention\nThe U.S. CPI report is the main event risk. Consensus forecasts call for a 0.3% monthly rise and a 3.1% annual increase in core inflation. A hotter print could boost expectations for delayed rate cuts, propelling the dollar further and pressuring the euro toward 1.1550\u20131.1530. Conversely, a softer CPI outcome may trigger short-covering, lifting the pair back above 1.1650 as traders re-price the probability of a De"

Fortunately, traders still had some action this week \u2014 with a mini-rout in gold and an explosive move higher in crude oil prices keeping things lively. But with US CPI data due later today, there\u2019s potential for volatility to return ahead of the weekend.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nView related analysis:\n- With US Dollar \u2018Rebound\u2019 Waning, EUR/USD and GBP/USD Could Bounce\n- Australian Dollar Consolidates: AUD/USD, EUR/AUD Near Pivotal Levels\n- Japanese Yen Price Action Setups: USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, AUD/JPY\n- Bitcoin Bears At Risk of Short Squeeze Unless Prices Continue Lower\nAUD/USD and GBP/USD Eye Breakout Zones as US CPI Looms\nUS Inflation in Focus\nHeadline CPI is expected to rise to 3.1% year-on-year, while core CPI is forecast to hold steady at 3.1% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month. Money markets are currently pricing in a 25bp rate cut from the Fed next week and another in December, with implied probabilities of 99% and 93% respectively. A hotter-than-expected CPI print could challenge those expectations and send the US dollar higher across the board.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG, Investing.com\nStill, my hunch is that inflation will come in softer, supporting current market pricing. As noted in recent articles, I suspect the US dollar\u2019s rebound this week is nearing an inflection point \u2014 and its next meaningful move is likely lower.\nThat scenario could bode well for the Australian dollar heading into next week, particularly with Australia\u2019s key inflation report on the horizon for the RBA.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe daily chart shows the Australian dollar has continued to trade sideways over the past couple of weeks. Since last Wednesday, however, the open and close prices have mostly held above the September low. AUD/USD\u2019s open-to-close range has remained below 35 pips since last Tuesday, and daily ranges have been trending lower. This suggests prices are coiling above support \u2014 often a precursor to increased volatility.\nAt this stage, my hunch is that AUD/USD will initially break higher from its current range before meeting resistance below 0.6550, or perhaps around the descending trendline. Whether the pair then continues to break higher or reverse lower likely depends on the tone of next week\u2019s FOMC meeting and Australia\u2019s quarterly inflation figures.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/USD\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis: British Pound vs US Dollar\nMostly based on the assumption that the US dollar will top out, I have provided a bullish bias for the British pound against the US dollar \u2013 should it hold above Wednesday\u2019s low. The daily chart shows that this is being stretched, and there may need to be some wriggle room for some CPI-related noise beneath Wednesday\u2019s low to allow the potential for a bounce to breath.\nWhile bets are now being renewed for a Bank of England (BOE) cut, GBP/USD has already fallen for five consecutive days. The daily RSI (2) is in the oversold zone, and prices are trying to hold above that hammer low, for now at least.\nON the basis that the 200-day EMA is a tough nut to crack and my hunch for a weaker US dollar, I\u2019ll stick to my guns and eek a move higher on the GBP/USD daily chart, with the 50-day EMA as a potential bullish target.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView GBP/USD\nView the full economic calendar\n-- Written by Matt Simpson\nFollow Matt on Twitter @cLeverEdge\nThis report is intended for general circulation only.

On an annualized basis, Retail Sales are seen rising 0.6% during the reported month, inching lower from 0.7% prior.\nCore Retail Sales, stripping the basket of motor fuel sales, are anticipated to have climbed by 0.7% year-over-year (YoY), lower than the previous reading of 1.2%.\nHow could the UK Retail Sales affect GBP/USD?\nUK Retail Sales data for September could contribute to the downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair amid signs of softer consumer spending. Even the surprise uptick may struggle to help the pair hold ground amid rising bets of more interest rate cuts by the Bank of England (BoE) in the remaining year.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) faced challenges after BoE Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Swati Dhingra signaled on Thursday that United States (US) tariffs could put downward pressure on prices in the medium term. The preliminary United Kingdom (UK) Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) data by S&P Global will be eyed later in the day. Attention will be shifted toward the US Consumer Price Index figures due on Friday.\nTechnically, the GBP/USD pair remains steady after five days of losses, trading around 1.3320 at the time of writing. The pair may target the two-month low of 1.3248, recorded on October 14, followed by the six-month low of 1.3141. On the upside, the initial barrier lies at the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.3365, followed by the 50-day EMA at 1.3433. A break above these levels would improve the short- and medium-term price momentum and open the doors for the pair to test the monthly high of 1.3527.\nBoE FAQs\nThe Bank of England (BoE) decides monetary policy for the United Kingdom. Its primary goal is to achieve \u2018price stability\u2019, or a steady inflation rate of 2%. Its tool for achieving this is via the adjustment of base lending rates. The BoE sets the rate at which it lends to commercial banks and banks lend to each other, determining the level of interest rates in the economy overall. This also impacts the value of the Pound Sterling (GBP).\nWhen inflation is above the Bank of England\u2019s target it responds by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is positive for the Pound Sterling because higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls below target, it is a sign economic growth is slowing, and the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit in the hope businesses will borrow to invest in growth-generating projects \u2013 a negative for the Pound Sterling.\nIn extreme situations, the Bank of England can enact a policy called Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the BoE substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. QE is a last resort policy when lowering interest rates will not achieve the necessary result. The process of QE involves the BoE printing money to buy assets \u2013 usually government or AAA-rated corporate bonds \u2013 from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Pound Sterling.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE, enacted when the economy is strengthening and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the Bank of England (BoE) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to encourage them to lend; in QT, the BoE stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive for the Pound Sterling.\nAuthor\nAkhtar Faruqui\nFXStreet\nAkhtar Faruqui is a Forex Analyst based in New Delhi, India. Wit"

The move followed another sharp rebound in the greenback after several Federal Reserve officials reiterated their commitment to maintaining restrictive monetary policy until inflation convincingly returns to target. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield held near 4.65%, keeping the dollar broadly supported across major currencies, while investors continued to scale back expectations for early Fed rate cuts.\nThe pound, meanwhile, has faced sustained selling interest as weak domestic data and dovish market expectations for the Bank of England (BoE) weigh on sentiment. Recent figures have underlined a soft patch in the U.K. economy, with September retail sales contracting by 0.4% and consumer inflation slowing to 2.9%, the lowest level since mid-2021. The moderation in price pressures has given traders confidence that the BoE\u2019s tightening cycle has ended, with markets now pricing around 60 basis points of rate cuts by mid-2026, and growing speculation that the first move could come as early as the second quarter of next year. This divergence in rate outlook between London and Washington has widened yield spreads in favor of the dollar and kept the pound pinned near recent lows.\nMarket participants continue to watch U.S. data closely for signs that could shape the Fed\u2019s next steps. The upcoming PCE inflation report, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of price growth, will be pivotal in determining whether policymakers can afford to maintain their hawkish stance into early 2026. A stronger-than-expected reading could reignite speculation of an additional rate hike, reinforcing upward pressure on the dollar. Conversely, a softer outcome may offer temporary relief for GBP/USD, though the broader narrative remains one of U.S. resilience and U.K. fragility.\nTechnically, the pair remains confined within a narrow range, lacking clear directional conviction. Resistance is seen near 1.2235, aligning with the 50-day EMA, followed by 1.2280 and 1.2350. A break above these levels could shift near-term momentum toward the upside, though the broader bias remains negative while below 1.2300. On the downside, 1.2110 offers immediate support, followed by 1.2050, where buyers previously emerged during mid-September. Momentum indicators remain subdued, with the RSI hovering near 44 and MACD signals flattening below zero, confirming weak bullish participation and persistent selling pressure on rallies\nRead More\n-\nMSTY ETF Falls 54.9% YTD as MSTR Stock Volatility Crushes NAV Despite 198% Yield\n23.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRPI and XRPR ETFs Gain as XRP-USD Holds $2.40 and $13.3B Inflows Forecast Ahead of Ripple XRP ETF Approval\n23.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price (NG=F) Sinks to $3.33 as Record Production and 87 Bcf Storage Build Hammer Prices\n23.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Yen Surges to 152.68 as Japan\u2019s \u00a514 Trillion Stimulus and U.S. CPI Outlook\n23.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nIn global markets, the dollar\u2019s renewed strength was mirrored by a mild pullback in risk assets, while European equity futures turned lower as investors reassessed interest rate expectations.

                "body": "The Australian Dollar (AUD) is currently navigating a pivotal consolidation phase in October 2025, exhibiting range-bound trading against major currencies, most notably the US Dollar (AUD/USD). This period of constrained movement is fueled by a complex interplay of conflicting domestic economic indicators, a cautious Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) stance, the evolving economic landscape of China, and the monetary policy shifts from the US Federal Reserve. As market participants keenly await definitive catalysts, the AUD is poised for a significant breakout, with key event risks looming on the horizon.\nThis consolidation reflects a market grappling with uncertainty, where bullish and bearish forces are temporarily in equilibrium. On one hand, resilient consumer spending and improving business confidence in Australia offer a degree of support. On the other, a softening labor market complicates the RBA's inflation-fighting mandate. Globally, mixed signals from China\u2014Australia's largest trading partner\u2014and the dovish pivot by the US Federal Reserve add further layers of complexity, creating a delicate balance that has kept the AUD in a tight trading range.\nNavigating the Economic Labyrinth: Factors Driving AUD's Stasis\nThe Australian Dollar's current state of consolidation is a direct consequence of several influential factors, each pulling the currency in different directions, creating a temporary stalemate.\nDomestically, Australia's economy is presenting a mixed picture. While the third quarter of 2025 has seen improvements in business confidence and conditions, alongside a solid rise in consumer spending in September, the labor market is showing concerning signs of slack. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose from 4.3% to 4.5% in September, marking its highest level since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. This softening in employment data has fueled speculation of potential RBA rate cuts. Conversely, consumer inflation expectations edged up to 4.8% in October, the highest reading since June, suggesting that Q3 inflation might exceed forecasts and potentially complicate the RBA's path towards its target.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has maintained its Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 3.60% at its September meeting, adopting a \"cautious and data dependent\" approach. The central bank acknowledges that the full effect of previous rate adjustments will take time to materialize. While the market has priced in a roughly 70% chance of a November rate cut following the weaker employment data, the RBA's decision will ultimately hinge on the upcoming Q3 CPI release, which is widely considered the \"ultimate determinant\" for its November policy stance. Any deviation from expectations in this crucial inflation report could significantly alter the RBA's outlook and trigger a strong market reaction.\nChina's economic performance continues to be a critical determinant for the AUD, given its status as Australia's largest trading partner. Recent data shows Q3 GDP growth at 4.8% year-on-year, a slowdown from Q2 but in line with expectations. Industrial production and retail sales have shown some upside surprises, yet September's Manufacturing PMI data remained in contraction territory, indicating ongoing challenges. Easing US-China trade tensions, with signals from President Trump about the unsustainability of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and a planned meeting with President Xi Jinping, have provided some optimism, boosting risk-sensitive assets like the AUD. However, any resurgence of trade friction or weaker-than-expected Chinese data could quickly reverse this sentiment.\nGlobally, the dynamics of the US Dollar (USD) and the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy are also exerting significant influence. The Fed reduced its benchmark rate by 25 basis points in September to a range of 4.00%-4.25% and signaled two additional cuts before year-end, with markets assigning an over 80% chance to further reductions.

                "body": "Japanese inflation numbers fueled speculation about a Bank of Japan rate hike in early trading on Friday, October 24, influencing USD/JPY price outlook.\nThe annual inflation rate increased from 2.7% in August to 2.9% in September, while core inflation rose from 2.7% to 2.8%. Crucially, the so-called \u2018core-core\u2019 inflation rate eased from 3.3% to 3.0%. Economists had expected the core-core inflation rate to fall modestly to 3.2%.\nDespite easing core-core inflation, overall inflation remains well above the BoJ\u2019s target, maintaining pressure for policy tightening.\nSeptember\u2019s inflation figures came after LDP leader Sanae Takaichi became Japan\u2019s first woman prime minister on Tuesday, October 21. Sanae Takaichi is expected to support an ultra-loose BoJ monetary policy stance to boost the economy.\nSignificantly, the LDP-led coalition government is reportedly planning a stimulus package of more than $90 billion to support households struggling with high prices. Stimulus plans and expectations that Takaichi will influence the BoJ\u2019s rate path tempered market reaction to the September inflation data.\nUSD/JPY moved from 152.626 to 152.672 before dropping to a low of 152.575 following the release of the data. Notably, the USD/JPY pair has rallied 3.23% in October as traders considered Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s stance on monetary and fiscal policy.\nHowever, hopes for a December BoJ rate hike remain alive despite Takaichi\u2019s election victory. The next BoJ interest rate decision is on October 30, which will provide insights into policymakers\u2019 views on Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus plans and the Bank\u2019s policy outlook.\nThis week, board member Takata Hajime supported rate hikes ahead of Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s election win, reportedly stating:\n\u201cI believe that now is a prime opportunity to raise the policy interest rate. The once deeply entrenched norm has waned in Japan, that the price stability target has been almost achieved.\u201d\nNotably, the BoJ must weigh the benefits of a weaker yen boosting exports and the negative effects of higher import costs on households.\nOn Wednesday, October 22, former BoJ board member Eiji Maeda hinted at a December or January rate hike, stating:\n\u201cMoving too slowly in policy normalization would hurt people\u2019s livelihoods by weakening the yen and accelerating inflation.\u201d\nAs the dust settles from the inflation report, traders will now turn their attention to flash private sector PMI numbers.\nThe market focus will likely be on the Services PMI, given that the sector contributes over 70% to Japan\u2019s GDP. Economists forecast the S&P Global Services PMI to drop from 53.3 in September to 53.0 in October.\nA sharper drop in the headline PMI could signal a loss of economic momentum, potentially tempering bets on a BoJ rate hike. A more dovish BoJ policy stance may weigh on the Japanese yen. Conversely, a higher PMI reading could boost expectations of a BoJ rate hike.\nHowever, traders should also consider input and output prices and the employment sub-components. Softer wage growth, weaker output prices, and job cuts would support a delay to monetary policy tightening. On the other hand, higher wages, stronger output prices, and rising jobs would suggest a more hawkish rate path.\nAcross the Pacific, US S&P Global Services PMI and Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index numbers will fill an economic data void as the US government shutdown enters day 24.\nEconomists forecast the Services PMI to fall from 54.2 in September to 53.5 in October.\nA sharper drop toward the 50 neutral level would signal a marked loss of economic momentum, given that services contribute around 80% to US GDP. Additionally, traders should consider the employment and prices sub-components. Lower prices, job cuts, and slower services sector activity would support a more dovish Fed rate path, pushing USD/JPY toward 150.\nConversely, a pickup in services sector activity, higher prices, and rising employment could temper bets on multiple Fed rate cuts.

                "body": "The US Dollar continues its upward trend against the Japanese Yen, hitting 152.60. This marks the pair\u2019s appreciation for four consecutive days, driven by speculation about a potential large-scale stimulus programme in Japan.\nJapan Economic Stimulus Impact\nReports have surfaced about a possible USD 90 billion package aimed at mitigating rising household costs in Japan. This development is expected to impact Japan\u2019s public finances and has led to a weaker Yen. The rise in the US Dollar is supported by increased demand for safe havens amidst US-China trade tensions.\nConcerns over Japan\u2019s public finances are growing, particularly with the nomination of Sanae Takaichi as the new prime minister. Takaichi is anticipated to increase government spending, potentially challenging the Bank of Japan\u2019s monetary tightening plans.\nJapan\u2019s CPI data for September is expected to confirm rising inflationary pressures, which could support the Yen. This release will be watched closely, as higher inflation might reinforce the Bank of Japan\u2019s plans to raise interest rates.\nJapan\u2019s National Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the price fluctuation of goods and services. The next release is scheduled for October 23, 2025, with a consensus expectation of 2.9%, following a previous 2.7% reading.\nWith the US dollar pushing past 152.50 against the yen, the main driver is Japan\u2019s potential $90 billion stimulus package. This government spending suggests continued pressure on the yen, as it prioritizes economic growth over currency strength. The market is viewing this as a clear signal of ongoing yen weakness.\nIntervention Risk and Trading Strategies\nHowever, we must be extremely cautious at these levels, as this territory invites government intervention. Looking back, we saw Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance step in to buy yen and strengthen the currency in both late 2022 and the spring of 2024 as the dollar approached similar highs. The risk of a sudden, sharp reversal orchestrated by officials is now significantly elevated.\nTwo key inflation reports are creating major uncertainty in the immediate term. Tonight\u2019s Japanese CPI, with a consensus forecast of 2.9%, could offer temporary support to the yen if it comes in hot, while tomorrow\u2019s US CPI will determine the dollar\u2019s next move. These back-to-back data points make any directional bet highly speculative over the next 24 hours.\nFor traders wanting to follow the upward momentum, buying call options on USD/JPY is a direct play on continued yen weakness. This strategy allows profiting from a further rise while limiting downside risk to the premium paid, which is crucial given the intervention threat. The stimulus news and the new fiscally-dovish prime minister provide a strong fundamental basis for this view.\nGiven the high event risk, a volatility play may be more prudent for the coming days. Buying an options straddle or strangle allows a trader to profit from a large price swing in either direction following the inflation data, without needing to predict the outcome. This approach capitalizes on the current uncertainty itself rather than a specific directional bias.\nThe bigger picture remains the wide interest rate gap between the US and Japan. We remember the Bank of Japan only ended its negative interest rate policy in March 2024 and has been incredibly slow to raise rates since. This policy divergence with a still-hawkish Federal Reserve will likely keep the yen fundamentally weak for the foreseeable future, even if short-term pullbacks occur."

The GOP-backed stopgap bill failed to pass in the Senate for a 12th time on Wednesday evening.\nThe USD/CAD pair also appreciates as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) faces challenges on weaker Oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price depreciates after three days of gains, trading around $61.00 per barrel at the time of writing. However, the downside of crude Oil prices could be restrained due to increased supply concerns, driven by the fresh United States (US) sanctions on Russia's two biggest Oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from g"

                "body": "ING sees the Canadian dollar outperforming peers, but expects weaker US conditions and upcoming rate cuts to eventually push the currency lower against most major counterparts.\nabout 13 hours ago \u2022 1 min\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nThe Canadian dollar managed to hold its ground in October, even as the US dollar\u2019s rally left other major currencies like the euro and sterling trailing behind.\nWhat does this mean?\nGlobal banking group ING highlights that the Canadian dollar\u2014often dubbed the loonie\u2014has tracked US market sentiment closely, but it\u2019s been noticeably sturdier than most G10 currencies. This relative strength comes partly from less sensitivity to the US dollar\u2019s gains. Still, ING warns that shifting tides could be on the horizon: upcoming US employment and inflation reports may spark additional Federal Reserve rate cuts beyond those already priced in through early 2026. If both the Fed and the Bank of Canada move into rate-cutting mode, ING expects the loonie to slip against other G10 currencies, while the USD/CAD exchange rate could still hover above short-term fair value. Their forecast sees the pair drifting down to 1.38 by year-end but spiking as high as 1.41 if October brings fresh signals of Canadian rate cuts.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency trends drive market moves.\nInvestors have favored the Canadian dollar this fall, but currency swings could ramp up if the Bank of Canada turns dovish or if US economic data disappoints further. With the USD/CAD seen as overvalued, traders are likely to watch for sudden moves\u2014especially around interest rate decisions or headline economic numbers.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks chart a new course.\nRate cuts from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada would signal a shift toward looser money conditions into 2026. That change could redraw the map for global currencies, with countries\u2019 varying economic strengths and links to the US shaping the pace and path of future capital and trade flows.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 18 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Bank of Canada set to cut again despite inflation uptick\nLingering trade-induced uncertainty continues to weigh on Canadian activity and carries risks of broader jobs market deterioration. We expect the BoC to overlook higher-than-expected jobs and inflation data and cut by 25bp on 29 October. The door may be left open to more easing, and CAD should remain vulnerable against most of the G10\nSticky dovish pricing despite data\nOctober has delivered broadly hawkish hard data for the Bank of Canada. The September jobs report showed solid 60k employment gains while unemployment held stable at 7.1%. Earlier this week, headline inflation (also for September) rose faster than consensus to 2.4%, with both core measures \u2013 median and trim \u2013 also accelerating by 0.1-0.2% above 3.0%.\nYet, markets are pricing in 21bp of easing for the 29 October meeting. We are aligned with the consensus majority in expecting a 25bp cut to 2.25% next week. The rationale lies \u2013 once again \u2013 in the bleak Canadian economic outlook.\nActivity and jobs picture remains grim\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s quarterly Business Outlook Survey, published earlier this week, is a key input into policy decisions. The third-quarter release showed that while sentiment marginally improved relative to the second quarter, uncertainty around trade policy continues to weigh heavily on investment and hiring plans.\nThe \u201cfuture sales\u201d indicator dropped back into negative territory (with more companies reporting expected sales decreases) for the first time in 2025. And the percentage of respondents reporting that indicators of future sales have deteriorated is the highest since the pandemic.\nLabour market weakness remains the most sensitive and potentially actionable data for the Bank of Canada. Despite stable unemployment in September and slight improvements in hiring intentions, 63% of firms expect either unchanged (50%, down from 57% in the second quarter) or reduced (13%, up from 10% in the second quarter) workforce levels. Excluding the pandemic period, similar responses have historically coincided with higher unemployment rates \u2013 peaking at 7.3% in 2015 and 7.9% in 2003.\nUnemployment can rise further, based on BoC survey result\nInflation uptick not too concerning\nThe BoC survey also pointed to limited inflationary risks, with many firms stating that weaker demand is limiting their ability to pass higher costs through to their selling prices. Wage growth expectations for the next 12 months averaged 3.1% \u2013 a steady decline and notably below the 3.6% reported in the September jobs report.\nCombined with similar disinflationary trends in shelter costs as seen in the US, the BoC\u2019s baseline projection for CPI to average 2% in 2026\u201327 still appears realistic. As new economic forecasts are released at this October meeting, we expect the Governing Council to look through the September inflation uptick and proceed with a rate cut.\nCommunication has leaned dovish\nThe BoC\u2019s own communication is another factor contributing to our call for an October cut. Governor Tiff Macklem\u2019s 17 October speech \u2013 delivered after the jobs data but before the inflation release \u2013 downplayed employment gains and highlighted \u201cvery soft hiring\u201d across the economy, particularly in tariff-impacted sectors.\nThe statement accompanying the September rate cut also emphasised risks to growth and the labour market. In particular, it referred to uncertainty about USMCA renegotiations as a major risk. Despite an amicable meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US President Donald Trump earlier in October, there has been no tangible progress on trade relations, and the risk of tumultuous USMCA talks ahead is likely to weigh on the economic outlook.\nIt will be hard to shut the door to more cuts\nWhile the October statement and guidance may lean slightly more hawkish than September\u2019s, we believe it will be difficult for the BoC to signal the end of the easing cycle. Tariff-related risks remain elevated, and allowing mark"

                "body": "Technical Analysis And Historic Context\nThe GBP/JPY pair increased by 0.19% on Thursday, closing at 203.30, marking a 0.55% rise for the week. As Friday\u2019s Asian session commenced, it traded at 203.36, showing little change.\nTechnically, the pair dipped to a nine-day low of 200.68 on 17 October but has since recovered. The RSI indicates a bullish trend, suggesting potential resistance at 203.50 and 204.00, with a break above 204.00 potentially leading to a yearly high of 205.32. Support levels are seen at 203.00, 202.00, and the 20-day SMA at 201.87.\nThis week, the British Pound was most robust against the Japanese Yen. The heat map illustrates percentage changes among major currencies. For instance, the GBP showed a 0.43% change against the JPY. Christian Borjon Valencia authored this analysis, a retail trader since 2010, who began his career focusing on technical analysis.\nWith GBP/JPY trading around 203.36, the bullish momentum suggested by the Relative Strength Index is a key signal for us. We see this as a potential entry point for strategies designed to profit from upward movement. The pair\u2019s recent recovery from the 200.68 low on October 17 shows that buying interest is returning.\nFor the coming weeks, we could consider buying call options with a strike price near the 204.00 resistance level. A sustained break above this psychological barrier would open the door to retesting the yearly high of 205.32, which was set earlier this month on October 8. This makes short-term bullish plays particularly attractive right now.\nPolicy Influence And Interest Rate Dynamics\nThis upward pressure on the Pound is reinforced by the Bank of England\u2019s current policy stance. With UK inflation for September 2025 coming in slightly above target at 3.1%, the central bank is expected to keep interest rates elevated to manage price pressures. This hawkish outlook continues to provide fundamental support for Sterling.\nConversely, the Japanese Yen remains weak due to the Bank of Japan\u2019s persistent dovish policy. Recent economic data shows Japan\u2019s core inflation is still struggling to hold above the 2% target, giving the BoJ no reason to tighten its monetary policy. This growing interest rate differential between the UK and Japan is the main engine driving this currency pair higher.\nThis situation feels similar to the wide policy divergences we traded through back in 2022 and 2023, which created very strong trends. We are watching the 203.00 level closely as our first line of support. A break below this would signal that the bullish momentum is fading and would prompt us to hedge with put options."

Here's a look at her latest trades disclosed, which comes with increased attention on Congress Trades from retail traders.\nA new disclosure from Greene, which is tracked by the Benzinga\u2019s Government Trades page, reveals six stocks purchased in October along with one ETF.\nTrending: Amazon and NVIDIA Partnered With This Robot Chef \u2014 Now Individual Investors Can Too\nHere are the trades disclosed by the Greene, with several assets bought more than once:\n-\nAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE): $1,000 to $15,000 in shares bought on Oct. 15\n-\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n-\nAmazon.com Inc: $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 9\n-\nExelon Corp (NASDAQ:EXC): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n-\niShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n-\niShares Bitcoin Trust: $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 9\n-\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n-\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 15\n-\nUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS): $1,000 to $15,000 bought on Oct. 9\nOf the stocks bought, several come before quarterly earnings results with Tesla having reported on Oct. 22, UPS reporting on Oct. 28, Amazon reporting on Oct. 30 and Exelon reporting on Nov. 4.\nAll of the stocks and ETFs disclosed by Greene have previously been bought by her this year, including Adobe and the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which were disclosed as purchases by the congresswoman last month.\nAdobe and UPS are frequent purchases disclosed by Greene with the stocks bought in six and seven of the 10 months of 2025, respectively. Tesla stock has also been bought in five of the 10 months of the year now.\nGreene went several years without disclosing stock purchases before unveiling a handful in 2024 in May 2024. That disclosure has been followed up with trades every month or two, with each month in 2025 having at least one disclosure.\nSee Also: Missed Nvidia and Tesla?

One of her purchases came shortly before President Donald Trump announced he would make a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Greene is an ally of the president, who has helped boost the price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) with a pro-Bitcoin agenda since taking office in January.\nGreene's purchase of Palantir, while serving on the Committee on Homeland Security, drew increased scrutiny with the company having multiple government contracts.\nThe congresswoman has said that she has a portfolio manager who handles all of her trades. Greene brushed off criticism earlier this year over the timing of buying numerous stocks before Trump announced a pause on tariffs and sent stock prices significantly higher.\n\u201cI think that criticism is laughable. President Trump has been talking about tariffs for decades,\u201d Greene told reporters when asked about the trades at a recent town hall event in Georgia, in a clip shared by Unusual Whales.\nThe congresswoman used the opportunity to boast about her stock performance, which ranked her as one of the top trading members of Congress in 2024.\n\u201cI don\u2019t place my buys and sells,\" Greene said, citing an agreement she has with her portfolio manager, who handles all the buying and selling of stocks. \u201cHe did a great job. Guess what he did. He bought the dip. And that\u2019s what anybody that has financial sense does.\"\nGreene also said her portfolio manager did not have inside information; everything was public and a potential tariff pause wasn\u2019t a secret.\nSeveral Congress members have called for a ban on the buying and selling of stocks and options by membe"

After multiple red sessions, U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs staged a sharp rebound with combined inflows of $619 million, including $477.2 million into Bitcoin funds alone. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led with $210.9 million, reaffirming its dominance, followed by ARK 21Shares (ARKB) with $162.85 million, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC at $34.1 million, and Bitwise\u2019s BITB at $20.1 million. VanEck\u2019s HODL contributed $17.41 million, while smaller issuers\u2014Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, Invesco\u2019s BTCO, Franklin\u2019s EZBC, and Valkyrie\u2019s BRRR\u2014registered modest gains. Ethereum mirrored the strength, securing $141.7 million in inflows led by Fidelity\u2019s FETH ($59.1M) and BlackRock\u2019s ETHA ($42.5M). However, the surge proved fleeting. Within 24 hours, total withdrawals hit $120 million, with Bitcoin ETFs losing $101.29 million and Ethereum products shedding $18.77 million. Even amid redemptions, IBIT absorbed $73.6 million, a sign that longer-term holders remain active buyers despite shifting sentiment.\nBitcoin ETF Capital Structure and Market Influence\nThe scale of Bitcoin\u2019s ETF footprint remains formidable. Trading volume reached $6.58 billion, while cumulative net inflows stood near $61.87 billion. Total Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM) now hover at $146.27 billion, representing roughly 6.81% of Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization. By comparison, Ethereum ETFs recorded $2.63 billion in daily turnover and $25.81 billion in total AUM, equal to 5.66% of ETH\u2019s market value. This imbalance underscores Bitcoin\u2019s structural dominance; ETF flows for BTC remain the single most influential driver of market tone across the crypto spectrum.\nBTC-USD Price Map: Key Support and Resistance Zones\nBTC-USD trades near $110,000, slightly up on the week but still down about 3.4% over 30 days. The pivotal $107,000\u2013$108,000 support band defines the market\u2019s short-term survival zone, repeatedly tested since early October. A breakdown through this level risks exposing the $100,000 psychological pivot, while a firm reclaim of $113,000\u2013$115,000 could reestablish upside momentum toward the $120,000 reaction zone projected by harmonic models. Analysts continue to flag ETF flow direction as the deciding factor\u2014when daily creations exceed $300\u2013$500 million, Bitcoin tends to reclaim bullish momentum, but consistent -$100\u2013$200 million outflows usually drag the pair back into range-bound stagnation.\nInstitutional Flow Leadership and Market Dominance\nDespite volatility, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance within the ETF landscape is unchallenged. BTC commands nearly 59.3% of total crypto market capitalization, dwarfing Ethereum\u2019s 12.6%. Even on the outflow day, IBIT maintained inflows of +$73.63 million, while Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and Grayscale\u2019s GBTC saw exits of -$56.56 million and -$56.63 million respectively. Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization stands near $2.18 trillion, backed by $64 billion in 24-hour spot trading volume. That depth amplifies the influence of ETF creations\u2014each positive print in IBIT or ARKB represents systemic liquidity entering the ecosystem, directly impacting BTC-USD price resilience.\nInvestor Positioning and Demand-Side Fragility\nThe split between inflow and outflow sessions exposes the market\u2019s fragile balance. Tuesday\u2019s $477.2 million in Bitcoin ETF inflows reignited bullish sentiment, but the following $101.29 million outflow revealed how quickly optimism fades. The cumulative picture remains net positive, yet traders are wary: without sustained multi-day creation streaks above $300 million, demand-side fragility persists. "

                "body": "The next big crypto opportunity might not come from Ethereum (ETH), despite its dominance and impressive 2025 price projections that place it near $6,000. Instead, investors are turning their attention to a rising DeFi project priced at just $0.035, which many analysts believe could deliver returns far beyond Ethereum\u2019s. This new coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is rapidly being recognized as the best cryptocurrency to invest today, thanks to its innovative mechanics and strong market traction.\nCurrently in Phase 6 of its presale, already over 70% sold out and having raised more than $17.75 million, Mutuum Finance is building what experts call the next evolution of DeFi, a dual-lending ecosystem that merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract models to maximize capital efficiency and user control. If it reaches its projected $1 target, early investors could see returns exceeding 2,700%, easily outpacing Ethereum\u2019s gains and positioning Mutuum Finance as the breakout star of the next bull market.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Consolidation Before Its Next Big Move\nEthereum (ETH) is stabilizing after rebounding from its lower support line after a dramatic correction. The asset is trading in the triangle consolidation pattern, indicating market indecision as buyers and sellers battle for dominance. Having been rebuffed at the vicinity of the $4,250 resistance level, ETH is having trouble picking up momentum again, and a failure to recover this level could see another pullback towards the $3,800 support zone.\nThat said, as long as ETH holds its shape above key support, buyers are in wait mode for new upside momentum once this period of consolidation subsides. Since the future direction of Ethereum is still uncertain in the short term, investors looking for opportunities outside its current consolidation phase are beginning to look towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fledgling DeFi project building momentum for the next market cycle.\nMutuum Finance Presale Races Ahead\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is making a big splash in the DeFi world and wider crypto space, as increasing investor interest drives the project forward. Presale Phase 6 is currently 70% sold through, indicating positive market sentiment and increased interest. The token now trades at $0.035, which makes MUTM one of the best crypto projects for investors to target high-potential, early-stage DeFi. To date, over 17,370 investors have invested a total of over $17.75 million to purchase MUTM tokens, indicating the project\u2019s increasing popularity and traction among the cryptocurrency community.\nDual Lending Model\nMutuum Finance relies on a two-lending framework where customers are provided with unprecedented ease through Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Under the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) framework, lending pools are provided with access to smart contracts that can be designed to decide whether they will dynamically adjust interest rates as a function of how market conditions change. Fixed incomes are provided by lenders while borrowers are insured when they borrow.\nP2P model does not use middlemen to establish direct relationship between lending and borrowing parties. Any asset with price-risky demands such purely decentralized model completely within users\u2019 control.\nEthereum (ETH) is a still-holding good long-term investment, while pre-emergence opportunities such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are gaining more popularity for explosive growth opportunities. Prior to presale Stage 6 at $0.035 and more than 70% already sold, and having collected more than $17.75 million from 17,370+ investors, MUTM provides early birds with opportunities to gain from a twin-lending DeFi platform that includes Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract models in order to achieve maximum efficiency and control.\nWith its under-$1 price valuation, revolutionary lending mechanisms, and fast-expanding community, Mutuum Finance represents a once-in-a-lifetime chance for exponential gains before the next bull mar"

                "body": "Ethereum core developer Peter Szilagyi has criticized the blockchain\u2019s centralized nature and related administrative issues. This follows growing concerns from industry experts about the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s internal operations amid last year\u2019s funding scandal. However, the network has recorded massive adoption in the last 12 months as mainstream finance leans towards the industry.\nVitalik Determines What Succeeds- Szilagyi\nIn a letter revealed to the community, the core developer revealed several reasons why \u201cEthereum failed him\u201d despite working over the years. He criticized the influence of the high rollers around the network, pointing to increased centralization against the core values. In his view, Vitalik Buterin became a victim of his success, being at the center of everything about the projects.\nThis led to the Vitalik-centric approach because his opinions influenced what was permitted, the direction of the ecosystem. Furthermore, research, brainpower, and donations also contributed to the growing centralized nature. At the moment, this approach has created a small cabal of 5-10 people around Vitalik that determines what becomes successful.\n\u201cThe issue at this point isn\u2019t even Vitalik, but rather that we now do have a \u201cruling elite\u201d of Ethereum. New projects do not do public offerings anymore; they reach out to the same 5-10 people for initial investment or advisorship roles. Everyone realized that if you can get Bankless to invest, they\u2019ll sing odes on their podcast. If you can get researchers as advisors, you both solve hard problems, but also reduce perceived friction with the Ethereum mainnet,\u201d he added.\nPreviously, the early founders backed the decentralized dream before conference attendees began the pro-Vitalik approach. This has sparked stirs around digital asset circles with industry leaders pledging to return to decentralized ideals. Several analysts have also suggested that users have more trust in these systems over the traditional model.\nA similar issue arose when the network transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism after the merge. There were growing centralization concerns due to the staking cost. However, positives were pitched for the event, and more devs doubled down on the network. Ethereum remains the largest smart contract blockchain with growing decentralized finance (DeFi) activities.\nThe platform\u2019s native token, Ether, has also recorded significant success in the same period, attracting bullish investors. Despite the criticisms, Szilagyi heaped praise on the platform for being a positive force in the world, having had a major impact on traditional finance."

ETH\u2019s price surged 77% in Q3, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 6.4% gain, partly fueled by demand from Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies.\nBlackRock\u2019s ETHA led the pack, growing 266% and capturing 58% of the Ethereum ETF market. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs appeared to stabilize after their early 2024 boom, ending the quarter with $152.5 billion in AUM (+15% QoQ) and 1.36 million BTC held (6.9% of supply).\nStaking ETFs Mark a Structural Shift\nThe rise of staking-enabled ETFs highlights a deeper structural shift in crypto investment products.\nIn May 2025, the SEC clarified that protocol-level staking does not constitute a securities offering, removing a major legal barrier for ETF issuers.\nShortly after, REX-Osprey launched the first U.S. Ethereum Staking ETF (ESK) in September, offering investors both ETH price exposure and on-chain staking rewards. The fund passes 100% of staking yield to investors, targeting institutional income seekers.\nMajor players including BlackRock, 21Shares, and Grayscale have since filed to add staking features to their Ethereum ETFs. The SEC\u2019s decisions on these applications are expected between October and December 2025.\nTradFi and Crypto Converge\nQ3 also underscored the accelerating convergence between traditional finance and crypto. Banks, fintechs, and large enterprises are increasingly using blockchain for asset issuance, trading, and settlement.\nMessari notes that this shift has moved beyond experimentation. Crypto is now integrating into regulated financial infrastructure.\nCompanies like JPMorgan, SWIFT, Stripe, and Google Cloud are developing tokenized settlement systems and enterprise blockchains, signaling that institutional adoption is moving from pilots to production.\nWhy This Matters\nThe growing synergy between ETFs, staking, and enterprise blockchain adoption signals that digital assets are evolving into mainstream financial instruments. Crypto markets are becoming more regulated, yield-generating, and intertwined with the traditional capital systems.\nDiscover DailyCoin\u2019s hottest crypto news today:\nGreat Rotation Begins? $2.1T Gold Wipeout Powers $113K BTC\nBitcoin Flushes Out Leverage, Investors Start Quiet Accumulation\nPeople Also Ask:\nAn Ethereum ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a regulated investment vehicle that tracks the price of Ether (ETH), allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency.\nA spot Ethereum ETF directly holds ETH as its underlying asset, while a futures ETF uses derivatives contracts to track ETH\u2019s price. Spot ETFs are generally considered more transparent and aligned with actual market demand.\nEthereum ETFs hold ETH or ETH futures and issue shares that trade on traditional stock exchanges. The ETF\u2019s share price mirrors Ethereum\u2019s market value, giving investors price exposure through a brokerage account.\nEthereum ETFs make crypto exposure easier for institutional and retail investors by offering regulated, liquid, and tax-efficient access to ETH. They also help integrate crypto into mainstream financial markets."

                "body": "Meteora stands as a pioneering liquidity infrastructure, purpose-built on the Solana blockchain to maximize capital efficiency and sustainability in decentralized finance.\nIt transforms the static, passive nature of traditional automated market makers (AMMs) into a dynamic, responsive system.\nWhat is Meteora?\nMeteora is a comprehensive DEX and liquidity protocol that is foundational to the Solana DeFi ecosystem. It functions as a liquidity layer, not just a simple swap interface, powering transactions for other major protocols, such as Jupiter Swap. The protocol\u2019s ultimate vision is to create a secure, highly efficient, and composable liquidity environment.\nMeteora\u2019s key positioning is centered on leveraging Solana\u2019s high-throughput and low-cost environment to introduce liquidity primitives previously considered too complex or gas-intensive for other chains. Its focus is not merely on accumulating Total Value Locked (TVL) but on achieving capital efficiency, which is the ability to process massive trading volume with the least amount of capital.\nIts success is measured by its rapid integration and adoption across the Solana landscape, establishing itself as a top-tier DEX by volume and TVL.\nHow It Works\nMeteora achieves its unprecedented liquidity efficiency and yield optimization through a sophisticated, multi-pronged architecture that continuously manages capital across two primary innovative engines: the DLMM for active trading and the Dynamic Vaults for idle capital. These two systems work in tandem to ensure that liquidity providers\u2019 assets are always deployed in the most profitable and efficient manner possible.\nDynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM)\nThe DLMM is Meteora\u2019s flagship technology and a major evolution in the Automated Market Maker (AMM) landscape. It draws inspiration from concentrated liquidity models (like Uniswap V3) but introduces a critical architectural innovation: zero-slippage price bins and dynamic fees.\nBin-Based Liquidity Concentration\nUnlike traditional AMMs, where liquidity is spread evenly (Constant Product AMM) or across a single continuous range (Concentrated Liquidity AMM), the DLMM organizes liquidity into discrete, individual \u201cprice bins\u201d.\n- Discrete Bins: Imagine a book of discrete orders, but instead of orders, it contains liquidity. Each bin represents a very narrow, specific price point. LPs choose which bins to fund, allowing for extreme concentration of capital.\n- Zero Slippage: A key feature is that any trade that is executed entirely within an active price bin will experience zero slippage. Slippage is the difference between the expected trade price and the final execution price, a major hidden cost for traders. By ensuring zero slippage within a bin, Meteora offers a superior execution experience for high-volume traders.\n- Capital Efficiency: This bin-based system allows LPs to place their capital precisely around the current market price, ensuring that the entire deposited amount is actively earning fees. This level of precision is referred to as high capital efficiency, as it allows for deep liquidity provision with significantly less total capital.\nDynamic Fee Mechanism\nTo protect LPs from Impermanent Loss during volatile market conditions, the DLMM employs a dynamic fee structure.\n- Volatility Adjustment: The protocol continuously monitors market volatility and trading volume. When the market is calm, trading fees are kept low to attract volume. However, during periods of high volatility, the DLMM automatically and dynamically increases the swap fee (ranging from 0.15% to 15%).\n- Impermanent Loss Mitigation: This higher fee acts as compensation for LPs, offsetting the potential impermanent loss by generating higher returns in fees. This intelligent mechanism aligns incentives by rewarding LPs for providing capital when it is most needed, specifically during times of market stress.\nFlexible LP Strategies\nThe DLMM allows LPs to implement various customized strategies, going beyond"

                "body": "Authors: HY & Adam, Xianrang\nThe history of blockchain development has fully demonstrated that only business scenarios related to financial transactions can survive in Web3. Meanwhile, Real World Assets (RWA) ingeniously combine the respective advantages of real-world assets and on-chain trading, attempting to reshape the global financial landscape. Through blockchain technology, RWA transforms traditional assets such as commodities, credit, and equities into on-chain tokens, enabling efficient management and transfer of ownership while significantly lowering the barriers to trading financial assets.\nAccording to current data, the total market capitalization of RWAs, excluding stablecoins, has surpassed $33 billion, but this is only the beginning. According to Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the scale of on-chain RWAs is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030.\nThe potential of RWAs is undoubtedly enormous; however, where will the mainstream narrative of RWAs first come to fruition among public blockchains?\nAs the largest public chain in the DeFi sector, Ethereum accounts for over 50% of the RWA market share. Meanwhile, Solana, with its intensive ecosystem development efforts, holds 3.2% of the RWA market, ranking seventh among major public chains, which should not be underestimated. As giants like BlackRock introduce tens of billions of dollars worth of RWA assets onto Solana via the Securitized platform, its RWA ecosystem has entered a phase of rapid development.\nIn today\u2019s article, we will delve into Solana's current status within the RWA track, providing investors, developers, and industry observers with a comprehensive and systematic investigation.\nPanoramic Analysis of RWA Projects in the Solana Ecosystem\nMany users in the RWA market originate from traditional stock markets or commodity markets. For these individuals, whether the platform can respond to user requests quickly, providing low-latency and cost-effective trading experiences, is a critical factor.\nTo address transaction delays, many RWA projects adopt a strategy of absorbing deposits through multiple chains while settling transactions on a single chain. Solana, with its high TPS, is well-suited to serve as an execution platform for RWA operations. The fact that CMBMINT, the blockchain-based RWA fund launched by China Merchants Bank International, chose Solana for its debut underscores its appeal.\nMoreover, RWA applications typically involve a large volume of small transactions, such as rent distributions and interest payments. Excessively high gas fees could severely erode returns. For instance, Homebase, a well-known real estate tokenization platform, processes thousands of small rental payouts monthly. This micropayment model demands extremely low transaction fees, giving Solana an inherent advantage due to its ultra-low costs.\nData indicates that, although still in its early stages, Solana\u2019s RWA ecosystem has shown robust growth momentum. According to RWA.xyz, there are currently 94 types of RWA assets within the Solana ecosystem, with a total market value of $700 million. In the past 30 days, RWA transfers on the Solana chain reached $18 billion, making it second only to Ethereum in trading volume.\nAt present, Solana's RWA ecosystem has developed a diversified structure, encompassing a wide spectrum ranging from physical assets to financial instruments. Below, we will introduce typical RWA project cases categorized by type.\nGovernment Bonds\nCurrently, government bond tokenization is one of the primary and most popular types of RWA assets, as government bonds offer stable risk-free returns and have long been highly sought after in the financial markets. Compared to traditional financial markets, tokenized government bonds enable round-the-clock trading, allow retail participation through fractionalization, and can integrate with the DeFi ecosystem to enhance liquidity.\nBelow, we will analyze several typical cases.

                "body": "New York, NY \u2013 October 23, 2025 \u2013 The financial markets today presented a complex tapestry of forces, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) experiencing volatile movements as investors grappled with intensifying U.S.-China trade relations, a mixed bag of corporate earnings reports, and a significant surge in oil futures. While some sectors celebrated robust quarterly results, the overarching sentiment was one of cautious optimism, overshadowed by geopolitical risks and inflationary concerns. The immediate surge in oil prices, a direct consequence of new U.S. sanctions against Russian oil giants, injected fresh inflationary anxieties into an already delicate economic landscape, further complicating the Federal Reserve's monetary policy trajectory.\nThe market's performance on October 23rd reflected this push-and-pull dynamic. After a notable decline yesterday, major U.S. stock indexes, including the Dow, managed to advance today. However, this recovery unfolded amidst a backdrop of renewed U.S.-China trade friction and individual corporate earnings reports that delivered both pleasant surprises and significant disappointments, indicating a market grappling with uneven growth and heightened uncertainty.\nGeopolitical Headwinds and Corporate Resilience Shape Market Action\nThe intricate dance of global economics and geopolitics played out prominently in today's market movements. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) (NYSE: ^DJI) closed up 0.4% today, adding 107 points to reach 46,608.09. This rebound followed a volatile Wednesday, October 22nd, when the Dow shed 334 points, or 0.7%, primarily due to renewed U.S.-China trade tensions and some underwhelming tech earnings. Earlier in the week, on Tuesday, October 21st, the Dow had surged over 200 points (0.47%) to a new record high, buoyed by robust corporate performance. Year-to-date, the DJIA has posted a commendable 6% increase, while the S&P 500 (NYSE: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQ: ^IXIC) have climbed 14% and 17%, respectively, showcasing a broader market strength, particularly in technology.\nThe primary driver of market anxiety stemmed from escalating U.S.-China trade relations. High-level trade negotiations are set to resume in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from October 24th to October 27th, involving U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, alongside Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. These talks are critically timed, coinciding with the ASEAN summit, and precede a potential \"pull-aside\" meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, beginning October 31st. The renewed dialogue comes after China expanded export controls on rare earth materials earlier in October, prompting Washington to threaten additional tariffs of up to 100% on Chinese imports. Both nations also imposed arrival fees on each other's ships, indicating a significant escalation from a temporary tariff truce agreed upon in August.\nThird-quarter 2025 earnings season is largely concluding, revealing overall robust corporate performance, particularly within the technology and financial sectors. Over 80% of S&P 500 companies have surpassed earnings expectations, contributing to a projected 8.0% year-over-year earnings growth for the index. Notable positive reports included Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), which saw its shares jump nearly 3% after beating Q3 expectations, and 3M (NYSE: MMM), which posted strong earnings and raised its full-year guidance, driving its stock up 2.3%. General Motors (NYSE: GM) surged nearly 15% after raising its full-year guidance, while Danaher (NYSE: DHR) advanced 9% and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) climbed approximately 14% following strong results. Today, Dow Inc. (NYSE: DOW) shares surged 11%, and Honeywell International (NASDAQ: HON) advanced over 7% after their respective earnings releases.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a modestly lower open for the markets, with the S&P 500 futures down by 0.2 percent.\nThe downward momentum on Wall Street comes amid a negative reaction to corporate earnings news from companies like Tesla (TSLA) and IBM Corp. (IBM).\nShares of Tesla are tumbling by 3.7 percent in pre-market trading after the electric vehicle maker reported weaker than expected third quarter earnings despite record sales.\nTech giant IBM is also seeing substantial pre-market weakness after reporting third quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates but slowing growth in its core cloud computing business.\nOn the other hand, shares of Honeywell (HON) are likely to see initial strength after the industrial giant reported third quarter results that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.\nOngoing concerns about rising geopolitical tensions may also weigh on Wall Street after the Trump administration announced sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies.\nThe Treasury Department announced sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Russia's \"lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.\"\nPresident Donald Trump recently expressed some optimism about ending the drawn-out Russia-Ukraine war before suddenly canceling a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTrump's sudden shifts in opinion, particularly with regard to trade relations with China, have recently been a key source of volatility on Wall Street.\nFollowing the lackluster performance seen during Tuesday's session, stocks moved mostly lower during trading on Wednesday. The major averages all moved to the downside on the day, with the Dow pulling back off Tuesday's record closing high.\nThe major averages climbed well off their worst levels in late-day trading but remained firmly negative. The Nasdaq slumped 213.67 points or 0.9 percent to 22,740.40, the Dow slid 334.33 points or 0.7 percent to 46,590.41 and the S&P 500 fell 35.95 points or 0.5 percent to 6,699.40.\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index tumbled by 1.4 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index edged up by 0.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed by 0.7 percent.\nThe major European markets have also turned mixed on the day. While the German DAX Index is down by 0.2 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.2 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.6 percent.\nIn commodities trading, crude oil futures are soaring $2.94 to $61.44 a barrel after surging $1.26 to $58.50 a barrel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, after tumbling $43.70 to $4,065.40 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are jumping $53.80 to $4,119.20 an ounce.\nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 152.54 yen versus the 151.97 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1597 compared to yesterday's $1.1610.\nby RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com"

                "body": "Check out first look images of L.A.\u2019s trippy museum of AI arts \u2014 and its new opening plan\n- Share via\nAI is driving the stock market to record highs, dominating countless debates about the value of human labor, and radically rewiring the way schools approach education. It\u2019s also causing a stir in the art world, with media artist Refik Anadol poised to open Dataland, the world\u2019s first museum of AI arts, inside the Frank Gehry-designed Grand L.A. complex in downtown Los Angeles next spring.\nThe 25,000-square-foot museum was originally scheduled to open this year, but Anadol announced Thursday that the opening has been pushed back to spring 2026. Anadol also unveiled a sneak peak at the Infinity Room, one of the museum\u2019s five discrete galleries. The immersive room features Anadol\u2019s distinct swirling colors and images and will be infused with AI-generated scents, creating a multisensory experience powered by its very own AI model, called the Large Nature Model.\nAI is supplying powerful new tools at a fraction of the cost, forcing below-the-line artists to wonder if the future of filmmaking has a place for them.\nThe Infinity Room design dates back to 2014 when Anadol created his first immersive data sculpture at UCLA. He described it as an exploration into the future of the Light and Space movement. It was essentially a 12-by-12-foot cube, with mirrored walls, ceiling and floors. Projectors emitted pulses of black-and-white imagery that used data as a pigment. To date, the Infinity Room has toured 35 cities and been viewed by more than 10 million people.\n\u201cThe work emerged from my exploration of the idea that information can become a narrative material capable of transforming architectural space into a living canvas. The question driving me was simple but profound: What happens if there is no corner, no floor, no ceiling, no gravity?\u201d Anadol wrote about his concept for the Infinity Room in a blog post on his website. \u201cAt DATALAND, Infinity Room enters a new era. This iteration embodies the technical and conceptual leaps our studio has made over the past decade. Where the original used generative algorithms, this new incarnation incorporates our decade-long research into what I call \u201cmachine hallucinations\u201d \u2014 the dreamlike, surreal realities an AI can generate from vast datasets.\u201d\nIn an interview last year, Anadol said \u201cethical AI\u201d is essential to his practice. Unlike most large AI models, Anadol secured permission to use all of his sourced material, and said all of the studio\u2019s AI research was performed on Google servers in Oregon that use only renewable energy."

Its market value of about $33 billion now rivals that of better-known Japanese manufacturers such as air-conditioning maker Daikin 6367 and construction equipment manufacturer Komatsu 6301.\nUps and downs in global equities have been increasingly tied to the fortunes of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" U.S. technology companies at the forefront of AI development, including Nvidia NVDA, Amazon AMZN, and Microsoft MSFT.\nIn Japan, that euphoria has filtered down to major suppliers and investors in the AI sector, such as Advantest 6857, Tokyo Electron 8035 and SoftBank Group 9984. Those firms alone account for most of the Nikkei's gain since early September.\nFujikura, founded in 1885 during Japan's Meiji Era of modernisation, has been a focus for investors searching through the AI supply chain to find the next batch of winners.\n\"Generative AI is a big theme and key driver for the Japanese market,\" said Kazuaki Shimada, chief strategist at IwaiCosmo Securities. \"Now investors have started looking for new targets that may become the next Fujikura.\"\nMitsui Kinzoku 5706, which makes materials for data centre servers, is another AI-related high-flyer in the Japanese market, jumping 192% so far in 2025. Another supplier JX Advanced Metals 5016 has soared fourfold since its market debut in March.\nStarting out as a maker of silk and insulated wires, Fujikura went on to produce the world's first optical fibre in 1959. Those fibres are now a key component of AI data centres, with about 75% of the company's output going to overseas customers, such as Google owner Alphabet GOOG.\nA spokesperson said Fujikura had added capacity for fibre production at its existing facility in February, and it announced in August it would spend 45 billion yen ($298.45 million) to add another factory.\n($1 = 150.7800 yen)"

                "body": "I've bolded a section below that I think could be key to BOJ hold at its next meeting, October 29 and 30.\nJapan's core consumer inflation accelerated in September, keeping pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) ahead of its policy meeting next week, though a closer look at the data revealed a slowdown in the underlying trend.\nCore consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include fuel, rose 2.9% year-on-year, government data showed on Friday. This matched market forecasts and was an acceleration from the 2.7% rise in August, keeping inflation well above the central bank's 2% target.\nHowever, the BOJ's preferred \"core-core\" index, which strips out both food and volatile energy costs, provided a different picture. This gauge, seen as a better measure of underlying demand, rose 3.0%, marking a slowdown from the 3.3% increase in August.\nThe headline acceleration was driven by a renewed rise in energy costs and stubbornly high food prices, which climbed 7.6%.\nA key sign of weakness for the BOJ was the persistent lag in service-sector inflation, which rose just 1.4%. This slow pace, far behind the 4.2% jump in goods prices, indicates that firms are only gradually passing on higher labour costs\u2014a crucial prerequisite for the BOJ to resume its rate-hike cycle.\nAnalysts noted this mixed report gives the BOJ cover to remain cautious. \"As things stand, both inflation... are on track to meet or overshoot the BOJ's forecast for the ongoing fiscal year,\" said Abhijit Surya, senior economist at Capital Economics. \"Even so, the Bank's messaging has remained cautious... and it doesn't suggest that a rate hike is imminent.\" Surya projects the BOJ will wait until January before hiking rates from their current 0.5% level.\n---\nThis mixed report will likely reinforce the Bank of Japan's cautious, \"wait-and-see\" stance, which should put downward pressure on the Japanese Yen (JPY). While the 2.9% headline figure keeps rate-hike expectations on the table, traders will likely focus on the slowdown in the \"core-core\" index and weak service inflation. This reduces the immediate pressure on the BOJ to hike, which in turn should support Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and provide a tailwind for the Nikkei, as a weaker yen benefits exporters."
