                "body": "Gold, inflation and Social Security: Protecting your purchasing power in 2026\nFor millions of retirees and near-retirees, Social Security is more than a line item in the budget \u2014 it's the backbone of their monthly cash flow. But as prices keep shifting and Social Security cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) lag behind real-world expenses, that dependable monthly check that you get in retirement doesn't always stretch as far as expected. In turn, the question many households are now asking is whether their Social Security benefits will actually keep up with their expenses this year.\nInflation doesn't have to be dramatic to do damage, either. Today's inflation rate is much lower than it was and has dropped dramatically compared to recent peaks. But even modest price increases in essentials like housing, healthcare and groceries can erode purchasing power over time, especially when your income is largely fixed. And while Social Security's annual COLA is designed to help, it's based on a broad inflation measure that doesn't always reflect retirees' highest costs.\nThat's where diversification with assets like gold enters the conversation. For many older Americans, holding gold can smooth the gap between the benefits they receive and their actual expenses. But how exactly can gold protect your purchasing power in 2026? That's what we'll detail below.\nStart protecting your retirement portfolio with gold and silver now.\nGold, inflation and Social Security: Protecting your purchasing power in 2026\nWhile Social Security provides an essential baseline income, retirees can use gold to try and protect their purchasing power from the impacts of inflation and other economic hurdles this year. Here's how it works:\nGold typically moves in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar\nYour Social Security check is paid in dollars, which means every benefit payment is only as valuable as the currency backing it. Over the past few years, inflation has weakened the dollar's purchasing power significantly and uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy keeps currency stability in question.\nThe value of gold typically rises, though, when the dollar weakens, creating a natural hedge. This inverse relationship means that while retirees have watched their fixed benefits buy less at the checkout counter, gold holders have seen their assets appreciate substantially. So, by holding gold right now, the future appreciation of that asset may help compensate for what your Social Security check increasingly can't cover.\nDiversify your retirement portfolio with precious metals now.\nGold prices tend to respond to economic realities\nThe 2026 cost-of-living adjustment was calculated using inflation data from mid-2025, which means your raise reflects yesterday's economy, not today's prices. This structural lag is built into Social Security's design, and it can force retirees to play catch-up with their finances.\nGold doesn't operate on a government calendar, though. When inflation pressures build, when the Fed signals policy shifts or when currency concerns emerge, gold prices tend to adjust quickly. That responsiveness has proven valuable in recent years as inflation has surged and receded unpredictably.\nGold provides stability independent of policy decisions\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates in late 2025 but held rates steady at its first meeting of 2026, and the debates continue regarding the right approach to managing inflation over the rest of this year. These types of policy decisions directly impact your dollar-denominated Social Security benefits through their effects on currency value and price levels.\nPhysical gold exists outside this system entirely. Central banks can't print more of it, monetary policy can't devalue it through decree and it carries no counterparty risk like bank deposits or government bonds. That independence becomes increasingly valuable when economic policy creates uncertainty about your fixed income's future purchasing power.\nGold helps"

                "body": "Gold Price Surges Above $5,500: Here\u2019s Why\nFund managers say structural distrust in monetary policy is pushing gold to new record highs.\nKey Takeaways\n- The price of gold has surged above $5,500, reflecting a structural erosion of trust in monetary policy, fiscal discipline and US political stability, fund managers say.\n- Central banks\u2019 persistent buying of gold has broken its historical link to real yields, reshaping how the metal behaves during interest rate cycles.\n- Profit-taking and dollar strength may trigger pullbacks, but the forces underpinning gold are seen remaining firmly intact.\nThe price of gold is staging a historic rally, and while investors often flock to precious metals as a safe haven in times of turmoil, fund manager say the gains reflect deeper concerns about monetary policy and geopolitical tensions. These forces driving gold higher, they say, could easily continue.\nGold pushed to a new all-time high Thursday, touching USD 5,555, which translates into a 100% gain over the last twelve months. The move is not just another safe-haven spike. It reflects a deeper re-pricing of monetary credibility, geopolitical risk and portfolio construction, which will shape gold\u2019s trajectory into 2026.\nGold Price Snapshot\n- Jan. 28 close price: USD 5,419\n- 12-month return: +100%\n- YTD return: +19.5%\n- Central bank buying: 297 tonnes (January\u2013November 2025)\nThe New York spot gold price is up 19.5% in the year through Jan. 28, marking its best start to a year since 1980, when it rallied about 20.1% in US dollar terms over the same period.\n\u201cGold\u2019s record highs are not pricing imminent crisis, but a world of persistent instability, heavy debt burdens and eroding monetary trust,\u201d says Diego Franzin, head of portfolio strategies at Plenisfer Investments.\nWhy Gold Prices Are Rising\nFund managers and analysts point to a list of reasons for the rapid rise in gold prices. One factor that predates this year\u2019s spike in geopolitical volatility is central banks\u2019 persistent buying of gold on the global market, amounting to 297 tons from January to November 2025. \u201cTheir demand is strategic, not opportunistic, aimed at reducing exposure to currencies vulnerable to political influence,\u201d says Diego Franzin, head of portfolio strategies at Plenisfer Investments.\nGeopolitical unrest, including US-China competition, Russia-NATO tensions, and regional conflicts, have encouraged investors to reassess the concentration of risk within the global security and financial systems. \u201cThis reassessment has prompted central banks, particularly in emerging markets, to diversify away from US dollar-denominated reserves, a process that has increasingly involved the accumulation of gold,\u201d says Kenneth Lamont, principal, manager research at Morningstar.\nThat may help explain why the longstanding inverse relationship between gold and real interest rates \u2013 which are nominal interest rates adjusted for inflation \u2013 seems to have broken down since 2022-2023, when despite a sharp rise in real interest rates, gold prices also climbed moderately.\nTrump, US Deficits, and the Future of Gold\nMore recently, gold has rallied further, regardless of higher real yields and fading expectations of Fed rate cuts in 2026. Concerns about the US political environment are also a key factor, fund managers say.\nAccording to George Cotton, portfolio manager at Bank J. Safra Sarasin, the key variable is what happens next within the US administration as approval ratings slide and midterm elections approach. If US President Donald Trump shifts toward the middle ground on some contentious policies, especially trade and defense, that could take the wind out of the gold rally\u2019s sails.\nBut if the Trump administration continues on it\u2019s current course, that is more fuel for the rally, Cotton says. \u201cThe fragmentation of Trump\u2019s inner circle encourages populist operators to stay the course and further reinforce the America First doctrine, keeping the positive factors for gold firmly in place.\u201d\nAcco"

                "body": "Fed Chair Jerome Powell surprised some investors Wednesday afternoon with his comments about the gold and silver rally. The two precious metals, the most classic of the \u201csafe-haven\u201d assets, have the tangibility and inherent scarcity to act as a hedge in moments of turmoil, particularly when investors worry that politics or policy could undermine the value of the dollar or U.S. government bonds.\nThat is why the metals\u2019 relentless rally to record highs since late last year\u2014gold is up 84% year over year and silver up a whopping 245%\u2014has drawn attention from analysts. In recent months, market commentary has split the move into two distinct narratives. \u201cThe argument can be made that we\u2019re losing credibility or something,\u201d Powell acknowledged before insisting that\u2019s \u201csimply not the case.\u201d Just look at where inflation expectations are, he pointed out: \u201cOur credibility is right where it needs to be.\u201d\nIf investors believed inflation would remain persistently above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the case for a structural move into gold would be stronger. Instead, Powell noted, short-term inflation expectations have \u201ccome way down,\u201d while longer-term measures remain consistent with 2% inflation.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take much message macroeconomically from that,\u201d Powell said in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Matt Egan about gold and silver during his press conference. Investors feel differently, with gold and silver at the heart of two contentious trades.\nThe first is the \u201cSell America\u201d trade: a short-term, event-driven reaction in which investors rotate out of U.S. assets in response to political shocks, policy uncertainty, or some other kind of sudden change in trade or fiscal outlooks. Episodes such as the \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs and renewed volatility in the dollar have fed that narrative, linking gold\u2019s rise to a temporary loss of confidence in U.S. markets.\nThe second is the more structural \u201cdebasement trade.\u201d That view holds that persistent fiscal deficits, rising debt, and long-run expansionary policy will ultimately erode the purchasing power of the dollar over time, pushing investors toward hard assets like gold regardless of near-term market moves.\nHere\u2019s why Powell isn\u2019t bothered\u2014maybe to his detriment.\nAnother record high, a dismissal from the Fed chair\nOn Wednesday, gold hit yet another record high, while silver reached a multiyear high earlier in the week. Powell explained that a truly sustained loss of confidence would show up not in asset prices alone, but in unanchored inflation expectations.\n\u201cSo we look at those things,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get spun up over particular asset price changes, although we do monitor them, of course.\u201d\nPowell did not directly address the longer-term debasement argument, but his emphasis on anchored expectations suggests the Fed sees little evidence that the gold rally reflects a fundamental erosion of monetary credibility. Some economists agree, including analysts at the Bank for International Settlements, who have argued that retail investors have pushed gold away from its traditional safe-haven role and toward behavior more typical of a speculative asset.\nOthers remain less convinced. Mohamed El-Erian, former chief executive of Pimco, has long pointed to the metals as a signal that \u201cpeople have lost trust in the U.S. to be a responsible steward of the international system.\u201d\nThat interpretation aligns more closely with the classical framing of gold as a barometer of confidence. \u201cGold is the inverse of confidence,\u201d Max Belmont, a portfolio manager at First Eagle Investments, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s a hedge against unexpected inflation, unanticipated market drawdowns, and flare-ups in geopolitical risk.\u201d"

                "body": "EUR/USD strengthens above 1.1950 amid US trade policy uncertainty, Fed independence concerns\n- EUR/USD gathers strength around 1.1965 in Friday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- Concerns over US trade policy uncertainty and the Fed\u2019s independence continue to weigh on the US Dollar.\n- Trump said he would announce his nominee to chair the Fed next week.\nThe EUR/USD pair gains ground to near 1.1965 during the early Asian session on Friday. Unpredictable US trade policy and questions over the independence of the Federal Reserve (Fed) weigh on the US Dollar (USD) against the Euro (EUR).\nThe Greenback faced some selling pressure earlier this week after US President Donald Trump seemed to shrug off the currency's weakness, though it recovered some lost ground after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said a day later that Washington has a strong-dollar policy. Concerns over US policy volatility could undermine the Greenback and create a tailwind for the major pair in the near term.\n\"Concerns that investors have about trade and geopolitical policies that have been wheeled out in the U.S. at the moment have been potentially negative for the dollar,\" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank.\nTrump said that he would announce his nominee to chair the Fed \u201cnext week\u201d and reiterated his expectation that the central bank\u2019s new leader will lower interest rates. This headline raises worries about the independence of the US central bank and might contribute to the USD\u2019s downside.\nTraders await the preliminary reading of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the fourth quarter (Q4) from the Eurozone and Germany, which will be published on Friday. Also, the flash German Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is due later in the day. However, if the reports show weaker-than-expected outcomes, this could drag the shared currency lower against the USD. On the US docket, the Producer Price Index (PPI) report and Fed\u2019s Alberto Musalem speech will be closely watched.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directl"

                "body": "All Things Forex | Oct 06, 2008 08:00PM ET\nThe EUR USD rallied on Tuesday as the Federal Reserved announced a plan to buy commercial paper. This action amounts to a direct loan to businesses which puts taxpayers at risk. The announcement of the plan almost immediately triggered buying in the EUR USD as traders perceived this a gesture that could weaken the Dollar. The EUR USD also strengthened during a talk by Bernanke when he made comments which open the door to a possible interest rate cut. Look for traders to continue to buy Euros if the Fed goes ahead with its current plan to buy commercial paper. At this time the Fed is only supporting one side of the market. If the Fed alters its current plan and decides to back both sides of the commercial paper market, the Dollar may strengthen. Based on how the plan is currently written, the Dollar is vulnerable to the downside.\nThe GBP USD found support on Tuesday and posted a small gain as some confidence returned to the Pound. Traders supported the Pound today because talks have begun between financial institutions and the Bank of England regarding a bailout. Some feel the possible plan is too late as the credit crisis has already driven the U.K. economy into a recession. Whatever plan the Bank of England comes up with is expected to be short-lived as their solution is likely to be short-term driven until the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECB all get together to shore up financial institutions. Look for support to build if the Bank of England follows through with its plan, but be aware that this market will break lower if talks stall.\nThe USD JPY started the day strong as equity markets rallied early when the Fed announced that they were buying commercial paper. Traders at that time felt that the plan would unlock the credit markets. This news brought some confidence to the carry traders who sought better returns with higher risk assets. As it became clear to the equity traders that the plan was incomplete and offered limited guarantees the stock market sold off, forcing the carry traders to exit their positions. With the trend down, continue to look for more downside pressure until the stock market builds a base and rallies. Until this happens, look for opportunities to get short.\nThe USD CHF traded lower on Tuesday as traders sought the safety of the Swiss Franc. The losses were somewhat subdued as some traders still believe the Swiss economy is overexposed to the weakening Euro Zone economy and beleaguered European financial institutions. Trade this market carefully as it seems to be following a different set of fundamentals. Trend traders should continue to look for breaks to buy.\nThe USD CAD continued to weaken but the rate of loss slowed somewhat as commodity markets posted gains. The Canadian economy is struggling because almost half of it relies on commodity markets such as wheat, gold and crude oil. With a global recession looming, traders are looking for a further decline in commodity prices. This should continue to put pressure on the Canadian Dollar. The credit crisis has also affected the Canadian economy to the point where the Bank of Canada is now leaving as much as $1.34 billion in the Large Value Transfer System. The average amount is $25 million. This is being read as the BoC\u2019s attempt to encourage lending between banks. Continue to look for a higher USD CAD as commodity prices are still searching for a bottom.\nThe AUD USD weakened as the Reserve Bank of Australia unexpectedly cut interest rates by 1%. The RBA is making a strong statement that the Australian economy is being crippled by the credit crisis. Furthermore the move is basically calling out the other major central banks to take action immediately. In defense of the other majors, Australia may be a little late to the game as they have kept rates substantially higher than the rest of the world for some time. If anything, this action is an indication that the RBA is prepared to act aggressively to allevi"

At the time of writing, the pair trades at 1.3779, down 0.18%\nSterling tumbles as the Fed signals labor market stability, lifting the Dollar and pressuring risk assets\nOn an abrupt move, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the buck\u2019s value against six currencies, is up 0.65% to 96.40, a headwind for Sterling.\nThe US Dollar\u2019s gains and the fall of US equities sent Gold, Silver and risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum plunging across the board.\nAside from this, on Wednesday, the Fed held rates unchanged at the 3.50%-3.75% range to assess the impact of 75 basis points of easing during the second half of 2026. The decision was by majority on a 10-2 vote split, with Governors Waller and Miran opting for a quarter of a percentage point cut.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell dodged political questions, like the US Dollar\u2019s value and whether he would stay as Governor towards the end of his period in 2028. Nevertheless, he advised his successor, saying, \u201cStay out of elected politics.\u201d\nRegarding the economy, Powell commented that it remains solid, that the risks of a jump in the unemployment rate have diminished, but not so high prices. Hence, he shifted towards a neutral stance, as he wants to assess the impact of last year\u2019s three rate cuts and see what data warrants, regarding setting monetary policy.\nOn the data front, US Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending January 24, exceeded estimates of 205K, rose by 209K, below the previous print of 210K.\nAcross the pond, the UK docket remains absent with traders' focus on the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) monetary policy decision next week. Meanwhile, domestic political issues inside the Labour Party. Chris Turner, head of forex strategy at ING, mentioned that \u201cUK politics may well take its toll on sterling again over the coming months.\u201d\nGBP/USD Price Forecast: Technical outlook\nGBP/USD remains upwardly biased, despite falling to a two-day low of 1.3742, before recovering some ground. For a bullish resumption, the pair needs to close daily above 1.3800, keeping buyers hopeful of testing higher prices. On the downside, buyers\u2019 last line of support would be the January 27 daily low of 1.3668, before clearing the path towards 1.3600.\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "AUD/USD falls toward 0.7000 after pulling back from three-year highs\n- AUD/USD retreated after reaching a three-year high of 0.7094 on Thursday.\n- Australia\u2019s PPI rose 3.5% YoY in Q4 2025, unchanged from the pace seen in Q3.\n- The US Treasury said China\u2019s large external surpluses reflect a substantially undervalued exchange rate.\nAUD/USD loses ground after three days of gains, trading around 0.7030 during the Asian hours on Friday. The pair remains subdued following the release of Australia\u2019s Producer Price Index (PPI), which climbed 3.5% year-over-year (YoY) in the fourth quarter of 2025, the same pace as in Q3.\nHowever, the Australian Dollar (AUD) may regain its ground as hotter-than-expected Australian inflation data, released earlier this week, boosted the odds of a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rate hike as early as next week.\nMarkets now price in over a 70% chance of a 25-basis-point (bps) hike by the RBA from the 3.6% cash rate, up from 60% before the release, with rates fully priced at 3.85% by May and around 4.10% by September.\nUS Treasury noted in a semi-annual foreign-exchange report released on Thursday, \u201cGiven China\u2019s extremely large and growing external surpluses and now substantially undervalued exchange rate, it is important that the Chinese authorities allow the RMB exchange rate to strengthen in a timely and orderly manner in line with macroeconomic fundamentals,\u201d reported by Bloomberg.\nBloomberg also reported late Thursday that US President Donald Trump said that he will announce his choice to replace Jerome Powell as the chair of the Federal Reserve (Fed) on Friday morning. Trump said that his pick will do a \"good job\" and that he wants the US central bank to cut rates when there are signs of economic growth.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Iron Ore falls. Higher Iron Ore prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance for Australia, which is also pos"

                "body": "Australia\u2019s quarterly CPI report kept inflation above the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s target band, but not convincingly enough to lock in a February rate hike. While trimmed mean inflation remains uncomfortably high, bond markets and the Australian dollar both signalled a degree of scepticism, suggesting the data failed to materially shift policy expectations.\nView related analysis:\n- The US Dollar\u2019s Demise Could Just Be Getting Started\n- ASX 200 Holds Gains as Jobs Data Fails to Derail Risk Rally\n- Australian Dollar Rallies as Trump Eases Tariff Fears, Wall Street Rebounds\nCPI Fails to Seal RBA Hike as Australian Dollar Trades Mixed\nThe RBA has held its overnight cash rate (OCR) at 3.6% for four consecutive meetings. While it has yet to confirm that the easing cycle is over, many suspect it is. A strong December employment report last week saw RBA cash rate futures price in roughly a 60% chance of a February hike. That said, the decisive test was always going to be today\u2019s quarterly CPI report.\nSource: ABS, LSEG\n- Trimmed mean CPI increased to 3.4% y/y to mark its first quarter outside the upper band of the RBA\u2019s 1-3% target since Q4 2024\n- Trimmed mean also rose 0.9% q/q, up from 1% in Q3, dragging its 4-quarter average up to 0.83% (3.3% annualised)\n- CPI increased to 3.8% y/y, up from 3.4% prior\n- Housing increased 5.5% y/y and was the main contributor to the headline figure\n- Within housing, electricity has risen 21.5% y/y, rents were up 3.9%\nWhile inflationary pressures persist and keep the prospect of a hike alive, I\u2019m not convinced these numbers alone seal the deal. Yes, the RBA has reason to be concerned. But it has also become far more reserved when it comes to rate decisions in recent years \u2014 not to mention that further hikes are a political hot potato for a supposedly independent central bank. I\u2019d also be surprised if the RBA moved ahead of the RBNZ, a central bank not known for sitting idle for long.\nStill, the recent run of firm data overall paves the way for a hawkish tone. Expect the RBA to keep its finger hovering over the hike button and reiterate that policy decisions will continue to be made on a \u2018meeting-by-meeting\u2019 basis.\nAustralian Dollar Rally Mutes CPI Impact\nAny impact this inflation report was supposed to have on the Australian dollar has been largely muted by the strong rally leading into it. A sharply weaker US dollar, alongside surging gold and silver prices, catapulted the Aussie to an 11-month high ahead of the CPI figures, leaving little room for upside surprise for AUD/USD bulls. Add to that the fact the 3-year yield \u2014 a proxy for RBA policy expectations \u2014 is 5 basis points lower, and it\u2019s clear this CPI release has not provided the certainty of a hike that RBA bulls were hoping for.\nSource: ICE, TradingView\n- AUD/CAD is flat on the day after meeting resistance at its 2023 high and handing back its 40-pip pre-CPI advance.\n- The Aussie is also flat against the euro. While AUD/EUR remains in an uptrend, two shooting-star candles warn of trend exhaustion and the risk of at least a minor pullback.\n- AUD/JPY is ticking higher for a second day from trend support, though these gains are modest relative to the volatile two-day retracement from just beneath its 2024 high.\n- The Aussie has also handed back earlier gains against the British pound, with AUD/GBP hinting at a near-term cycle high \u2014 potentially bullish for GBP/AUD over the near term.\n- AUD/USD is retracing from the 70-cent handle \u2014 an obvious level for a breather given the strength of the rally into these levels.\n- Australia\u2019s 3-year yield is on track for a\n- bearish outside day, hinting at fading conviction among bond traders for an imminent RBA hike.\nView the full economic calendar\n-- Written by Matt Simpson\nFollow Matt on Twitter @cLeverEdge\nHow to trade with City Index\nYou can trade with City Index by following these four easy steps:\n- Open an account, or log in if you\u2019re already a customer\n\u2022 Open an account in the UK\n\u2022 Open an account in"

                "body": "USD/JPY took center stage in early trading on Friday, January 30, as market focus shifted to the Japanese economy and the Bank of Japan.\nCrucial retail sales, inflation, and labor market data from Japan fueled speculation about an April BoJ rate hike amid ongoing chatter of yen intervention threats.\nThe USD/JPY pair continued trading below the crucial 155 level after plunging from 159.225 to 152.092 in a three-session sell-off.\nA hawkish BoJ policy outlook, warnings of yen interventions, and US dollar weakness continue to support a bearish medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nOn January 30, Tokyo inflation, retail sales, and labor market data contrasted with the BoJ\u2019s upbeat quarterly economic projections for 2026.\nTokyo\u2019s annual inflation rate slipped from 2.0% in December to 1.5% in January, while the so-called core-core inflation eased to 2.0% (December: 2.3%), holding at the BoJ\u2019s 2% target.\nAs a leading indicator of national inflation, January\u2019s figures potentially cooled bets on an April BoJ rate hike.\nMeanwhile, retail sales fell 0.9% month-on-month in December, following November\u2019s 1.1% rise. Retail sales trends are a key focal point for the BoJ, given that private consumption accounts for around 55% of Japan\u2019s GDP.\nNevertheless, a stable labor market, with unemployment holding at 2.6% in December, supports wage growth. Typically, strong wage growth boosts spending, fueling demand-driven inflation, while driving economic momentum.\nThe Japanese economic data followed last week\u2019s BoJ decision to keep interest rates at 0.75%, aligned with market expectations. However, the BoJ\u2019s quarterly outlook report showed upward revisions to inflation and GDP growth for 2026 from the previous quarter.\nLast week, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated that rate hikes would continue if the economy and prices moved in line with forecasts.\nUSD/JPY responded to the weaker-than-expected economic indicators, rising from 152.889 to 153.292, reflecting a less hawkish BoJ rate path. However, the BoJ\u2019s forecasts suggest a pickup in inflation and consumption, supporting the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nAdditionally, the unexpected fall in retail sales may reflect the lingering effects of the weaker yen pushing import prices higher. Rising import prices erode Japanese households\u2019 purchasing power, another concern among the BoJ\u2019s board members. A more hawkish BoJ rate path would strengthen the yen, soften import prices, and boost households\u2019 purchasing power.\nMeanwhile, economists have also taken a more upbeat outlook on the Japanese economy, as tariff risks and inflationary pressures on households abated. East Asia Econ commented:\n\u201cJapan\u2019s economy in 2025 suffered not one but two shocks: the tariff hit to business, and the inflation shock to households. Both have now lifted, with consumer confidence in Jan the highest since 2023. That helps the cycle. And snow aside, means Feb isn\u2019t a bad time for the LDP to try an election.\u201d\nEast Asia Econ referred to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s first national election after heading the Liberal Democratic Party in October. The national election will take place on February 8. USD/JPY rallied from 147.819 on October 3 to a January high of 159.454 amid concerns about Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal spending plans and Japan\u2019s 240% debt-to-GDP ratio.\nLater on Friday, US economic indicators will influence expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and buying interest in the US dollar.\nEconomists forecast producer prices will rise 2.9% year-on-year in December, down from 3.0% in November.\nIn-line or softer-than-expected producer prices would raise expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. A more dovish Fed policy stance would weaken demand for the US dollar, supporting the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nThis week, the Fed kept interest rates at 3.75%, citing a resilient"

The pair trades near 153.50 at the time of writing, consolidating its recovery from three-month lows near 152.00, as the focus shifts to the Tokyo CPI reading, due later on the day.\nThe Yen went through a significant pullback on Wednesday, following comments by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who affirmed that Washington is pursuing a strong Dollar policy. Bessent also played down speculation about a US-Japan coordinated plan to support the Yen, a rumour that sent the pair tumbling last Friday.\nBoJ remains committed to higher interest rates\nPreviously, the Yen had been supported by the hawkish tone shown by the minutes of the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) latest monetary policy meeting. The BoJ\u2019s committee shared the scenario of rising inflationary pressures, a weak Yen, and wage growth, which paves the path for further monetary tightening.\nIn that sense, Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI), due later on Thursday, will be closely watched for confirmation of those theories. Consumer inflation in Japan\u2019s capital eased to 2% year-on-year in December from 2.7% in November, and the market consensus for the core CPI suggests that price pressures moderated further in January, which, if confirmed, could add negative pressure on the Yen.\nIn the US, the main focus on Thursday will be on the US initial Jobless Claims, which are expected to have ticked up to 205k in the week of January 24, from 200k in the previous one. Apart from that, Factory Orders are expected to have bounced up in November, while, on the negative side, the deficit on goods and services trade is forecasted to have widened in November.\nEconomic Indicator\nTokyo Consumer Price Index (YoY)\nThe Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Statistics Bureau of Japan on a monthly basis, measures the price fluctuation of goods and services purchased by households in the Tokyo region.

                "body": "As intervention risks continue to stay heightened, there is plenty of uncertainty with regards to the USD/JPY outlook in the short-term. What is the trigger point for the ministry of finance (MOF) to take action? At what levels will they be comfortable with USD/JPY trading in the aftermath? Without any real change to the fundamental drivers, what happens when the pair rebounds higher after a few weeks/months?\nThe Takaichi trade is still the main risk for the Japanese yen at the moment and Tokyo officials certainly know that. The good news that they can bank on right now is that the US dollar is also at weak extremes and looking very vulnerable. And also the fact since the Bank of Japan (BOJ) meeting, the bond market has calmed down considerably.\nSo far, they have only gone as far as performing a couple of 'rate checks' since last Friday. That is keeping the yen currency from crumbling, with it having fallen alongside the dollar before that. But even so, all we're seeing is a push down in USD/JPY from 159.00 levels to 153.00 levels currently. The pair is still up 4% from the gap higher in early October, which marked the commencement of the Takaichi trade.\nSo, what happens now to USD/JPY?\nBofA argues that there is a balance to be struck and that might fit with a USD/JPY range of around 145 to 155 in the near-term.\n\"According to the Tankan survey, large manufacturers assume average USD/JPY rate for FY25 to be 146.50.. USD/JPY's drop below 145 appears undesirable in the near-term. 145-155 range may strike a fine balance between stability in the equity market and the bond market. However, a volatile selloff in USD/JPY below 150 could lead to a sharp selloff in equities, which increases the bar for intervention with USD/JPY below 155.\"\nLooking further out, the firm notes that perhaps Tokyo officials might want the currency pair to keep lower than that. However, BofA says that it will be tough to sustain such a move with just intervention alone:\n\"In the medium-term, the government may be comfortable with a lower USD/JPY rate but not lower than manufactures' \"breakeven\" USD/JPY rate, which was 127 as of late 2024/early 2025. 135-145 may be a desired range though this would require something more than unilateral FX intervention.\"\nAs a reminder, Japan last intervened to prop up the yen currency back in July 2024. That helped to push USD/JPY down from above 160 to test 140 in about two months. But right after that, the pair managed a rebound all the way back up to near 159 by the time we got to January 2025.\nThat serves as a good anecdote that actual intervention doesn't always mean lasting impact, especially if not accompanied by a shift in fundamental drivers."

S&P 500 futures have risen by 0.17%. The US Dollar Index is at 96.36, and the the 10-year Treasury yield sits at 4.249%.\nEURUSD chopped around in 1.1938\u20131.1997 band consolidating recent gains while maintaining a constructive tone above 1.1900. Broad-based US dollar weakness and stronger-than-expected Eurozone business confidence, with the January reading at 99.4 versus 97.2 previously, have underpinned the single currency. Demand has also been supported by portfolio reallocation away from US assets as global investors seek alternatives.\nGBPUSD traded within a 1.3781\u20131.3848 range and remains supported by ongoing US dollar softness and renewed concerns about a potential US government shutdown. Additional support has come from optimism that Prime Minister Starmer can make progress in resetting UK\u2013China relations. Short-term technical signals remain positive while prices hold above 1.3750.\nUSDJPY rebounded in a 152.78\u2013153.64 band hovering near the top of the band after US officials denied any effort to weaken the yen through intervention. The advance has lacked conviction, reflecting market skepticism toward official assurances.\nAUDUSD rallied in a 0.7021\u20130.7095 range, rallying sharply before easing back to 0.7037 in New York. The move was driven by rising expectations of an RBA rate hike next week, firmer commodity prices, particularly gold, and persistent US dollar weakness.\nCanadian and US trade data, along with US weekly jobless claims and factory orders are due."

                "body": "USD/CAD slides to 15-month low as rising Oil prices and BoC outlook lift the Loonie\n- USD/CAD slides to its lowest level in over a year as the Canadian Dollar extends gains.\n- Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East lift Crude, reinforcing demand for the commodity-linked Loonie.\n- BoC-Fed policy divergence keeps downside pressure on the pair.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) extends its gains against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with USD/CAD sliding to its lowest level since October 2024, as the Loonie draws support from rising Oil prices and a steady Bank of Canada (BoC) monetary policy outlook. At the time of writing, the pair is trading near 1.3500, down nearly 0.40% on the day.\nRising crude prices tend to support the Canadian Dollar, as Canada is one of the world\u2019s largest Oil exporters. Oil prices surged sharply after Washington issued fresh warnings of potential military action against Iran over its nuclear programme, reviving concerns about supply disruptions in the Middle East. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading around $65.90 a barrel, its highest level since September 26, up more than 4% on the day.\nThe pair remains under pressure even as the Greenback holds broadly steady. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against a basket of six major currencies, is trading around 98.17, down about 0.17% on the day, after staging a modest rebound the previous day from a dip to four-year lows.\nOn the data front, US economic releases earlier in the day offered a mixed picture. Initial Jobless Claims edged lower to 209K from 210K in the previous week, but came in above market expectations of 205K.\nNonfarm Productivity rose at an annualized pace of 4.9% in the third quarter, matching both market expectations and the previous reading. Unit Labor Costs fell by 1.9% in Q3, in line with forecasts and unchanged from the prior estimate.\nMeanwhile, traders continue to digest the latest monetary policy decisions from both the BoC and the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered on Wednesday. The BoC left its policy rate unchanged at 2.25%, as widely expected, and reiterated that it remains focused on keeping inflation close to the 2% target, adding that the current policy rate \u201cremains appropriate.\u201d\nSouth of the border, the Fed also kept interest rates unchanged, opting to maintain a cautious, data-dependent approach. Officials acknowledged that economic activity continues to expand at a solid pace but noted that inflation remains \"somewhat elevated\" and that uncertainty around the outlook is still high.\nLooking ahead, relative monetary policy expectations are likely to keep downside pressure on USD/CAD, with interest-rate swaps pricing in around a 44% probability of a 25-basis-point BoC rate increase to 2.50% over the next twelve months. By contrast, markets expect the Fed to deliver two rate cuts later this year.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-po"

Markets anticipate two Fed cuts later this year.\nLoonie Extends Rally as Oil Advances\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) continues to strengthen against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday. USD/CAD dropped to its lowest level since October 2024, trading near 1.3500, down nearly 0.40%. Higher oil prices and a steady Bank of Canada (BoC) policy outlook are supporting the Loonie.\nCanada is one of the world\u2019s largest oil exporters. Rising crude prices typically benefit the CAD. Oil markets rose after Washington warned of possible military action against Iran over its nuclear program. This triggered concerns about Middle East supply disruptions. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading around $65.90 per barrel, its strongest since September 26, up more than 4% on the day.\nDollar Index Slips Despite Greenback Resilience\nUSD/CAD remains under pressure even as the broader US Dollar shows some resilience. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against six major currencies, is near 98.17, down roughly 0.17%. The index recovered slightly after briefly touching a four-year low in the previous session.\nMixed US Data: Labor Market and Productivity\nUS economic data earlier in the day painted a mixed picture. Initial Jobless Claims fell to 209K from 210K last week but missed market expectations of 205K.\nNonfarm Productivity rose at an annualized rate of 4.9% in Q3, matching consensus forecasts and the previous estimate. Unit Labor Costs declined by 1.9% in Q3, also in line with expectations and unchanged from the earlier reading.\nBoC and Fed Decisions Shape Policy Divergence\nInvestors are evaluating policy announcements from the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered on Wednesday. The BoC kept its benchmark rate at 2.25%, in line with expectations. It reaffirmed its goal of maintaining inflation near 2%. The central bank said the current rate \u201cremains appropriate.\u201d\nThe Fed also held rates steady, reiterating a cautious, data-dependent stance. Officials noted that economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. They added that inflation remains \u201csomewhat elevated\u201d and uncertainty about the outlook is still substantial.\nRate Expectations Favor Canadian Dollar\nFuture rate expectations are likely to support the CAD. Interest-rate swaps suggest a 44% chance of a 25-basis-point BoC hike to 2.50% over the next year. In contrast, markets expect the Fed to cut rates twice later this year. This policy gap reinforces the CAD\u2019s strength against the USD.\nCanadian Dollar: Key Drivers\nSeveral factors influence the CAD\u2019s path, including:\n- Bank of Canada interest rates.\n- Oil prices, as petroleum is Canada\u2019s largest export.\n- Domestic economic health, including growth and inflation.\n- Trade Balance, or the gap between exports and imports.\n- Market sentiment: risk-on supports CAD, risk-off weighs on it.\n- US economic performance, since Canada\u2019s largest trading partner.\nMonetary Policy and Oil as CAD Catalysts\nThe BoC influences the CAD by setting the interest rate at which banks lend to each other. This shapes borrowing costs across the economy. Its main goal is to keep inflation within 1-3%. Higher relative rates usually strengthen the CAD. Quantitative easing tends to weaken the currency, while tightening generally supports it.\nOil prices also drive CAD demand. Because petroleum is Canada\u2019s largest export, rising prices usually bolster the currency by improving the Trade Balance. Falling prices tend to weaken it.\nInflation, Data, and CAD Performance\nHigher inflation can lead central banks to raise rates. This can attract foreign capital seeking higher returns, supporting the "

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s comments denying any plan to intervene in markets to support JPY stability, a rumour that triggered a sharp JPY recovery last week\nLess than 24 hours after Trump praised the Greenback's depreciation, Bessent affirmed in a Wednesday Bloomberg interview that the US administration has a strong Dollar policy.\nThese comments offset the impact of the hawkishly tilted minutes of the latest Bank of Japan (BoJ) monetary policy meeting. The minutes showed general agreement that rising inflationary pressures, a weak Yen, and wage growth justify further monetary tightening.\nLater on Thursday, the advanced Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be closely watched to confirm those views. Consumer inflation in Japan\u2019s capital eased to 2% year-on-year in December from 2.7% in November, and the market consensus for the core CPI suggests that price pressures might have moderated further in January, which could add negative pressure on the Yen.\nIn the UK, data released earlier this week revealed that shop price inflation jumped in January to its highest levels in nearly two years, boosted by rising food prices and the high cost of fuel. These figures boost expectations of a hot CPI reading in January and strengthen the case for steady BoE interest rates, providing some support to the Pound.\nEconomic Indicator\nTokyo Consumer Price Index (YoY)\nThe Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Statistics Bureau of Japan on a monthly basis, measures the price fluctuation of goods and services purchased by households in the Tokyo region.

The annual conference expects tens of thousands of attendees and hundreds of speakers, including builders, policymakers and innovators from across the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nAtkins\u2019s invitation comes during a dramatic shift in U.S. crypto policy leadership. Since being appointed SEC Chair in 2025, he has signaled a departure from a decade of ambiguity and enforcement-driven oversight that many in the industry say stifled innovation.\nAtkins has repeatedly emphasized that clear, workable regulations are crucial to nurture digital asset markets.\nHe has publicly stated that most crypto tokens do not qualify as securities under existing law and that regulatory clarity, not litigation, should define the future landscape for digital assets \u2014 a sharp contrast with the previous era of \u201cregulation by enforcement.\u201d\nEarlier today, the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee advanced its version of crypto market legislation in a 12-11 vote. The legislation aims to finally settle long-standing questions about how digital assets should be regulated in the U.S. by giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over spot markets for \u201cdigital commodities,\u201d while leaving securities-related digital assets under Atkin\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAtkins is involved with Bitcoin adoption and policy\nUnder Atkins\u2019s leadership, the SEC has launched \u201cProject Crypto,\u201d an initiative aimed at modernizing securities laws to better fit blockchain-native assets and market structures. The effort includes clearer token classifications, tailored rules for issuance and custody, and other changes designed to bring regulatory certainty to Bitcoin and other digital assets.\nIn remarks at a crypto roundtable last year, Atkins also highlighted the importance of preserving self-custody \u2014 describing the ability to control one\u2019s own private keys as a \u201cfoundational American value\u201d even as digital finance evolves.\nAtkins\u2019s presence on stage is likely to draw interest from both the Bitcoin community and regulators watching from Washington.\nFor many attendees, it will be a rare opportunity to hear directly from the SEC about how digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, fit into U.S. financial markets and long-term policy goals.\nStrategy\u2019s Chairman, Michael Saylor, will also be speaking at The Bitcoin Conference."

The leveraged inverse product now oversees $14.54 million in assets under management (AUM), with the latest flow representing roughly 5.65% of its total size\u2014an unusually large single-day allocation that underscores growing conviction in downside exposure to Bitcoin.\nThis brisk inflow suggests traders are increasingly using BTCZ as a tactical vehicle to express short-term bearish views or hedge spot holdings, especially as volatility in the underlying crypto market persists. With more than one-twentieth of the fund\u2019s AUM added in a single session, positioning appears to be tilting more aggressively toward leveraged bets against Bitcoin\u2019s price.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading at $87,739.53, having dropped about 20.56% over the past three months. That retreat follows a prolonged rally that had left many investors wary of overheating valuations and vulnerable to profit-taking. The latest 1-day technical signal for Bitcoin flashes a bearish tone, standing at Strong Sell, which aligns with the renewed appetite for inverse exposure reflected in BTCZ\u2019s flows.\nWhile leveraged inverse ETFs like BTCZ are designed for short-term tactical trades rather than long-term holding, the scale of the latest inflow hints at a segment of the market increasingly willing to bet that Bitcoin\u2019s corrective phase is not yet over.

                "body": "SEC clarifies rules for tokenized stocks, tightening scrutiny on synthetic equity\nThe agency says issuer approval is required for true tokenized ownership, warning that many stock tokens sold to retail investors provide only indirect or synthetic exposure.\nWhat to know:\n- The Securities and Exchange Commission issued new guidance clarifying that tokenized stocks are subject to existing securities and derivatives rules, regardless of whether they are recorded on a blockchain.\n- The agency drew a sharp line between issuer-sponsored tokenized securities, which can represent true equity ownership, and third-party products that typically provide only synthetic exposure or custodial entitlements.\n- Regulators signaled they aim to curb the spread of synthetic equity products to retail investors while encouraging issuer-approved, fully regulated tokenization structures.\nThe Securities and Exchange Comission is pushing back against a growing market for \u201ctokenized stocks\u201d that look like equity, trade like equity, but do not actually confer ownership, releasing new guidance that puts third-party synthetic equity products squarely under traditional securities and derivatives rules.\nIn a joint statement, the SEC\u2019s Divisions of Corporation Finance, Investment Management, and Trading and Markets said tokenized securities fall into two clear categories: those issued or authorized by the underlying company, and those created by third parties without issuer involvement.\nThe latter category, the SEC warned, often amounts to synthetic exposure rather than real equity ownership, a distinction that became newly salient after OpenAI publicly disavowed tokenized \u201cequity\u201d linked to its shares offered through Robinhood in Europe.\nTokenization, the SEC said in its statement, does not alter the application of federal securities laws. Whether a security is recorded on a blockchain or in a traditional database, issuers retain control over ownership records, transfer approvals, and shareholder rights.\nOnly issuer-sponsored tokenized securities, where the company integrates blockchain records into its official shareholder register, can represent true equity ownership, the agency said.\nBy contrast, third-party tokenized stocks generally fall into one of two buckets. Some are custodial arrangements that represent an entitlement backed by shares held by an intermediary, exposing investors to counterparty and bankruptcy risk.\nOthers are synthetic instruments, such as linked securities or security-based swaps, that track the value of a stock without conveying voting rights, information rights, or any claim on the issuer itself.\nBy formalizing how tokenized stocks are classified, regulators appear intent on limiting the spread of synthetic equity products to retail investors while steering compliant tokenization toward issuer-approved, fully regulated structures.\nMore For You\nPudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture\nPudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform \u2014 combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale.\nWhat to know:\nPudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative \u201cdigital luxury goods\u201d into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.\nThe ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.\nMore For You\nEl Salvador's central bank buys $50 million of gold as government keeps adding bitcoin\nThe bitcoin-friendly"

The U.S. Department of Labor previously said that asset managers should \u201cexercise extreme care before they consider adding a cryptocurrency option to a 401(k) plan\u2019s investment menu for plan participants.\u201d\nHowever, last summer, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that now allows crypto investments in 401(k) retirement plans, opening up access to an estimated $10 trillion asset class. The White House has said that alternative assets such as crypto offer competitive returns and diversification benefits to retirement plans.\nIs Bitcoin a Buy?\nMost analysts don\u2019t offer ratings or price targets on Bitcoin. So instead, we\u2019ll look at the three-month performance of BTC. As one can see in the chart below, the price of Bitcoin has declined 19.54% in the last 12 weeks."

                "body": "1 New Reason to Be Cautious About Buying Solana, and 1 New Reason to Sell It Immediately\nKey Points\nA few of Solana's important organizations are getting sued in a class-action lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit might have big implications for the chain's ecosystem.\nThis legal overhang is more likely to linger than to dissipate.\nSolana (CRYPTO: SOL) has a mixed reputation these days. It's undeniably a fast and cheap platform for lots of different decentralized apps (dApps). But, it's also the home of crypto casino apps, like the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, which is now named in a class-action lawsuit along with critical Solana ecosystem entities like the Solana Foundation.\nAnd, depending on how you look at it, that particular legal can of worms could be one big reason to be seriously cautious about buying the coin, or, for more risk-averse investors, it could even be a justifiable reason to sell it right now. Here's what you need to know, and how it could change the coin's growth trajectory for the worse.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe lawsuit makes this coin a bit riskier\nThe lawsuit's allegations center on the issue of maximal extractable value (MEV), and on whether Solana insiders or the chain's market makers were systematically able to get better execution on their trades than ordinary retail investors, thereby conferring an unfair advantage. In a nutshell, MEV is the value a block producer or other actor can potentially extract from a given flow of trades by inserting, excluding, or reordering the transactions reported to the chain in real time.\nThink of it like this: You go to the store with the intention of buying apples that you know are priced at $1 each. But, a little goblin sneakily watching the checkout line slips in at the last moment, buys the apples first, and then immediately resells them to you for $1.01, a higher price than what you wanted. That's a simplified version of a common MEV pattern: using transaction ordering to capture value from ordinary buyers.\nIt makes sense why investors are mad enough about that happening to them all the time that they would bring a class-action lawsuit against those they (quite plausibly) suspect to be responsible. And as of December, there was a court decision regarding the lawsuit that granted plaintiffs the right to file an extended and amended complaint. That likely increases the odds of a drawn-out discovery process, thereby creating the opportunity for more than one bad headline to harm the coin's price.\nNow let's tie this back to Solana's economics. Pump.fun, the platform on Solana that's named in the lawsuit, drives on-chain transactions that generate network fees. If litigation or enforcement actions scare off casual participants, both app-level fees and chain-level activity can cool in tandem. That would be bad for holders.\nThis is especially important because Pump.fun has been a major fee generator for Solana. In other words, this app has been a nontrivial part of the coin's narrative, and also part of the investment thesis for buying the coin. Nor would losing a major fee engine to a lawsuit be good for investor sentiment, if that ends up happening.\nSo this lawsuit is a very big reason to be cautious about buying Solana until it resolves.\nAdvertisement\nWhen selling might make more sense than holding\nFor some investors, this same reason to be cautious is a reason to sell Solana.\nThe lawsuit is going to make it impossible to avoid an unpleasant discussion about how the chain is often used as a venue for speculation or outright gambling for buyers who usually don't realize that they have no edge. A pair of the investment theses for buying Solana, namely that it will become a platform for mainstream financial or consumer applications, and that it will become a platform for tokenized asset management, are now bot"

                "body": "Solana is considered a good investment because of its fast, scalable blockchain and low transaction fees. It stands out for speed and efficiency, processing around 65,000 transactions per second and having a unique Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism. This makes Solana appealing for NFTs, DeFi, and decentralized apps.\nIts ecosystem is growing, thereby attracting developers and projects across several sectors. However, it faces competition and risks like regulatory scrutiny and network outages. Since its price has been highly volatile, it is a high-risk yet potentially highly-rewarding investment. This article further discusses whether Solana is still worth holding long-term. So, keep reading to learn more.\nIs Solana Still Worth Holding in the Long Term?\nSolana (SOL) remains a strong long-term hold for many investors, as it is expected to see continued growth with prices ranging between $260 and $230. It is considered a good investment due to its speed, low transaction fees, and strong institutional adoption, particularly for tokenized assets. Despite recent price volatility and a 37% drop in the past 12 months, its underlying ecosystem remains robust, often outperforming Bitcoin in growth potential. While Solana appears to be a promising long-term investment, particularly due to its fast-growing ecosystem, innovative technology, and broad developer and investor support, it also carries significant risks. Some of the risks associated with it include regulatory uncertainty, network reliability, and competition.\nSolana enhances user experience by focusing on providing fast transaction speeds along with low fees. This makes the platform more accessible to a broad range of users, including developers, retail investors, and businesses. This user-friendly nature is what drives mass adoption, especially in emerging markets where low transaction costs are crucial. Since traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring blockchain technologies, Solana\u2019s efficiency and speed make it an attractive option for large-scale institutional use cases. It is well-positioned to benefit from the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space as it continues to expand and scale. This increases the need for fast and low-cost networks. Solana\u2019s ability to manage high transaction volumes well gives it a competitive advantage as the DeFi market matures and more users and liquidity flow into the ecosystem.\nSolana\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is much more energy-saving compared to traditional Proof of Work (PoW) systems. Concerns about the environmental impact of blockchain are growing, but Solana\u2019s eco-friendly nature appeals to investors who prioritize sustainability. It also drives institutional and retail investment in the future. Solana has managed to build an active, vibrant community that continuously advocates for the network. This strong community presence, along with effective marketing strategies, makes Solana maintain a high level of visibility and attracts new users and developers in the long run.\nWho Should Consider Holding Solana and Who Shouldn\u2019t?\nSolana is a good option for you if you believe in the long-term growth of blockchain technology and decentralized applications, and are prepared for volatility. It is more suitable for investors aiming to capitalize on emerging technologies with higher growth potential, especially those who are comfortable with risk. Here is a breakdown of who should and shouldn\u2019t hold Solana.\nWho should consider holding Solana:\n- Investors who believe in Solana\u2019s high speed, growing ecosystem (dApps and NFTs), and low transaction cost.\n- Active participants in the Web3 and DeFi space.\n- Active stakers and yield seekers.\n- Risk-tolerant investors seeking high growth.\n- Investors seeking diversification.\nWho should not consider holding Solana:\n- Those who cannot afford to lose capital in a volatile market or are likely to panic-sell during short-term, day-to-day downturns.\n- People see"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in full focus again, with traders watching a powerful move that has the index hovering around important zones rather than collapsing into panic. No meltdown, no euphoria blow-off \u2013 just determined, steady strength that keeps German blue chips firmly on global watchlists. The price action screams \"accumulation on dips\" and \"buy-the-dip mentality\" rather than capitulation. Volatility flares up on macro headlines, but every attempt to push the market down has met a stubborn wall of buyers.\nInstead of a clean, vertical moonshot, we\u2019re seeing a grinding uptrend: rallies getting sold into, pullbacks getting bought, and a constant tug-of-war near key technical areas. That is classic institutional behavior \u2013 big money building positions over time rather than chasing candles. Bulls have the momentum edge, but bears are not fully dead; they show up every time recession fears, earnings warnings, or political noise hit the tape.\nThe Story: What\u2019s really driving this DAX 40 mood right now? It\u2019s a cocktail of ECB expectations, German industrial reality, and global risk appetite:\n1. ECB & Rates \u2013 From Shock to Strategy\nThe European Central Bank has slowly shifted from aggressive tightening to a more cautious, data-dependent stance. Markets are no longer pricing endless hikes; instead, they are gaming out the path and speed of future cuts. That matters massively for the DAX because it is packed with rate-sensitive sectors: industrials, autos, financials, and exporters.\nWhen traders believe the ECB is done tightening and may start easing later, that\u2019s a green light for risk assets. Cheaper money supports valuations, boosts credit conditions, and weakens the euro at the margin \u2013 a sweet setup for German exporters that live and die by global demand.\n2. German Industry \u2013 Weak Headlines, Strong Survivors\nGerman economic headlines still sound gloomy: sluggish manufacturing data, talk of technical recession, and constant worries over energy, regulation, and de?industrialization. But the market is not trading the headlines; it is trading forward expectations.\nAutos like VW, BMW, and Mercedes are deep in transition mode \u2013 EVs, software, and global supply chain rewiring. That creates volatility, but also fertile ground for re?rating if margins stabilize and China risk is managed. Meanwhile, German industrial giants are aggressively cutting costs, digitizing, and hunting productivity. The DAX is quietly telling you: the market thinks the worst of the energy shock and industrial slump may be behind us, not ahead.\n3. Euro vs Dollar \u2013 FX Tailwind For German Blue Chips\nThe EUR/USD dance is crucial. A comparatively softer euro versus the dollar is a stealth profit engine for German exporters: they earn a big chunk of revenues globally but report in euros. When the euro isn\u2019t overly strong, foreign sales translate more favorably, and that can surprise on earnings season even when volumes are not spectacular.\nAs long as the Fed-ECB rate gap does not shrink too aggressively in favor of the euro, German exporters enjoy a currency tailwind. That FX dynamic is one reason why global macro hedge funds keep DAX futures on their radar as a tactical long whenever the euro stalls.\n4. Energy & Geopolitics \u2013 From Crisis Mode To Managed Risk\nEnergy prices are still a risk factor, especially natural gas and electricity for heavy industry. But we are no longer in the pure-crisis mode of previous years. Europe has diversified supply, built reserves, and adapted consumption. Does it mean Germany is safe? No. But it means the market is learning to liv"

                "body": "The DAX fell 2% as SAP sank on softer cloud backlog, even as eurozone sentiment improved and traders weighed what the data means for the ECB.\nabout 13 hours ago \u2022 1 min\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nGermany\u2019s DAX slid to start earnings season after SAP sank 16% on an update that suggested its cloud order pipeline is growing a bit more slowly.\nWhat does this mean?\nSAP didn\u2019t exactly flunk the quarter: Q4 revenue rose 9% year over year and cloud revenue jumped 26% at constant currency, while some analysts said profit and free cash flow beat forecasts. But investors cared more about what comes next. \u201cCurrent cloud backlog\u201d \u2013 a key read on near-term demand \u2013 grew 25% at constant currency, slightly below expectations and down from 27% the prior quarter. Management also pegged 2025 cloud growth at 26%, the low end of its 26% to 28% range, which made the backlo..\ng wobble feel like a warning light for future growth, not a one-off noise.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Guidance can trump a good quarter.\nBig index names can move everything around them. SAP is one of the DAX\u2019s heaviest weights, so its sell-off dragged the benchmark even as other stocks held up better. The bigger lesson for earnings season is that forward indicators \u2013 backlog, bookings, and guidance \u2013 often matter more than beating on last quarter\u2019s profit or cash flow.\nThe bigger picture: A brighter mood still leaves room for caution.\nEurozone sentiment has been improving, with the European Commission\u2019s indicator rising to 99.4 and consumer confidence ticking up too. That helps the growth outlook, but softer inflation expectations and mixed corporate demand signals give the European Central Bank room to stay patient on rates. A weaker dollar is another factor policymakers may watch, since it can affect imported inflation and financial conditions.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: Right now the DAX 40 is in classic decision mode: no clean euphoric melt-up, no full-blown panic crash, but a tense, choppy phase where every candle feels like a vote on Germany\u2019s economic future. The index has been oscillating around a major zone, with intraday spikes both ways as algos and day traders fight it out. Think nervous bounce after recent weakness rather than a confident moonshot. German blue chips are trying to stabilize, but the market still smells like cautious risk management, not fearless buying.\nWhen you zoom out, the DAX is still trading relatively close to its historical highs in structural terms, yet underneath the surface you see big sector rotations: defensive names are seeing renewed interest, while cyclical plays and some industrials show hesitation whenever new macro headlines hit. In other words: the headline index might look okay, but under the hood it is a stock-picker\u2019s market with hidden landmines.\nThe Story: What is currently steering the DAX narrative is a three-way tug-of-war: the European Central Bank, German macro data, and global risk sentiment driven by the US and China.\n1. ECB & Rates:\nThe ECB is caught between persistent inflation pockets and a clearly slowing Eurozone economy. Markets are constantly repricing the path of future rate cuts: one day, traders bet on aggressive easing to save growth; the next day, hawkish commentary or sticky inflation data temper those hopes. That whipsaw directly affects the DAX: rate-cut optimism lifts growth and tech names, while hawkish repricing brings back pressure on valuations and hits the more leveraged or cyclical stories.\nChristine Lagarde and other ECB officials have been signaling a data-dependent approach, which is basically code for: \u201cWe will keep the market guessing.\u201d For DAX traders, that means you cannot blindly assume a smooth rate-cut path. Every ECB press conference, every inflation or wage print, can flip the short-term trend.\n2. Germany\u2019s Real Economy:\nGermany remains the industrial engine of Europe, but the engine is coughing. Manufacturing surveys have been stuck in weak territory, with order books pressured by global slowdown concerns and higher financing costs. Export-heavy sectors, especially autos and machinery, are sensitive to any sign of cooling demand from China and the US.\nThe German auto complex (think VW, BMW, Mercedes-Benz) is facing a tricky mix: electric vehicle competition from China, regulatory changes in Europe, and shifting consumer behavior. Whenever negative news hits that space, the DAX feels it immediately because these companies still have massive index weight. At the same time, any hint of stimulus from China, or better-than-feared global demand data, quickly translates into short-covering and relief rallies in these names.\n3. Energy, Euro vs. Dollar, and Global Flows:\nEnergy prices remain a wild card. While Europe has avoided the absolute worst-case scenarios of the prior energy crisis, gas and power price volatility still hangs over German industry. Higher energy costs cut into margins for chemicals, industrials, and heavy manufacturers \u2014 all major DAX constituents.\nThe euro versus the dollar is another key driver. A relatively weaker euro tends to support German exporters, making their products more competitive abroad and boosting overseas earnings when converted back into euros. But a strong dollar often comes with tighter global financial conditions and risk-off sentiment, which can hurt equities broadly. Recently, FX markets have been stuck in a tug-of-war based on differing rate-cut expectations between the ECB and the Fed"

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell roughly around 0.6%.\nE-Mini S&P 500 Mar 26 (ES=F)\nFocus is turning to Trump's pick to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which the president said he would announce Friday morning. Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh has emerged as the favorite, with Fed governor Chris Waller, BlackRock chief of fixed income Rick Rieder, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.\nThe announcement would come days after the Powell-led Fed's first rate decision of 2026, in which it held rates steady, again infuriating Trump. Traders continue to expect roughly two quarter-point rate reductions before the end of the year, according to CME FedWatch.\nEarnings movers drove after-hours action. Apple (AAPL) shares rose around 1% after the company topped fiscal first-quarter profit and sales estimates, fueled by stronger-than-expected iPhone demand.\nApple's results capped a week of mixed reports from Big Tech Microsoft (MSFT) shares sank roughly 10% on Thursday, marking their steepest single-day decline since March 2020 and weighing heavily on both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC). The sell-off followed signs of slowing growth in the company\u2019s cloud business. The results sparked broader losses across software stocks as investors assessed the impact of artificial intelligence on revenue versus the sky-high spend needed to attain it.\nElsewhere in corporates, data storage company Sandisk (SNDK) surged 11% after issuing upbeat forward guidance.\nDespite recent volatility, major indexes remain mostly higher for the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are each up, while the Dow (^DJI) remains slightly down. All of the indexes are also pacing for January gains.\nWith a slew of Big Tech names having already reported earnings, market focus now aims towards oil producers, with Exxon (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) due to release reports before the open on Friday. American Express (AXP) and Verizon (VZ) round out the earnings slate in a stacked week.\nLIVE 2 updates"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.11%, or 55.96 points, and settled at 49,071.56. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin shed more than 5% and hit its lowest level in almost two months.\nMicrosoft dragged down the benchmark with a roughly 10% slide, posting its worst day since March 2020. That's after the \"Magnificent Seven\" member reported that cloud growth slowed in the fiscal second quarter. The company also issued soft guidance on operating margin for the fiscal third quarter.\nA tumble in software stocks added to the losses, with as fears grew among investors that artificial intelligence would disrupt Microsoft's business model. ServiceNow shares pulled back about 10% even after better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter. Shares of Oracle and Salesforce moved lower by 2% and 6%, respectively.\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) \u2014 which tracks the performance of the software sector \u2014 fell into bear market territory Thursday, with its around 5% loss on the day placing it nearly 22% below its recent high. The fund's move also puts it on track for its largest single-day drop since last April.\n\"AI has become like a two-edged sword here. It's a contributor to growth and spending. It's a contributor to why valuations are the way they are,\" said Rob Williams, chief investment strategist at Sage Advisory. \"Now, there are more questions about it, so it's becoming harder for it to continually deliver positive news.\"\nWith Microsoft's disappointing results, the pressure is on Apple to deliver with its earnings results, which are set to be reported after the bell Thursday. Williams noted that because it's only getting more difficult for megacap tech names to spur upbeat sentiment in the market unless they post \"blowout\" numbers, diversification will become key for investors moving forward.\n\"Earnings are the path to good returns for the equity market this year, because multiples don't have a lot of room to contribute,\" he told CNBC. \"Market breadth is improving, but we are still very concentrated.\"\nOn a positive note, Meta Platforms shares jumped more than 10% after the Facebook parent gave a stronger-than-expected first-quarter sales forecast. Elsewhere, Caterpillar shares were up more than 3% after the industrial giant reported fourth-quarter results that easily beat the Street.\nMeanwhile in Washington, the Senate on Thursday failed to clear a procedural vote on a government funding package, raising the chance that much of the federal government will shut down this week. The shutdown would take effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET if lawmakers cannot advance funding legislation."

The two vehicles \u2014 introduced in 2012 and 2015, respectively \u2014 helped to move electric cars from the consumer fringe into the mainstream. They also fueled Tesla\u2019s rise from a startup into the world\u2019s most valuable automaker.\nMusk announced the phase-out on a call with investors and Wall Street analysts, saying it was part of his effort to overhaul Tesla\u2019s operations to focus on robotaxis and humanoid robots.\n\u201cWe expect to wind down S and X production next quarter and basically stop production,\u201d he said, adding that the company would continue to support the vehicles for as long as people have them.\n\u201cThat is slightly sad, but it\u2019s time to bring the S and X programs to an end, and it\u2019s part of our overall shift to an autonomous future,\u201d he said.\nMusk announced the change as Tesla released its financial results for the final three months of last year. The company topped analysts\u2019 expectations for earnings but showed signs of weakness as total revenue for last year was down 3% from its 2024 revenue.\nIts share price was up about 2% in after-hours trading.\nTesla vehicles' sales have suffered overall in the past year, as customers reacted to Musk\u2019s involvement in right-wing politics and as competitors from China and elsewhere have given global drivers more choices.\nMusk said that Tesla would convert its factory in Fremont, California, from an auto plant into the manufacturing site for the planned Optimus line of robots. Those robots are not yet on the market.\nThe Model S arrived at a time when electric cars were a tiny niche in the vehicle market, with many industry analysts doubting whether there was enough demand to sustain an electric-only automaker. But the Model S soon topped owner satisfaction surveys and developed a loyal following. The Model X, a crossover SUV, followed a few years later and initially received poor reviews for reliability.\nIn 2023, Tesla cut prices for both the Model S and the Model X in an effort to generate more demand."

This has already happened for the smaller, more affordable CLA-, GLB-, and GLC-Class vehicles, but the S-Class and its EQS counterpart are on a different timeline, so they remain separate.\nThis means that while the company shows off all-new vehicles built on new platforms with new styling, the S-Class must soldier on with a midcycle refresh. As public interest in big luxury sedans has waned over the last decade, this becomes the most consequential refresh in S-Class history.\nIt Doesn\u2019t Really Look New\nMercedes-Benz claims the 2027 S-Class is more than 50 percent new by parts content, with some 2,700 parts updated or replaced. It's a shame, then, all you can see from the outside are a new nose, tail, wheels, and some cameras.\nUp front, the S-Class follows the latest Mercedes trend of illuminating everything and adding three-pointed stars wherever possible. The new grille is 20 percent larger and features a field of chrome stars broken up by four vertical chrome bars, though you can black-out all the chrome with the Night Package. The perimeter of the grille is now illuminated, and if that\u2019s not ostentatious enough, the hood ornament can also be illuminated. Think of it like an Oreo, with a chrome front and back with a white light sandwiched between.\nThe grille itself is surrounded on three sides by an unfortunate piece of piano black trim regardless of paint color. It\u2019s an idea carried over from the E-Class and meant to make the grille and headlights look like a big, single piece. It works better on the less-expensive car where the black trim surrounds the entire grille, but on the S-Class the top strip is body color so the black trim just looks odd. It\u2019s the rare case in which painting the car black instead of a more interesting color is advisable because it hides that detail. Too bad, since Mercedes is offering more than 150 exterior combinations and more than 400 interior combinations, and that\u2019s before you go down the Manufaktur in-house customization rabbit hole.\nLike other models, the headlights and taillights now have star-shaped DRLs, in this case two each to signify it\u2019s an S-Class (lesser models get one light-up star). The blue lights in the headlight fixtures are to indicate when the car is operating in hands-free autonomous driving mode. Opponents of super-bright headlights will be disappointed to learn these new micro-LED jobs are 40 percent brighter with high beams capable of throwing light more than a third of a mile.\nAll the light-up stuff may strike some as gaudy, but it\u2019s a growing trend. Beyond that, Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola K\u00e4llenius says it makes the car more visible at night for pedestrians, which he says makes it safer.\nAt the corners, Mercedes is introducing several new wheel designs ranging from 19 to 21 inches in diameter. By far the most interesting is the new high-pressure cast 20-inch wheel that features 50 spokes in an intricate lace design. Rear steering remains standard turning 4.5 d"

Abraham, 8, of East Peoria, IL peacefully passed away on Thursday, January 22, 2026 at her home.\nShe was born on November 29, 2017, in Peoria, IL, to Alan R. Bullock and Malyne V. Abraham.\nKirra was a presence of light, and a heart full of smiles.\nKirra was a second-grade student at Germantown Hills School District #69 in their incredible Skill Builders Program.\nKirra was the brightest light in the universe. She radiated the purest form of unconditional love, without judgement, and you could just feel that every time she smiled. She loved unicorns and she truly was a unicorn herself, rare and gone too soon, but for those who got to meet her and see how truly amazing she was, a once in a lifetime gift that will always be treasured and never forgotten. She was a magical little girl and she spread that magic to everyone around her, everyone that got to meet her, and especially to those who got to spend time with her and get to know her.\nKirra changed more lives than she could have ever imagined, simply with her laughter and smile. She made friends everywhere she went. People radiated to her and could feel how special she was as soon as they saw her and felt her presence. Kirra also had a great sense of humor. Her laugh would light up a room and bring anyone out of their own pain and into that special moment with her, because every moment with her was special. Kirra had the best way of bringing everyone together with her joy and radiant energy, healing people and relationships and bringing the focus back to the things that are most important in this life: forgiveness, happiness, and love.\nKirra was the most patient little girl, even after all the challenges that life threw at her. She only complained if something was truly wrong, or if she was ready for dessert. Her proudest moments were when she was able to make the people around her smile and laugh with the things she did. She was truly perfect. She was all the beauty, love and joy of this world wrapped into one magical little girl. There are just no words to describe what a gift she was and will continue to be to her family.\nKirra will be deeply missed by her parents Malyne and Alan of East Peoria; step-brother, Cooper Bullock of Mattoon, IL; grandparents, Dutch and Kathleen Abraham of East Peoria, and Susan Bullock of Torrington, CT; and aunt and uncle, Adam and Lauren Chittick; and cousins, Maddie and Emma Chittick.\nCremation rites have been accorded. A Celebration of Life will be held from 5PM-7PM at Camp Tapawingo Mary Morgan Lodge in Metamora, IL on Monday, February 2, 2026. Service will begin at 5:15PM, followed by light appetizers. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be given to Germantown Hills School District with the memo noted to the Inclusive Playground Fund- Kirra Abraham. Online condolences at www.masonfuneralhomes.com.\nChecks can be mailed to: Germantown Hills School District, 103 Warrior Way, Germantown Hills, IL 61548 or Venmo: @Michelle-Doobs with the note \u201cKirra\u201d.\nCelebration of Life: Camp Tapawingo, 1450 Hickory Point Road, Metamora IL 61548\nVisits: 2060\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the\nGoogle Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nService map data \u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors"

                "body": "Advantest\u2019s forecast hike cushioned the drop, but a firmer yen and fresh worries about AI spending kept Japanese tech on the back foot.\n1 day ago \u2022 1 min\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 edged down on Thursday as the yen strengthened and investors questioned when heavy AI spending will start paying off.\nWhat does this mean?\nThe yen\u2019s rise matters because the Nikkei is packed with exporters \u2013 and a stronger currency makes overseas revenue worth fewer yen. That pressure is showing up just as earnings season heats up in Japan and the US, with big tech results setting the tone for sentiment. At the same time, Microsoft\u2019s comments about record AI investment revived a familiar concern: industrywide capex could arrive faster than the profits. Still, chip-testing gear maker Advantest rallied after raising its full-year profit outlo..\nok, and its large index weight helped keep the broader dip relatively small.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency moves can rewrite earnings expectations.\nWhen the yen firms up, investors often mark down profit forecasts for globally exposed Japanese firms \u2013 even if nothing else changes. Thursday was also a reminder that index performance can hinge on a few heavyweights: Advantest\u2019s jump partly offset declines in other tech leaders. With central banks still focused on inflation, markets are less forgiving of \u201cspend now, monetize later\u201d stories, so AI-linked companies may see bigger swings around earnings.\nZooming out: AI is becoming a global capex cycle.\nBig US tech budgets ripple through supply chains worldwide, and Japan sits right in the middle thanks to its chip and factory-equipment champions. The key question for markets isn\u2019t whether AI is useful, but whether the returns arrive quickly enough to defend today\u2019s valuations and margin targets. Until that\u2019s clearer, currency shifts and guidance updates can matter as much as the underlying demand.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "European shares were lower after a mixed day in Asia, while the prices of gold and silver soared higher ahead of an interest rate decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nLater Wednesday, the U.S. central bank was due to announce its latest move on interest rates. The expectation is that it will hold its main interest rate steady for now.\nOther WRAL Top Stories\nGermany's DAX lost 0.2% to 24,837.57, while the CAC 40 in Paris sank 1.1% to 8,065.62. Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.2% to 10,188.28.\nThe future for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was nearly unchanged.\nIn Asian trading, South Korea\u2019s benchmark hit a record, lifted by gains for technology shares like computer chip maker SK Hynix, which climbed 5.1%. The Kospi gained 1.7% to 5,170.81.\nTokyo's Nikkei 225 index clawed back early losses to edge less than 0.1% higher, closing at 53,358.71. Energy and technology giant SoftBank Group Corp. helped lift the benchmark, gaining 3.7%, following reports it plans to invest more in OpenAI.\nThe dollar rebounded slightly against the Japanese yen but has still weakened sharply since last week, putting pressure on shares of major exporters.\nThe dollar was trading at 152.68 yen, up from 152.19 yen. But it's nearly 4% lower than its level last week, when it surged to near 160 yen, prompting both Japanese and U.S. officials to warn they would intervene to stanch the yen's decline.\nThe euro slipped to $1.1983 from $1.2041 late Monday. It also has surged against the dollar.\nAn index measuring the U.S. dollar\u2019s strength against several of its competitors has dropped to its lowest point since 2022.\nThe price of gold jumped 3.9% to $5,279.30, and silver\u2019s price jumped 6.7%, to $112.69.\nPrices of precious metals have been soaring as investors, including major central banks, have sold dollars to park their money in assets considered to be relatively safe in times of turmoil.\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 2.6% to 27,826.91, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.3% to 4,151.24.\nTaiwan's Taiex advanced 1.5%, while the Sensex in India gained 0.3%.\nOn Tuesday, U.S. stocks zigzagged following mixed profit reports from UnitedHealth, General Motors and other big companies.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 6,978.60, edging past its prior all-time high set a couple weeks ago. The Dow fell 0.8% to 49,003.41, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9% to 23,817.10.\nSeveral of Wall Street\u2019s most influential stocks will deliver their latest earnings reports later this week. They include Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday.\nThe dollar has weakened since President Donald Trump threatened tariffs against several European countries that he said opposed his taking control of Greenland. Such threats, along with worries about risks like the U.S. government\u2019s heavy debt, have periodically pushed global investors to step back from U.S. markets, a move that\u2019s come to be called \u201cSell America.\u201d\nA report from the Conference Board said confidence weakened among U.S. consumers last month. Economists had expected to see a slight improvement, but confidence dropped to its lowest level since 2014, even lower than it was during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInflation remains stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and lower interest rates could worsen increases in prices for U.S. consumers at the same time that they give the economy a boost. Traders expect the Fed to resume its cuts to interest rates later this year.\nThe pressure is on companies to deliver strong growth in profits following record-setting runs for their stock prices. Stock prices tend to follow the path of corporate profits over the long term, and earnings need to rise to quiet criticism that they've grown too expensive.\nIn other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 1 cent to $62.40 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 9 cents to $66.50 per barrel."
