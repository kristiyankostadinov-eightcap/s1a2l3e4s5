                "body": "Gold prices surged, poised for a near 4% weekly increase, following a mixed US employment report. While fewer jobs were added than expected, the Unemployment Rate decreased, leading to speculation about potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nUS economic data affected expectations for short-term interest rates, though there\u2019s belief the Federal Reserve might reduce rates by 50 basis points over the year. Nonfarm Payrolls data fell short, while Unemployment improved, with steady Average Hourly Earnings.\nHousing Market Slowdown\nHousing data indicated a slowdown, with Building Permits and Housing Starts dipping. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index rose to 54, surpassing forecasts but amidst concerns about inflation. Gold hit a daily high of $4,517, close to its record high of $4,549.\nThe US Dollar Index gained 0.33% to 99.16. Gold traders are focused on upcoming inflation figures, Retail Sales, and Federal Reserve commentary. With US Treasury yields static, Gold prices climbed, even as job additions underperformed expectations.\nDecember saw 50,000 jobs against a forecast of 60,000, though the Unemployment Rate dropped to 4.4%. Investors have priced in expected Federal Reserve rate cuts, estimating a total of 56 basis points by 2026. Gold\u2019s price trend remains upward, with technical indicators suggesting potential increases if it surpasses $4,549.\nGold Price Momentum\nGiven gold\u2019s powerful move above $4,500, the immediate momentum suggests positioning for further upside. The mixed jobs report from December 2025 is being interpreted as a green light for future Federal Reserve rate cuts, which is bullish for gold. We should consider buying call options with strike prices near the record high of $4,549 and above, targeting a move toward $4,600.\nHowever, we must also acknowledge the conflicting signals that could create volatility. The drop in the unemployment rate to 4.4% and the resilient US Dollar could cap this rally, making outright long futures positions risky without tight stops. A sharp reversal below $4,500 could quickly see a test of the $4,450 daily low, so purchasing protective put options could be a prudent way to hedge long exposure.\nTo add credibility to this bullish outlook, we can see that recent data reinforces underlying support for gold. World Gold Council figures released for the fourth quarter of 2025 showed central banks added another 290 tonnes to reserves, continuing the record accumulation trend we saw back in 2022. Open interest in call options with a $4,600 strike price for February expiration has also increased by over 25% this past week, showing that big money is betting on a continued rally.\nWe have seen this pattern before during past Federal Reserve policy shifts. Looking back at the pivot in 2019, gold began a sustained rally months before the first actual rate cut as the market priced in easier monetary policy. This historical precedent suggests that the current expectation of 56 basis points in cuts for 2026 is the primary driver, making any price dips attractive buying opportunities for us.\nIn the coming weeks, all eyes will be on the upcoming US inflation and retail sales data. A hotter-than-expected inflation number could challenge the rate cut narrative and trigger a sharp sell-off in gold, while weak data would likely fuel the breakout. This makes short-term straddles or strangles an interesting strategy to trade the potential volatility around these key economic releases."

The Nikkei index climbed 1.6% to close at 51,939.89, securing a 3.2% gain for the week. This rally was largely powered by Uniqlo\u2019s parent company, Fast Retailing, which surged nearly 11% after posting strong earnings; this single stock was responsible for more than two-thirds of the Nikkei's total rise for the day.\nJapanese automakers also had a good day, boosted by a weaker yen (which increases the value of their overseas profits) and a sense of relief regarding trade tensions. Investors were reassured that China\u2019s new export ban on \"dual-use\" military items would not completely cut off supplies to civilian Japanese companies.\nMazda, Toyota, and Honda all posted solid gains. However, not all news was positive; the retailer Aeon slumped nearly 8% after its earnings disappointed investors. Traders are now looking ahead to the earnings report from robot-maker Yaskawa Electric, due later today, which is seen as a key indicator for the health of the manufacturing sector.\nPlease note that Japanese markets will be closed this coming Monday for a holiday.\nChinese Inflation Edges Higher, Near 3-Year Highs\nChina's annual inflation rate rose slightly to 0.8% in December 2025, up from 0.7% the previous month. While this is the highest level since early 2023, it still missed the 0.9% rate that experts had predicted.\nThis marks the third month in a row that consumer prices have increased, driven largely by a jump in food costs, specifically fresh vegetables and fruit which saw their biggest rise in over a year.\nOutside of food, prices remained mostly stable. Clothing and healthcare costs went up, but housing prices dipped slightly, and transportation costs continued to fall. Core inflation (which ignores volatile food and energy prices) held steady at 1.2%, its highest point in nearly two years.\nOverall, inflation for the entire year was flat, finishing well below the government's target of around 2%.\nEuropean Session - European Shares Higher as Rio Tinto Eyes Glencore Takeover\nEuropean stock markets opened higher on Friday, bouncing back from two days of losses caused by weak earnings and political tension.\nThe STOXX 600 index is now on track for its best winning streak since May, largely thanks to a massive 8% jump in shares of Glencore. This surge happened after rival mining giant Rio Tinto announced it is in early talks to buy Glencore, a deal that would create the world's largest mining company. While Glencore stock hit an 18-month high on the news, Rio Tinto's shares dropped 2.2%.\nThe broader European market rose 0.4%, led by gains in energy and mining companies. Other notable movers included Anglo American, which rose 2.4% on news that its deal with Teck Resources is likely to be approved by European regulators.\nTech stocks also performed well; ASML gained 2.1% and STMicroelectronics rose nearly 1% after positive revenue reports from industry partner TSMC.\nInvestors are now waiting for the crucial US jobs report later today, which is expected to show that hiring slowed down in December.\nOn the FX front, the US dollar rose slightly on Friday, reaching its highest level in a month, as investors waited for the upcoming jobs report and a major Supreme Court ruling on President Trump's tariffs. The dollar also strengthened against the Japanese Yen for the fourth straight day.\nIn contrast, the Euro dropped to $1.1644 after data showed that German exports unexpectedly fell, even though industrial production actually improved.\nOther major currencies struggled as well: the British Pound fell 0.2%, while the Australian and New Zealand"

                "body": "(Kitco Commentary) - Gold and silver posted substantial weekly gains, marking the fifth positive week out of the last seven for gold and the sixth for silver. The precious metals complex demonstrated remarkable strength, driven by a confluence of geopolitical instability and shifting expectations regarding Federal Reserve monetary policy.\nThe week opened with exceptional momentum, as gold surged $116, or 2.71%, on Monday alone. Silver outpaced its more expensive counterpart on a percentage basis, appreciating $3.81, or 5.24%. The rally was primarily attributed to heightened safe-haven demand stemming from escalating tensions surrounding the US-Venezuela conflict.\nUncertainty regarding the future governance of the oil-rich nation once American attention shifts elsewhere has sustained the safe-haven bid throughout the week, with both metals maintaining trading levels above Monday's closing prices and preserving their substantial gains.\nMid-week profit-taking emerged following the release of the ISM manufacturing report, which depicted robust economic conditions and temporarily dampened expectations for near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, this bearish sentiment proved fleeting. Friday's employment report revealed significantly weaker-than-anticipated job creation, immediately rekindling speculation that the central bank would resume its easing cycle. The direction of this narrative will face a critical test on Tuesday with the release of December's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which could substantially influence market sentiment and determine gold's trajectory in the coming week. Gold concluded the period with cumulative gains of $177, representing a 4.09% weekly advance.\nSilver's performance mirrored gold's directional movement but exhibited heightened volatility characteristic of the metal's smaller market capitalization. The white metal experienced more pronounced mid-week selling pressure in response to the manufacturing data mentioned previously. Despite silver's strong recent performance, analysts suggest the metal retains additional upside potential relative to gold.\nThe gold-to-silver ratio has compressed to 56.43, a level not observed since January 2013, as silver has progressively narrowed the performance gap with gold. Should this ratio continue its descent, historical support levels exist at 50 and subsequently at 46. Notably, the ratio reached its modern low of 31 during the precious metals bull market of 2011, though such extreme valuations remain far from current levels.For those who would like more information about our services click here.\nWishing you as always good trading,"

                "body": "Why is silver price up over 6% and back above $80 after weak U.S. job growth rattled markets? Here\u2019s where silver prices could go next\nSynopsis\nSilver Price Forecast 2026: Silver prices surged past $80 an ounce after weak U.S. job growth rattled markets and revived Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations. Thin London inventories, China\u2019s export curbs, and rising geopolitical tensions involving the U.S., Iran, and Israel intensified the rally. After a record 2025, silver\u2019s volatility signals deeper supply stress and sustained safe-haven demand ahead.\nSilver\u2019s surge also reflects deeper structural forces. Limited physical inventories in key global vaults, new export restrictions from China, and sustained industrial demand from clean energy, electric vehicles, and data centers have combined to tighten supply. At the same time, escalating geopolitical risks\u2014from renewed conflict signals in the Middle East to heightened U.S.-Iran and Israel-related tensions\u2014have pushed investors toward safe-haven assets.\nThe rally extends a historic run for silver. In 2025, prices rose more than 150%, outperforming most commodities and equities. With volatility still elevated, analysts say silver is now trading at the intersection of macroeconomic policy shifts, physical scarcity, and global uncertainty.\nSilver rallies 6%+, breaks back above $80 on labor market slowdown\nFriday\u2019s rally was triggered by the December U.S. employment report, which showed a sharp slowdown in job creation. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate edged down slightly to 4.4%. The data signaled cooling momentum in the labor market after months of gradual softening.For precious metals, weaker job growth often translates into lower real interest rates. Investors expect the Federal Reserve to respond to slower hiring by easing monetary policy sooner and more aggressively. Lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like silver and gold.\nMarket participants also noted that oil prices have firmed in recent weeks, adding to inflation concerns. Combined with softer economic growth, the backdrop has revived demand for assets that historically hold value during periods of uncertainty. Gold prices also rose on Friday, climbing more than 1% to around $4,514 an ounce.\nAnalysts say silver tends to amplify these moves. Because the metal is smaller and less liquid than gold, shifts in macro sentiment often produce sharper price swings in both directions.\nSupply squeeze deepens as London inventories thin\nBeyond macroeconomic data, physical supply constraints remain a central driver of silver\u2019s volatility. Analysts at major investment banks have pointed to unusually low inventories in London, one of the world\u2019s most important precious-metal trading hubs.Throughout 2025, large volumes of silver were transferred from London to New York amid concerns that the U.S. could impose tariffs on imported metals. The shift left global inventories fragmented and reduced available supply in key markets. Thin stockpiles make prices more sensitive to sudden demand, increasing the risk of short-term squeezes.\nChina has added another layer of pressure. New restrictions on silver exports took effect earlier this month, tightening global supply further. As one of the world\u2019s largest silver exporters, China\u2019s move has forced buyers to compete for fewer available shipments, especially in Western markets.\nMarket strategists warn that the breakdown of a unified global inventory system has made pricing less efficient. Regional shortages can now trigger sharp rallies even without a broad surge in demand.\nGeopolitical tensions boost safe-haven demand\nGeopolitical risk has played a growing role in silver\u2019s price action. Investors have increasingly turned to precious metals as tensions rise across several regions.In the Middle East, recent developments involving Israel and renewed instability tied to Iran\u2019s regional influence have unsettled markets.

Earlier this week, the president said that U.S. companies could be \u201cup and running\u201d in Venezuela within 18 months. \u201cA tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,\u201d Trump also said.\n\u201cTo me, the signal from the administration is: we\u2019d rather spend our American money on propping up a Venezuelan oil business than supporting our current independent businesses,\u201d the chief executive of Latigo Petroleum told the Financial Times.\nIndeed, only Big Oil supermajors can afford the investment necessary to revitalize Venezuela\u2019s oil industry\u2014which is why Trump is meeting with their executives later today to discuss just that. It is also Big Oil supermajors that are best placed to withstand lower oil prices\u2014something that smaller field operators in the U.S. shale patch cannot afford.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an appropriate reaction by US shale to be miffed,\u201d Dan Pickering from Pickering Energy Partners told the FT. \u201cNot just because Venezuelan production might go up but because the US government, in theory, is going to subsidise that.\u201d\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nIrina is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry."

The inclusion of smaller domestic companies in the meeting is notable, given that they mostly operate in the US.\nContinental Resources, which bills itself as the biggest privately owned oil and natural gas producer in the world, will be in attendance, as will HKN Inc, which was formerly known as Harken Energy.\nSeveral of the companies have connections to Denver, Colorado, the home turf of Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and a relatively small hub for oil and gas activity compared with other parts of the United States.\nOil output in PADD 4, the production region that includes Colorado, totalled 1.02 million barrels per day (bpd) in October, according to the latest data from the US Energy Information Administration. PADD 3, which includes states like Texas and New Mexico, produced 10.28 million bpd that month.\nRaisa Energy, which acquires non-operated stakes in energy assets and has a Venezuelan CEO, is based in Denver and backed by investment funds Citadel and Ares Management.\nTallgrass Energy \u2013 a midstream company with pipeline and terminal assets in areas including the US Rocky Mountains and Oklahoma \u2013 and Aspect Holdings, which lists former Speaker of the US House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy as an independent director, are also headquartered in Denver.\nThe Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Raisa, Tallgrass, and Aspect did not immediately reply to questions about any previous discussions they may have had about Venezuela ahead of the Friday meeting.\nMany of the smaller firms and independents may not have as much experience with heavy oil that is typical in Venezuela, but they will be familiar with lighter oil around Lake Maracaibo and shale that has not yet been tapped, said a long-time oil industry executive.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have as much capital as an Exxon, Chevron or ConocoPhillips, but independents are known to move much faster. Their cost structure is lower, so they can drill wells much cheaper than the majors,\u201d the person said."

From a trading standpoint, the immediate focus is on a breakout of the embedded December opening-range- losses would need to be limited to the 1.1589 IF price is heading higher on this stretch\u2026\u201d EUR/USD broke higher two-days later with the advance surging nearly 3% of the November low before exhausting at key resistance at 1.1747/75- a region defined by the 2025 high-week close (HWC), the 61.8% retracement of the September decline, and the 2025 high-close.\nEuro spent four-weeks below this key threshold before pulling back with the EUR/USD declining nine of-the-past eleven trading days. The losses extending more than 1.6% off the December highs this week with initial weekly support now in view at the 61.8% retracement of the November advance at 1.1598. Note that the 75% parallel converges on this level over the next few weeks and the focus is on a reaction off this mark IF reached. A break / weekly close below would suggest that a more significant high is in place / a larger correction is underway with subsequent support objectives seen at 78.6% retracement of the July rally and the March 2020 / 2022 high at 1.1497-1.1505, and the April high-close at 1.1394. The next major technical consideration rests with the 38.2% retracement of the 2025 range and the 2023 swing high at 1.1254/76.\nA topside breach above 1.1775 is needed to mark uptrend resumption with such a scenario exposing the 2025 swing high and the 100% extension of the 2022 advance at 1.1917/19 backed by the 38.2% retracement of the broader 2008 decline at 1.2020. Note that the upper parallel converges on this threshold into March \u2013 look for a larger reaction there IF reached. Subsequent resistance is eyed at the 2017 swing high near 1.2092.\nBottom line: Euro turned key resistance into the start of the month with the decline now approaching confluent uptrend support. From a trading standpoint, the focus is on possible inflection into 1.1598- a reaction there will likely determine if the late-December pullback was simply a correction or whether a larger trend reversal will take shape into the start of the year.\nKeep in mind that key U.S. inflation data is due next week, with the December Consumer Price Index (CPI) scheduled for release on Tuesday.

This points to a greater likelihood of further declines.\nInitial support for EUR/USD is at 1.1600. If this level is breached, the next target would be the 200-day SMA at 1.1565, which serves as the final support for bulls before the outlook turns decisively bearish. Additional downside targets include 1.1500 and the August 1 low at 1.1391.\nConversely, if buyers manage to reclaim the 50- and 100-day SMAs, resistance is seen at 1.1700, with the 20-day SMA at 1.1730 as the next level to watch."

                "body": "GBP/USD outlook: Forex Friday January 9, 2026\nGBP/USD outlook: US payrolls take centre stage\nThe US dollar remained on the front-foot Friday morning. Today\u2019s US nonfarm payrolls report looks set to be the main event for FX markets, with expectations firming that the data will be solid enough to keep the Federal Reserve on hold for longer. Alongside this, markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility that the Supreme Court will rule against Trump\u2019s tariff proposals, a combination which, taken together, would likely prove mildly supportive for the dollar. Against that backdrop, the near-term GBP/USD outlook is increasingly looking mildly bearish.\nUS data sends mixed signals ahead of jobs report\nThis week\u2019s US macro picture has been anything but straightforward. The ISM services survey surprised on the upside, ADP payrolls were respectable rather than spectacular, while JOLTS data disappointed, highlighting a continued cooling in labour demand. Jobless claims, meanwhile, have held up well enough to reinforce the view that the US economy is slowing, but not rolling over. Challenger job cuts, released earlier this week, showed a sharp drop in December.\nThe overall mixed employment indicators have helped underpin cautious optimism ahead of today\u2019s payrolls report. Expectations have risen over the past couple of days, rising from around 50k to 65k, with consensus now sitting close to 70k. The unemployment rate may attract even more attention than the headline jobs number, echoing the Fed\u2019s own focus on labour market slack. A modest improvement here, combined with payrolls around consensus expectations or slightly higher would be enough to keep the odds of a March move below 50%.\nAdding another layer of uncertainty, many are watching for a potential Supreme Court ruling on Trump\u2019s tariffs today \u2014 though timing remains far from guaranteed. A rejection of those measures would remove a tail risk for the global economy, but paradoxically could still offer near-term support to the dollar.\nPound weighed down by BoE rate cut expectations\nFor sterling, the focus remains firmly on the Bank of England. UK data continues to point towards a cooling economy and easing inflation pressures, keeping the door open to further rate cuts. While February still looks a step too far, the balance of evidence suggests March is increasingly plausible, potentially followed by another move in early summer.\nThe labour market remains a key concern for the more cautious members of the MPC. Vacancies have fallen sharply and now sit below pre-pandemic levels, while redundancies appear to be picking up. Wage growth has slowed noticeably, with private sector pay increases dropping from around 6% earlier last year to just under 4% by the autumn. If this trend continues, services inflation should ease further as food prices, rents and energy costs all cool. Base effects from last year\u2019s tax changes are also likely to push headline inflation lower from April onwards, potentially keeping CPI close to 2% for much of the year.\nMarkets currently favour April for the next cut, but March still looks the more likely option in our view, assuming incoming labour and wage data continues to soften.\nGBP/USD outlook: technical picture remains fragile\nTechnically, the GBP/USD outlook is starting to look a bit shaky. The prior bullish momentum has clearly faded following the rejection from the 1.35 area, which coincides with a broader long-term resistance zone. The lack of upside follow-through suggests bullish conviction is waning. Traders who chased the recent upside are already under pressure, as we have now seen the cable break below Monday\u2019s low at 1.3415. A sustained break below this level past the NFP data could accelerate position unwinding, especially if we also see rates hold below the 1.34 handle where the 200-day moving average comes into play. A clean break below this level would shift the balance towards a deeper corrective phase with the location of the next support"

At the time of writing, GBP/USD trades at 1.3412 after reaching a high of 1.3451.\nSterling retreats on mixed US payrolls data, traders pare near-term easing expectations\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that the economy added just 50K people to the workforce, below estimates of 60K and the previous revised print of 56K. Although the print shows signs of weakness, the Unemployment Rate edged lower from 4.6% to 4.4%, beneath forecasts of 4.5%.\nThe report reaffirmed Federal Reserve (Fed) officials\u2019 comments that the labor market is in a no-firing, no-hiring environment, and traders perceived the report as solid, as they trimmed the chances for a rate cut in January from around 29% to nearly 5%, as revealed by Prime Market Terminal data\nUS housing data and Consumer Sentiment was worse than expected\nAt the same time, Building Permits for October in the US dipped 0.2% from September\u2019s 1.415 million to 1.412 million. Private-owned Housing Starts in October came to 1.246 million, for a 4.6% decline from the September print of 1.306 million.\nRecently, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment preliminary reading in January exceeded economists\u2019 forecast of 53.5, coming in at 54, improved from November\u2019s final reading of 52.9. Inflation expectations for 1-year were unchanged at 4.2% and for a five-year period rose from 3.2% to 3.4%.\nAcross the pond, the UK\u2019s economic docket was absent, yet it is expected to gain traction next week. The BRC Like-For-Like Retail Sales data for December is awaited, the UK\u2019s jobs data and the release of GDP figures.\nGBP/USD Price Forecast: Technical outlook\nGBP/USD extended its downtrend and seems poised to challenge the 200-day SMA at 1.3384. A daily close below the latter could cement the case for testing the 50-day SMA at 1.3288, before sellers push to drive the exchange rate to 1.3200.\nConversely, buyers need to reclaim 1.3450 and on further weakness, reach the 1.3500 mark.\nPound Sterling Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies this week.

                "body": "On Friday, the British Pound slipped after the release of December\u2019s US Nonfarm Payrolls, which showed a blend of positive and negative signals. As a result, market participants scaled back expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in January. At the latest check, GBP/USD was trading at 1.3412, having earlier peaked at 1.3451.\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 50,000 new jobs were created, falling short of the anticipated 60,000 and the prior month\u2019s 64,000. Despite this softer job growth, the unemployment rate improved, dropping to 4.4% from 4.6%, which was better than the projected 4.5%.\nThis data supported recent remarks from Federal Reserve officials, who have described the labor market as stable but stagnant. Following the report, traders significantly reduced the likelihood of a January rate cut, with odds falling from about 29% to just 5%.\nFed interest rate probabilities - Source: Prime Market Terminal\nMeanwhile, US housing indicators also underperformed. October\u2019s Building Permits slipped by 0.2%, moving from 1.415 million in September to 1.412 million. Privately-owned Housing Starts for October registered at 1.246 million, marking a 4.6% drop from the previous month\u2019s 1.306 million.\nOn the consumer front, the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary January Consumer Sentiment reading came in at 54, slightly above the expected 53.5 and up from November\u2019s final figure of 52.9. One-year inflation expectations remained steady at 4.2%, while five-year expectations edged higher from 3.2% to 3.4%.\nIn the UK, there were no major economic releases this week, but attention is turning to upcoming data. Next week, markets will be watching for the BRC Like-For-Like Retail Sales for December, new employment figures, and the latest GDP results.\nThe GBP/USD pair has continued its downward trajectory and is approaching the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 1.3384. Should the pair close below this level, it could open the door for a move toward the 50-day SMA at 1.3288, with further downside potential toward 1.3200 if selling pressure persists.\nOn the other hand, a recovery above 1.3450 would be necessary for buyers to regain control, with the next target set at 1.3500 if momentum strengthens.\nGBP/USD daily chart"

While Australian inflation has cooled modestly, CPI remains above the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s target band, keeping policy restrictive and limiting the scope for aggressive downside in the Aussie.\nView related analysis:\n- AUD/USD 2026 Outlook: Policy Divergence and a Shifting Dollar Trend\n- Trade to Watch 2026: Nasdaq 100 Correction Risk Before New Highs\n- EUR/JPY: 2025\u2019s Biggest Surprise \u2013 The Great Short That Wasn\u2019t\nAUD/USD Outlook: Pullback Risks Rise as USD Finds Support\nAustralian Inflation Cools, but CPI Still Above RBA Target\nMonthly inflation figures for November released on Wednesday showed that core CPI remains sticky, although price pressures have eased modestly. Trimmed mean CPI slowed to 3.2% y/y, while headline CPI fell to 3.4%, leaving both measures above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target band. Housing was again a key driver, contributing 1.1 percentage points to inflation and accounting for 21.4% of the total CPI basket.\nWhile this eases pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia to hike rates in Q1, it does nothing to justify rate cuts. Policymakers will want confirmation from the Q4 CPI figures due on 28 January before determining whether the February meeting is live\u2014a possibility Governor Bullock effectively flagged in December. Until then, inflation remains uncomfortably high and the policy bias stays restrictive.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)\nUS Dollar Finds Its Footing\nThe US dollar index rose in the first week of the year to hint at an interim swing low around 97.50, although I doubt bulls will manage to drive prices back above 100. Prices have broken above last week\u2019s bullish inside week and the prior week\u2019s bearish engulfing candle, pointing to further near-term upside.\nRegular readers will recall that I suspect a wave-C correction may have ended on the weekly chart, which keeps my broader bias tilted towards fading extended USD rallies. That, in turn, suggests AUD/USD bulls may look to buy dips rather than chase strength.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: TradingView / ICE\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe daily chart shows the Australian dollar briefly hitting a 15-month high on Wednesday, before a stronger US dollar drove a full intraday reversal into the close. This has left a shooting star candlestick on the AUD/USD daily chart, reinforced by bearish RSI divergence, warning of at least a near-term pullback.\nI\u2019m not looking for anything aggressive at this stage, but a break below the September high at 0.6707, or the 67c handle, could see AUD/USD retrace towards its 20-day SMA near 0.6675.\nA deeper pullback may require domestic data to undershoot expectations, particularly given current futures and options positioning. However, a decisive break below 0.6660 would open a run towards the 50-day SMA and prior swing highs and lows around 0.6592.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: TradingView\nAUD/USD Positioning: Australian Dollar Futures \u2013 COT Report\nWhile futures traders remain net short AUD/USD, long exposure continues to trend higher among large speculators and asset managers. Short interest has only edged modestly higher among large specs and has largely flattened among asset managers.\nWith no immediate signs of sentiment reaching an extreme, futures traders could flip net long AUD/USD in the coming weeks or months, assuming no fresh bearish catalyst emerges for the Australian dollar.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: TradingView / ICE\nView the full economic calendar\n-- Written by Matt Simpson\nFollow Matt on Twitter @cLeverEdge"

The monthly changes in payrolls can be extremely volatile. The number is also subject to strong reviews, which can also trigger volatility in the Forex board. Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is seen as bearish, although previous months' reviews and the Unemployment Rate are as relevant as the headline figure.

At that point, I think we could go looking to the 160 yen level, which is an area where the Bank of Japan intervened ages ago.\nTechnical Support and Future Targets\nShort-term pullbacks will end up being buying opportunities, I believe, and as a result, the support levels that I'm watching include the 50-day EMA and the 155 yen level. These are areas that I think will remain very important, but I think it is difficult to break down below.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nIf we were to break down below that area, then you could have a lot of problems for the US dollar, and I think you have a situation where if that does in fact happen, the 152 yen level might be your next target.\nUltimately, though, despite the fact that the Bank of Japan has raised interest rates and the Federal Reserve has cut, you still have a pretty wide gap between the two, and therefore, if you're looking for the carry trade to play out, you are looking for the US dollar to remain somewhat resilient against the Japanese yen. Beyond that, the US dollar itself is fairly resilient, mainly due to the fact that the economic numbers coming out of America are stubbornly strong, so even if the Federal Reserve does cut it can only do so in a limited way.\nWant to trade our USD/JPY forex analysis and predictions?

                "body": "The US Dollar remains resilient following a mixed US employment report, while the Canadian Dollar faces challenges due to weak Oil prices. The USD/CAD trades around 1.3900, gaining 0.25% on Friday, supported by strong macroeconomic indicators favouring USD and impacting CAD.\nUS labour data reveals Nonfarm Payrolls rose less than expected in December, yet the unemployment rate declined as wage growth increased. These combined indicators suggest a cooling but still robust US labour market. The Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious stance on interest rates is reflected in market expectations for the January meeting.\nCanadian Dollar Challenges\nMeanwhile, Canadian Dollar suffers from weak Oil prices, integral to Canada\u2019s trade terms. The possibility of heightened Venezuelan Oil exports to the US creates competitive pressure for Canadian Crude, potentially impacting Canada\u2019s energy revenue. This situation, alongside the Bank of Canada\u2019s pause on interest rate changes, affects CAD.\nThe disparity in the economic momentum between the US and Canada, along with challenging Oil market conditions, supports a bullish view on USD/CAD. The Greenback shows strength compared to other major currencies, particularly reinforcing its position against the Japanese Yen. The currency dynamic continues to evolve with attention on upcoming macroeconomic inputs and policy directions.\nThe economic signals point to a stronger US dollar against the Canadian dollar, and we see this divergence continuing in the near term. This suggests that the USD/CAD exchange rate is likely to climb higher from its current position around 1.3900. Derivative strategies should be positioned to profit from this expected upward move over the next several weeks.\nUS And Canada Economic Momentum\nThe latest US jobs report for December 2025 showed a resilient labor market, with annual wage growth holding firm at 4.1%. With the Federal Reserve signaling a cautious stance, futures markets are now pricing in over a 90% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged at the upcoming January 28th meeting. This policy outlook provides a solid foundation for the US dollar.\nOn the other hand, Canada\u2019s economy appears to be cooling, as the most recent jobs data showed the unemployment rate ticking up to 5.9%. The Bank of Canada is expected to keep its policy rate at 5.0%, but this wait-and-see approach offers little immediate support for the loonie. This growing difference in economic momentum between the US and Canada is a key factor driving our view.\nPressure on the Canadian dollar is being amplified by weak energy markets, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil struggling to stay above $72 a barrel. This trend directly hurts Canada\u2019s terms of trade and makes its currency less appealing, a pattern we also observed in late 2024 when falling oil prices weakened the loonie. The prospect of increased Venezuelan supply competing with Canadian crude only adds to this headwind.\nGiven this outlook, we believe buying call options on USD/CAD with strike prices around 1.4000 and 1.4100 presents a favorable risk-to-reward opportunity. This strategy allows traders to capitalize on a potential rise in the exchange rate while defining their maximum risk. Traders with a higher risk tolerance might also consider selling out-of-the-money put options to collect premium on the expectation that the pair will not fall."

The move represents roughly 8.74% of the ETF\u2019s latest reported assets under management of $81.37 million, signaling a meaningful vote of confidence in exposure to the Canadian dollar.\nThe size of the single-day flow suggests that investors may be repositioning for a shift in North American currency dynamics, using FXC as a vehicle to express a more constructive view on the loonie versus the U.S. dollar. Such a sizable relative increase in AUM in one session often reflects institutional flows or a concentrated macro bet, rather than incremental retail interest.\nThe related asset, FX:USD-CAD, is currently trading at 1.38731, indicating that one U.S. dollar buys roughly 1.39 Canadian dollars. Over the past three months, USD/CAD has slipped about 1.07%, a modest decline that hints at a gradual erosion of U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian currency. Notably, the one-day technical signal on the pair is flashing Buy for USD/CAD, implying that near-term momentum still favors the greenback, even as medium-term price action points to a softer trend.\nThis combination\u2014bullish short-term technicals for USD/CAD, but meaningful inflows into a vehicle offering Canadian dollar exposure\u2014suggests that some investors may be looking past immediate volatility to position for a potential medium-term recovery in the loonie. If energy markets stabilize or the Bank of Canada diverges less dovishly from the Federal Reserve than expected, that could reinforce the rationale behind the recent surge of capital into FXC.\nFor a more detailed analysis and real-time sentiment trends, check the live currency exchange rates here."

Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose less than expected in December, while the Unemployment Rate declined and wage growth accelerated. Taken together, these figures point to a labor market that is gradually cooling but remains relatively resilient, reinforcing expectations of a cautious approach from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Markets largely expect the US central bank to keep interest rates unchanged at the January meeting, while still leaving the door open to a gradual easing path later in the year, as reflected in futures pricing.\nAt the same time, the Canadian Dollar remains under pressure amid persistent weakness in Oil prices, a key driver of Canada\u2019s terms of trade. The prospect of increased Venezuelan Oil exports to the United States has raised concerns about greater competition for Canadian Crude, particularly heavy Oil. This could weigh on Canada\u2019s energy revenues and limit the Canadian Dollar\u2019s appeal against the US Dollar.\nOn the domestic front, signals from the Canadian labor market point to an uneven recovery. According to RBC, modest job gains and a higher Unemployment Rate reflect a gradual but choppy improvement in economic conditions. This assessment is broadly aligned with the Bank of Canada\u2019s (BoC) current wait-and-see stance on interest rates, which provides little immediate support to the Canadian currency.\nAgainst this backdrop, the divergence in momentum between the United States and Canada, combined with unfavorable Oil market dynamics, continues to favor a bullish bias in USD/CAD in the near term, with market participants closely watching upcoming macroeconomic data and monetary policy signals on both sides of the border.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today.

On January 6, 2026, Morgan Stanley Investment Management filed an S-1 registration statement with the SEC for a product officially named Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust. Many headlines shorten this to \u201cMorgan Stanley\u2019s Bitcoin ETF,\u201d and while that phrasing is common, the filing itself is very specific about how the product works, what investors get, and what risks remain.\nFor anyone trying to understand Bitcoin ETFs for the first time, this filing is a clean example of how large US financial institutions are now approaching crypto exposure in a regulated, structured way. If you are learning crypto markets through a Crypto Certification, this filing mirrors many of the mechanics taught in real trading and market structure modules.\nWhat Morgan Stanley filed\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management filed for Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust, described as an exchange-traded fund designed to track the price of Bitcoin, minus fees and expenses.\nKey points from the filing:\n- The product is a spot Bitcoin ETP, pending regulatory approval\n- It passively tracks Bitcoin price movements\n- It does not use leverage or derivatives\n- Exchange name and ticker symbol are still listed as TBD in the preliminary filing\nMorgan Stanley also filed other crypto ETPs around the same time, including a Solana product and, according to reporting, an Ether product. This signals a broader crypto strategy rather than a one-off Bitcoin experiment.\nHow the Bitcoin ETF structure works\nThe Trust is sponsored by Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley.\nThe goal is straightforward:\nTrack Bitcoin performance using a pricing benchmark based on aggregated executed trade flow from major spot exchanges, adjusted for Trust expenses and liabilities.\nThere is no active trading strategy here.\n- No leverage.\n- No futures.\n- No options.\nThis is designed to mirror Bitcoin\u2019s spot price as closely as possible.\nUnderstanding this structure is foundational knowledge for anyone studying institutional crypto products through a Tech Certification focused on financial systems and infrastructure.\nHow shares are created and redeemed\nLike other spot crypto ETPs, shares are created and redeemed in large blocks called Baskets.\nThere are two ways this happens.\nCash creation\n- An Authorized Participant deposits cash\n- The Sponsor instructs a Bitcoin Counterparty to buy Bitcoin\n- Bitcoin is deposited with the Trust\u2019s custodian\n- New shares are issued\nIn-kind creation\n- The Authorized Participant delivers Bitcoin directly to the custodian\n- Shares are issued in return\nRedemptions work the same way, either in cash or in kind. Importantly, trading slippage and execution costs are borne by the Authorized Participant, not the Trust or its investors.\nThis is why ETF pricing generally stays close to the underlying asset price, a concept often covered in professional Marketing and Business Certification programs when explaining market efficiency and arbitrage.\nFees\nThe Trust will charge a unitary Sponsor Fee expressed as a percentage of NAV. The exact percentage is not filled in yet in the preliminary prospectus.\nOne critical detail many new investors miss:\n- The Trust does not generate income\n- Fees are paid by transferring Bitcoin out of the Trust\n- This means the Bitcoin represented per share declines gradually over time\nThis is standard for spot Bitcoin ETPs, but it matters for long-term holders.\nCustody, prime brokers, and concentration risk\nThe filing describes the use of Bitcoin custodians and a prime broker, but several provider names are still redacted or left blank in this early version.\nMorgan Stanley explicitly flags:\n- Industry concentration risk\n- A limited number of qualified Bitcoin custodians and intermediaries\n- The risk that shared service providers across crypto products could amplify systemic impact if one fails\nThe Trust states that assets a"

                "body": "The SEC\u2019s Caroline Crenshaw crypto saga ended on January 2, 2026, when the agency's last Democratic commissioner officially departed. Her exit removed the final internal resistance to clearer rules, faster approvals, and a softer enforcement posture. With an all-Republican panel now in control, investors are reassessing risk across Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) based on improved regulatory visibility rather than speculation.\nPrediction Market powered by\nThis shift matters because regulation\u2014particularly the strong crypto opposition by Caroline Crenshaw\u2014had been the missing variable holding back institutional capital. As 2026 begins, the focus has moved from legal uncertainty to liquidity, ETFs, and macro alignment, setting the stage for a more structurally driven crypto cycle.\nCaroline Crenshaw's SEC Exit: What Changed on January 2?\nCaroline Crenshaw's departure marked the end of a long-running internal brake on crypto policy at the SEC. As the agency's lone Democratic commissioner, she consistently opposed crypto-related approvals\u2014from spot Bitcoin ETFs to XRP-linked products\u2014and publicly criticized the agency's decision to drop its appeal in the Ripple case. Her stance shaped years of regulatory caution and prolonged uncertainty.\nThat changed when her seat went vacant. The SEC now operates under a unified Republican majority, with no internal dissent blocking votes or softening enforcement direction. Chair Paul Atkins and Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda hold full decision-making control. The new face of the SEC signals clearer rulemaking, fewer surprise actions, and a departure from enforcement-first tactics that defined the Caroline Crenshaw era.\nHow Bitcoin and XRP Responded to the All-Republican SEC Panel\nThe market reaction\u2014particularly the Bitcoin and XRP rally\u2014following Crenshaw's exit reflected relief. Bitcoin moved steadily, climbing from around $88,000 to above $93,000 as regulatory uncertainty eased. The shift confirmed expectations already forming after her tenure expired, so the response stayed controlled.\nXRP told a different story. The token jumped 8% on January 3, reclaiming $2 for the first time since mid-December as long-standing regulatory pressure disappeared. XRP ETFs saw $13.59 million in inflows that day alone, pushing cumulative inflows past $1.3 billion since their November launch. Exchange balances also tightened, creating a supply squeeze that amplified demand.\nAlthough Bitcoin had already cleared its regulatory hurdles, XRP had not. Crenshaw's opposition had weighed directly on XRP-linked products, but her exit removed that ceiling overnight, allowing capital that had waited through 2025 to move quickly.\nWhy Crypto-Friendly Regulation Could Accelerate in 2026\nThe SEC's posture toward digital assets has changed in a measurable way. Enforcement activity slowed sharply after Paul Atkins took over, with most crypto-related cases quietly closed rather than expanded. This wasn't delayed action\u2014it was a deliberate shift away from enforcement as policy. With Crenshaw gone, internal resistance disappeared, allowing the agency to move in a single direction.\nWith Crenshaw gone, internal resistance disappeared entirely. The current Republican majority can advance rulemaking without dissents muddying intent or slowing timelines. Project Crypto, announced by Atkins in July 2025, aims to define what tokens are and how they should be regulated instead of leaving markets in limbo. Clear categories reduce guesswork for exchanges, custodians, and banks that previously stayed sidelined.\nThe SEC has outlined plans for a \"token taxonomy\" establishing digital commodities, network tokens, digital collectibles, and digital tools as non-securities. An \"innovation exemption\" is expected by early 2026, allowing crypto firms to launch tokens and products faster without full SEC registration.\nThe impact goes beyond paperwork. When compliance questions fade, institutions stop debating legality and start "

The single-day haul represents roughly 2.02% of the fund\u2019s latest reported assets under management, which now stand at about $1.05 billion, underscoring persistent demand for yield-focused Bitcoin exposure in a volatile market.\nThe latest flow suggests that investors are using BTCI\u2019s high-income strategy as a way to stay in the Bitcoin trade while cushioning drawdowns. With more than a fifth of a billion dollars effectively rotating into the fund in one session, the move signals renewed confidence in structured Bitcoin products that promise option-enhanced income rather than pure price speculation.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading around $90,234.03, down about 25.49% over the past three months, reflecting a sharp correction from prior highs as liquidity tightens and speculative froth evaporates. Yet the short-term picture is more nuanced: the 1-day technical signal stands at Hold, indicating that momentum and trend indicators are not yet aligned on a clear bullish or bearish break.\nThat divergence between a steep medium-term price drawdown and notable ETF inflows hints that some investors see current levels as an opportunity to accumulate yield-oriented Bitcoin exposure at a discount, betting that volatility can be monetized even if spot prices remain range-bound or choppy in the near term.\nFor a more detailed analysis and real-time sentiment trends, check the live cryptocurrency prices here."

                "body": "Today, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is priced at about $3,150, considerably lower than its all-time highs, and comfortably above the pits of early 2025. I predict that the cryptocurrency will hit $4,000 in 2026, because all it needs to do that is a couple of basic technical things to go right, and for investors to remember why the chain is still the center of the crypto-financial system.\nLet's walk through the catalysts that make this price target plausible, and take a little time to understand what the near term is likely to bring.\nThe next upgrade will be a catalyst, but it isn't the whole story\nPer its development roadmap, Ethereum's 2026 is supposed to be about more of the same stuff that helped the chain to become a lot more formidable and resilient in 2025.\nUpgrades are coming to improve the network's scaling capacity even further, with more efficient transaction execution, and, critically, new technical infrastructure to support the later addition of parallel transaction execution, as well as a slew of other fixes and minor improvements which users will probably not notice.\nThe first update, called Glamsterdam, is positioned as the successor to 2025's major packages, Pectra and Fusaka, both of which focused on improving the chain's ability to handle traffic without letting gas (user) fees get out of control. Glamsterdam should launch sometime in the first half of 2026, and it will be followed by another scaling-focused update called Hegota, which is slated for sometime in the second half of the year.\nCRYPTO: ETH\nKey Data Points\nThe optimistic version of this story is that once Glamsterdam goes live, the newly improved basis for faster throughput will attract more usage of decentralized finance (DeFi) services on the chain, which in turn will attract more app developers and financial institutions, and subsequently pull in even more capital. And, on some level, this narrative is almost certainly going to be proven true, as pushing a substantial (if somewhat invisible to users) upgrade less than a year after a pair of fairly meaty upgrades speaks to the quality of the chain's technical leadership, as well as its ability to execute on its stated plans.\nBut it probably will not, by itself, push the price to $4,000; the point of Glamsterdam is to overhaul a few of Ethereum's under-the-hood systems to create the technical foundations for big upgrades down the line.\nReal-world assets will probably be a bigger tailwind\nThe bigger driver for Ethereum to hit $4,000 or more is its expanding tokenized real-world asset (RWA) base, as well as its expanding base of capital stored in stablecoins.\nOn that front, Ethereum already has the crypto sector's largest stablecoin base, with about $170.9 billion in stablecoin market cap, alongside $12.6 billion in tradable RWA value. Importantly, Ethereum's most important tokenized assets for attracting institutional investors and financial institutions, like tokenized U.S. Treasuries, are by far the most ample in the entire crypto sector, with a value of $4.6 billion.\nAs capital continues to migrate to managing assets via blockchain tech, these pools of capital on Ethereum will serve to attract even more inflows, as capital tends to beget more capital. Doing that will require asset managers and other entities to hold some Ethereum coins to pay gas fees and for any DeFi services they might need. So, it will increase demand, and probably send prices a bit higher.\nSo, that's why I expect the coin to hit $4,000 or more sometime in 2026, assuming broader risk appetite does not collapse. There's no moonshot in the cards here -- just good old-fashioned technical progress on its core platform, and consistent traction leading to more entrenchment and growth in its base of tokenized assets.\nIf you don't own some Ethereum, it's worth considering buying and holding it as a long-term position -- just appreciate that in 2025, weak market conditions overrode the positive impacts of the tech upgrades on the coin's pri"

                "body": "Institutions are applying the same options playbook they perfected on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) to altcoins\u2014and XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) are the primary beneficiaries. Covered calls, protective puts, and collar strategies that once defined sophisticated Bitcoin trading are now standard tools across the most liquid altcoin markets.\nThis shift marks a turning point in how altcoins are perceived and traded. XRP, SOL, and ETH are no longer just speculative assets for retail traders chasing 10x returns. They\u2019re becoming institutional products: vehicles for structured yield generation, volatility management, and portfolio hedging. As 2026 rolls on, this institutional embrace is changing price dynamics, reducing volatility, and redefining the risk-reward profile of these digital assets.\nThe Bitcoin Options Playbook: What Institutions Are Copying\nBefore altcoins, Bitcoin was the sole focus of institutional options activity. Over the past few years, an impressive derivatives ecosystem developed around BTC, enabling institutions to manage risk and enhance returns with precision. Now, that same playbook is being applied to altcoins.\nThe use of options signals long-term commitment. Unlike spot trading, which can be short-term and speculative, options strategies require multi-month planning and derivatives expertise. Institutions using options aren\u2019t flipping tokens, but managing portfolios with defined risk and return parameters.\nCovered Calls\nA covered call involves holding the underlying asset\u2014such as Bitcoin or XRP\u2014and selling call options against it. This generates premium income, turning a volatile asset into a yield-bearing one. The trade-off is that upside is capped beyond the strike price\u2014if the asset rallies beyond the strike price, the seller forfeits additional gains.. For institutions, this is a conservative income strategy that works well in sideways or moderately bullish markets.\nProtective Puts\nInstitutions buy put options to hedge against downside risk. While this costs a premium, it limits potential losses during volatile periods. Protective puts are especially useful when holding high-beta assets like Solana or XRP.\nCollar Strategies\nA collar combines a covered call with a protective put. This defines both the upside and downside of a position, creating a risk-controlled range. Institutions use collars to lock in a band of returns, sacrificing some potential gains in exchange for downside protection. The strategy is ideal for long-term holders seeking stability.\nWhy XRP, Solana, and Ethereum Are Getting Institutional Options Adoption\nXRP\nXRP has emerged as a top institutional altcoin. The launch of XRP ETFs in November 2025, now holding $1.3 billion in assets under management, provided a regulated vehicle for exposure. The SEC lawsuit resolution in August 2025 removed a major regulatory overhang, clearing the path for broader adoption.\nA liquid options market is developing rapidly. Amplify\u2019s XRP 3% Monthly Premium Income ETF (XRPM), launched in November 2025, marked the first XRP-based options income product, targeting 36% annual premium income through covered call strategies. XRP\u2019s higher volatility compared to Bitcoin makes it attractive for covered calls\u2014premiums are richer. Institutions could own XRP to sell covered calls, creating accumulation pressure. As more funds adopt yield-focused strategies, XRP\u2019s demand profile strengthens.\nSolana\nSolana\u2019s spot ETFs, launched in late October 2025, have attracted over $765 million in cumulative inflows, with total assets under management surpassing $1 billion by early January 2026. As the fastest-growing Layer 1 blockchain, Solana offers extreme volatility\u2014something institutions are now monetizing through options. Covered calls on SOL generate high premiums, making it a lucrative income play.\nSolana\u2019s high-beta nature means larger price swings than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Institutions use options to manage this volatility, with treasury fir"

In 2025, Bitcoin inflows dropped 35% year-over-year to $26.98 billion, while major altcoins attracted sharply higher allocations.\nEthereum has led that push, recording a 137% increase with $12.69 billion.\nDecentralized finance is usually the core driver that separates Bitcoin from leading smart-contract ecosystems, yet DeFi activity itself stalled through much of 2025.\nTotal value locked across DeFi protocols surged 121% in 2024, from $52 billion to $115 billion, but grew just 1.73% the following year to around $117 billion.\nWhat makes this cycle different is the source of demand. Rather than organic DeFi usage, institutional participation has taken the lead.\nThe ETF narrative has broadened regulated digital asset exposure in U.S. TradFi markets, creating institutional-grade demand with a clear preference for ETH.\nEthereum Price Predicition: Why Are Institutions Bullish on ETH?\nThis capital rotation may have also been strategic, with Ethereum reaching the bottom of a potential 20-month bullish head-and-shoulders breakout over 2025.\nThe Ethereum price has confirmed a local bottom at $2,750, forming higher lows in a fresh uptrend that solidifies the right shoulder.\nMomentum indicators add validity to the trend. The RSI is pressing against the 50 neutral line after several higher lows, suggesting strength beneath the surface.\nThe MACD has also reversed towards the signal line in a potential golden cross setup, a sign that buyers may soon control the prevailing trend.\nA fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline tested around $5,500, reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 75% move.\nBut as the bull market matures, broader institutional participation alongside traction in DeFi as mainstream use cases are realised could extend the move 225% to $10,000.\nTraders should watch historical psychological levels around $3,500 and $4000 all-time highs as interim resistance to the move.\nBitcoin Hyper: Solana Technology Being Used for Bitcoin\nInstitutions that chose Ethereum as their TradFi bet may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability.\nBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin\u2019s security with Solana tech, creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn\u2019t support on its own.\nJust as Layer-2s like Ondo did for Ethereum, Bitcoin Hyper could bring Bitcoin deeper into the DeFi conversation.\nThe project has already raised over $30 million in presale, and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin\u2019s massive trading volume could send $HYPER significantly higher.\nBitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin\u2019s potential \u2013 just as the market turns bullish.\nVisit the Official Bitcoin Hyper Website Here- Crypto Market Prospect: After the Washout, the Soil Looks Richer\n- [LIVE] Fed Payments Innovation Conference: Real-Time Updates as Federal Reserve Discusses Crypto, Stablecoins, and AI with Industry Leaders\n- XRP Price Prediction: Three Straight Red Days \u2013 Is This Just a Pullback or the Start of a Panic Selloff?\n- Crypto Price Prediction Today 8 January \u2013 XRP, Bitcoin, Maxi Doge\n- Why Is Crypto Up Today? \u2013 "

A quick pullback failed to derail the move. Fresh on-chain speculation powered the recovery as meme trading rushed back to the network.\nThat rotation boosted activity fast. DEX volumes on Solana jumped close to 40% week over week. Weekly DEX turnover now nears $30 billion, pushing the Solana price predictions into bullish territory.\nThe surge helped clean up the chart. SOL broke its prior downtrend and now aims at $160, where the 200-day EMA waits. Momentum looks supportive, but caution remains as some Solana price predictions remain bearish.\nA clean move above $160 needs real growth to stick. That break could target $200. Failure would favor sideways action.\nEthereum investors target the $7k mark\nEthereum sits near a turning point on the weekly chart. Long-term structure now matters more than daily noise. Since the 2022 bottom, ETH has held a rising channel and kept printing higher lows. Demand stays steady. A brief push above resistance failed, but the pullback left the broader trend intact.\nThat rejection pushed ETH into a tight range. Price now coils between rising support and firm overhead supply. This setup signals balance, not weakness. Buyers defend higher levels. Sellers limit upside. ETH still trades well above key support, which points to quiet accumulation.\nThe recent fake breakout may help, not hurt. It cleared leverage and cooled optimism without breaking structure. The next move needs weekly confirmation. A strong close above resistance could unlock a run toward $6,500-$7,000.\nThe bottom line\nSolana price predictions may still grab attention, but with a $75 billion market cap, the true 100x upside potential is gone.

                "body": "Circle\u2019s USDC has overtaken Tether\u2019s USDT in annual transaction volume for the first time, marking a historic shift in the stablecoin landscape.\nFor a decade, USDT has reigned as the undisputed king of stablecoins. It still commands a $187 billion market cap\u2014nearly 2.5 times USDC\u2019s $75 billion market cap. Yet 2025 revealed a different story beneath the surface: the smaller stablecoin is now moving more money.\nSponsoredUSDC Leads by 39%\nAccording to data from Artemis Analytics, USDC processed $18.3 trillion worth of transfers in 2025, compared to USDT\u2018s $13.2 trillion\u2014a 39% gap.\nArtemis Stablecoin Transfer Volume filters out MEV bot transactions and intra-exchange transfers, isolating the platform\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d on-chain activity. This metric provides an upper bound on actual payments and DeFi usage, rather than raw transaction counts inflated by automated trading. In short, real-world payments, P2P transfers, and DeFi activity count; automated bot trades and exchange wallet reshuffling do not.\nWhy USDC Pulled Ahead\nThe gap comes down to four factors: how DeFi works, where it\u2019s happening, an unexpected catalyst, and regulatory timing.\n1. DeFi Turnover\nAnalysts attribute the gap largely to how each stablecoin is used. USDC dominates decentralized finance platforms, where traders frequently enter and exit positions. The same dollar gets recycled multiple times through lending protocols and DEX swaps. USDT, by contrast, serves more as a store of value and payment rail\u2014users tend to hold it in wallets rather than move it constantly.\nSponsored2. The Solana Factor\nSolana\u2019s explosive DeFi growth became USDC\u2019s primary engine. The stablecoin now accounts for over 70% of all stablecoins on the network, while USDT remains concentrated on Tron. In Q1 2025 alone, Solana\u2019s total stablecoin supply surged from $5.2 billion to $11.7 billion\u2014a 125% increase driven almost entirely by USDC inflows.\n3. The Trump Token Irony\nThe January 2025 launch of the TRUMP memecoin inadvertently supercharged USDC adoption. The token\u2019s primary liquidity pool on Meteora DEX is paired with USDC, not USDT. This meant traders rushing to buy TRUMP first needed to acquire USDC, creating a demand spike that rippled across Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\nThe irony runs deeper: the Trump family launched its own stablecoin, USD1, through World Liberty Financial in March. Yet the TRUMP token they inspired ended up boosting a competitor\u2019s stablecoin.\n4. Regulatory Tailwinds\nThe July passage of the Genius Act in the US established clear legal standards for stablecoin issuers. Industry observers note that USDC\u2019s longstanding emphasis on regulatory compliance and reserve transparency positioned it to benefit most from the new framework. In Europe, USDC\u2019s MiCA compliance has given it an edge amid delisting pressure on several exchanges facing USDT.\nA Rising Tide\nThe USDC surge contributed to record stablecoin activity overall. Total transaction volume reached $33 trillion in 2025, up 72% year over year. Q4 alone saw $11 trillion in flows, accelerating from $8.8 trillion in Q3.\nBloomberg Intelligence projects stablecoin payment flows could reach $56 trillion by 2030, positioning the sector as a major global payment rail alongside traditional networks."

                "body": "Major stock indexes ended sharply highs Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 setting closing records, after the U.S. unemployment rate declined more than expected in December.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow finished the day up 0.8%, 0.7%, and 0.5%, respectively. For the week, the Dow rose 2.3%, while the Nasdaq added 1.9% and the S&P 500 tacked on 1.6%.\nThe monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed the U.S. economy added 50,000 nonfarm jobs in December, below the 73,000 expected and weaker than the revised figure of 56,000 jobs added in November. However, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4% from 4.6% the month before, lower than the expected 4.5% rate.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, was around 4.17% at 4 p.m. ET, little changed from Thursday's close.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court did not decide on the legality of Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs on Friday, which had been a possibility. When it does issue a decision, it could back the \"Liberation Day\" levies announced in April or go as far as to deem them illegal and roll them back. A ruling could bring clarity to trade policy that has been muddled for nearly a year\u2014and which, when first announced, shocked markets that have since recovered.\nWest Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were up 1.8% to $58.80 a barrel as oil executives met President Trump about doing business in Venezuela, while gold futures advanced 1.3% to $4,515 an ounce.\nBitcoin was trading around $90,200, little changed on the day. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, was 0.2% higher at 99.13.\nIn corporate moves, shares of Oklo (OKLO) and Vistra (VST) soared a respective 8% and 10%, with the latter firm among the top S&P 500 gainers, after Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META) announced it had inked \"landmark agreements\" with the companies and privately held TerraPower to power its AI projects.\nIntel (INTC) was the top-performing stock in the Nasdaq, surging nearly 11% after President Trump wrote on his Truth Social network last night that he had \"just finished a great meeting\" with CEO Lip-Bu Tan.\nGeneral Motors (GM) stock was down 2.7% after the automaker said it would incur a $6 billion charge tied to its EV business, while U.S.-listed shares of mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) declined 3.7% on news it was restarting talks to merge with Glencore, whose shares soared nearly 10% in London trading.\nShares of Magnificent Seven tech giants Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) were up 1% and 0.1%, respectively. Google parent Alphabet surpassed Apple to rank second behind Nvidia (NVDA) in market capitalization Wednesday, at just below $4 trillion.\nTrump Posted Unpublished Jobs Report Data Ahead of Scheduled Release\nIf you wanted to know how the jobs market was doing at the end of the year, you could have waited until Friday morning's highly anticipated December jobs report\u2014or you could have gotten the information early by following President Donald Trump's social media feed.\nLate Thursday, about 12 hours before the scheduled release of the data, Trump posted a graph prepared by the Council of Economic Advisors on his Truth Social platform showing job creation figures since January.\nWhen the Bureau of Labor Statistics published the official jobs report Friday morning, the data matched what Trump had posted the night before: U.S. employers added just 473,000 jobs from February through December, marking the slowest pace of job creation outside of a recession since 2003. Trump's post highlighted the fact that the private sector had accounted for all new jobs created over the period, while the number of government jobs had fallen sharply.\nRead the full article here.\nStocks Could Keep Rising Even If AI Spending Slows Down.

This further reinforced the market's view that the U.S. job market is in a state of 'low hiring, low layoffs', boosting confidence that the economy could avoid a recession.\nThe weaker-than-expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls report did not significantly alter market expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cuts this year. According to CME data, the market currently expects only a 5% probability of the Federal Reserve cutting rates at its next meeting, compared with 11% in the previous trading session. However, the market as a whole still anticipates that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at least twice this year.\nThe three major U.S. stock indices closed higher collectively. In the first full trading week of 2026, Wall Street's three major indices surged significantly across the board.\n$Star Tech Companies (LIST2518.US)$ Most stocks closed higher, with Intel surging over 10%, hitting a new high since March 2024. ASML Holding rose more than 6%, Oracle gained nearly 5%, Broadcom climbed nearly 4%, Tesla increased over 2%, and Google's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion during trading. NVIDIA edged slightly lower, while Apple ended its seven-day losing streak.\n$Residential Construction (LIST2005.US)$ \u3001 $Real Estate Services (LIST0941.SH)$ \u3001 $Mortgage Finance (LIST2479.US)$The sector led gains, with Lennar Corporation rising nearly 9% and D.R. Horton gaining nearly 8%. This followed after Trump instructed the purchase of $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, and the U.S. Secretary of Commerce met with builders to discuss ways to improve housing affordability.\n$Data storage stock (LIST23925.US)$A broad-based rebound occurred, with the sector index recovering yesterday's losses. Micron Technology rose over 5%, and SanDisk surged over 12%. A research report from Nomura Securities pointed out that demand for high-capacity 3D NAND used in enterprise SSDs remained strong, and prices for SanDisk's related products this quarter may surge over 100% sequentially.\n$Nuclear Power (LIST2583.US)$ \u3001 $Uranium (LIST2430.US)$ \u3001 $Electrical Equipment (LIST2077.US)$The concept gained strength following news that Meta agreed to purchase nuclear power from companies like Oklo and Vistra to run artificial intelligence data centers. Shares of Oklo and Vistra soared significantly, driving gains in the broader industry sector. Peers such as NuScale Power, Centrus Energy, and Cameco also strengthened on the back of this news.\n$Semiconductor Equipment & Materials (LIST2016.US)$ \u3001 $Rare Earth Stocks (LIST23700.US)$Key concepts continued their strong performance, with ASML Holding, Lam Research, and Applied Materials surging to new all-time highs. CRML closed up 11%.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court did not issue a ruling on the legality of the Trump administration's comprehensive tariffs on Friday, leaving some investors who had anticipated a definitive outcome still in suspense. Additionally, Trump stated that a potential government shutdown could occur again on January 30.\nBelow is the performance of various core assets:\nAgainst the backdrop of temporarily subdued tariff uncertainties and mixed employment data, risk appetite returned to U.S. equities on Friday. Both equity indices and the U.S. Dollar Index rose, capping off a strong start to the new year, while U.S. Treasury bonds came under pressure and declined.\nDuring early trading in the U.S. stock market, attention was focused on whether the U.S. Supreme Court would issue a ruling on tariffs. The associated uncertainty briefly weighed on the performance of some consumer stocks. Upon confirmation that no decision would be made that day, capital swiftly shifted focus back to macroeconomic data. Mild employment data supported gains in the three major U.S. indices, with the "

This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago \u2014 sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% \u2014 down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\nOil price pressure\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil \u2014 still under tough sanctions \u2014 back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

Chip stocks rose and helped to boost the S&P 500, with Intel gaining after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d with the chipmaker\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Lip-Bu Tan.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly report showed 50,000 workers were added to nonfarm payrolls in December, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a rise of 60,000, just above November\u2019s downwardly revised increase of 56,000. The unemployment rate eased, as expected, to 4.4%.\nFed funds futures traders are now pricing in only a 4.8% chance of a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s Jan. 27-28 meeting, down from 11.6% before the data. The next cut is unlikely before at least April.\n\u201cPayrolls were a little bit light relative to consensus, but still fairly strong numbers,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.\n\u201cWe are back to normal in terms of economic reporting so that\u2019s a bit of a relief for everyone.\u201d\nBefore now, the release of U.S. economic data had been delayed because of the long federal government shutdown.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 252.84 points, or 0.51%, to 49,518.95, the S&P 500 rose 53.23 points, or 0.77%, to 6,974.69 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 216.38 points, or 0.92%, to 23,696.40.\nAll three indexes are set for weekly gains in the first full trading week of 2026, with the Dow on track for its biggest weekly gain since the last week of November.\nMSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.01 points, or 0.58%, to 1,035.46.\nEuropean shares ended at a record high. A jump in Glencore helped put the STOXX 600 on its longest weekly winning streak since May. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.97%.\nDollar, two-year yields up\nAfter the jobs report the dollar initially gave up almost all the day\u2019s gains versus a basket of major currencies, having risen by nearly 0.2% earlier. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, was last up 0.26% at 99.13.\nInterest rate sensitive two-year Treasury yields were higher after the data, while 10-year yields were last down slightly. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Fed, rose 5 basis points to 3.538%, from 3.488% late on Thursday. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 1.2 basis points to 4.171%.\nIn commodities, crude oil ended sharply higher. Brent futures rose $1.35, or 2.18%, to settle at $63.34 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $1.36, or 2.35%, to $59.12.\nInvestors have become more convinced that production in Venezuela, even under U.S. control, may not rise meaningfully for some time.\nSupreme Court won\u2019t rule on Trumps\u2019 tariffs today\nInvestors had been bracing for a possible U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nBut the court is expected to issue its next rulings on Wednesday. The court indicated on its website on Friday that it could release decisions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting next Wednesday."

Destatis said industrial production rose 0.8% month over month in November 2025, beating expectations for a 0.6% drop and building on a revised 2.0% gain. But the trade surplus shrank to \u20ac13.1 billion as exports fell 2.5% and imports rose 0.8%, suggesting external demand is still shaky. ING called it a tug-of-war \u2013 firmer output versus soft exports and private consumption \u2013 and thinks another quarter of stagnation is possible, though it still expects a..\nreturn to growth in 2026 as fiscal stimulus lands and industry stabilizes.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Green shoots are great but investors want follow-through.\nThe DAX\u2019s gain reflects relief that Germany\u2019s factory engine can still surprise on the upside, but the export slide is a reminder that many German heavyweights are tied to global demand. That\u2019s why stock-specific execution is getting rewarded: Fresenius Medical Care jumped after speeding up its \u20ac1 billion buyback, citing strong cash flow. And Heidelberg Materials got another boost after Berenberg raised its price target, pointing to pricing power, capital discipline, and decarbonization plans \u2013 traits investors tend to pay up for when growth is patchy.\nThe bigger picture: Germany can\u2019t export its way out of a slowdown this time.\nRising output can be an early sign the cycle is turning, but a smaller surplus shows trade isn\u2019t doing the heavy lifting. If planned fiscal stimulus translates into higher domestic spending and investment, it could bridge the gap from stagnation to a more durable upswing. Until then, the picture looks split \u2013 industry improving in spots while consumers and overseas buyers stay cautious.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "After closing mixed for two consecutive sessions, stocks are likely to move to the upside in early trading on Friday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a higher open for the markets, with the S&P 500 futures up by 0.4 percent.\nStocks may benefit from a positive reaction to the release of the Labor Department's closely watched report on employment in the month of December.\nWith the report showing employment increased by less than expected in December, the data may generate optimism about the outlook for interest rates.\nThe Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment rose by 50,000 jobs in December after climbing by a downwardly revised 56,000 jobs in November.\nEconomists had expected employment to rise by 60,000 jobs compared to the addition of 64,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.\nMeanwhile, the report said the unemployment rate edged down to 4.4 percent in December from a revised 4.5 percent in November.\nThe unemployment rate was expected to slip to 4.5 percent from the 4.6 percent originally reported for the previous month.\nWhile the Federal Reserve is still widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting later this month, the report may increase confidence in further rate cuts later this year.\nNot long after the start of trading, the University of Michigan is scheduled to release its preliminary reading on consumer sentiment in the month of January. The consumer sentiment index is expected to inch up to 53.5 in January from 52.9 in December.\nAfter ending yesterday's lackluster session on opposite sides of the unchanged line, the major U.S. stock indexes turned in another mixed performance during trading on Thursday.\nWhile the Dow moved back to the upside after Wednesday's pullback, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed lower for the first time in four sessions.\nThe Dow climbed 270.03 points or 0.6 percent to 49,266.11, bouncing back toward the record closing high set on Tuesday. The S&P 500 also crept up by 0.53 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 6,921.46, but the Nasdaq fell 104.26 points or 0.4 percent to 23,480.02.\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index jumped by 1.6 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index advanced by 0.9 percent.\nThe major European markets have also moved to the upside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is up by 1.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.8 percent and the German DAX Index is up by 0.5 percent.\nIn commodities trading, crude oil futures are rising $0.26 to $58.02 a barrel after spiking $1.77 to $57.76 a barrel on Thursday. Meanwhile, after edging down $1.80 to $4,460.70 ounce in the previous session, gold futures are climbing $36.40 to $4,497.10 an ounce.\nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 157.46 yen versus the 156.87 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1647 compared to yesterday's $1.1658.\nby RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com"

                "body": "The chaos and confusion of RFK Jr.'s new alcohol policy\nFederal health officials are no longer advising how many alcoholic drinks are safe for Americans, instead urging people to \"consume less alcohol\" and abstain altogether if they have certain health conditions.\nThe new advice from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services is an about-face from a longstanding government guideline that said drinking in moderation meant two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women.\nScientists, nutritionists and advocates say the new guidance is too vague for people to apply to their everyday lives, and criticize the Trump administration for missing an opportunity to warn about alcohol\u2019s link to cancer and other health problems.\n\u201cAny level of drinking has some risk, and it increases with more drinking,\u201d said Christopher Kahler, the director of the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University. \u201cThere\u2019s no discussion of risk in the guidelines now, just that drinking less is better for your health.\u201d\nFor the first time, the committee that put together the bulk of the dietary guidance did not address alcohol themselves, according to Deirdre Kay Tobias, a nutrition professor at Harvard University who was on the committee. Instead, the Trump administration relied on advice from two outside committees to study how alcohol affects health.\nOne study found the risk of breast cancer increases with every drink a person consumes each day, among other things. A draft of the other report said the risk of dying from alcohol use \u201cbegins at very low levels of average use,\u201d and linked alcohol use to seven types of cancers.\nBut the administration wrote in a document that it chose not to \"consider the findings\" of those two committees.\nDr. Mehmet Oz, who runs the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a news conference Jan. 7 that alcohol\u2019s value comes from being a social lubricant that brings friends together to have a good time, but said the \u201cbest case scenario\u201d would be not drinking at all.\n\u201cThere is alcohol in these dietary guidelines, but the implication is don\u2019t have it for breakfast, all right?\u201d Oz said. \u201cThis should be something done in a small amount and hopefully at some kind of an event that might have alcohol at it.\u201d\nOz said \u201cthere was never really good data to support\u201d women having one drink per day and men having two drinks per day. \u201cThat data was probably primarily confused with broader data about social connectiveness,\u201d he said.\nTeresa Fung, a registered dietician and professor at Simmons University in Boston, said people who come to her want specific guidance that gives them a clear message, not a general recommendation to eat or drink more or less of something.\n\u201cThe current recommendation of \u2018drink less alcohol\u2019 is vague,\u201d Fung said. \u201cLike, what does it mean? I drink a six pack a day, do I now drink five? It\u2019s less, but is it good enough? And those who drink once a month, do they have to drink less?\u201d\nKahler, from Brown University, said the one-to-two drink standard gave people a clear benchmark to consider their drinking habits, for doctors to give medical advice and for academics like him to study people drinking excessively.\n\u201cWere the prior guidelines a license to drink?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think there were some concerns that they were indicating that that level of drinking is safe, and I think research has established that there are known risks at even lower levels of drinking.\u201d\nMike Marshall, the CEO of the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance, said his group advocated to reduce the level of moderate drinking to one drink per day for men. He said they tried many times to meet with Kennedy or his staff but were unsuccessful.\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services for response.\nMarshall cited the draft study showing that men who have seven drinks per week have a one in 1,000 chance of dying from an alcohol-related issue, compared to a one in 25 chance at 14 drinks per we"

                "body": "January 10: Yen Slides to 158 as Election Talk Lifts Nikkei Futures\nThe Japanese yen at 1-year low set the tone on January 10, with USD/JPY 158 briefly in focus after reports that PM Sanae Takaichi may dissolve the lower house. Stronger U.S. wage data pushed Treasury yields higher, lifting the dollar and pressuring the yen. Nikkei futures surged more than 1,700 points on hopes for pro-growth policy and a weaker currency. We break down what this move means for portfolios in Japan, sector impact, and near-term risks to watch.\nWhy the yen slid today\nTalk of a possible snap election under PM Sanae Takaichi raised hopes for growth-friendly fiscal steps, which can support risk assets while weakening the currency. Markets often price larger deficits and infrastructure outlays as supportive for equities. That can draw foreign inflows into stocks and out of the yen, especially when global yields are rising. Political timing now intersects with currency dynamics, amplifying moves.\nStronger U.S. wage readings nudged Treasury yields higher, making the dollar more attractive versus low-yielding currencies. That backdrop helped drive USD/JPY 158 and the Japanese yen at 1-year low. The shift was highlighted in global FX coverage by Reuters. Until U.S. yields ease, rate differentials may keep pressure on the yen.\nTraders are alert to possible verbal warnings if moves become disorderly. Officials tend to emphasize stability, not specific levels, but many watch the 160 area as a psychological line. The Bank of Japan\u2019s gradual normalization outlook reduces negative-rate support, yet the pace is slow. That leaves currency direction sensitive to U.S. data, election headlines, and any signs of official concern.\nWhat a weaker yen means for Japan equities\nA softer yen improves the translated profits of exporters. Auto, machinery, and tech hardware names often benefit as overseas sales convert into more yen. This is one reason Nikkei futures jumped more than 1,700 points as the Japanese yen at 1-year low drew attention, according to Nikkei. Cyclicals tied to global demand usually lead on days when USD/JPY 158 extends.\nFinancials can see mixed effects. Higher global yields can improve investment income for insurers and widen net interest margins for some banks. However, rapid currency swings raise hedging costs and valuation uncertainty. If domestic yields stay capped, the benefit may be limited. Investors should compare each firm\u2019s foreign bond exposure, dollar hedging policy, and sensitivity to market volatility before chasing the move.\nImport-heavy sectors face higher costs when the yen weakens. Retailers with large imported inventories, food producers reliant on commodities, and utilities exposed to fuel imports may feel margin pressure. Price pass-through and currency hedges can cushion the hit. We look for companies with better pricing power, flexible procurement, or natural dollar revenues to offset costs and protect earnings in the coming quarter.\nKey levels and portfolio considerations\nUSD/JPY 158 marks the latest breakout, with 160 seen as a key psychological level. If election headlines build and U.S. yields stay firm, momentum could persist. For equities, watch whether Nikkei futures hold gains into cash trading and if leadership broadens beyond exporters. Breadth and volume confirmation can signal whether this is a trend or a short squeeze.\nFor investors with U.S. assets, partial hedges can reduce drawdowns if the yen rebounds. Simple approaches include using yen-hedged ETFs or staggered forward contracts sized to a fraction of foreign holdings. Keep hedges dynamic rather than all-or-nothing. Review hedge costs versus expected carry. A balanced stance lets portfolios benefit from equity upside while managing currency swings.\nCatalysts include domestic political developments around the Takaichi election narrative, upcoming U.S. data that influence Treasury yields, and any official remarks on FX moves. Sudden statements can spark sharp rever"

So when China tightens export controls, manufacturers can feel it fast through delays and higher costs. Japan says it will coordinate with allies like the US on \u201csupply security\u201d and is assessing the impact on domestic companies. At the same time, the weaker yen is helping exports and narrowing Japan\u2019s trade deficit, cushio..\nning the macro hit even if supply chains get messier.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Supply chains can move stocks faster than sales.\nInvestors are treating access to critical materials as a real competitive edge. Companies tied to electrification and data infrastructure can benefit from demand, but they\u2019re also exposed to magnet shortages and price spikes. If controls persist, expect more talk of stockpiling, long-term supply contracts, and alternative sourcing \u2013 and more volatility for automakers and electronics firms that can\u2019t easily redesign components.\nThe bigger picture: Strategic materials are becoming a new macro variable.\nFor decades, interest rates and oil were the big swing factors. Now, governments are also competing over chokepoint inputs that sit upstream of entire industries. Japan is trying to build resilience through diplomacy and coordination, while the yen\u2019s weakness and improving trade balance buy it time. But a world of tighter tech and materials controls could keep global supply chains less efficient \u2013 and inflation risks stickier \u2013 than investors got used to.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
