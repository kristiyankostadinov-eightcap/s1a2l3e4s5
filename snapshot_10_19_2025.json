                "body": "As global financial markets navigate a landscape fraught with persistent inflation, shifting monetary policies, and escalating geopolitical tensions, gold has unequivocally cemented its position as a core defensive asset in investor portfolios. The precious metal, often dubbed the ultimate safe haven, has witnessed a remarkable surge, with spot gold prices hovering between an unprecedented $4,100 and $4,379.60 per ounce as of October 2025. This robust performance, reflecting year-to-date gains of 57% to 65%, underscores gold's enduring appeal as a bulwark against economic uncertainty and currency debasement. Its immediate implication is a noticeable reallocation of capital by investors seeking refuge from volatility and a reliable store of value.\nThe current economic climate, characterized by a complex interplay of macroeconomic forces, has created a fertile ground for gold's resurgence. Persistent and \"sticky\" global inflationary pressures, particularly in critical sectors like energy and groceries, continue to erode purchasing power. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) registered 4.2% in September 2025, significantly above the Federal Reserve's target, while other regions, such as the UK, project inflation averaging 3.4% in 2025. This sustained inflation directly fuels demand for gold as a proven hedge against rising prices. Simultaneously, a pivotal shift towards monetary policy easing by major central banks is making gold increasingly attractive. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to implement another 25 basis point rate cut in October 2025, with further reductions anticipated, in response to a softening labor market. Similar dovish pivots are being observed or considered by the European Central Bank (ECB) and other central banks globally, reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold.\nAdding to this intricate mosaic are escalating and persistent geopolitical tensions. Renewed U.S.-China trade disputes, ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, renewed drone and missile attacks in Ukraine, and a prolonged U.S. government shutdown have collectively rattled investor confidence. These widespread geopolitical risks, coupled with broader policy uncertainty and international sanctions, drive investors towards gold as a premier safe haven. Central banks worldwide are also aggressively increasing their gold reserves, a strategic move motivated by geopolitical instability and a broader trend of de-dollarization, signaling a fundamental shift in global financial dynamics. This environment of heightened market volatility and a pervasive \"risk-off\" sentiment strongly supports gold's defensive role. A recent market stress test in October 2025 vividly demonstrated gold's effectiveness in providing portfolio protection, maintaining stability while equities and cryptocurrencies experienced significant declines. Concerns over credit stress within the U.S. regional banking sector and the private credit market further contribute to market jitters, pushing investors towards the perceived safety of gold.\nCompanies Navigating the Golden Tide: Winners and Losers\nThe ascendancy of gold as a core defensive asset creates distinct opportunities and challenges across various industries, particularly for public companies directly and indirectly exposed to the precious metal's market dynamics.\nGold Mining Companies (Winners): The most direct beneficiaries of surging gold prices are gold mining companies. Companies like Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE: GOLD), Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM), and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE: AEM) are poised for significant gains. Higher gold prices directly translate to increased revenue and potentially fatter profit margins, assuming production costs remain stable. These companies can leverage improved cash flows to fund exploration, expand existing operations, or return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Investors often flock to these equities as a leveraged play on gold"

                "body": "- Investors are turning to gold, silver, and bitcoin amid fears of currency debasement.\n- Concerns about rising government debt, low interest rates, and potential inflation are growing.\n- Experts debate the effectiveness of gold and bitcoin versus international equities and TIPS.\nIf there's a phrase of the day on Wall Street right now, it's \"debasement,\" says Sarah Beaton, director of investment strategy at Madera Wealth Management.\n\"Everyone's talking about it,\" she told Business Insider. \"That's the boogeyman right now.\"\nSo, what is it?\nEssentially, investors are worried about the debasement of fiat currencies and sovereign debt assets as government spending and debt levels continue to rise. In simpler terms, they're concerned that the value of money and bonds will be inflated away.\nTo deal with this threat, investors are increasingly piling into what's being called the debasement trade \u2014 taking long positions in gold, silver, and bitcoin. All three of the assets have surged more than 60% in 2025, crushing the stock market.\nHere's what to know about the buzziest trade on Wall Street.\nWhy now?\nThink about the collective investor as your nutty uncle who's been getting really into doomsday prepping lately. The gist of the debasement trade is to hedge portfolios against the devaluation of other investments.\nThere are valid warning signs that debasement is underway. The US government deficit is set to balloon further as tax cut extensions take hold in 2026. Debt, which is inherently inflationary, is mounting, and the government has piled up $38 trillion of it as of this month, according to data from the Treasury Department.\nThe Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is slashing interest rates, adding fuel to the economy by making borrowing cheaper. Higher tariffs threaten to leak into consumer prices.\nBut one could also argue that the apocalypse isn't as close as some would have you believe, and that worries about debasement aren't all that severe yet. After all, long-term inflation expectations are still muted, the dollar's value hasn't declined all that much in recent months, and long-term interest rates are still below 5%.\nCan the trade keep going?\nIt depends on who you ask, but some think yes, the rallies in precious metals and bitcoin can continue.\n\"We believe lower US real interest rates, further USD weakness, and ongoing political twists will drive prices higher,\" said Wayne Gordon, a strategist at UBS, in an October 3 client note.\nBen McMillan, the CIO at IDX Advisors, said that gold and bitcoin should also benefit from governments buying them up.\nGold is \"going into vaults in China, India, Russia, and everywhere else, and it's out of circulation. It's not unlike bitcoin being burned, frankly. And that's because people are worried about the beginning of the end of dollar hegemony,\" he said. \"Bitcoin is just a digital version of that trade.\"\nOthers are skeptical. David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, thinks bitcoin is a fraudulent asset with no value, for instance, and that gold has a poor track record.\n\"It does have a standing as a central bank reserve currency. It also has industrial and jewelry uses, so it's not just pure ether like cryptocurrencies,\" Kelly said. \"But it doesn't pay any dividends, doesn't generate income, and hasn't proved to grow wealth over time.\"\nHe continued: \"Since 1980, gold has basically, through a lot of zigs and zags, just kept pace with inflation. People talk about long-term assets being 'as good as gold' \u2014 I can't think of any long-term asset that's been as bad as gold.\"\nAre gold, bitcoin, and silver the right way to hedge debasement?\nSome market pros have called into question investing in assets like gold and bitcoin as a play on the debasement trade.\nKelly said that a better way to play a falling dollar is to be in UK and European equities and currencies.\n\"I'm not a fan of gold. But if I want to make a bet that the dollar is going to come down \u2014 and I do \u2014 you could be"

                "body": "Morgan Stanley noted that there is a 2.5 million barrels per day discrepancy in estimates of OPEC production among institutions. If more accurate data were used, it would reveal three key insights: OPEC's production increase merely reflects quota adjustments to match actual output rather than representing new supply; real spare capacity stands at only about 2.9 million barrels per day, much lower than expected; global oil demand has been systematically underestimated. Based on stronger underlying demand and limited supply growth, the market is expected to rebalance in the second half of 2027, with Brent crude potentially rebounding to USD 65 per barrel.\nThe global oil market may have been misled by \"false data\" for years. Morgan Stanley's latest research report reveals that OPEC's production increase might just be a numbers game, with real idle capacity far lower than expected, while the overlooked strong demand is quietly rewriting the future trajectory of oil prices.\nOn October 18, according to TradingView, Morgan Stanley\u2019s latest research report unveiled a shocking phenomenon in the oil market: major data providers\u2019 estimates of OPEC crude oil production showed an unprecedented divergence, with a gap as high as 2.5 million barrels per day.\nMartijn Rats, the bank's chief analyst, and his team pointed out through in-depth analysis that using more accurate production data would lead to three disruptive conclusions: OPEC's production increase plan is essentially \"nominal,\" real idle capacity is far lower than expected, and global oil demand is stronger than commonly perceived.\nThe report states that first, OPEC's announced production increase may be \"nominal\"\u2014the rise in production quotas merely reflects catching up with existing actual production rather than truly releasing new supply. Second, this indicates that OPEC's real idle capacity is far lower than widely expected, currently at only about 2.9 million barrels per day, which is historically low. Most crucially, if OPEC production has indeed been underestimated and these barrels are not entering observable inventories, there is only one reasonable explanation\u2014the global oil demand and its growth have also been systematically underestimated.\nBased on this, Morgan Stanley adjusted its forecast: although short-term oversupply pressures will continue to push oil prices lower, given stronger underlying demand and limited supply growth, the oil market may rebalance in the second half of 2027, with Brent crude potentially rebounding to $65 per barrel.\nOPEC Production Data Puzzle: Discrepancies Reach Record Levels\nThe report states that the core contradiction in the oil market lies in an increasingly challenging issue\u2014the reliability of OPEC production data.\nThe estimates of OPEC crude oil production by six professional data providers tracked by Morgan Stanley\u2014Argus, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Energy Aspects, the International Energy Agency, Rystad, and S&P Global Commodities\u2014showed an error margin of only 400-500 thousand barrels per day during the 2020-2022 period. However, discrepancies began to emerge at the start of 2023 and had widened to consistently exceed 1.5 million barrels per day by 2025.\nMore strikingly, the divergence further expanded upon the inclusion of Petro-Logistics' data. In September 2025, the gap between the highest and lowest estimates reached 2.5 million barrels per day\u2014a figure equivalent to Morgan Stanley\u2019s forecast of market oversupply in 2026, which is certainly not a negligible statistical error.\nAfter consulting with numerous physical trading market participants, Morgan Stanley received unexpected feedback: most industry insiders consider Petro-Logistics\u2019 estimates to be the \"most accurate.\" The institution has specialized in OPEC production estimates for over 45 years, relying on an extensive network of information sources, satellite tanker tracking, and government reports, while also providing transparent data construction methodo"

Citi\u2019s $50 bear case clashes with BofA\u2019s $55 support | That's TradingNEWS\nBrent and WTI Face Diverging Paths Amid Demand Uncertainty\nBrent crude (BZ=F) and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) ended the week mixed, with Brent up 0.38% at $61.29 and WTI edging 0.14% higher to $57.54. Despite these small gains, both benchmarks remain down roughly 18% for the year as global inventories swell and traders brace for a potential test of the $55\u2013$50 range. Citi\u2019s latest outlook cautioned that easing geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine could accelerate a drop toward $50 Brent, while BofA Global Research reaffirmed its view of a $55 floor, citing steady demand and OPEC+\u2019s willingness to defend price stability.\nCiti\u2019s $50 Bearish Thesis Faces Supply Reality Check\nCitigroup\u2019s forecast reflects growing skepticism about a sustained rebound. Senior strategist Eric Lee argued that de-escalation in Eastern Europe could trigger a \u201cfaster move\u201d toward $50 as speculative longs unwind. However, that thesis is being challenged by supply discipline from Saudi Arabia and resilient demand from China, which continues to replenish strategic reserves. Despite rising global stocks \u2014 with Vortexa data showing 1.2 billion barrels of crude at sea, the highest since 2016 \u2014 consistent Asian buying and U.S. refilling of its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) have prevented a price collapse.\nBofA Sees Brent Bottoming Near $55 as Long-Term Contango Deepens\nBank of America takes a more structured view, projecting Brent to average $61 in Q4 2025 and $64 in early 2026, anchored by a price floor near $55. Analysts note an unusual $4-per-barrel long-term contango, where longer-dated contracts trade higher than near-term ones, signaling oversupply expectations for 2026. This structure contrasts with short-term backwardation, suggesting traders anticipate tighter conditions now but looser balances ahead. BofA attributes this anomaly to OPEC+\u2019s quota expansion of four million barrels per day (bpd) through mid-2026 and slowing global demand growth.\nOPEC+ Output Growth and U.S. Shale Expansion Pressure Prices\nOPEC+\u2019s cautious production increase remains a double-edged sword. While higher output curbs inflationary pressures for consuming nations, it has also capped prices below the $65\u2013$70 range seen earlier in 2025. The cartel\u2019s collective production now exceeds 41 million bpd, with Saudi Arabia and Russia maintaining a leadership role despite policy friction. Meanwhile, U.S. shale output has quietly surged past 13.3 million bpd, offsetting recent OPEC+ cuts. Analysts at Citi warn that if both blocs maintain production, Brent could slip below $55 within weeks, particularly if Asian demand falters or trade tensions with China intensify.\nChina\u2019s Stockpiling and Trade Tensions Add Market Volatility\nChina\u2019s energy behavior continues to dominate sentiment. The nation\u2019s ongoing strategic stockpiling has temporarily absorbed excess supply, yet renewed trade friction with Washington \u2014 including U.S. threats of new tariffs and Chinese rare earth export restrictions \u2014 could undercut growth. Beijing\u2019s imports from Russia remain elevated at 1.9 million bpd, while India, despite U.S. pressure, has resisted cutting Russian oil inflows. This geopolitical tug-of-war keeps Brent locked between $60\u2013$63, with traders unwilling to price in a sustainable breakout.\nMacroeconomic Drivers: Inflation, Refinery Outages, and Supply Chain Tensions\nMacroeconomic dynamics are adding layers of complexity. U.S. inflation readings remain elevated, limiting the Federal Reserve\u2019s flexibility for aggressive rate cuts, while refinery outages \u2014 including BP\u2019s Whiting refinery \u2014 have disrupted domestic supply. In Europe, the IEA warned of a potential oil glut into 2026, contrasting sharply with "

                "body": "For over a decade, the shale patch has been the engine behind U.S. oil production growth. Now, the pattern is shifting to offshore oil amid tech advances and maturing shale reservoirs\u2014with the help of a pro-oil federal government.\nEarlier this year, the Energy Information Administration said it expected oil output from Gulf of Mexico fields to rise from 1.8 million barrels daily at the moment to 2.4 million barrels daily as early as 2027. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had the same estimate. The two cited federal support in the form of easier permitting, technological advancements that make offshore drilling more economic and efficient, and investment appetite in the industry.\nThis month, BP said it would go ahead with a $5-billion investment into a new offshore project in the Gulf that would tap reserves of some 350 million barrels of crude. The company said the Tiber-Guadalupe project would add 80,000 barrels daily to its total U.S. output as it eyes boosting this to over 1 million barrels daily.\nYet that was not the only recent offshore oil news from the United States. BP again, in partnership with Chevron, earlier this year also announced a discovery in the Far South prospect, with an executive saying, \u201cThis Far South discovery demonstrates that the Gulf of America remains an area of incredible growth and opportunity for bp.\u201d Indeed, the supermajor plans to ramp up its Gulf output to 400,000 barrels daily by 2030.\nAlso this year, Talos Energy announced a discovery in the Gulf that Wood Makenzie said was the most significant one since Shell\u2019s Whale find in 2017. The Daenerys discovery could produce an estimated 65,000 barrels daily at peak production rates, and it could lead to more discoveries in the area, Wood Mac analysts said in a September report.\n\u201cWe believe that offshore production will play an increasingly larger role in filling the global energy demand,\u201d Talos Energy\u2019s chief executive, Paul Goodfellow, said in June, as quoted by Reuters. \u201cQuestions are starting to arise about the continued long-term economic viability of onshore basins... At the same time, technological advancements have unlocked significant deepwater reserves.\u201d\nThis is a pretty succinct description of the situation in U.S. oil. For years, shale was a favourite because production could start so much faster than it would at a conventional offshore field. The latter required years of work and a lot of upfront investment, while a shale well could be drilled and start producing in a matter of months.\nIt was only over time that the drawback of this fast start of production surfaced: shale wells started producing faster, but they also depleted faster. As a result, shale drillers have to keep drilling, which is where they sooner or later face the fact that not all drilling locations are equally \u201csweet\u201d. As top-tier acreage begins to run out, shale producers have ventured into higher-cost parts of the patch and have become more cautious with their cash.\nSome have also pointed to evidence of declining well productivity in parts of the shale patch, which, like costs, has affected production growth plans. Add to the mix the oil price uncertainty on global markets, and the situation for U.S. shale becomes quite complicated. As one industry executive put it to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey, \u201cWe can make money at today\u2019s oil prices. But with costs climbing and politics in play, we\u2019d rather pay dividends than take big risks.\u201d\nOffshore drilling, on the other hand, starts with high upfront costs. These are a given. Yet new and better drilling equipment has made it possible to drill in ever-deeper waters and tap previously inaccessible deposits. Over time, the breakeven for an offshore field could fall far below what is now average for even the lowest-cost shale. As Talos\u2019 Goodfellow said earlier this year, its offshore projects for the current half of the year would remain economical even if international oil prices plummeted to $35 per barrel.

                "body": "Euro Forecast: EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, Takes Two to Tango\nThe sell-off in EUR/USD stalled last week but bulls responded with a breakout from a short-term double bottom formation. EUR/JPY, on the other hand, retains clean bullish structure, with re-test of the 175.00 psychological level as support ahead of the end of the week. EUR/CAD similarly retains dovish lean, and I\u2019ll look at all three Euro pairs below.\nEUR/USD 1.1631 is Vital for USD Trends\nThe weekly chart of EUR/USD remains fairly messy and this is much to the chagrin of FX traders around the world. The major pair is a big piece of the puzzle as the Euro makes up 57.6% of the DXY quote, and as such, when the pair is range bound there can be a seeming lack of trend elsewhere. That\u2019s largely been the case since July 1st, when EUR/USD punched up to a fresh three-year-high on the first day of Q3. A pullback ran cleanly through July but as soon as the US NFP report dropped on August 1st, its been a grinding range-bound affair.\nMore recently, hope for trend arrived in the form of a bearish break, following the reversal that initiated right when the Fed announced their rate cut in September. That brought in a lower-low last week, with the same exact price holding the low this week while producing a double bottom formation.\nI spoke of that in the Tuesday webinar and then again in the Friday video (linked above), but that weekly chart still remains as indecisive and this puts pressure on price for next week. The 1.1748 level remains a key spot for EUR/USD bears as this held the high for five consecutive days before the breakdown into lower-lows. That level now serves as a form of invalidation for bears.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nFrom the above weekly chart, it\u2019s the Fibonacci levels at 1.1686-1.1748 that stand out. This is the 76.4 and 78.6% retracements of the 2021-2022 major move, and they\u2019re related to the 23.6% retracement that held support back in January. I looked into this Fibonacci setup in the evergreen article on the topic, and since then, this current zone of resistance has become like a brick wall for bulls that remains in-place today.\nPerhaps more importantly, these Fibonacci levels helped to craft the lower-lows and highs that sets up the current sequence, and from the daily, there\u2019s still the possibility of bearish continuation, provided that sellers can defend that structure.\nFrom the daily, this retains the look of lower-lows and lower-highs, but a break above 1.1748 negates that. And, from shorter-terms, there can be another observation that highlights a significant level of possible support.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nIn the Tuesday webinar I said that one of the main benefits of price action is its objectivity. It doesn\u2019t care what I want and, instead, its up to me to read it without bias in effort of devising strategy. At the time, there was a perfect hold of the prior week low, and that set up a possible double bottom formation. These are often tracked with aim of bullish breakout, looking for a breach of the neckline, or the high between the two lows, to trigger into breakout setups. And then the distance between the bottoms and neckline is usually tracked for a projection of that move.\nAs I showed in the webinar this pointed towards 1.1720, which came into play early on Friday morning. So the formation filled in and ran to the projected target, and from the four-hour chart, this shows a higher-high and low sequencing on short-term charts.\nIt also highlights the neckline from the formation, at 1.1631, as a key spot for bulls to hold to retain that sequence. So, as said in the video for USD this week, if sellers can sink below that 1.1631 level, the bearish sequence on the daily chart will take on more attraction, as it illustrates sellers taking greater control. Or, conversely, if that holds, and bulls can run up and through 1.1748, the shorter-term"

                "body": "EUR/USD Faces Renewed Pressure as Fed\u2019s Hawkish Cut and Trade Easing Lift the Dollar\nEUR/USD slid to 1.1666, extending its pullback from the weekly peak of 1.1728 as the U.S. Dollar recovered on remarks by President Donald Trump, who said high tariffs on China were \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d The softer tone temporarily eased trade tensions but strengthened the Greenback, pushing the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) up to 98.42. Despite dovish comments from several Federal Reserve officials, persistent inflation and resilient economic data have kept the Fed cautious, signaling that policy divergence with the European Central Bank (ECB) will likely weigh on the euro through the coming sessions.\nU.S. Inflation Remains Sticky as Fed Balances Cuts and Credibility\nThe U.S. Consumer Price Index remains the key factor shaping EUR/USD\u2019s path. September\u2019s core CPI rose 3.9% year-on-year, beating expectations and underscoring that inflation is far from contained. Although the Fed delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut at its late-October meeting, Chair Jerome Powell stressed that it was a tactical move rather than the start of a full easing cycle. The market initially interpreted it as a \u201chawkish cut,\u201d driving yields and the dollar higher.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield briefly rose above 4.72% before stabilizing near 4.58%, while short-term yields climbed back toward 4.9%, narrowing the rate differential that had favored the euro earlier this month. As Powell reiterated the central bank\u2019s commitment to restoring price stability, money markets priced in another rate cut by December but adjusted expectations for deeper easing in 2026. This shift has reignited bullish momentum for the dollar, tightening conditions for risk-sensitive currencies like the euro.\nEurozone Stability Masks Diverging Monetary Paths\nAcross Europe, inflation remains anchored but lacks the urgency to force new ECB action. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose 0.1% month-on-month and 2.2% year-on-year, matching estimates and signaling contained price pressure. Core inflation ticked up slightly to 2.4%, suggesting modest persistence but no major threat to policy stability.\nECB officials such as Olaf Sleijpen and Joachim Nagel maintained that the policy stance is \u201cin a good place,\u201d though both noted that the eurozone economy has proven more resilient than expected. The central bank remains cautious, refraining from signaling rate changes as it monitors energy costs and wage growth. With the Federal Reserve acting preemptively while the ECB stays on hold, yield spreads between U.S. and European bonds continue to favor the dollar, reinforcing the EUR/USD downtrend.\nTechnical Picture: Support Levels Tested as Momentum Turns Bearish\nFrom a technical standpoint, EUR/USD remains vulnerable below its 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 1.1648. The pair briefly held this line before dipping toward 1.1580, a key short-term support zone. Further losses could extend to 1.1550 and 1.1500, marking the next retracement levels if downside momentum accelerates. On the upside, resistance lies at 1.1691 (the 50-day SMA), 1.1728, and 1.1800 \u2014 levels that must be reclaimed for any meaningful recovery.\nThe daily chart shows a fading bullish impulse after last week\u2019s short-lived rebound from 1.1543, where a double bottom had formed. However, the inability to hold above 1.1631, the former neckline, suggests that sellers remain firmly in control. Momentum indicators continue to point south, with RSI hovering near 42, reflecting a steady but controlled bearish bias.\nTrade and Geopolitical Shifts Add Intraday Volatility\nTrump\u2019s remarks about unsustainable tariffs on China temporarily boosted market sentiment, sending Wall Street futures higher and reducing demand for traditional havens. However, the relief was short-lived as traders interpreted the comments as an acknowledgment of policy limits rather than a clear reversal. The EUR/USD pair initially spiked to 1.1728 before falling sharply as the DXY r"

Meanwhile, the dollar remains under pressure amid lower yields and revived trade war fears.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about crypto robots? Check our detailed guide-\nThe pair pulled back towards the 1.1650 level from the weekly top of 1.1730, as the dollar slightly rebounded. However, the cooling US yield, with the 10-year treasury falling below 4% weighs on the dollar.\nFrom France, PM Sebastian Lecornu\u2019s survival of two no-confidence votes and the delay in pension reforms have calmed the political upheaval. Still, the French government attempts to advance a strict year-end budget through parliament. If it\u2019s successful, it could revive volatility and limit the euro.\nThe ongoing US-China trade frictions are a key global risk factor. Any further pressure could cap euro gains and trigger safe-haven demand for dollars.\nThis persistent instability has dampened investor confidence and strengthened expectations for further Fed easing, which could likely weaken dollar growth. Meanwhile, any easing in Europe\u2019s fiscal challenges and risk sentiment could cause the euro to recover.\nEUR/USD Key Events Next Week\nThe major key events in the coming week include:\n- Initial Jobless Claims\n- Continuing Jobless Claims\n- Consumer Price Index\n- Eurozone PMIs\n- US PMIs\nTraders await the initial and continuing jobless claims and consumer price index next week for insights into expectations of Fed rate cuts and the economic outlook. However, the primary focus will remain on the PMI readings to gauge the business activity in both the US and Europe.\nEUR/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Selling Pressure Under 1.1700\nThe EUR/USD weekly technical outlook indicates a mild bearish bias after pulling back from the 1.1700-1.1720 zone. The pair stays pressured below the 1.1685 support level and the 20-day MA, reflecting sellers dominating the market. Overall, the pair maintains a medium-term sustained phase. The support sits at the 1.1500 and 1.1380 levels.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about buying Dogecoin?

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Falls to 1.34 as Dollar Rises on Trump\u2019s China Shift and UK Growth Weakens\nThe Pound slipped to 1.34 as Trump\u2019s softer China rhetoric boosted the U.S. Dollar. Diverging monetary paths between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England and fragile UK data now drive pairs | That's TradingNEWS\nTrump\u2019s Shift on China Sparks Dollar Rebound and GBP/USD Slide\nFollowing President Donald Trump\u2019s remarks that high tariffs on China were \u201cunsustainable,\u201d the U.S. Dollar strengthened broadly while risk sentiment improved. The GBP/USD pair dropped 0.17%, trading around 1.34, as the Dollar Index (DXY) rose to 98.42, recovering from earlier losses. Trump\u2019s more conciliatory tone eased trade tensions, reigniting investor confidence in the Dollar and prompting short-term flows away from the Pound.\nUK Growth Falters as BoE Eyes Rate Cuts Amid Rising Slack\nThe UK economy expanded by just 0.1% in August 2025, barely offsetting July\u2019s contraction. The slowdown in wage growth and a mild rise in unemployment have heightened expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) could cut rates by 25 basis points before year-end. Market data from the CME Group shows a 44% probability of a December rate cut, up from 28% a week earlier. This dovish outlook comes as BoE MPC member Megan Greene warned that while the cutting cycle isn\u2019t over, the bank \u201cshould not cut rates every quarter,\u201d signaling caution even as growth momentum fades.\nFed Holds Firm as Inflation Stays Stubborn at 3.1%\nAcross the Atlantic, the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to emphasize patience, with the September CPI cooling slightly to 3.1% year-over-year but still above the 2% target. Fed officials, including Christopher Waller and Neel Kashkari, have reiterated that inflation remains \u201ctoo high,\u201d even as labor data softens. The market now sees only a 25% chance of a Fed rate cut before March 2026, reinforcing a strong Dollar bias against the Pound. The widening interest rate gap between the Fed\u2019s steady stance and the BoE\u2019s dovish tilt remains the primary downward pressure on GBP/USD.\nPolicy Divergence Widens Between BoE and Fed\nInvestors are increasingly pricing in 53 basis points of BoE rate cuts by the end of 2026, while the Fed remains anchored in its \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d narrative. This divergence creates a structural headwind for Sterling. In historical context, a similar setup occurred during the 2018\u20132019 trade war, when the Pound fell nearly 8% as global investors favored the Dollar\u2019s stability over risk-sensitive currencies. Today\u2019s environment mirrors that dynamic, with energy costs easing but fiscal risks in the UK growing.\nUK Fiscal Concerns Deepen as Reeves Prepares Tax Hikes\nChancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed that the Autumn Budget will include new tax measures to stabilize public finances, adding to economic headwinds. While short-term spending will support social programs, the fiscal tightening is expected to shave 0.2% off GDP in early 2026. The Pound remains vulnerable as investors weigh deteriorating fiscal flexibility against the Fed\u2019s firmer footing. Analysts note that the UK\u2019s twin deficits \u2014 budget and current account \u2014 remain among the worst in the G7, limiting Sterling\u2019s recovery potential even if inflation cools.\nMarket Reaction and Technical Outlook for GBP/USD\nFrom a technical lens, GBP/USD is testing key support near 1.3350\u20131.3400, aligning with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). A break below this level could trigger a move toward 1.32, where the next major support lies. Resistance sits near 1.3550, followed by the 1.3680 zone \u2014 a breakout above which could shift momentum short-term. Despite brief rebounds, the pair\u2019s overall structure remains bearish, with lower highs signaling persistent downside bias.\nComparative Performance Across Majors\nThe British Pound gained modestly against the Australian Dollar this week but lost ground versus the Swiss Franc and U.S. Dollar, reflecting global risk aversion.

                "body": "The GBP/USD pair retreated on Friday after reaching a one-week high of 1.3471, slipping to trade around 1.3415, down 0.12% for the day. The move came as the US Dollar strengthened following comments from President Donald Trump, who said elevated tariffs on China were \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d His remarks eased market fears of prolonged trade tensions, giving the Greenback fresh momentum.\nIn an interview with Fox Business, Trump emphasized the need for a \u201cfair deal\u201d with China and announced plans to meet President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks. The news slightly boosted risk sentiment but also helped the Dollar recover earlier losses as investors sought clarity on the trade front.\nMeanwhile, the prolonged US government shutdown entered its seventeenth day, with no resolution in sight between the White House and Democrats. Adding to market anxiety, two regional US banks reported fraudulent loan issues, fueling concerns about potential credit stress in the financial system.\nAcross the Atlantic, the British Pound had briefly rallied earlier in the week, supported by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will resume rate cuts following dovish comments by Chair Jerome Powell. Markets have fully priced in a 25-basis-point rate reduction at the Fed\u2019s October meeting, while the odds of a larger 50-bps cut remain low at just 1%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nUK economic data offered mixed signals. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported modest GDP growth of 0.1% in August after a 0.1% contraction in July. However, slowing wage growth pointed to weakening labor market conditions, suggesting that inflation pressures could ease further. This has strengthened market bets that the Bank of England (BoE) might cut rates in the coming months. Traders currently assign a 44% chance of a 25-basis-point cut by December, with expectations for around 53 basis points of easing by late 2026.\nTrade Idea:\nGBP/USD faces short-term correction pressure. Selling below 1.3420 could target 1.3370\u20131.3340, while resistance lies near 1.3470. A sustained break above 1.3480 may shift momentum bullish."

The outcome could be pivotal for the USD/JPY when considering the potential influences on BoJ policy.\nThe LDP currently holds 196 seats, requiring 233 for a majority. A potential alliance with Ishin would take the number to 231, leaving the LDP needing just two more seats from smaller parties. An LDP-led coalition government could refuel expectations of a dovish BoJ rate path, driving another USD/JPY breakout.\nBeyond the election, traders should closely monitor key economic data and Bank of Japan speeches.\nWith policy and politics driving USD/JPY trends, it could be a pivotal week that sets the stage for a choppy price outlook.\nOn Wednesday, October 22, Japanese trade data will provide insights into demand for Japanese goods. A rebound in imports and exports would suggest the drop in US tariffs on Japanese shipments to 15% could limit the impact on the economy.\nThe BoJ remains focused on the potential effect of US tariffs on demand, prices, and the labor market. Strong figures could raise expectations of a near-term BoJ rate hike. On the other hand, a continued fall in imports and exports may pressure the BoJ to delay rate hikes, weighing on the yen.\nFor context, imports and exports fell 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, year-on-year in August.\nOn Friday, October 24, inflation data and Services PMI will influence the Bank of Japan\u2019s rate path.\nEconomists forecast the annual inflation rate to rise from 2.7% in August to 2.9% in September, while expecting the so-called core-core inflation rate to ease to 3.2% (August: 3.3%). Forecasts indicate that underlying inflation would continue to hold well above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target, supporting a more hawkish policy stance.\nEconomists forecast the S&P Global Services PMI to fall to 53 in October, down from 53.3 in September.\nA sharper drop in the PMI, softer prices, and job cuts could sink expectations of a near-term BoJ rate hike, while stronger data may raise bets on a Q4 rate hike.\nThe PMI data could overshadow the inflation numbers, given that the services sector contributes over 70% to Japan\u2019s GDP. The services sector is a focal point for the BoJ, with sector inflation trends affecting the Bank\u2019s inflation outlook and rate path.\nWhile the economic data will influence demand for the yen, traders should closely monitor BoJ commentary. BoJ policy makers Hajime Takata (October 20) and Ryozo Himino (October 21) are scheduled to speak. Views on political developments, economic data, and monetary policy will influence demand for the yen.\nFollow our real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nTraders face the prospect of another light US economic calendar after a tenth US Senate vote fell short of the required 60 to pass a stopgap funding bill. A continued US government shutdown, now 19 days and the third-longest in history, would delay official economic data releases.\nA continued shutdown would leave US-China trade developments and Capitol Hill to influence USD/JPY trends. There are no Fed speeches as the blackout period started on October 18.\nIf the US governmen"

                "body": "USD/JPY (USDJPY) Holds Above 150.60 as Traders Weigh Fed Cuts, Japan Leadership Vote, and Trump\u2019s China Shift\nThe USD/JPY pair is trading near 150.65, recovering from last week\u2019s low at 149.38, as shifting U.S. rate expectations, Japan\u2019s upcoming political transition, and renewed optimism in U.S.-China relations converge to shape one of the most critical moments for the yen in 2025. The recovery follows a volatile week marked by rising global uncertainty, a partial U.S. government shutdown, and a sudden softening of trade rhetoric by Donald Trump, which stabilized risk sentiment and boosted the dollar\u2019s demand.\nDollar Finds Support as Fed Rate-Cut Bets Settle\nThe U.S. dollar has regained footing after markets priced in roughly 50 basis points of cumulative rate cuts by the Federal Reserve through December, according to LSEG data. Despite the dollar index (DXY) dropping to 98.00, the greenback rebounded modestly on Friday, gaining 0.26%, as traders shifted focus to the upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) release, now scheduled for October 24 after delays caused by the government shutdown.\nExpectations call for core CPI to rise 0.3% month-over-month, with headline inflation increasing 0.4%, maintaining the Fed\u2019s cautious tone heading into the October 29 FOMC meeting. Fed Fund Futures show markets fully pricing two quarter-point cuts, but several policymakers \u2014 including St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem \u2014 warned that policy room is limited before easing becomes overly accommodative. The market\u2019s reaction to CPI will be crucial: a softer reading could anchor USD/JPY above 150.00, while a surprise upside print risks reigniting hawkish repricing.\nJapanese Political Crossroads and BoJ Caution\nJapan\u2019s domestic focus remains on the October 21 parliamentary vote, which could usher Sanae Takaichi into office as Japan\u2019s first female prime minister. Her policy stance \u2014 widely seen as more dovish and market-friendly than that of Shigeru Ishiba \u2014 has contributed to the yen\u2019s weakness, as investors expect continued fiscal stimulus and no aggressive intervention against yen depreciation.\nMeanwhile, Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda continues to urge patience, citing the need for more data before any policy shift. The BoJ is likely to keep rates unchanged at its October 30 meeting, even as core inflation hits 2.9% YoY, up from 2.7% in August. The policy gap between Japan\u2019s near-zero yields and U.S. rates above 5% remains a dominant driver of USD/JPY strength, anchoring the pair above the 150.00 threshold despite occasional pullbacks.\nTrump\u2019s Softer China Tone Revives Risk Appetite\nRisk sentiment improved markedly after Trump commented that 100% tariffs on Chinese imports are \u201cnot sustainable,\u201d confirming a planned meeting with Xi Jinping at the upcoming APEC Summit in South Korea. This pivot away from hardline trade rhetoric lifted U.S. equities and risk assets, reversing safe-haven flows that had briefly favored the yen earlier in the week. The result was a surge in demand for the dollar, pushing USD/JPY from its Asian session low of 149.38 toward 150.50, with momentum extending through European hours.\nThe easing of trade tensions also dampened implied volatility in the forex market, making USD/JPY options cheaper. Traders are increasingly turning to straddle strategies around the 150.50 strike, betting on a volatility spike driven by the combination of the Fed\u2019s October decision and the APEC meeting in November. With geopolitical developments intertwined with monetary expectations, short-term positioning now favors tactical dollar strength, though intervention risks persist.\nYield Spreads, Volatility Correlations, and Technical Signals\nThe USD/JPY maintains a strong inverse correlation of 0.73 with Fed Funds futures pricing out to 2026, highlighting the dominance of interest rate differentials over other drivers. The yen\u2019s rebound last week was largely linked to a drop in U.S. Treasury yields, but realized and expected volat"

But the boost looks shaky: weaker wholesale and manufacturing sales hint at slower economic momentum at home, keeping the currency under pressure. At the same time, Wall Street\u2019s upbeat finish lifted global risk appetite, offering a bit of support. Still, many expect the Bank of Canada to cut rates soon\u2014either at its late October meeting or by year-end\u2014especially with bond yields slipping to their lowest since spring. The growing prospect of a rate cut is weighing on the loonie, leaving investors bracing for continued swings.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Oil offers a shallow anchor.\nThe loonie\u2019s fate is closely tied to oil, so even small moves in crude prices can ripple through Canada\u2019s markets. While steadier oil gave the currency a short-lived bump, the prospect of lower rates and falling bond yields has dampened investor optimism. Even as Wall Street\u2019s upbeat mood nudged risk-taking higher, the loonie\u2019s four-week losing streak highlights ongoing investor caution in Canadian assets.\nThe bigger picture: Canada navigates global headwinds.\nBeyond oil and rates, Canada\u2019s outlook is tangled up in global uncertainty, sluggish domestic growth, and tricky trade situations with China over canola and electric vehicles. The likely path toward easier monetary policy and middling growth projections suggest more currency volatility ahead, putting extra focus on upcoming central bank moves and international negotiations.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "The sell-off in EUR/USD stalled last week but bulls responded with a breakout from a short-term double bottom formation. EUR/JPY, on the other hand, retains clean bullish structure, with re-test of the 175.00 psychological level as support ahead of the end of the week. EUR/CAD similarly retains dovish lean, and I\u2019ll look at all three Euro pairs below.\nEUR/USD 1.1631 is Vital for USD Trends\nThe weekly chart of EUR/USD remains fairly messy and this is much to the chagrin of FX traders around the world. The major pair is a big piece of the puzzle as the Euro makes up 57.6% of the DXY quote, and as such, when the pair is range bound there can be a seeming lack of trend elsewhere. That\u2019s largely been the case since July 1st, when EUR/USD punched up to a fresh three-year-high on the first day of Q3. A pullback ran cleanly through July but as soon as the US NFP report dropped on August 1st, its been a grinding range-bound affair.\nMore recently, hope for trend arrived in the form of a bearish break, following the reversal that initiated right when the Fed announced their rate cut in September. That brought in a lower-low last week, with the same exact price holding the low this week while producing a double bottom formation.\nI spoke of that in the Tuesday webinar and then again in the Friday video (linked above), but that weekly chart still remains as indecisive and this puts pressure on price for next week. The 1.1748 level remains a key spot for EUR/USD bears as this held the high for five consecutive days before the breakdown into lower-lows. That level now serves as a form of invalidation for bears.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nFrom the above weekly chart, it\u2019s the Fibonacci levels at 1.1686-1.1748 that stand out. This is the 76.4 and 78.6% retracements of the 2021-2022 major move, and they\u2019re related to the 23.6% retracement that held support back in January. I looked into this Fibonacci setup in the evergreen article on the topic, and since then, this current zone of resistance has become like a brick wall for bulls that remains in-place today.\nPerhaps more importantly, these Fibonacci levels helped to craft the lower-lows and highs that sets up the current sequence, and from the daily, there\u2019s still the possibility of bearish continuation, provided that sellers can defend that structure.\nFrom the daily, this retains the look of lower-lows and lower-highs, but a break above 1.1748 negates that. And, from shorter-terms, there can be another observation that highlights a significant level of possible support.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nIn the Tuesday webinar I said that one of the main benefits of price action is its objectivity. It doesn\u2019t care what I want and, instead, its up to me to read it without bias in effort of devising strategy. At the time, there was a perfect hold of the prior week low, and that set up a possible double bottom formation. These are often tracked with aim of bullish breakout, looking for a breach of the neckline, or the high between the two lows, to trigger into breakout setups. And then the distance between the bottoms and neckline is usually tracked for a projection of that move.\nAs I showed in the webinar this pointed towards 1.1720, which came into play early on Friday morning. So the formation filled in and ran to the projected target, and from the four-hour chart, this shows a higher-high and low sequencing on short-term charts.\nIt also highlights the neckline from the formation, at 1.1631, as a key spot for bulls to hold to retain that sequence. So, as said in the video for USD this week, if sellers can sink below that 1.1631 level, the bearish sequence on the daily chart will take on more attraction, as it illustrates sellers taking greater control. Or, conversely, if that holds, and bulls can run up and through 1.1748, the shorter-term setup will negate the bearish sequence, thereby ope"

Friday\u2019s U.S. CPI stands out as the key catalyst, carrying extra weight after weeks of data silence and its potential to reshape rate cut bets.\nVolatility Boost Sparks USD/JPY Downside\nUSD/JPY maintained a moderately strong inverse relationship with market pricing for the Fed funds rate out to September 2026 last week, exhibiting a correlation coefficient with the futures curve of 0.73. That suggests the short-term U.S. interest rate outlook remains a key factor driving dollar-yen movements, demonstrating a stronger relationship than U.S. Treasury yields or yield spreads with Japan further out the curve.\nSource: TradingView\nHowever, the big change last week was the rapidly strengthening inverse relationship with realised and expected U.S. stock market volatility, logging scores of -0.85 and -0.87, respectively. Higher volatility\u2014sparked initially by escalating trade tensions between the United States and China and then renewed concerns about U.S. regional lenders\u2014clearly had a detrimental impact on the yen, hinting it and the decline in U.S. Treasury yields may have pressured carry trades, resulting in yen strength.\nShould those relationships continue this week, it suggests any event that can shift the U.S. rate outlook or generate volatility will be key for USD/JPY traders. While the blackout before the October FOMC monetary policy meeting will create radio silence from Federal Reserve speakers, there is still plenty on the agenda to keep traders busy, including key U.S. economic data despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.\nWe Finally Have U.S. Data\nThe economic calendar is detailed below, with events that may generate market volatility shown in yellow, while those that are key are highlighted in red. The times shown are for the U.S. east coast.\nSource: TradingView\nFriday looms as the day most likely to shake things up for USD/JPY with the release of key inflation data from the United States. This is the only major official release we\u2019ve seen since the government went into shutdown, so its impact may be greater than usual for a market that\u2019s been starved of information.\nThe key core inflation rate is seen increasing 0.3% in September, the same as a month earlier. While labour market data matters more for the Fed, details within the inflation report remain important. Even though its weighting is not as large as services, goods prices remain the key focus of markets given only limited evidence of tariff passthrough in prior reports. Unless there\u2019s a sudden and broad increase in goods inflation, markets will likely adopt the view that it will not prevent the Fed from cutting rates Wednesday week. And if there\u2019s little evidence of tariff passthrough, it will likely lead to traders pricing in even more cuts further out the curve.\nGiven heightened economic uncertainty due to limited data flow, the area of focus should really be on trends in services inflation, especially in discretionary areas. Not only does this a far larger weighting in the CPI basket, but it\u2019s also sitting at levels not consistent with the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target. It\u2019s been far firmer than many expected recently, hinting apparent labour market weakness that has spooked some FOMC members may not actually be there. Core services prices are linked to labour market conditions, so continued strength in those areas may spark a rethink about the scale of rate cuts priced in over the next year\u2014if traders can peel their eyes away from tariff impacts.\nSource: TradingView\nMarkets Eye Japan\u2019s Next Prime Minister\nOutside the U.S. inflation report, the remaining calendar is light.

Traders now turn their focus to key U.S. inflation data due next week, with the September CPI release likely to set the tone ahead of the FOMC rate decision.

From a trading standpoint, look to reduce portions of long-exposure / raise protective stops on a stretch towards 4100- losses would need to be limited to 3782 IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a close above the 75% parallel needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\u201d XAU/USD broke higher this week with the bulls exhausting into confluent uptrend resistance on Friday.\nThis week\u2019s rally marks the largest single-week range on record and the ninth consecutive weekly advance\u2014 the first such streak since August 2020, when the yearly high was registered. Weekly momentum has also surged to its highest level since April 2006, which likewise coincided with that year\u2019s peak in gold. These technical observations suggest that while the broader outlook remains constructive, the immediate advance may be vulnerable at these levels.\nInitial weekly support rests along the median-line, currently near the 4000 mark and a break / weekly close below this slope would be needed to suggest a more significant high is in place / a larger correction is underway. Monthly-open support rests at 3859 with broader bullish invalidation now raise to the 61.8% extension of the May advance at 3782.\nWeekly resistance is eyed with the upper parallel / 2.618% extension of the 2015 advance at 4308- a topside breach / weekly close above this threshold would threaten another bout of accelerated gains with the next major technical considerations eyed at the 3.618% extension of the April decline at 4492 and the 1.618% extension of yearly advance at 4553.\nBottom line: The gold breakout extended into record highs this week with multi-year extremes registered in momentum, range, and duration- the exhaustion risk is mounting. From a trading standpoint, losses would need to be limited to 4000 IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a weekly close above 4308 needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\nKeep in mind that key U.S. inflation data is due next week, with September CPI figures on tap Friday. The release will be pivotal ahead of the FOMC interest rate decision the following week, and traders will be watching Fed Fund Futures closely for any shift in rate expectations into year-end. In the meantime, traders will be closely monitoring developments regarding the escalating China trade dispute and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Headline risk over the next few weeks will be significant- stay nimble and watch the weekly closes for guidance.

It took America 9 months to become a third-world country \u2026 or maybe America has been a third world country since 2008?\nSeems like the US is steamrolling its way into doing all the actual bad things that the communist era Russia and China did.\nMeanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $536M in daily net outflows on Thursday, their largest since August 1, according to SoSoValue. Outflows hit eight of the twelve funds, led by ARKB with $275M and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC with $132M, as investors moved to the sidelines amid macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.\nHere are three news stories from the week you need to know:\n1. Institutional Flows Flash Red as Traders Deleverage From Bitcoin ETF\nThe outflows in mirror rising investor caution following one of crypto\u2019s biggest liquidation events this year: more than $20Bn in leveraged positions erased after Trump\u2019s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.\nMoreover, bank contagion risks have flared up, adding further pressure:\nEthereum ETFs saw $56.9 Mn in withdrawals the same day, reversing a brief two-day inflow streak.\n\u201cThe $536 million in net outflows primarily reflects a sharp surge in investor risk aversion,\u201d said Nick Ruck, Director at LVRG Research.\nEXPLORE: 20+ Next Crypto to Explode in 2025\n2.

Meanwhile, Ondo Finance is urging the US SEC to delay or reject Nasdaq\u2019s tokenized securities proposal.\nRoman Storm warns open-source developers of retroactive prosecution\nTornado Cash developer Roman Storm warned open source software developers, particularly those working on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, that they could be retroactively prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).\nStorm asked the DeFi developers in a Saturday X post: \u201cHow can you be so sure you won\u2019t be charged by the DOJ as a money service business (MSB) for building a non-custodial protocol?\u201d\n\u201cIf the Southern District of New York (SDNY) can charge a dev for building a non-custodial protocol, who is safe? My case is still ongoing,\u201d he continued.\nThe verdict in the Roman Storm case has major legal implications for open source software development in the United States and sets a dangerous legal precedent for developers, who are not currently protected from prosecution.\nOpenSea rejects pivot from NFTs, says it\u2019s evolving to \u2018trade everything\u2019\nOpenSea CEO Devin Finzer has rejected claims that the company is pivoting away from non-fungible tokens (NFTs), saying instead that the marketplace is \u201cevolving\u201d into a universal platform to trade every type of onchain asset.\nIn a Friday post on X, Finzer announced that OpenSea's October trading volume exceeded $2.6 billion, with over 90% of that amount coming from token trading, calling it the beginning of the platform\u2019s transformation to \u201ctrade everything.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re building the universal interface for the entire onchain economy \u2014 tokens, collectibles, culture, digital and physical,\u201d Finzer told Cointelegraph. \u201cThe goal is simple: if it exists onchain, you should be able to trade it on OpenSea, seamlessly across any chain, while maintaining complete control of your assets,\u201d he added.\nOpenSea was the first major NFT marketplace, launching in 2017 as a platform for buying, selling, and trading various non-fungible tokens. The platform remained the dominant player in the space until early 2023, when it lost momentum due to a combination of the overall NFT market crash and the rise of a major competitor, Blur.\nOndo Finance to SEC: Hold off on Nasdaq\u2019s tokenized securities plan\nOndo Finance urged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delay or reject Nasdaq\u2019s proposal to trade tokenized securities, saying it lacks transparency and could give established market players an unfair edge.\nIn a Wednesday letter to the regulator, Ondo \u2014 a blockchain company that issues tokenized versions of traditional assets \u2014 said regulators and investors can\u2019t fairly evaluate Nasdaq\u2019s proposal without public details on how the Depository Trust Company (DTC) will handle blockchain settlements. DTC serves as the main depository for US securities and facilitates their post-trade settlement.\nWhile acknowledging support of Nasdaq\u2019s move toward tokenization, Ondo warned that \u201cNasdaq\u2019s reference to non-public information implies differential access that deprives other firms of a fair opportunity to comment.\u201d\nThe company also noted that Nasdaq\u2019s rule cannot take effect until DTC finalizes its system, saying there\u2019s no harm in delaying approval until more features are released. It called on the SEC to prioritize \u201copen collaboration and transparent standards\u201d before making a final decision.\nOndo\u2019s letter responds to Nasdaq\u2019s Sept. 8 filing with the SEC, in which the world\u2019s second-largest stock exchange sought to amend its rules to allow trading in tokenized securities.\nTokenized shares are digital versions of traditional stocks recorded on a blockchain.\nIf approved, the proposal would let tokenized shares trade alongside traditional ones, with settlements processed through the DTC\u2019s forthcoming system for tokenized se"

                "body": "Bitcoin ETF Inflows Rebound After Historic Outflow Shock\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) trades near $107,000, regaining stability after last week\u2019s violent liquidation that erased nearly $19 billion in leveraged positions across crypto futures. Despite the turbulence, institutional participation through U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2014chiefly BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\u2014remains at record strength. IBIT\u2019s shares hover around $60.50, roughly 15% below their early-October peak near $71, yet assets under management stand near $90 billion, having briefly surpassed the $100 billion threshold earlier this month. That milestone cements IBIT as the fastest-growing ETF in history, outpacing traditional behemoths like SPY and VOO, which each needed over five years to cross the same mark.\nInstitutional Flows Endure Despite $536 Million Daily Exodus\nOn October 17, aggregate U.S. Bitcoin ETFs registered $536 million in net outflows, the largest single-day withdrawal since August 1. Eight of twelve funds saw redemptions, led by ARK 21Shares (ARKB) with $275 million exiting and Fidelity (FBTC) losing $132 million. Yet BlackRock\u2019s IBIT remained comparatively resilient, shedding only $29 million\u2014less than 6% of the total. Over the preceding two sessions, IBIT even attracted $134 million in new capital, indicating long-term buyers used the correction as a re-entry window. Across all ETFs and public corporations, institutions now hold roughly 12% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply, a structural foundation unseen in prior cycles.\nGeopolitical Volatility Meets Macro Shifts\nThe flash crash stemmed from renewed U.S.\u2013China tariff escalation, after Washington signaled a potential 100% import duty, spooking global risk markets. Bitcoin plunged from $122,000 to $104,000 within hours before rebounding above $105,000. Concurrently, expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut on October 29 rose to 65%, fostering optimism that liquidity conditions will soon loosen. A dovish pivot would historically favor Bitcoin inflows: during prior easing cycles, BTC\u2019s correlation with the Nasdaq tightened, amplifying upside during liquidity expansions. Conversely, persistent inflation near 3% YoY could delay relief and prolong ETF volatility.\nBlackRock Dominance Defines the ETF Landscape\nBlackRock\u2019s lead is absolute. IBIT controls approximately 1.3 million BTC, four times larger than its closest rival, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, which manages roughly $24 billion AUM. Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, long the institutional gateway, now trades only 10% below NAV as conversion to a spot ETF appears imminent. Should approval arrive, the transition could inject an additional 600,000 BTC into the regulated ETF ecosystem. Still, IBIT\u2019s liquidity advantage\u2014average daily turnover above $2.6 billion\u2014keeps it the benchmark vehicle for large allocators. At a 0.25% management fee, IBIT generates roughly $225 million per year in revenue for BlackRock, already surpassing many of its legacy equity products.\nInvestor Behavior Points to Strategic Accumulation\nBlockchain data confirm consistent accumulation: over $169 million in BTC flowed from exchanges to cold storage last week, while on-chain \u201clong-term holder supply\u201d reached an all-time high. Institutions appear to be dollar-cost-averaging through ETF channels rather than retreating. Even after the drawdown, Bitcoin remains up +15% YTD and +75% over 12 months, underscoring how corrections coexist with structural inflows. Analysts at multiple desks note that the latest selloff mirrors prior \u201cdeleveraging resets\u201d rather than a cycle peak, citing resilient funding rates and declining exchange reserves as supportive metrics.\nRegulatory Clarity Fuels Broader ETF Pipeline\nThe SEC\u2019s September rule change allowing standardized 75-day reviews for crypto ETFs ignited a second wave of filings\u2014not only for Bitcoin but also for Ethereum, Solana, and XRP. This regulatory pivot, coupled with July\u2019s bipartisan stablecoin law, has converted skepticism into measured acceptance among U.S. in"

One DeFi crypto capturing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold out and more than $17.6 million raised. MUTM\u2019s innovative dual-lending DeFi model, which combines Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, allows users to lend and borrow efficiently within a single ecosystem, providing real-world utility alongside speculative potential.\nAnalysts and early investors suggest that, with its presale momentum and strong community backing, Mutuum Finance could become the next crypto coin to explode, making it a better opportunity for both ETH millionaires and new investors seeking exposure to a high-potential DeFi project.\nWhy Ethereum (ETH) Millionaires Are Changing Their Bets\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at below $4,000 currently, which indicates short-term weakness but the bulls are unable to gain control, yet long-term fundamentals are still intact, thus making tactical bets by experienced ETH investors. With immediate resistance at $4,000 and its crucial accumulation zone between $3,000 and $2,600, millionaires are exercising maximum prudence while positioning for the next move, using dips as opportunities to re-accumulate in anticipation of targets higher up towards $8,000\u2013$10,000.\nThis strategy of accumulating reflects a macro strategy of capitalizing on volatility without deviating from Ethereum\u2019s long-term bullish trajectory. As ETH investors branch out and look for alternative high-potential opportunities beyond established networks, attention increasingly is turning to new DeFi crypto initiatives and future-oriented crypto tokens that can be used to enhance legacy positions, and so here is growing interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto coin to explode.\nMutuum Finance as the Best Cryptocurrency to Invest in Now\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly turning into a top crypto project within the DeFi space and among the top cryptos to buy for the near and long terms. Its presale already stands at Stage 6 and has so far registered robust adoption among the crypto community with a combined total of 17,300+ investors contributing over $17.6 million. They observed that such growing demand and consistent investor confidence position MUTM as a viable contender, supported by real DeFi crypto use cases and solid growth, making it one of the next crypto coin to explode in the decentralized finance market.\nCurrently, over 70% of Phase 6 has already sold out, signaling accelerating demand as investors rush to secure tokens before the next price jump. Once this phase concludes, the MUTM price will rise by 20%, moving closer to the $0.06 launch value. With each stage offering fewer tokens at higher prices, early buyers are locking in positions ahead of what analysts describe as a strong post-listing upside.\nMutuum Finance Leaderboard\nMUTM is also introducing friendly competition in the presale with its leaderboard in the presale. The top five largest investors in the last 24 hours purchased $1,704, $1,291, $1,000, $734, and $685 MUTM tokens respectively, a gauge of increasing interest and activity at the grassroots level. There is also the $500 MUTM bonus for the number 1 buyer on a day-to-day basis as an incentive feature designed to reward and encourage frequent activity.\nA member qualifies after making one purchase within the 24-hour window, and thus it is very simple for anyone to join and rise through the ranks. Crypto news today reports have highlighted that such community-based mechanisms are giving MUTM instant exposure as the next cryptocurrency to reach $1 in the DeFi crypto space and a likely next crypto coin to explode in 2025.\nMutuum Finance Lending and Borrowing Protocol\nOne of the top altcoins to invest in right now"

The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency saw its intraday high reach $3,924, supported by improving on-chain fundamentals, renewed investor optimism, and growing institutional accumulation.\nAccording to DefiLlama, Ethereum\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) sits near $84 billion, maintaining its position as the dominant force in decentralized finance with roughly two-thirds of global DeFi liquidity. Despite a modest 0.7% daily dip, Ethereum\u2019s network activity remains robust, underscoring its resilience.\nEthereum\u2019s daily active addresses climbed to 612,377 as of October 17, 2025, marking one of the strongest levels this month. Transaction volumes continue to hover above 1.6 million per day, while network fees exceeded $1.6 million in 24 hours, signaling sustained demand for block space.\nAt the same time, ETH exchange reserves have continued to fall, suggesting long-term accumulation and reduced short-term selling pressure among holders.\nKey takeaways from Ethereum\u2019s current on-chain landscape:\n- TVL near $84B despite minor pullback\n- 612K daily active addresses; 1.6M+ transactions\n- Exchange balances declining, signaling accumulation\nAsian Investors Plan $1 Billion Ethereum Treasury\nA consortium of Asian investors is preparing a $1 billion Ethereum treasury to establish ETH as a regional reserve asset. The effort is led by Li Lin, founder of Huobi and chairman of Avenir Capital, with participation from HashKey Group\u2019s Xiao Feng, Fenbushi Capital\u2019s Shen Bo, and Meitu founder Cai Wensheng.\nBloomberg reports that pledges already exceed $1 billion, including $500 million from HongShan Capital Group (formerly Sequoia China) and $200 million from Avenir Capital. The initiative, expected to be announced within weeks, will reportedly combine direct ETH holdings with yield-based strategies built on Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\nInstitutional portfolios have been steadily adding ETH. Corporate treasuries now hold roughly 3.6 million ETH, led by BitMine Immersion (1.7 million ETH) and SharpLink Gaming (797,000 ETH)\u2014together valued at about $3 billion.\nWhile some analysts warn of overvaluation in digital asset treasuries, others view this as a sign of market maturation, particularly as Ethereum continues to outperform most Layer-1 competitors in network adoption and liquidity retention.\nEthereum Technical Outlook: Triangle Pattern Hints at Breakout\nFrom a technical perspective, Ethereum price prediction remains neutral is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, a pattern that often precedes sharp breakouts. The upper resistance lies near $3,937, aligning with the 100-EMA, while support sits around $3,713\u2013$3,510, where the 50-EMA converges.\nA confirmed breakout above $3,937 could propel ETH toward $4,093, with an extended target at $4,299, corresponding to key Fibonacci retracement levels. Conversely, a breakdown below $3,510 might trigger a pullback toward $3,350.\nWith the RSI hovering near 48 and subtle bullish divergence forming, Ethereum appears poised for renewed upside momentum. If price confirms above resistance, ETH could rally toward $4,300\u2013$4,550, aligning with the upper boundary of the descending channel.\nEthereum\u2019s current consolidation likely represents a period of accumulation before its next major leg higher, a setup increasingly supported by on-chain data, institutional inflows, and optimi"

The direction is right: Solana leads on several key metrics.\nHowever, the institutional case carries trade-offs that the report acknowledges only in passing, and a few headline figures deserve closer scrutiny.\nWhat Grayscale says\nThe report frames Solana as the standout among smart contract platforms on three core fundamentals: users, transaction volume, and fees.\nGrayscale cites roughly $425 million in monthly ecosystem fees, an annualized run rate above $5 billion, and points to $1.2 trillion in year-to-date DEX volume routed through Raydium and Jupiter.\nIt highlights Jupiter as the largest DEX aggregator by volume in the industry, Pump.fun\u2019s 2 million monthly active users, and Helium\u2019s 1.5 million daily users as proof of application diversity.\nOn the developer side, the report notes more than 1,000 full-time Solana developers and claims the ecosystem has grown faster than any other smart contract platform over the past two years.\nSpeed and cost receive equal billing. Solana produces blocks every 400 milliseconds, with transactions considered final in roughly 12 to 13 seconds.\nAverage transaction fees sit at $0.02, while median daily fees this year have averaged $0.001, one-tenth of one cent, thanks to local fee markets that isolate congestion to specific high-demand applications.\nA forthcoming upgrade called Alpenglow aims to reduce finality to 100 to 150 milliseconds.\nGrayscale also draws boundaries. It explicitly states that SOL \u201cmay be less suitable as a long-term store of value than Bitcoin or Ethereum,\u201d citing higher nominal supply inflation and centralization vectors.\nThe report noted that Solana\u2019s efficiency comes at the cost of comparatively high hardware and bandwidth requirements, with 99% of staked SOL in data centers and roughly 45% concentrated in the top two hosting providers.\nWhat the numbers show\nDeFiLlama shows Solana consistently running around 2.6 million active addresses in the last 24 hours and roughly 67 million on-chain transactions over the same window, in line with 2025\u2019s typical pace.\nArtemis reporting from mid-2025 highlighted that Solana matched all other layer-1 and layer-2 networks combined on monthly active addresses, corroborating the \u201ccategory leader\u201d characterization on user count.\nRegarding fees, the \u201c$425 million per month\u201d figure requires context. Token Terminal\u2019s chain-level fee data for Solana show tens of millions per month in several 2025 periods, around $30 million to $40 million in recent months.\nDeFiLlama shows current daily chain fees around $0.8 million to $1.6 million and app fees around $9 million to $13 million, together implying roughly $300 million to $450 million per month at the recent pace, depending on mar"

                "body": "Jupiter Ultra and Solana: How This Integration is Revolutionizing DeFi\nIntroduction to Jupiter Ultra and Solana\nThe cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) space is evolving rapidly, with groundbreaking innovations reshaping blockchain ecosystems. Among these, Jupiter Ultra has emerged as a transformative force within the Solana ecosystem. By integrating its advanced Ultra API, Jupiter has enhanced Solana\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) capabilities, introducing features that set new benchmarks in the DeFi space. This article explores how Jupiter Ultra is revolutionizing Solana, its standout features, and its broader implications for the DeFi ecosystem.\nHow Jupiter Ultra Enhances Solana\u2019s DEX Ecosystem\nJupiter Ultra\u2019s integration with Solana has significantly improved the blockchain\u2019s decentralized exchange infrastructure. By leveraging the Ultra API, Solana users gain access to:\nSeamless Cross-Chain Trading: Jupiter\u2019s platform-agnostic technology enables smooth interactions between Solana and other blockchain networks.\nEnhanced Liquidity: The Ultra API routes all Solana trades through Jupiter\u2019s platform, optimizing liquidity and trade execution.\nAccess to Over a Million Tokens: Solana wallets now support a vast array of tokens, thanks to Jupiter\u2019s expansive token compatibility.\nThese advancements have positioned Jupiter as a cornerstone of Solana\u2019s $140 billion DEX ecosystem, simplifying trading and improving user experience.\nKey Features of Jupiter Ultra v3\nThe Ultra v3 update introduced cutting-edge features that enhance security, efficiency, and accessibility for users. Here are the highlights:\nReduced Slippage: Ensures users receive the best possible value for their trades by minimizing price slippage.\nMEV Attack Protection: Safeguards users from Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks, bolstering platform security.\nGasless Trading: Eliminates transaction fees, making DeFi more affordable and accessible.\nIris Router: A sophisticated routing system that identifies optimal trade execution paths across multiple platforms.\nShadowLane for Privacy: Enables private transactions, addressing concerns about transparency and data exposure.\nThese features collectively establish Jupiter as a leader in the DEX aggregator space, offering unparalleled functionality and user-centric innovations.\nJupiter\u2019s Dominance in the Solana Ecosystem\nJupiter has solidified its position as a dominant force within the Solana ecosystem, commanding 95% of DEX aggregator volume and 80% of perpetuals trading. This dominance has translated into impressive financial performance, with the platform generating over $280 million in annualized revenue.\nHowever, this level of influence has sparked debates about centralization. Critics argue that Jupiter\u2019s dominance could stifle competition and innovation within the Solana ecosystem. Despite these concerns, Jupiter continues to expand its reach through strategic acquisitions and technological advancements.\nStrategic Acquisitions Driving Jupiter\u2019s Growth\nTo strengthen its ecosystem, Jupiter has pursued strategic acquisitions, including:\nMoonshot: A memecoin trading platform catering to niche token enthusiasts.\nSonarWatch: An on-chain portfolio tracker that provides users with detailed insights into asset performance.\nThese acquisitions underscore Jupiter\u2019s commitment to offering a comprehensive suite of services, enhancing its value proposition for users and investors alike.\nToken Buyback Program: A Unique Approach to Sustainability\nJupiter has implemented an innovative token buyback program to foster long-term investor confidence. The platform allocates 50% of its protocol fees to repurchase tokens, creating a deflationary effect that could increase the value of its native token over time. This strategy is relatively rare among DEX aggregators and highlights Jupiter\u2019s forward-thinking approach to ecosystem sustainability.\nJupnet: Pioneering Cross-Chain Interoperability\nJupiter\u2019s ambitions extend beyond Solana "

                "body": "DeFi Development Invests $16 Million in Solana\nDeFi Development Corp. has just reached a new milestone. The Nasdaq-listed company has injected an additional 16 million dollars into its Solana reserves, thus consolidating its position among the largest institutional holders of the SOL crypto.\nIn brief\n- DeFi Development Corp. has just acquired 86,307 additional SOL tokens for 16 million dollars, at an average price of $110.91 per unit.\n- The company\u2019s total reserves now exceed 2 million SOL, valued at around 426 million dollars.\n- This operation positions DeFi Development among the top five largest public Solana holders, although Forward Industries maintains the top spot with nearly 7 million tokens.\nDevelopment continues to invest massively in Solana\nDeFi Development Corp. does not hide its ambitions. The company listed under the ticker DFDV has just announced the acquisition of 86,307 SOL tokens bringing its holdings to more than 2 million tokens.\nThis operation, carried out at an average price of 110.91 dollars per unit, represents an investment of 16 million dollars and increases the company\u2019s reserves by nearly 5%.\nThis massive accumulation strategy recalls that of MicroStrategy with bitcoin, but applied to the Solana ecosystem. The company founded this year by former Kraken executives is betting everything on the blockchain known for its speed and low fees.\nWith about 28 million shares outstanding, DeFi Development now displays a ratio of 14.67 dollars of SOL per share, a figure down from the 19.44 dollars recorded in September when the company had 25 million shares.\nThis dilution of shares raises questions. Investors must wonder whether this rapid expansion of the share capital may dilute value for existing shareholders, despite the increase in SOL reserves.\nA unique positioning but fierce competition\nDeFi Development does not just buy and hold tokens. The company also deploys a staking strategy on various assets within the Solana ecosystem, including memecoins like Dogwifhat.\nIt also generates additional revenue through its validation services, notably for Kraken, the crypto exchange from which its founders come.\nThis diversification of activities is an undeniable asset. By combining reserve accumulation and operational revenue generation, DeFi Development aims to create a more resilient business model than simple \u201ctreasury companies\u201d that only hold cryptos.\nHowever, competition remains fierce. While DeFi Development ranks among the top five largest public Solana holders, it is still far from Forward Industries (ticker FORD), the undisputed leader.\nThis company, backed by heavyweights like Galaxy, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, holds nearly 7 million SOL. A figure that alone exceeds the combined reserves of the next three companies.\nThis domination by Forward Industries raises a crucial question: can the market support several large \u201cSolana treasuries\u201d without causing excessive concentration? The answer will likely determine the long-term success of companies like DeFi Development.\nDeFi Development continues its aggressive accumulation of Solana but navigates still uncharted waters. While the strategy may pay off if the SOL price soars, it also exposes the company to the inherent risks of crypto volatility.\nOnly the future will tell if this bold bet will turn DeFi Development into a major player in the blockchain economy or simply a victim of an unpredictable market.\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Much of that change comes from Friedrich Merz, the new German chancellor, who pushed through a landmark spending bill before even taking office.\nThe plan unlocks federal borrowing to rebuild Germany\u2019s infrastructure and overhaul its military. Lagarde described it bluntly: \u201cAgent of change Germany \u2014 who would have thought?\u201d\nGermany boosts growth plans with \u20ac400 billion investment drive\nSharing the stage with Lagarde, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva praised the decision.\u201cMy message is: bravo, bravo, bravo,\u201d she said.\u201cBecause what Germany is demonstrating is that imbalances can be addressed, it is a matter of will, and mostly political will.\u201d\nGeorgieva\u2019s remarks came as optimism builds across Europe that Germany\u2019s fiscal push could lift growth in the region, which has long relied on the country\u2019s cautious approach to spending.\nEarlier this week, Merz proposed creating a pan-European stock exchange to strengthen competitiveness against the United States and Asia. Lagarde reacted to the plan, saying, \u201cWhen I hear the German chancellor say we need in Europe one single stock market, one single supervision \u2014 that means a lot. How that will materialize, how it will take place, how it will work out, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe spending program, secured before Merz took office last month, could add more than \u20ac400 billion ($470 billion) to Germany\u2019s annual output by 2030, according to the German government\u2019s panel of economic advisers.\nThat would lift average GDP growth by 1.6%, slightly above the long-term pace since reunification in 1990. Monika Schnitzer, the panel\u2019s chair, said expectations among businesses and the public are \u201cextremely high,\u201d adding that \u201caction must be taken quickly.\u201d\nInvestors rally as Germany emerges from years of restraint\nInvestor confidence in Germany, meanwhile, has been rising all year. The DAX index has hit new records, making it one of the best-performing stock markets this year, behind only Spain\u2019s IBEX and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng.\nThe enthusiasm proves the growing belief that Germany is regaining economic momentum at a time of political uncertainty in the United States under President Donald Trump.\nAfter years of tight budgets, Germany holds the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio among G7 nations, giving it space to borrow for growth. Economists say the turnaround represents the biggest policy change in a generation. But challenges remain; political divisions and weak coordination could slow down progress if not handled carefully.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded its growth forecast on the back of Merz\u2019s fiscal plan, predicting 2% growth for Germany next year. Still, the bank warned that momentum might fade if funds are funneled into consumption rather than investment.\nAlexander von zur M\u00fchlen, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of Asia-Pacific, said, \u201cOutside of Europe they say: the sleeping giant Germany has woken up. We need to use the momentum.\u201d\nEconomic advisers reportedly cautioned that if spending is directed toward short-term relief like cutting restaurant taxes or incen"

                "body": "While shareholders of XP (NASDAQ:XP) are in the red over the last five years, underlying earnings have actually grown\nGenerally speaking long term investing is the way to go. But no-one is immune from buying too high. To wit, the XP Inc. (NASDAQ:XP) share price managed to fall 62% over five long years. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 17% in a month.\nThe recent uptick of 4.7% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, XP actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 26% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\nBecause of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.\nWe note that the dividend has remained healthy, so that wouldn't really explain the share price drop. While it's not completely obvious why the share price is down, a closer look at the company's history might help explain it.\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nXP is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.\nWhat About Dividends?\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for XP the TSR over the last 5 years was -58%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."

Again.\nThe initiative to take the job of pulling over bad drivers away from cops is months behind schedule, frustrating reform advocates and some city leaders who argue that Los Angeles is missing an onramp toward the future of road safety.\nLocal officials first raised the prospect during the national reckoning on racial injustice that followed the police murder of George Floyd in 2020, but the plan has progressed in sluggish fits and starts since. Backers thought that they had scored an important victory with the release in May 2023 of a long-promised study mapping out how most enforcement could be done by unarmed civilian workers.\nLast summer, the City Council requested follow-up reports from various city departments to figure out how to do that and gave a three-month deadline. But more than year later, most of the promised feasibility studies have yet to materialize.\n\u201cI\u2019m very upset about the delay,\u201d said Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson, one of the proposal\u2019s early champions. \u201cGenerally speaking, when you try to do a big reform like this, at least some portion of the people who want to do the work are very motivated to change the status quo \u2014 and I don\u2019t think we have that here.\u201d\nHe said that there was blame to go around for the continued delays, but that he\u2019s encouraged by his conversations with officials from the involved departments that studies will be completed \u2014 a precursor to legislation that would allow for re-imagining traffic safety.\nTwo brothers injured in a crash caused by a speeding LAPD officer were recently awarded an $18-million legal settlement \u2014 one of many cases in recent years where taxpayers shelled out for dangerous driving by police.\nAt the same time, he said that he still saw a role for armed police in certain traffic situations.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think we need to be pulling people over at all for vehicle violations, especially for those that don\u2019t pose any public safety risks,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cIf somebody\u2019s going 90 miles an hour down Crenshaw Boulevard, that person does need to be stopped immediately and they do need to be stopped by somebody with a gun.\u201d\nIn a unanimous vote in June 2024, the council directed city transportation staff and other departments to come back within 90 days with feasibility reports about the cost and logistics of numerous proposals, including creating unarmed civilian teams to respond to certain traffic issues and investigate accidents. Also under exploration were ideas to limit fines in poorer communities and end stops for minor infractions, such as expired tags or air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror.\nOf the dozen or so requests made by the council, only two reports by the city\u2019s transportation department have been completed so far, officials said.\nBoth of the studies \u2014 one assessing parking and traffic fines, and the other looking at how so-called \u201cself-enforcing infrastructure\u201d such as adding more speed bumps, roundabouts and other street modifications could help reduce speeding and unsafe driving \u2014 are \u201cpending\u201d before an ad hoc council committee focused on unarmed alternatives to police, according to an LADOT spokesman. The committee will need to approve the reports before they can be acted on by the full council, he said in a brief statement.\nChief Legislative Analyst Sharon Tso, the council\u2019s top policy advisor, said she understands frustration over the delays.

Kennedy Jr. ends up finding the cause of autism, convincing parents vaccinating their kids is optional and turning conservatives into advocates of using government to combat chronic disease, he can thank Jeffrey Tucker.\nIn founding the Brownstone Institute, Tucker, a 61-year-old libertarian activist who brought leading opponents of Covid lockdowns into the health secretary\u2019s orbit, has carved out a splinter faction that\u2019s promoting Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again movement from the right.\n\u201cMAHA is a genuinely new intellectual and political force,\u201d Tucker told POLITICO in explaining why he\u2019s joined Kennedy\u2019s following. \u201cThey break through all the taboos. They are so brave.\u201d\nIf it weren\u2019t for Tucker, the Great Barrington Declaration, the manifesto that spurred a movement against lockdowns, would never have been written. Two of its authors, recruited by Tucker, are now top Kennedy advisers.\nOpposition to lockdowns and mask mandates prompted Tucker in 2020 to bring then-Stanford professor Jay Bhattacharya, now the director of the National Institutes of Health, and former Harvard professor Martin Kulldorff, now the chair of Kennedy\u2019s outside vaccine advisory committee, to western Massachusetts. He convinced them there to draft the anti-lockdown treatise that would become the right\u2019s declaration of independence from the public health experts. It called for the end of lockdowns and focused protection for elderly people. Nearly a million people have signed it.\nA fellow critic of the Covid response, Kennedy in 2023 cited a Brownstone article by Tucker on how the declaration came to be alongside a photo of Bhattacharya and Kulldorff and their co-signer, Oxford epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta. In a social media post, Kennedy promised that, as president, he\u2019d appoint \u201cbrave dissident scientists like these\u201d to his administration. Kennedy had not yet dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Donald Trump.\nKennedy did not respond to requests for comment.\nTucker founded Brownstone months after the declaration, following his resignation from his previous job amid sexual harassment allegations. Since Trump teamed up with Kennedy last year, Tucker has used the think tank to convince opponents of big government that they should find common cause with the MAHA movement and a health secretary known for allying with trial lawyers and demonizing industry.\n\u201cMAGA meets MAHA meets libertarianism meets the Great Barrington Declaration meets the Brownstone Institute \u2014 this interconnected movement has now adopted animus towards vaccination almost at its core, and that\u2019s not something one used to see on the right,\u201d said Gavin Yamey, director of Duke University\u2019s Center for Policy Impact in Global Health.\nBhattacharya, who was a senior scholar at Brownstone after publishing the Great Barrington Declaration, told POLITICO he\u2019s a fan. \u201cBrownstone is a think tank that publishes articles from authors with many different points of view who often disagree with one another,\u201d he said. \u201cI benefit greatly from learning how different smart people think, and the work of the Brownstone Institute contributes well to that end.\u201d Kulldorff, who was also a senior scholar at Brownstone, declined to comment.\nOther Brownstone authors now working for Kennedy include Robert Malone, part of a group reviewing the Covid vaccine for Kulldorff\u2019s advisory committee; Vinay Prasad, the top vaccine regulator at the Food and Drug Administration; and Catherine Stein, the newest vaccine committee member.\nKennedy shared Tucker\u2019s opposition to lockdowns and mask an"

Key takeaways\nThe US president called the pact a \u201cmiracle\u201d and \u201camazing\u201d and hailed the United Arab Emirates\u2019s signing of it.\nThe \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d secured agreements between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll help bring long-lasting peace to the Middle East,\u201d Trump claimed with his signature bombast.\nBut there are several factors at play since the original iteration of the accords, signed with fanfare at the White House during Trump\u2019s first term as president in 2020.\nIsrael has carried out a two-year genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza, escalated its harsh assault on the occupied West Bank, and beyond Palestine, bombed six countries in the region this year, including key Gulf Arab mediator Qatar, the huge diplomatic fallout from which effectively helped Trump force Israel into a ceasefire in Gaza.\nAn emergency summit of Arab and Muslim countries held in Doha in September, in the wake of the attack, staunchly declared its solidarity with Qatar and condemned Israel\u2019s bombing of the Qatari capital.\nThe extraordinary joint session between the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) gathered nearly 60 member states. Leaders said the meeting marked a critical moment to deliver a united message following what they described as an unprecedented escalation by Israel.\nIsrael\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s vision of a \u201cGreater Israel\u201d, has also been roundly condemned by Arab and Muslim countries, and involves hegemonic designs on Lebanese and Syrian territory, among others. Syrian President al-Sharaa, while welcoming Washington\u2019s moves to end its international isolation, has not been warm to the idea of signing up to the Abraham Accords.\nHezbollah\u2019s Secretary-General Naim Qassem appealed to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks to mend relations with the Lebanese armed group, aligned with Iran, and build a common front against Israel.\nAn August survey from the Washington Institute, a pro-Israel think tank in the US, found that 81 percent of Saudi respondents viewed the prospect of normalising relations with Israel negatively.\nA Foreign Affairs and Arab Barometer poll from June came to similar findings: in Morocco, one of the Abraham Accords signatories, support for the deal fell from 31 percent in 2022 to 13 percent in the months after Israel\u2019s war on Gaza began in October 2023.\nSaudi Arabia has also repeatedly asserted its commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative, which conditions recognition of Israel on resolving the plight of Palestinians and establishing a Palestinian state."

If the LDP and Ishin join forces, the ruling party could gain 35 more lower house seats, while Ishin boosts its image on the national stage \u2013 though together they\u2019d still fall short of a majority. Many investors see the alliance as making it tougher for opposition parties to disrupt policy, offering a sense of stability. Even so, Japan\u2019s economic recovery remains uneven: core machinery orders slid 0.9% in August, reflecting cautious business sentiment, but orders from major manufacturers spiked 7.3%, showing that some big players are still investing. The Bank of Japan signaled it will keep monetary policy loose, since inflation still lags its 2% goal. Meanwhile, firms like Kringle Pharma and Tekscend Photomask made headlines for international expansion and big fundraising, and GNI\u2019s clinical progress in China underscored regional momentum in health innovation.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Stable politics boost market optimism.\nStronger political cooperation in Japan usually means lower risk for investors, and the Nikkei's surge to 48,277.74 reflects relief over policy continuity. Still, mixed machinery orders and a dovish Bank of Japan mean that gains may remain patchy \u2013 with some industries rebounding faster than others as stimulus and global demand ebb and flow.\nThe bigger picture: Innovation puts Japan on the regional map.\nBig-ticket stock listings and expansion into global markets show that Japanese firms are keen to lead in technology and healthcare. Japan\u2019s slow and steady approach to stimulus and inflation is a sign policymakers remain cautious \u2013 aiming for growth but unwilling to risk stability as they navigate post-pandemic recovery and long-term change.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
