The decline in gold prices may also have been exacerbated by margin calls and algorithm-driven trading.\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\nAccording to Michael Ball, a macro strategist at Bloomberg, the retreat was likely intensified by commodity trading advisers who use computer models to make directional bets on prices.\nPart of the recent weakness in gold and silver \u2014 the latter plunged nearly 11% on Thursday \u2014 was also attributed to profit-taking. Precious metals had rebounded after a historic rout earlier in the month, and trading conditions have remained unusually volatile. Despite the choppy moves, gold is on track to finish the week largely unchanged.\nMarket participants are now focused on US inflation data due later Friday, which could influence expectations for the next policy move by the Federal Reserve. Strong US jobs data released earlier this week dampened expectations for an interest rate cut by midyear. Lower interest rates typically benefit non-yielding assets such as gold.\nAs of 10:20 a.m. in Singapore, spot gold was up 1.1% at $4,977.44 an ounce. Silver gained 1.9% to $76.70, while platinum rose 1.4% and palladium advanced 2.2%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index edged up 0.1%.\nBy Nijat Babayev"

                "body": "After dropping below $5,000 an ounce, gold and other metals rebounded as markets looked to CPI for clues on when the Fed might cut rates.\n1 min\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nGold rebounded in early Asian trading after a sharp sell-off briefly dragged it below the closely watched $5,000-an-ounce level, with traders waiting on US CPI data for clues on the Fed\u2019s next move.\nWhat does this mean?\nGold usually has a tougher time when interest rates are high, since it doesn\u2019t generate income the way bonds do. After strong US jobs data reinforced the \u201chigher for longer\u201d view, attention has shifted to the next CPI reading, due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Markets are still pricing in two 25-basis-point Fed cuts in 2026, with June penciled in for the first, but a hotter inflation print could push that timeline back and weigh on precious metals. And onc..\ne prices crack big round numbers like $5,000, stop-losses and options hedges can amplify the move in either direction.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Inflation is still the main scoreboard.\nGold\u2019s whipsaw is a reminder that real yields and rate expectations are steering a lot of price action right now. If CPI comes in hot, investors may price fewer or later cuts \u2013 typically a headwind for gold and its peers. That can keep volatility elevated across the metals complex, especially when positioning is crowded around major technical levels.\nZooming out: Round numbers can move money.\nPsychology plays a bigger role than most people admit. Big, clean price points often attract headlines, trigger mechanical selling, and concentrate options activity, which can turn a normal pullback into a fast slide. In risk-off stretches \u2013 when stocks wobble and liquidity tightens \u2013 gold can trade less like a steady hedge and more like another asset caught in the crosswinds.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

The white metal suddenly fell late Thursday, pushing silver down more than 11%. Analysts blame a sudden sell-off amid falling technology stocks and expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will not cut interest rates soon.\nConcerns about Artificial Intelligence (AI) spurred a sell-off across financial markets, with margin calls also likely adding to a fall in precious metals. Additionally, expectations that the US central bank would not cut interest rates in the near future following robust jobs data might weigh on a non-yielding asset such as Silver.\nFinancial markets are now pricing in nearly a 92% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting, although the odds of a rate cut at its June meeting are now at nearly 50%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nThe Silver Institute industry association said on Tuesday that global silver demand is expected to remain steady in 2026, with gains in retail investment offsetting most of the losses across industrial, jewelry, and silverware demand.\nThe US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report will be the highlight later on Friday. This report could offer more clues about the interest rate path. The headline and core CPI are expected to show a rise of 2.5% YoY in January. In case of a softer-than-expected outcome, this could drag the US Dollar (USD) lower and lift the USD-denominated commodity price in the near term.\nSilver FAQs\nSilver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.\nSilver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply \u2013 Silver is much more abundant than Gold \u2013 and recycling rates can also affect prices.\nSilver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals \u2013 more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers\u2019 demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.\nSilver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrar"

                "body": "The trading world awaits the final piece to this week's US economic puzzle, with the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) releasing tomorrow at 8:30 A.M. (ET).\nAfter a cold Retail Sales (0% vs 0.4% exp) and a surprisingly strong Non-Farm Payrolls report (130K vs 70K exp), the third wave of high-tier US data should provide the answers for early 2026 rate cut pricing (and if they are even still a thing).\nThe Federal Reserve had pivoted within its dual mandate, putting less emphasis on the inflation mandate and prioritizing a visibly weakening labor market, to justify the streak of 25 bps cuts between September and December 2025, from 4.50% to the current 3.75%.\nAhead of these cuts, the Fed held a frustrating pause (at least frustrating for President Trump) since December 2024.\nAfter the massive -140K drop in October, Non-Farm Payrolls rebounded through a gradual recovery and haven't reported a figure below +40K since. Hence, communications from the Fed quickly turned back to inflation.\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile Energy and Food prices from the headline Index, remained much closer to 3% than the 2% mandate throughout 2025, with the effects of the infamous Trump Tariffs delaying post-COVID inflation drops further (compared to what was seen in Canada, for example). And that hasn't sat well with the Fed.\nUS Core Inflation (Sticky Price Index) since 2016 \u2013 Source: FRED\nExpectations for tomorrow's report\nUS Inflation Data expectations \u2013 MarketPulse Economic Calendar\nTomorrow's report should bring further clarity to the US CPI releases, which had previously been obscured by the longest-ever Government shutdown in October, which prevented precise data collection.\nBoth the Headline and Core CPI are expected to release at +0.3% m/m, taking the year-over-year data to 2.5% for both.\nComforting for the Fed? Maybe, but this release should also be affected by last year's high-base effect (January 2025 Core CPI was at 3.1%!), and hence provide more sensitivity to any beat.\nProducer Prices tend to be reflected in CPI between 3 and 6 months after their rise, but the more lasting effects may even take more than a year.\nFor those who forgot, PPI sent out a major warning about tariffs in July 2025: We are entering the final periods to observe significant effects from the Trump Policies, and the Fed will be watching closely.\nIt has a few of the most hawkish regional members on the voting chairs in 2026 (Hammack and Logan), so thresholds for cuts will be high.\nMarkets are at a sensitive inflexion point, with Equities still at or very close to their all-time highs (despite huge routs in the Tech and Software Sectors) and extreme trends looking fragile, as seen this morning with the large drops in Gold and Silver.\nIf things turn sour, Stocks and Metal Markets could quickly see a Crypto-like bear market for the foreseeable future, as Participants will be forced to deleverage.\nLet's discover reactions to see why.\nReactions Scenarios\nThe following FOMC Rate Decision will be announced on March 18 and is currently priced at only 8% (from 23% pre-NFP), leaving little room for a correction at this meeting.\nHowever, there are still about two cuts fully priced in for the rest of the year.\nMarkets are impossible to predict fully; hence, these scenarios could elicit quite different reactions.\nAs-expected\nThis would kick the can down the road for policy pricing, being the final influent data release before February 27 (PPI).\nStock Indexes:\nAn as-expected data will send Stock Markets to a quick test of their recent all-time highs, but the effect should slow down throughout the session. After the data, expect Indexes to keep consolidating at their highs (48,000 to 50,000 for the DJIA) in the waiting for more clarity.\nMetals:\nAfter today's large drop, metals should continue seeing progressive outflows \u2013 Silver back to $70 and Gold hanging around $4,200 to $4,400\nCryptos:\nCryptos should rally initially but the rise shouldn't be long-lasted.

Stronger-than-expected jobs figures have tempered expectations for interest rate cuts this week.\nAs of 5:01 GMT, spot gold rose 1.05 percent to $4,978.83 an ounce, bringing its weekly gain to 0.4 percent. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures for April delivery advanced 0.95 percent to $4,995.30 per ounce.\nIn the UAE, gold rates posted a notable rebound, with 24-carat gold gaining AED3 to AED599.75 and 22-carat gold rising AED2.75 to AED555.25. Additionally, 21-carat gold edged up AED2.75 to AED532.5, and 18-carat gold rose AED2.25 to AED456.5.\nMeanwhile, 14-carat gold increased AED1.75 to AED356.\nPrecious metals track broader market decline\nGold prices tumbled nearly 3 percent on Thursday to their lowest level in about a week, slipping below the key $5,000-an-ounce support as intensified selling followed a sharp downturn in global equities. Precious metals tracked the broader market decline overnight, with no clear macroeconomic trigger behind the move.\nInstead, the sell-off was largely driven by renewed concerns over artificial intelligence disruption, which weighed heavily on technology stocks. Asian equities pulled back from record highs on Friday, as fears of margin compression in the tech sector pressured companies such as Apple.\nGold prices also came under pressure as the U.S. dollar index strengthened, rising 0.07 percent to 97.00. A firmer dollar typically weighs on commodities priced in the greenback, as it raises costs for buyers using other currencies.\n\u201cFollowing the recent flash crash in metals, continued aftershocks are likely in the weeks and months ahead, making a near-term retest of January highs highly improbable, while at the same time leaving the door open for a retest of the lows,\u201d said Tony Scaymore, Analyst at IG.\nMarket attention turn to key U.S. inflation data\nThe bullion market also faced headwinds after data released on Wednesday showed the U.S. labor market started 2026 on a stronger-than-expected footing. The robust jobs figures reinforced expectations that policymakers may keep interest rates higher for longer.\nIn addition, the U.S. budget deficit is projected to widen slightly to $1.853 trillion in fiscal 2026, according to a forecast released on Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office, indicating that President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies are further straining the country\u2019s fiscal outlook at a time of subdued growth.\n\u201cOnce volatility subsides, however, the medium-term bullish outlook should reassert itself. Persistent concerns over U.S. debt sustainability, ongoing dollar weakness, sticky inflation pressures and the increasing appeal of real assets as a hedge continue to underpin demand,\u201d Scaymore added. \u201cCompounding this are stretched equity valuations, geopolitical risks, questions surrounding Fed independence and uncertainty over U.S. trade and fiscal policies.\u201d\nAttention now turns to upcoming U.S. inflation data for further signals on the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy trajectory. Markets are currently pricing in two 25-basis-point rate cuts this year, with the first anticipated in June. As a non-yielding asset, gold typically benefits from a lower interest rate environment.\nSilver recovers from 11 percent dip\nAs gold prices rebounded, the broader precious metals market witnessed increases. Spot silver advanced 2.91 percent to $77.35 per ounce, recovering after plunging 11 percent in the previous session, although it was still heading for a weekly decline of about 1.2 percent.\nPlatinum gained 1.74 percent to $2,034.76 per ounce, while palladium rose 2.98 percent to $1,664.99. Despite the rebound, both metals remained on course to post losses for the week."

                "body": "Protests have erupted across the country of Iran, leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians due to the violent response of the government. As a result, President Trump has sent the USS Abraham Lincoln, serving as the flagship for Carrier Strike Group 3, with the threat of intervention if the violence and oppression do not stop. Additionally, with the ongoing threat of military intervention, a resolve demonstrated by the recent downing of an Iranian drone that was approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln, Iran has agreed to additional rounds of nuclear talks. The outcome of the first round of talks, which took place in Oman the weekend of February 5, did not seem promising.\nIran boasts one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world, and although heavily sanctioned, it remains a top 10 global producer and an active member of OPEC+. As a result of heavy sanctions, most of Iran\u2019s oil has been purchased by China, which accounts for a significant portion of China\u2019s annual seaborne oil imports. Given the recent political upheaval in Venezuela, if Iran has a similar fate, the combination of losing access to cheap Venezuelan and Iranian oil would devastate China\u2019s seaborne imports.\nIran\u2019s Oil and Vulnerability\nIn 2023, Iran held the world\u2019s third-largest known oil reserves, accounting for 9% of the global total, and was the fourth-largest crude-oil producer in OPEC+. A significant portion of Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure, especially its vital export terminals, is concentrated in the southwest, with onshore production centered in Khuzestan and offshore production along the country\u2019s Persian Gulf coastline. The majority of Iran\u2019s oil reserves, 86%, are located onshore in the Khuzestan Basin, which also accounts for 80% of the country\u2019s total onshore reserves. The concentration of oil in one particular region is a convenience for extraction and transportation, but it may also prove to be a strategic vulnerability if the United States proceeds with military intervention and targets key resources and infrastructure. Of the plentiful oil infrastructure Iran has, arguably the most important is the Kharg Oil Terminal on Kharg Island. With 90% of Iran\u2019s oil exports passing through Kharg, it remains one of the most critical components of Iran\u2019s oil supply chain and, therefore, a glaring Achilles\u2019 heel.\nIn addition to Kharg Island, the Strait of Hormuz is important to Iran and to the global oil supply. For decades, the Strait, situated between Iran and Oman, has remained one of the world\u2019s most important trade routes, serving as a critical link between Middle Eastern oil and the global market. In 2024 alone, the Strait served as a passage for an average of 20 million b/d, equivalent to a staggering 20% of global consumption; the figure increased to over a quarter of all seaborne oil trade in 2024 and the first quarter of 2025.\nAlthough more diversified than other oil-rich countries in the region, oil accounts for a significant and reliable portion of Iran\u2019s GDP. In 2024, oil production accounted for 23% of Iran\u2019s GDP, and oil exports accounted for 40% of the country\u2019s total export revenue in 2023. Given the importance of oil revenue to the current government of Iran, a major supply chain disruption of any kind, which could include either the destruction of critical infrastructure or perhaps even an American occupation of Kharg Island, could contribute to the government of Iran losing control over an already frustrated citizenry.\nSanctions on Iran and China\u2019s Exposure\nThe United States has levied sanctions on Iran for decades, beginning in 1979 with President Jimmy Carter\u2019s Executive Order 12170, which froze Iranian assets in response to the seizure of the U.S. Embassy and kidnapping of its staff during the Islamic Revolution. Trade restrictions were expanded in 1984 after Iran was declared a state sponsor of terrorism, but it was in 1995 when Iran\u2019s petroleum industry was specifically targeted. In 1995, President Bill Clinton signed Exe"

The pair has trimmed previous losses amid a moderate risk appetite as the positive impact of the strong US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on the USD faded.\nJanuary's delayed US NFP report showed a 130K increase in net employment, almost twice the 70K forecasted by market analysts, and the Unemployment Rate declined to 4.3% from 4.4% in the previous month.\nAn excessive concentration of employment creation, with the healthcare sector accounting for nearly two-thirds of January's payrolls and a sharp downward revision to 2025 figures, somewhat tempered investors' optimism.

The odds for monetary easing in March have dropped to 5% from 20% pre-NFP, and the chances of a rate cut in April have dropped to 20% from above 40%, according to the CME's Fed Watch Tool. Investors still see a 60% chance of an easing move in June, the first monetary policy meeting with Kevin Warsh in the central bank's chair.\nIn the US session, Initial Jobless Claims and Home Sales figures might provide some distraction, although traders might remain cautious ahead of Friday's Consumer Price Index (CPI), for a more complete assessment of the Fed's monetary policy path.\nLater on Thursday, European Central Bank Board member Philip Lane, and Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel will take the stage to reiterate the idea of a steady monetary policy for the ner future, which is likely to keep the Euro buoyed.\nEconomic Indicator\nInitial Jobless Claims\nThe Initial Jobless Claims released by the US Department of Labor is a measure of the number of people filing first-time claims for state unemployment insurance. A larger-than-expected number indicates weakness in the US labor market, reflects negatively on the US economy, and is negative for the US Dollar (USD). On the other hand, a decreasing number should be taken as bullish for the USD.\nRead more.Next release: Thu Feb 12, 2026 13:30\nFrequency: Weekly\nConsensus: 222K\nPrevious: 231K\nSource: US Department of Labor\nEvery Thursday, the US Department of Labor publishes the number of previous week\u2019s initial claims for unemployment benefits in the US.

Consequently, the world\u2019s most traded forex pair continues to waver within its recent technical ranges. Market participants now demonstrate clear hesitation ahead of the imminent release of pivotal US economic indicators. Specifically, traders await the latest US Initial Jobless Claims and Housing Starts data, both scheduled for 12:30 GMT. These reports possess significant potential to inject volatility into a market currently characterized by consolidation.\nEUR/USD Analysis: A Technical Perspective on Range-Bound Action\nTechnical analysis reveals the EUR/USD pair remains firmly trapped between two critical price levels. On the daily chart, the pair consistently finds support near the 1.0820 zone. Conversely, it encounters robust resistance around the 1.0880-1.0900 band. This 60-pip corridor has contained price action for the majority of the trading week. Furthermore, key moving averages have begun to converge, signaling a potential compression of volatility. The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) currently sits at 1.0850, while the 200-day SMA resides at 1.0875. This clustering of technical indicators underscores the market\u2019s indecision.\nMarket technicians often interpret this pattern as a coiling phase. Typically, such phases precede a decisive breakout. However, the direction of that breakout frequently depends on fundamental catalysts. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart hovers near 50, confirming a neutral momentum bias. For traders, this environment necessitates a disciplined approach. Many institutional desks report implementing range-trading strategies. These strategies involve selling near resistance and buying near support until a clear breakout occurs.\nKey Technical Levels for EUR/USD\nThe Fundamental Catalyst: US Jobless Claims and Housing Data\nThe immediate fundamental focus rests squarely on the upcoming US economic data. Market consensus, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists, anticipates the following figures. First, Initial Jobless Claims are forecast to show 215,000 new applications for the week ending April 5. This figure would represent a slight increase from the previous week\u2019s 210,000. Second, Housing Starts for March are projected to register at an annualized rate of 1.52 million units. This follows February\u2019s reading of 1.50 million. These datasets provide critical insights into the health of the US labor market and housing sector.\nAnalysts at major investment banks highlight the data\u2019s dual importance. Strong jobless claims figures could reinforce the narrative of a resilient US labor market. This resilience often supports the US Dollar by allowing the Federal Reserve to maintain a cautious stance on interest rate cuts. Conversely, a significant uptick in claims might fuel expectations for earlier monetary policy easing. Similarly, housing data serves as a leading indicator for consumer confidence and broader economic activity. Robust housing starts suggest economic strength, while weakness could signal underlying fragility.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s recent communications have explicitly emphasized a data-dependent approach. Therefore, every high-frequency data point now carries amplified weight. The central bank\u2019s next policy meeting on May 1 looms large on the horizon. Consequently, today\u2019s releases will contribute directly to the market\u2019s pricing of future Fed policy actions. This direct link to monetary policy expectations explains the cautious trading in EUR/USD ahead of the data drop.\nExpert Insight: Interpreting the Data for Forex Markets\nJane Miller, Chief Currency Strategist at Global Macro Advisors, provided context in a client note th"

                "body": "British Pound consolidates around 1.3600 vs. USD; looks to US CPI for fresh impetus\n- GBP/USD struggles to gain any meaningful traction as traders await the key US inflation data.\n- Fed rate cut bets and threats to the Fed\u2019s independence keep the USD bulls on the defensive.\n- Easing political jitters counter dovish BoE bets, lending support to the GBP and spot prices.\nThe GBP/USD pair remains on the defensive through the Asian session on Friday, though it lacks bearish conviction and holds above the 1.3600 mark as traders await the release of the US consumer inflation figures before placing directional bets.\nThe crucial US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will play a key role in influencing market expectations about the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-cut path. This, in turn, will drive the US Dollar (USD) demand and provide some meaningful impetus to the GBP/USD pair. Ahead of the key data risk, the markets are pricing in a greater chance that the US central bank will cut interest rates at least two times in 2026, which keeps the USD bulls on the defensive.\nApart from this, growing concerns about the Fed's independence fails to assist the USD to build on the blowout US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report-inspired bounce from a two-week low, touched on Wednesday. However, the risk-off impulse offers some support to the safe-haven Greenback and acts as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. Adding to this, dovish Bank of England (BoE) expectations contribute to capping the upside for the British Pound (GBP).\nIn fact, the odds of a 25 basis points (bps) BoE rate cut as soon as March increased following the release of mostly disappointing UK macro data on Thursday. In fact, the preliminary report published by the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK economy expanded by 0.1% in the October-to-December period, matching the slow pace recorded in the third quarter. The reading also fell short of the BoE's forecast of 0.2% growth, backing the case for further easing.\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received backing from his cabinet and Labour MPs following a tumultuous period sparked by fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein files and the resignation of a key aide. This helped prevent an immediate leadership challenge, easing UK political jitters. This, in turn, is seen acting as a tailwind for the Sterling and the GBP/USD pair, warranting some caution before positioning for any meaningful depreciating move.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can"

                "body": "GBP/USD: Pound Flat Near $1.3630 After UK Growth Slides Under Consensus\n1 min read\nKey points:\n- British currency hugs the flatline\n- Markets eye more rate cuts ahead\n- 2025 growth comes in modest at 1.3%\nBritish economy expanded by just 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025. Analysts had expected growth of 0.2%.\n\ud83d\udce2 Growth Miss, Market Shrugs\n- The GBPUSD pair was flat after data said UK GDP expanded just 0.1% in the fourth quarter, missing the 0.2% consensus and matching the third quarter\u2019s modest pace. That is growth, technically, but it is hardly the stuff of champagne headlines.\n- December alone delivered a 0.1% monthly increase, while November was revised slightly lower to 0.2%, reinforcing the theme of a slow grind rather than a breakout.\n- For 2025 as a whole, the economy grew 1.3%, up from 1.1% the prior year, steady but hardly roaring in a year marked by trade noise and fiscal uncertainty.\n\ud83d\udcb7 Pound Holds Its Ground\n- The pound-dollar hovered near $1.3630 after the data, little changed on the session and up roughly 1.6% year to date. Traders appear more focused on rate expectations than a single tenth of a percentage point.\n- In FX terms, flat price action after a miss often signals that the outcome was already priced in. The market had braced for softness and got softness.\n- Immediate technical support sits around $1.3550, while a sustained push above $1.37 would signal renewed upside momentum for sterling bulls.\n\ud83c\udfe6 BoE Cut Bets Build\n- Investors now expect the Bank of England to continue trimming rates, with the next cut widely penciled in for March. Lower rates reduce borrowing costs and aim to stimulate spending and investment.\n- Rate expectations are key because currencies often track interest-rate differentials, the gap between one country\u2019s rates and another\u2019s. Narrower gaps can weigh on a currency.\n- For now, the pound trades in wait-and-see mode. If growth fails to pick up and inflation cools further, policymakers may lean more dovish, and sterling may feel the pressure."

This key economic indicator will provide essential insights into the British economy\u2019s health and potentially determine the Sterling\u2019s trajectory through the second quarter of 2025. Market participants currently price in continued strength for the British Pound against the US Dollar, with technical analysis supporting this optimistic outlook. However, the upcoming GDP figures represent a significant fundamental catalyst that could either validate or challenge the prevailing market sentiment.\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis: Bullish Structure Intact\nTechnical analysts observe several constructive patterns in the GBP/USD chart structure. The currency pair has established a series of higher lows since January 2025, creating a clear upward channel. Furthermore, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages maintain a bullish alignment, with the shorter-term average positioned above the longer-term one. This configuration typically signals sustained upward momentum. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads 62, indicating positive momentum without entering overbought territory. Several key technical levels warrant close monitoring:\n- Immediate Support: 1.3600-1.3620 zone (previous resistance turned support)\n- Primary Resistance: 1.3750 (2025 yearly high)\n- Secondary Resistance: 1.3800 (psychological level)\n- Critical Support: 1.3550 (200-day moving average)\nMarket technicians note that sustained trading above 1.3600 maintains the bullish bias. Conversely, a decisive break below 1.3550 would signal potential trend reversal. The current price action suggests institutional accumulation, with volume patterns supporting the upward trajectory.\nUK Economic Context and GDP Expectations\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s economic performance has shown remarkable resilience through early 2025, defying earlier recession predictions. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) will release Q4 2024 GDP figures alongside monthly estimates for January 2025. Economists surveyed by Reuters anticipate quarterly growth of 0.3% for Q4 2024, following 0.2% expansion in Q3. Meanwhile, market consensus projects January\u2019s monthly GDP reading at 0.2%. Several economic sectors demonstrate particular strength currently:\n- Services Sector: Accounting for 80% of UK output, services show consistent expansion\n- Manufacturing: Recent PMI data indicates modest recovery in factory activity\n- Construction: Infrastructure projects support steady growth in this sector\nBank of England policymakers closely monitor these GDP figures as they consider future monetary policy decisions. Strong economic data could reinforce expectations for maintaining current interest rate levels, potentially supporting Sterling strength. However, weaker-than-expected numbers might revive speculation about earlier rate cuts, creating downward pressure on the currency.\nComparative Economic Performance: UK vs. US\nThe GBP/USD exchange rate reflects the relative economic performance between the United Kingdom and United States. Recent Federal Reserve communications suggest a cautious approach to monetary policy adjustments, with Chair Jerome Powell emphasizing data dependency. Meanwhile, the Bank of England maintains a similarly cautious stance, creating a balanced policy divergence landscape. The following table illustrates key economic comparisons:\nThese comparative metrics highlight why the GBP/USD pair remains sensitive to relative economic performance. The upcoming UK GDP data will provide fresh evidence for this ongoing comparison.\nMarket Sentiment and Positioning Analysis\nCommitment of Trad"

                "body": "AUD/USD eases slightly, but remains firmly in bull country\n- AUD/USD backslid around 0.5% on Thursday.\n- Despite an intraday cool-off, the Aussie remains comfortably bullish, trading near multi-year highs.\nThe Australian Dollar rallied to a fresh three-and-a-half-year high above 0.7140 this week after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) reinforced its hawkish stance. Governor Michele Bullock warned the board remains prepared to raise rates further if inflation proves persistent, describing any inflation \"with a three in front of it\" as unacceptable. Deputy Governor Hauser echoed this stance a day earlier, noting inflation remains too high and continues to pose a challenge for the rate-setting board. The RBA hiked its cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.85% earlier this month, and markets now price a 74% chance of another increase in May, with 38 basis points of additional tightening expected through year-end. Consumer inflation expectations jumped to 5% in February, the highest since mid-2025, adding to the hawkish narrative. However, a weaker Chinese Consumer Price Index (CPI) and persistent producer price deflation signaled softer demand for Australian exports, capping gains.\nOn the US Dollar side, January Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) came in at 130K (above the 70K consensus) while unemployment fell to 4.3%, tempering expectations for near-term Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. Looking ahead, Friday's delayed US CPI release for January will be the key driver, with economists forecasting headline CPI at 0.29% month-on-month and core CPI at 0.39% month-on-month. A softer print could widen the Fed-RBA policy divergence further in favor of the Australian Dollar.\nTechnicals punch in a potential hard ceiling near 0.7150\nOn the daily chart, AUD/USD is holding near 0.7118 after printing a session high of 0.7148, its highest level since February 2023. The pair has rallied for six consecutive weeks and trades well above the 50-week and 100-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), confirming a strong bullish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has risen to 23 on the weekly timeframe, its highest reading in weeks, signaling trend strength is building. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is continuing to climb, though approaching overbought territory on the daily chart.\nOn the 4H timeframe, the pair pulled back from the 0.7148 high to test support near the former resistance zone at 0.7100, which now acts as a near-term pivot. The September 2024 swing high at 0.6932 has been decisively broken and serves as a key support level on any deeper retracement. Immediate resistance sits at the 0.7148 session high, with a break above targeting the psychological 0.7200 handle and the 0.7250 zone. A failure to hold 0.7100 could see a pullback toward the 0.7050 to 0.7000 demand zone, where buyers are likely to re-emerge given the broader bullish structure.\nAUD/USD daily chart\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and ti"

                "body": "Sydney, Feb 13, 2026, 09:54 (AEDT)\n- Renewed bets on another RBA rate hike are pushing the Australian dollar higher.\n- When the currency gains strength, it can tamp down imported inflation, though exporters and investors with overseas holdings tend to feel the pinch.\n- Focus stays on inflation numbers and what central banks signal about policy shifts\u2014traders are lined up for the next move.\nThe Australian dollar surged to a new three-year high this week, clearing the 71 U.S. cent mark as markets factored in greater odds of another Reserve Bank of Australia rate hike. The currency advanced 0.7% to $0.7122, with analysts eyeing technical resistance at $0.7158, then $0.7282. Lending drove the move: mortgage borrowing spiked 9.5% last quarter, while investment loans hit all-time highs. 1\nThis isn\u2019t just a story for currency traders. When the Aussie dollar climbs, import costs may ease, yet exporters can see their margins squeezed. There\u2019s another wrinkle: returns on overseas investments can quietly slip, too.\nThis comes at a tricky time for policymakers. Inflation hasn\u2019t settled below target, and rates are moving again. That puts the currency in the spotlight \u2014 it can slam the brakes on growth, sometimes more abruptly than central bankers expect.\nRBA Governor Michele Bullock didn\u2019t mince words before lawmakers, saying the bank stands ready to tighten policy if inflation proves sticky: \u201cIf we need to go up further because inflation is entrenched, the board will do so,\u201d she said. The RBA bumped its cash rate up by 25 basis points to 3.85% last week, reacting to underlying inflation rising to 3.4% last quarter. Traders are currently pricing in roughly a 75% probability of a hike to 4.10% at the May meeting, pending first-quarter inflation data. 2\nThe short-term setup is looking overstretched\u2014even for bullish traders. UOB\u2019s Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia pointed out that AUD/USD might still push toward 0.7150, though they cautioned that \u201cupward momentum has not increased much.\u201d Resistance sits at 0.7175. For now, they see 0.7055 as a key level; holding above it keeps the broader outlook constructive in the coming weeks. 3\nSome strategists are eyeing the Aussie dollar for a move into the mid-70s U.S. cents, according to a report in the Australian Financial Review, as investors ramp up bets on more RBA tightening. Still, the same report points out, there are warnings that the push higher could run into its own hurdles. 4\nThe dollar\u2019s barely budged. Traders, stuck with a batch of mixed U.S. data, are holding out for Friday\u2019s inflation print. The dollar index? Still hovering near 96.93. 5\nThe New Zealand dollar hovered near $0.6059, with traders eyeing the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\u2019s meeting set for next week. Consensus is for the central bank to hold steady at 2.25% following an extended period of rate cuts. Westpac\u2019s chief New Zealand economist, Kelly Eckhold, noted, \u201cHence, we have revised up our view of how quickly the RBNZ will lift the OCR over 2027,\u201d pointing to a faster pace of official cash rate hikes. 6\nAustralian investors face a less obvious headwind when the Australian dollar surges. Even if U.S. dollar-denominated global shares rally, gains can look smaller once converted back to Australian dollars\u2014unless, of course, that currency risk is hedged.\nThe rally faces two potential stumbling blocks. If inflation data comes in weaker, that could cool enthusiasm for another RBA hike. On the flip side, a sudden bounce in the U.S. dollar would pressure AUD/USD. Technically, the pair is also bumping up against resistance, adding to the pullback risk."

                "body": "Australian Dollar Today, February 13: RBA Hike Drives AUD Toward 0.72\nAustralian dollar jumped today, 13 February, after the RBA rate hike of 25 bp, pushing AUD/USD to 0.7147, the highest since February 2023. Traders now watch AUD/USD 0.7175, a nearby resistance flagged by several desks. With domestic rates higher, carry support has improved, and some strategists see scope for the mid-0.70s. The risk is a firmer US dollar that could erase gains. For Australians with unhedged offshore assets, currency hedging matters more today. Sticky services inflation keeps the RBA cautious, so policy may stay tighter for longer. We outline what drove the move, key levels, and simple steps to protect portfolios.\nWhy the AUD jumped after the RBA move\nThe RBA lifted the cash rate by 25 basis points and kept a tightening bias, which widened Australia\u2019s rate advantage versus peers. That shift boosted carry demand and pushed the Australian dollar higher, with AUD/USD touching 0.7147. Several banks now talk about the mid-0.70s if data co-operates, according to the Financial Review source. Clearer guidance reduced policy uncertainty and drew fresh inflows into AUD.\nUS yields, growth surprises, and risk appetite still steer daily moves. A firmer greenback can quickly reverse gains, even when domestic policy is tight. That is why today\u2019s pop in the Australian dollar comes with a caveat. If US data beats or oil rises, AUD/USD can stall below resistance. Investors should track US CPI and jobs to gauge whether USD strength returns.\nKey levels: AUD/USD 0.7175 and the path to the mid-0.70s\nTraders are watching AUD/USD 0.7175 as the next upside mark after 0.7147. UOB analysts note a positive tone toward that level, per Mitrade\u2019s coverage source. A clean break and daily close above could open 0.7220 to 0.7250. Fading momentum or weak risk sentiment could see a pullback to 0.7080 to 0.7100, where dip buyers may recheck conviction.\nMany desks see room toward the mid-0.70s if the upswing holds. For the Australian dollar bull case, we would want higher lows on pullbacks and strong closes above 0.7175. Invalidation arrives on a decisive drop back under 0.7050, which would hint that USD strength is back in charge and the rally needs to reset.\nWhat a stronger AUD means for Australians\nA firmer Australian dollar lowers prices of imported goods in AUD terms, which can ease pressure on household budgets. It also helps when planning overseas travel, as buying USD, EUR, or JPY becomes cheaper. On the flip side, tourism operators that rely on inbound visitors may feel a pinch if Australia becomes pricier for foreigners.\nExporters with USD revenue may report lower AUD earnings when the currency rises. Companies with heavy offshore income sometimes hedge to smooth results. For investors, an unhedged global equity fund can fall in AUD terms when the Australian dollar rallies, even if the underlying stocks rise. Hedged ETFs can reduce that swing but add costs.\nPractical currency hedging ideas\nStart by measuring your offshore exposure and decide a target hedge ratio, such as 25 percent to 50 percent. Australian investors can use AUD-hedged global ETFs, multi-currency cash accounts, or forward contracts from a broker. The goal is to cushion swings in the Australian dollar without betting the farm. Revisit the mix as markets shift.\nHedge gradually instead of all at once. Use limit orders to add protection on pullbacks toward 0.7080 to 0.7100, and lighten hedges into strength near 0.7175 to 0.7250. Keep costs in view, and avoid overhedging. For larger sums, discuss forwards or options pricing with your provider and confirm margin and collateral terms.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe RBA\u2019s 25 bp move and firm guidance lifted the Australian dollar to 0.7147 and put AUD/USD 0.7175 in play. The next phase depends on global risk and the US dollar. A clear break higher could extend toward the low to mid-0.70s, while a stronger USD could send the pair back toward 0.7050.\nFor households, a stronger"

                "body": "USD/JPY extended its losing streak to four consecutive sessions on Thursday, February 12. Demand for the Japanese yen has intensified since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s landslide election win.\nRising expectations of multiple Bank of Japan rate hikes, intervention warnings, and optimism that Prime Minister Takaichi will endorse prudent fiscal policy management have sent USD/JPY sharply lower.\nMeanwhile, bets on a June Fed rate cut linger, cooling buying interest in the US dollar. On Friday, February 13, the US CPI report will be key for the greenback and near-term USD/JPY trends.\nImportantly, expectations of narrowing US-Japan interest rate differentials in favor of the yen continue to support a bearish medium-term outlook.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nThis week, Japanese economic indicators fueled speculation about a Bank of Japan rate hike. Wage growth accelerated at the end of 2025, signaling a pickup in consumer spending. An upswing in spending could fuel demand-driven inflation, supporting market expectations of a more hawkish BoJ rate path. Average cash earnings rose 2.4% year-on-year (YoY) in December, up from 1.7% in November.\nMeanwhile, producer prices increased 2.3% YoY in January, down from 2.4% in December. While slightly softer year-on-year, producer prices rose 0.2% month-on-month in January, suggesting an improving demand backdrop. Typically, producers adjust prices subject to demand, passing cost savings or higher prices on to consumers.\nEast Asia Econ remarked on the January figures, USD/JPY:\n\u201cImport prices aren\u2019t rising quickly, but they do remain elevated, supporting PPI in a way that wasn\u2019t true during Japan\u2019s long deflation. More interesting now is the strength of export prices, a dynamic that boosts exporter profits, and via the terms of trade, provides a tailwind for domestic income.\u201d\nCrucially, rising domestic income could boost job creation and wages, supporting the BoJ\u2019s USD/JPY quarterly GDP and inflation projections.\nUpbeat Japanese economic data has triggered hawkish sentiment toward the BoJ\u2019s policy outlook. On February 12, Mizuho Bank USD/JPY projected up to three rate hikes in 2026, with a first potentially as early as March. Hawkish bets on the BoJ rate path contrast with ongoing expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts, suggesting sharply narrower US-Japan rate differentials in favor of the yen, contributing to the USD/JPY pair\u2019s decline.\nNotably, rising bets on BoJ rate hikes coincided with yen intervention threats.\nThe government\u2019s stance on yen weakness and the BoJ\u2019s hawkish policy outlook support a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nWhile the yen gets a boost on expectations of multiple BoJ rate hikes, the US CPI report will influence bets on a June Fed rate cut. Economists forecast headline inflation to ease from 2.7% in December to 2.5% in January, with core inflation expected to be 2.5% (Dec: 2.6%).\nSofter inflation numbers are likely to raise expectations of a June Fed rate cut, weighing on the US dollar. Given Fed Chair Powell\u2019s concerns about elevated inflation, USD/JPY is likely to be particularly sensitive to the report.\nThis week\u2019s hotter-than-expected US jobs report has signaled a less dovish Fed rate path.

Spot prices, however, lack bullish conviction and currently trade and remain below the 153.00 mark amid mixed cues.\nInvestors remain hopeful that Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi could be more fiscally responsible and that her policies will boost the economy. This might prompt the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to stick to its policy normalization path, which, along with the risk-off impulse, acts as a tailwind for the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY). The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, continues with its struggle to attract buyers and keep a lid on the USD/JPY pair\u2019s uptick.\nMarket players trimmed their bets for another interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in March following the release of the blowout US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Wednesday. The current market pricing, however, indicates a greater chance of at least two 25 bps Fed rate cuts in 2026. Adding to this, threats to the US central bank's independence keep the USD within striking distance of the weekly low and contribute to capping the USD/JPY pair.\nTraders also seem reluctant and opt to wait for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path before positioning for the next leg of a directional move. Hence, the focus will remain glued to the release of the latest US consumer inflation figures, due later during the North American session. Nevertheless, the USD/JPY pair seems poised to register heavy weekly losses, and the divergent BoJ-Fed expectations back the case for a further near-term depreciating move.\nJapanese Yen Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies this week.

According to recent analysis from OCBC, this currency pair presents a complex picture of competing forces that could shape forex trading strategies throughout 2025. The interplay between monetary policy divergence, economic fundamentals, and geopolitical considerations creates a fascinating case study in modern currency dynamics.\nUSD/JPY Technical and Fundamental Landscape\nCurrency analysts at OCBC have identified several key factors influencing the USD/JPY exchange rate. The pair currently trades within a well-defined range, supported by consistent capital flows but constrained by fundamental limitations. These supportive flows primarily originate from yield differentials between US and Japanese government bonds. Furthermore, corporate hedging activities and institutional positioning contribute to the current stability. However, upside potential remains capped by several structural factors including Japan\u2019s improving current account balance and potential Bank of Japan policy adjustments.\nMarket participants should consider the historical context of USD/JPY movements. Over the past decade, the pair has experienced significant volatility driven by monetary policy shifts. The Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening cycle contrasted sharply with the Bank of Japan\u2019s prolonged accommodative stance. This divergence created substantial interest rate differentials that favored dollar strength. Nevertheless, recent developments suggest a potential convergence scenario that could limit further dollar appreciation against the yen.\nSupportive Flows: Sources and Sustainability\nSeveral distinct sources generate supportive flows for the USD/JPY pair. Foreign direct investment patterns show consistent Japanese investment in US assets. Additionally, carry trade activities continue to provide underlying support. Investors borrow in low-yielding yen to purchase higher-yielding dollar assets. This creates persistent demand for dollars while increasing yen supply. Portfolio rebalancing by Japanese institutional investors further contributes to these flows. Their ongoing allocation to foreign securities, particularly US Treasuries, provides structural support for the currency pair.\nThe sustainability of these supportive flows depends on multiple factors. Yield differentials between US and Japanese government bonds remain a primary driver. As of early 2025, the 10-year US Treasury yield exceeds comparable Japanese government bond yields by approximately 350 basis points. This substantial gap incentivizes continued capital movement from Japan to the United States. However, narrowing differentials could reduce these supportive flows. Market participants closely monitor inflation expectations and central bank forward guidance for signals about future yield trajectories.\nOCBC\u2019s Analytical Framework and Methodology\nOCBC\u2019s currency research team employs a comprehensive analytical framework to assess USD/JPY dynamics. Their methodology combines quantitative models with qualitative assessment of market sentiment. The team analyzes order flow data from multiple trading venues to identify institutional positioning. They also monitor options market pricing for volatility expectations and risk reversals. Furthermore, the research incorporates macroeconomic indicators from both economies. This includes inflation data, employment figures, and manufacturing indices. The resulting analysis provides a multidimensional view of currency pair dynamics.\nThe bank\u2019s research indicates that supportive flows demonstrate remarkable resilience despite periodic market stress.

The US Dollar (USD) edges higher against the Canadian Dollar (CAD) amid expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will not cut interest rates in the near term. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report will be in the spotlight later on Friday.\nThe US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose by 130,000 in January, above the market consensus of 70,000, while the Unemployment Rate edged lower to 4.3% during the same period. The recent stronger-than-expected US jobs data reduces the chances the US central bank will see a need to cut interest rates again by midyear, which underpins the Greenback against the CAD.\nMeanwhile, crude oil prices fall amid expectations of a slowdown in global oil demand for 2026. This, in turn, weighs on the commodity-linked Loonie. It is worth noting that Canada is a major oil-exporting country, and low crude oil prices generally have a negative impact on the CAD.\nOn the other hand, dovish remarks from Fed officials could drag the USD lower in the near term. Fed Board of Governors member Stephan Miran said on Friday that monetary policy has passively tightened. Miran added that the central bank can afford to have lower interest rates.\nTraders currently priced in nearly a 92% odds that the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting, although the chance of a rate cut at its June meeting is now at nearly 50%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar.

This movement occurs in proximity to the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key short-term momentum gauge that traders scrutinize for directional cues. Consequently, this technical confluence creates a decisive juncture for the pair\u2019s near-term trajectory, influencing strategies for institutional and retail traders alike.\nUSD/CAD Technical Analysis at the 1.3600 Junction\nThe 1.3600 level represents more than just a round number. Historically, it has acted as a robust zone of both support and resistance. For instance, price action in Q4 2024 showed repeated rejections near this handle. Currently, the pair\u2019s interaction with the nine-day EMA adds a critical layer of analysis. The EMA smooths price data to identify the trend direction. When price tests an EMA from below, it often seeks confirmation for a continued upward move. Conversely, a failure to hold above it can signal weakening momentum. Market analysts at major banks, including Scotiabank and CIBC Capital Markets, frequently highlight these EMA tests in their daily briefings. They provide evidence that such levels often precede increased volatility.\nFurthermore, other technical indicators contribute to the narrative. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator, is watched for overbought or oversold signals. Trading volume profiles also offer insights into the conviction behind the price move. A high-volume break above 1.3600 carries more weight than a low-volume test. This multifaceted technical perspective is standard practice for firms like J.P. Morgan\u2019s forex desk, which bases trades on a confluence of signals rather than a single indicator.\nFundamental Drivers Behind the Pair\u2019s Movement\nThe USD/CAD exchange rate, often called the \u201cloonie\u201d pair, is fundamentally driven by the economic interplay between the United States and Canada. Several key factors are currently in focus. Primarily, the monetary policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada (BoC) is a primary driver. Recent statements from Fed officials have shaped market expectations for the US interest rate path. Simultaneously, the BoC\u2019s stance on inflation and growth directly impacts the Canadian dollar\u2019s valuation.\nSecondly, commodity prices, especially crude oil, exert a profound influence. Canada is a major oil exporter, so the Canadian dollar often correlates with oil prices. A rise in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude can bolster the CAD, applying downward pressure on USD/CAD. Thirdly, broader risk sentiment in global markets affects the pair. The US dollar often serves as a safe-haven currency. Therefore, during periods of market stress, USD/CAD may rise irrespective of Canada-specific news. Economic data releases, such as US Non-Farm Payrolls and Canadian CPI reports, provide regular catalysts for sharp movements. The timeline of these events is crucial for traders planning their weekly exposure.\nExpert Insight on Market Structure and Impact\nAccording to veteran analysts, the market structure around key levels like 1.3600 often involves layered orders. Institutional traders place stop-loss and take-profit orders clustered around these technical points. This concentration can lead to accelerated price movements when the level is breached\u2014a phenomenon known as a \u201cstop hunt.\u201d The potential impact is significant. A sustained break above 1.3600 could open a path toward the next resistance near 1.3650, a level last tested in February. Conversely, a rejection could see the pair retreat to seek support at the 1.3550 area or the 21-day Simple Moving Average.\nFor businesses, this volatility translates into real-world effects.

                "body": "LONDON, April 2025 \u2013 The GBP/JPY currency pair has staged a significant technical recovery, pushing decisively above the critical 208.00 psychological level, yet this rebound faces a substantial challenge from persistently weak momentum readings on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This development creates a complex trading environment for forex participants, blending short-term bullish price action with concerning underlying momentum divergence that warrants careful analysis.\nGBP/JPY Technical Analysis: Decoding the 208.00 Rebound\nThe recent price action in the British Pound against the Japanese Yen reveals a fascinating technical narrative. After testing support near the 206.50 region in early April, the pair initiated a robust recovery that culminated in a decisive break above the 208.00 handle. This level represents not merely a round number but a significant technical confluence zone that has acted as both support and resistance throughout 2024 and early 2025. Market participants closely monitor this threshold because institutional trading algorithms often cluster orders around such psychologically important levels.\nTechnical analysts emphasize the importance of this recovery within the broader context. The move above 208.00 represents a reclaiming of what many consider the median range for the pair over the past six months. However, the sustainability of this move remains questionable when examined alongside momentum indicators. The recovery has occurred on relatively subdued volume compared to previous significant moves, suggesting cautious participation from major market players. Furthermore, the advance has shown intermittent hesitation at various Fibonacci retracement levels drawn from the March decline.\nKey Technical Levels and Confluence Zones\nSeveral technical factors converge around the current price area. The 208.00 level aligns closely with the 50-day exponential moving average, creating a dual technical barrier that the price must convincingly overcome. Additionally, this zone intersects with a descending trendline drawn from the February 2025 highs, adding further technical significance. The table below outlines the critical technical levels currently influencing GBP/JPY price action:\nThe RSI Momentum Conundrum: A Warning Signal\nDespite the encouraging price recovery above 208.00, the Relative Strength Index presents a concerning picture that cannot be ignored. The RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, has failed to confirm the recent highs in price. This creates what technical analysts term a bearish divergence \u2013 a scenario where price makes a higher high while the momentum indicator makes a lower high. Historically, such divergences have frequently preceded corrective moves or trend reversals in the GBP/JPY pair.\nThe current RSI reading oscillates in the 45-55 range, which indicates neutral momentum despite the price trading near recent recovery highs. This suggests that buying pressure lacks the conviction typically associated with sustainable bullish moves. Several factors contribute to this momentum weakness:\n- Reduced institutional participation during the recovery phase\n- Hedging activity from Japanese exporters above 208.00\n- Diverging monetary policy expectations between the Bank of England and Bank of Japan\n- Risk sentiment fluctuations affecting carry trade dynamics\nMomentum analysis extends beyond the RSI to include the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which currently shows a hesitant bullish crossover that lacks the strong histogram expansion typically seen in decisive trends. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures trend strength, remains below the 25 threshold, confirming the absence of a strong directional trend despite the price recovery.\nFundamental Drivers: Bank of England vs. Bank of Japan Policy Divergence\nThe technical picture unfolds against a complex fundamental backdrop characterized by diverging central b"

This shift in sentiment is fueling a pronounced flight to safety, directly benefiting traditional haven assets like the Japanese Yen. Consequently, the British Pound finds itself on the back foot, grappling with both domestic economic headwinds and this broader market recalibration. Analysts are now closely monitoring support zones as the pair\u2019s trajectory suggests further potential weakness in the near term.\nGBP/JPY Forecast: Technical Breakdown and Key Levels\nThe recent price action for GBP/JPY paints a clear bearish picture. The pair has decisively moved below several critical moving averages, including the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), a signal often interpreted by chartists as a confirmation of a bearish trend. Furthermore, momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have entered oversold territory, yet show no immediate signs of a bullish reversal. This suggests that while a short-term technical bounce is possible, the underlying selling pressure remains dominant. The next major support level resides near the 178.50 handle, a zone that held firm during the market turbulence of late 2024. A sustained break below this level could open the path for a test of 176.00. On the upside, any recovery attempt will likely face stiff resistance initially at 182.00, followed by the more significant 184.50 region.\nMarket participants are also watching the Ichimoku Cloud closely. The current price is trading well below the Cloud, which is itself turning from red to green\u2014a configuration that typically reinforces a bearish outlook. The lagging span (Chikou Span) is positioned below the price curve of 26 periods ago, adding another layer of confirmation to the downtrend. Volume analysis shows that the recent declines have occurred on above-average volume, indicating strong conviction behind the sell-off rather than mere profit-taking. This confluence of technical factors provides a data-backed framework for the current GBP/JPY forecast, emphasizing the challenge bulls face in regaining control.\nUnderstanding the Risk-Off Surge and Yen Strength\nThe primary catalyst for the GBP/JPY\u2019s decline is a sharp, market-wide pivot toward risk-off behavior. This sentiment shift is characterized by investors moving capital away from perceived riskier assets, such as equities and commodity-linked currencies, and into safe-haven assets. The Japanese Yen has historically excelled in this environment due to Japan\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest creditor nation and its persistent current account surplus. When global uncertainty rises, international investors often repatriate funds, buying Yen and selling other currencies. The current surge appears driven by a combination of factors, including renewed geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, concerns over the pace of global economic growth, and volatility in the technology sector. These elements have collectively eroded investor appetite for risk, creating a perfect storm of demand for the Yen.\nMoreover, the interest rate differential between the UK and Japan, a traditional driver of carry trades, has narrowed. While the Bank of England has signaled a cautious approach to further rate hikes, the Bank of Japan has begun a very gradual normalization of its ultra-loose monetary policy. This subtle shift reduces the inherent yield advantage of holding Pound over Yen, making the carry trade less attractive and thus weakening a previous pillar of support for GBP/JPY. The table below summarizes the key fundamental drivers impacting the pair:\nExpert Analysis: Macroeconomic Crosscurrents\nFinancial institutions are adjusting their models in response to these dynamics. For instance, strategists at major banks like Nomura and HSBC have recently published research notes h"

A close above the middle band would open scope for a broader corrective bounce.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

The decision reflects a growing recognition that digital assets are evolving beyond speculative instruments into a legitimate asset class capable of reshaping capital markets.\nNirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Binance Thailand, described the move as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the country\u2019s capital markets. \u201cIt sends a strong signal that Thailand is positioning itself as a forward-looking leader in Southeast Asia\u2019s digital economy,\u201d he told the Bangkok Post.\nUnder the plan, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will amend the Derivatives Trading Act to formally recognize digital assets as reference assets for derivatives contracts.\nThis expansion allows licensed operators to offer contracts tied to crypto, like futures and options, under appropriate regulatory supervision.\n\u201cThe expansion of permissible goods and variables is designed to support emerging asset classes such as digital assets,\u201d said SEC Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon. \u201cThis will strengthen recognition of crypto as an asset class, enhance portfolio diversification, and improve risk management for investors.\u201d\nThe SEC is developing detailed rules and licensing frameworks for derivatives brokers, exchanges, and clearinghouses to accommodate crypto-based products. It is also working with the Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX) to finalize contract specifications that align with the risk characteristics and practical uses of digital assets in trading.\nIn addition to cryptocurrencies, the amendments reclassify carbon credits as \u201cgoods\u201d rather than \u201cvariables,\u201d allowing the launch of physically delivered carbon credit futures alongside cash-settled contracts. This initiative aligns with Thailand\u2019s climate change and carbon neutrality objectives, as outlined in the draft Climate Change Act.\nThailand\u2019s bitcoin ETF push\nThailand recently finalized a major regulatory framework aimed at positioning itself as a bitcoin hub in Asia. The country\u2019s SEC said its rolling out rules for bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), futures trading, and tokenized investment products, creating a formal legal foundation for digital assets under existing derivatives law.\nThe SEC approved crypto ETFs in principle and is now setting operational guidelines covering custody, liquidity, and cooperation between asset managers and licensed exchanges.\nInvestors could allocate up to 4\u20135% of diversified portfolios to digital assets, with domestic ETFs trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, allowing exposure without direct crypto ownership.\nThailand approved its first spot bitcoin ETF in 2024 and plans to expand to other cryptocurrencies, including ether and diversified baskets."

                "body": "Key Senate Democrat wants U.S. crypto bill to move, and SEC chief reveals danger of defeat\nSenator Mark Warner, a leading Democratic negotiator on the market structure bill, said he wants it to pass, and SEC chief Paul Atkins said durable policy actually requires it.\nWhat to know:\n- In a U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing today, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins said that making crypto policies permanent really demands legislation, despite the authorities he said his agency has to write rules that will work in the interim.\n- Though progress has moved in fits and starts on the U.S. Senate bill to govern crypto market structure, one of the top negotiators on the Democrats' side, Senator Mark Warner, said during the hearing that he still wants the effort to advance.\nOne way or another, the U.S. crypto industry is likely to receive official policy that defines which digital assets get what treatment from which federal agencies. The problem: It might not last.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins is focused on reversing the \"head in the sand\" approach he accuses his predecessors of having on crypto policy, and he's ready to issue rules that give the industry the regulatory clarity it craves. The catch, though, is that such rules won't be locked down and can be erased by the same kind of commission vote that puts them in place. They won't be backed by a targeted law that makes them unassailable by future administrations.\n\"We need a firm grounding in statute so we can't have any backsliding in the future,\" Atkins told the Senate Banking Committee in Thursday testimony. No matter how enthusiastic he is in giving the industry innovation-friendly rules, they're not \"future-proof.\"\nBut the legislation in the U.S. Senate that would govern such things is floundering. Crypto executives and bankers haven't been able to reach a compromise on one of the sticking points in stablecoin rewards programs. And Democratic lawmakers haven't been offered answers to a number of their core concerns, including the full staffing of regulatory commissions and the danger of conflicts of interest when senior government officials have deep business ties to crypto (most obviously, in their view, President Donald Trump).\nSenator Mark Warner, one of the leading Democratic negotiators on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which still needs a hearing in the banking panel, said there's still a big, bipartisan group working hard on the bill.\n\"We want to get this done,\" he said, signalling that Democrats haven't yet abandoned the talks. \"It's got to be done safely.\"\nHis primary concern is decentralized finance (DeFi) and preventing bad actors from using it for illicit purposes. Warner's views on this have, at times, shaken the industry and been seen as a threat to the future existence of DeFi projects. But the latest talks over the bill's treatment of illicit finance haven't yet settled on an approach.\n\"We've got to make sure that we don't set up a regime that allows bad actors or carves out enforcement,\" Warner said.\nA Republican lawmaker, Senator Bernie Moreno, commiserated with the SEC chairman, saying, \"Congress has failed miserably to give you laws.\"\nAtkins reiterated that his agency has \"pretty broad authority\" to write rules now that put crypto businesses on a clear regulatory foundation, as he's been trying to execute with his \"Project Crypto\" agenda. But, he said, the rules would need to have legislation \"undergird\" them.\n\"We do need, I believe, a good law coming out of Congress,\" Atkins said.\nRead More: The big U.S. crypto bill is on the move. Here is what it means for everyday users\nSo far, a similar version of the Clarity Act already passed the House of Representatives last year. And just last month, another version cleared the Senate Agriculture Committee in a party-line vote. However, when it comes time for the full Senate to vote on a final market structure bill, the industry will need at least seven Democr"

The huge unrealized losses could indicate that current price levels represent a bottom or less downside risk, per Santiment data.\nMeanwhile, Ethena's total value locked (TVL) has grown slightly above $7 billion since the beginning of the year, despite prices crashing, per DefiLlama data.\nIn the daily chart, the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.138 slopes lower and caps rebounds, keeping the short-term trend under pressure. Price remains beneath this gauge, and sustained closes below it preserve a bearish bias. Support is seen at $0.101, with resistance at $0.262 and $0.468.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 30 (near oversold) reflects subdued momentum with limited follow-through on bounces. The Stochastic (Stoch) near 31 shows tentative stabilization after prior extremes. A recovery above the 20-day EMA could ease selling pressure and open the door to a broader consolidation.

However, the token remains down nearly 50% from its yearly peak of $0.184 on January 11.\nDespite the large price drop, Polygon's TVL has held steady above $1 billion over the past month, meaning capital isn't leaving the chain, according to DefiLlama data.\nLoss realization also spiked slightly over the past week, climbing to about $40 million, per Santiment data.\nIn the daily chart, POL/USDT trades at $0.097. The 20-day EMA at $0.104 slopes lower and caps recovery attempts, keeping the short-term trend under pressure. Price remains below this average, which continues to restrain rallies. The RSI at 41, below the midline, reflects subdued momentum, while the Stoch near 40 has turned higher, hinting at tentative stabilization. Immediate resistance aligns at $0.168, while support is seen at $0.088.\nMomentum shows early improvement as the RSI and Stoch curl higher, but confirmation would require a daily close above the 20-day EMA to shift bias. A break above $0.168 could pave the way toward the next barrier at $0.212.

Away from speculation and toward infrastructure.\nWhy Private Blockchains Failed and Ethereum Won\nValmont noted that institutions first tried building on private and permissioned blockchains. She compared this to how enterprises built intranets before the public internet took over. The result was the same every time.\n\u201cLiquidity fragmented. Standards diverged. Network effects never fully materialized,\u201d she wrote.\nPublic blockchains fixed these issues. But institutions needed more than speed. They needed security, neutrality, and a track record under real stress with real money on the line. According to Valmont, Ethereum is the only programmable blockchain that has proven all three across a full market cycle.\nETF Approvals Changed the Math\nValmont said the approval of Ethereum ETFs and the resolution of proof-of-stake investigations removed a major barrier for institutional money.\n\u201cCapital does not move until uncertainty is reduced to an acceptable level,\u201d she stated.\nOnce that cleared, tokenization on public blockchains went from experimental to competitive.\nEthereum as \u201cFinancial Middleware\u201d\nValmont described Ethereum not as a standalone asset but as \u201cfinancial middleware.\u201d A neutral base layer where different institutions, protocols, and products can operate without one entity running the system.\nShe laid out the progression: stablecoins proved the model. Tokenized treasuries confirmed it. Funds are now connecting traditional asset management with blockchain-based settlement.\nThe Data Backs It Up\nEthereum currently holds around 68% of all DeFi total value locked. And just yesterday, BlackRock listed its $2.2 billion BUIDL tokenized Treasury fund on Uniswap and bought UNI tokens. That marks the world\u2019s largest asset manager stepping directly into DeFi infrastructure built on Ethereum.\nAs Valmont put it, \u201cInfrastructure shifts rarely announce themselves loudly. They tend to happen quietly and then all at once.\u201d"

The event was held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre alongside the broader Consensus Hong Kong conference.\nThe combined gathering brought together founders, institutional representatives, policymakers, and blockchain developers, underscoring Hong Kong\u2019s role as a regional hub and an established meeting point for Web3 and blockchain innovation across the Asia-Pacific region.\nBYDFi at Solana Accelerate APAC in Hong Kong\nSolana Accelerate APAC convened the Solana community and broader crypto ecosystem around the future of internet capital markets and onchain innovation, set against the backdrop of a global financial center known for clear frameworks and active market participation. BYDFi\u2019s participation marked a first, deeper step into Solana-focused programming and community dialogue. Discussions also reflected ongoing market focus on crypto regulation in Hong Kong and crypto licensing in Hong Kong.\nDuring the event, the BYDFi team was on site to meet attendees, share product context, and distribute limited merchandise, including Newcastle United co-branded items as part of BYDFi\u2019s ongoing brand collaboration with the club. The booth saw strong foot traffic throughout the day.\nWhat BYDFi Is Sharing in Hong Kong\nBYDFi used the event to share how a CEX + DEX dual-engine approach can support clearer participation across venues and workflows, particularly for users who want both centralized liquidity and onchain discovery in one connected experience.

These include over 1:1 Proof of Reserves with periodic public reporting, an 800 BTC Protection Fund, and 24/7 multilingual customer support with timely responses across official channels, including social media.\nWhy This Matters for BYDFi and the Solana Ecosystem\nSolana Accelerate APAC brought ecosystem builders and market infrastructure discussions into the same orbit. BYDFi\u2019s participation centered on two goals: listening closely to Solana-native users and teams, and exploring deeper collaboration opportunities that can strengthen product coverage, user experience, and market access as the crypto market continues to mature.\nMichael, Co-Founder and CEO of BYDFi, said: Solana Accelerate APAC creates the right setting for practical conversations between builders, market participants, and policymakers. BYDFi joined to learn, connect, and contribute in a way that holds up over time.

                "body": "Best Solana Ecosystem Presales: $IONX Chain Outshines 2026's Top Solana Contenders\nIn the fast-growing Solana ecosystem, finding the best Solana presales can feel overwhelming for new investors. With so many projects launching every week, it's natural to wonder which ones have the real potential to deliver meaningful returns. From my years of following blockchain trends, I've learned that the top Solana presales succeed when they combine strong technology, practical utility, and genuine community support. Right now, the IONIX Chain presale is standing out among the best Solana presales and top Solana presale gems, offering an AI-powered Layer 1 blockchain that addresses key challenges in speed and cost. For American beginners exploring Solana presale opportunities or high potential Solana presales, this guide will walk you through the landscape and explain why IONIX is frequently ranked among the best Solana presale projects for 2026. To learn more and join the presale, visit the official website at https://ionixchain.com/.Let's start with the basics so everyone is on the same page. Solana presales are early funding rounds where projects sell tokens at discounted prices to raise capital for development. These are often listed on the Solana presale list or Solana presale calendar, and they give investors a chance to get in before tokens are available on exchanges. Solana's fast and low-cost network makes it a popular choice for new launches, which is why so many upcoming Solana presales focus on DeFi, gaming, and AI applications. In early 2026, the Solana ecosystem has seen billions in presale funding, with investors looking for the best Solana ICOs and Solana presale investments that combine speed with real utility.\nWhat sets the best Solana presales apart? Strong fundamentals, a clear roadmap, and technology that solves real problems. Many Solana presale gems focus on memes or simple DeFi, but the ones that last offer more. IONIX Chain is gaining attention as one of the best Solana presales because it's not just another token on the network - it's a Layer 1 blockchain built to work alongside Solana and other chains. It uses artificial intelligence to achieve over 500,000 transactions per second with fees as low as $0.0005. For beginners, this means a network that can handle high-volume applications without the congestion that sometimes affects even Solana during peak times. Think of it as a smart expressway that adjusts lanes in real time to keep traffic flowing smoothly.\nTokenomics are one of the first things investors check when reviewing the best Solana presale projects. IONIX's $IONX token has a fixed supply of 2.15 billion, allocated to support long-term growth: 20% for the public presale to encourage broad participation, 17% for treasury to fund development, 15% for ecosystem incentives like developer grants, 10% for the team with vesting periods, 10% for marketing, 10% for liquidity, 8% for private sales, 5% for advisors, and 5% burned at launch to create scarcity. This balanced structure is common among high potential Solana presales because it helps maintain value as the project grows.\nAs of February 12, 2026, the IONIX Chain presale has raised over $74 million and is now in Stage 52, with tokens priced at approximately $0.135. That's still well below the expected $2.00 listing price on major exchanges in Q2 2026. In the broader market, with the crypto cap at around $4 trillion, Bitcoin near $104,000, and Solana itself at $180, projects that bring new infrastructure to the Solana ecosystem are drawing serious interest. Analysts from CryptoRank and 99Bitcoins have highlighted IONIX as one of the best Solana presales to buy, noting its AI features and cross-chain capabilities as reasons it could outperform many Solana presale gems.\nWhy is IONIX outshining other top Solana contenders in 2026? Its utility goes beyond the typical Solana presale opportunities. In decentralized finance, the high speed and low fees make lend"

                "body": "US stock futures steadied early in the Asian session on Friday, February 13, after facing heavy selling pressure in the previous session. The market focus now shifts from concerns about AI-related spending and disruption to US inflation and the Fed.\nThis week, US labor market data cooled expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. However, the US CPI report will likely have a greater influence on the Fed\u2019s policy stance, given Fed Chair Powell\u2019s concerns about elevated inflation.\nSofter US inflation, rising bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, would support a medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.\nUS futures edged higher during the Asian session on February 13. The Dow Jones E-mini climbed 30 points, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini advanced 28 points and 6 points, respectively.\nNotably, the broader Asian indices were in the red, limiting the gains across US stock futures. The Nikkei 225 fell 0.88% in early trading, pressured by yen strength, following the USD/JPY pair\u2019s drop below 153. Rising bets on multiple Bank of Japan rate hikes contributed to increased buying interest in the yen.\nExpectations of multiple Fed rate cuts and multiple BoJ rate hikes signal narrowing US-Japan rate differentials, favoring the yen. Crucially, narrowing rate differentials make yen carry trades into US assets less profitable, raising the risk of a carry trade unwind as seen in mid-2024.\nLater on Friday, the US CPI report will influence sentiment toward the Fed\u2019s policy stance. Economists expect the annual inflation rate to fall from 2.7% in December to 2.5% in January. Furthermore, economists forecast core inflation to ease from 2.6% in December to 2.5% in January, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nSofter-than-expected inflation figures would likely boost expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. While a more dovish Fed rate path would increase risks of a yen carry trade unwind, lower borrowing costs would have a longer-term positive effect on demand for US stock futures. For context, lower borrowing costs can boost profitability and stock valuations, overshadowing the short-term effects of a yen carry trade unwind.\nBeyond the data, traders should closely track comments from FOMC members. Views on the labor market, the inflation data, and monetary policy will influence risk sentiment.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a March Fed rate cut fell from 23.2% on February 5 to 8.9% on February 12. Meanwhile, the chances of a June cut dropped from 75.0% to 64.6%. Market sentiment toward the Fed\u2019s policy outlook remains a key driver for US stock futures.\nDespite Friday morning\u2019s gains, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini traded below their 50-day EMAs, while holding above their 200-day EMAs. The EMA positions indicated a bearish near-term, but bullish longer-term outlook. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones E-mini remained above its 50-day and 200-day EMAs, signaling a bullish bias that aligns with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on US economic data, central bank rhetoric, earnings, and geopolitical tensions. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook remains cautiously bullish. Meanwhile, ongoing expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut reinforce the bullish medium-term outlook. These positive fundamentals align with longer-term technicals for US stock futures.\nHowever, several scenarios would challenge the bullish medium-term outlook, including:\nIn summary, lingering bets on multiple Fed rate cuts, strong corporate earnings, and a cautiously hawkish BoJ reaffirm the medium-term outlook for US index futures. Multiple Fed rate cut bets remain hinged on lower rates in H1 2026. January\u2019s US CPI report will be key for market trends.\nDespite the ongoing risk of yen carry trade unwinds, US stock futures are likely to target new highs if the F"

This comes in the context of ongoing concerns about the UK economy\u2019s growth, which remains tepid at 0.1%. The recent announcement of Schroders\u2019 acquisition by Nuveen has garnered attention, although stocks like Unilever and British American Tobacco (BAT) have faced setbacks.\nFTSE 100 Performance and Notable Stocks\nOn this trading day, BP shares dropped by 2.9%, while Unilever and BAT each fell over 1%. This drop contributed to the FTSE 100\u2019s overall performance, which is now seen in the red.\nSchroders Acquisition\nIn a significant move, Schroders PLC has accepted a \u00a39.9 billion cash takeover offer from the US-based investment firm Nuveen. Shareholders of Schroders are set to receive \u00a3612 per share, reflecting a robust 29% premium over the stock\u2019s closing price prior to the announcement. This acquisition is expected to position Nuveen as one of the largest active asset managers globally.\nBank of England\u2019s Perspective on Rate Cuts\nBank of England official Sarah Breeden has indicated that a rate cut might be on the horizon. The upcoming policy meetings are scheduled for March 19 and April 30. Breeden suggested that a reduction in rates could occur if the economy evolves as anticipated, despite some risks associated with inflation and business activity.\nEconomic Outlook and GDP Growth\nThe UK economy\u2019s lackluster growth remains concerning. The gross domestic product (GDP) increased by just 0.1% in the last quarter of 2025, raising alarms about future economic prospects. Analysts suggest that political instability and changes in leadership could pose significant risks to economic stability, with potential impacts on gilt yields and borrowing costs.\nImpact of Political Instability\nAccording to RSM UK chief economist Thomas Pugh, the odds of leadership change have escalated from approximately 50% to nearly 70%. Such changes could induce policy uncertainty, leading to increased borrowing costs and potential tax adjustments that could further affect consumer confidence.\nOutlook for Major Companies\n- Unilever: Reported underlying sales growth of 3.5%, but operating profit fell 1.1%. The company aims for a sales growth target of 4% to 6% for 2026.\n- British American Tobacco (BAT): Announced an increased share buyback program worth \u00a31.3 billion, contrasting with lower growth expectations for the upcoming year.\nWith these developments, the performance of the FTSE 100 and major players like Unilever and BAT illustrates the volatile nature of the current market, shaped by both economic indicators and political dynamics.

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic high-tension mode: not in a euphoric moonshot, but also far away from panic lows. Think controlled volatility, sharp intraday swings and a market that keeps faking both bulls and bears with sudden reversals. The index is hovering in a wide battle zone where every ECB headline or macro data point can flip the narrative from cautious optimism to renewed fear in minutes.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh YouTube breakdowns of DAX 40 setups and levels\n- Scroll Instagram moodboards of German blue chips and Euro-market hype\n- Swipe through viral TikTok clips on DAX day-trading strategies\nThe Story: The DAX 40 right now is the purest reflection of Europe\u2019s identity crisis: a rich export machine stuck between weak growth, tough energy costs and a central bank that is terrified of both inflation and recession.\nAt the core of the current move is the European Central Bank. Under Christine Lagarde, the ECB has tried to engineer a soft landing: fighting inflation without completely crushing already-fragile economies like Germany. Traders are constantly gaming the same question: has the ECB done enough, or will it be forced to pivot harder and faster?\nHere\u2019s why this matters for the DAX:\n- ECB rates vs. DAX valuation: Higher rates compress valuation multiples, especially for growth and tech names like SAP. Every hint of a pause or a more dovish tone from Lagarde acts like oxygen for German equities, driving a relief bid into the index.\n- ECB tone vs. Euro/USD: When the ECB sounds more hawkish than the Fed, the euro tends to strengthen against the dollar. A stronger euro can hurt big German exporters (think autos, industrials, chemicals) because their products become more expensive internationally. Weak euro = tailwind for DAX exporters. Strong euro = pressure.\n- Policy uncertainty: Markets hate \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d messaging. Any ambiguity in ECB statements can trigger intraday spikes in volatility as algos and human traders adjust their rate expectations on the fly.\nSo the DAX is essentially trading as a leveraged bet on how hard and how fast the ECB will move over the next quarters. If inflation continues to cool and growth stays weak but not disastrous, that cocktail is bullish for equities: lower rate pressure, better multiples, and potentially a friendlier euro for exporters.\nOn top of this, global flows matter. When Wall Street starts pricing a slowdown in the US, big institutions often rotate some exposure into Europe, hunting for \u201cvalue plays\u201d in quality names like Siemens, Allianz, or SAP. That rotation can quietly lift the DAX even when domestic German headlines look depressing.\nDeep Dive Analysis: Now let\u2019s zoom in on the split personality inside the index: old-economy autos under pressure vs. high-quality tech and industrial names trying to carry the flag.\n1. The Auto Sector: From Hero To Headache\nGermany\u2019s flagship brands \u2013 Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz \u2013 used to be the undisputed backbone of the DAX story. Today, they are more of a stress test for investors\u2019 risk appetite.\n- EV transition pain: Margins on electric vehicles are thinner, competition from Tesla and Chinese brands is brutal, and legacy manufacturers are stuck juggling huge capex needs with shareholder expectations for dividends and buybacks.\n- Global demand uncertainty: Slowing growth in China and patchy demand in Europe make it harder to forecast earnings. Any weak guidance from autos quickly spills over into the whole DAX because of their weight and symbolic role.\n- Regulation & emissions: Stricter EU rules k"

Price action is hovering in a critical zone where every candle screams indecision: not a euphoric breakout, not a total meltdown, but a nervy, choppy range where both bulls and bears are getting whipped. German blue chips are oscillating between hopeful recovery and macro fear, and the index keeps teasing traders with fake-outs rather than clean trends.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh DAX 40 breakdowns from real traders on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest German stock market vibes on Instagram\n- Swipe through viral DAX trading setups on TikTok\nThe Story: Right now, the DAX 40 is not trading in a vacuum. It is the ultimate mashup of ECB policy, a fragile German economy, and global risk appetite.\nECB & Christine Lagarde: Why the DAX moves when she speaks\nThe European Central Bank is the invisible hand behind every major DAX swing. When markets sense that Christine Lagarde and her colleagues are done with aggressive tightening and are shifting toward a softer, more cautious stance, European equities get a boost. Cheaper money means easier credit for German corporates, better refinancing conditions, and a friendlier environment for growth-driven names like SAP or Siemens.\nBut here is the catch: inflation might be cooling, yet it is not dead. That keeps the ECB trapped between two nightmares:\n- Cut too early: risk a renewed inflation flare-up and a credibility hit.\n- Stay tight for too long: crush already fragile growth in Germany, which is flirting with stagnation.\nThe DAX 40 is reacting to every nuance:\n- Dovish tones or hints of future cuts: German bulls wake up, risk assets get a relief rally, and the index tends to grind higher.\n- Hawkish remarks or renewed inflation fears: sellers reappear, profit taking hits exporters and cyclicals hard, and the DAX slips back into defensive mode.\nEuro vs. USD: The silent driver of German multinationals\nFor the DAX, the EUR/USD pair is like a second heartbeat. Most of Germany\u2019s export champions sell globally but report in euros. That means:\n- Softer euro: exports become more attractive, earnings get a translation boost, and the DAX tends to find a tailwind.\n- Stronger euro: margins feel the pressure, especially in autos, industrials, and chemicals, and the index can lag Wall Street even when global risk is healthy.\nWith the Federal Reserve and the ECB moving at slightly different speeds in their policy paths, currency swings are fueling additional volatility. Every shift in expectations around the Fed vs. ECB rate path is indirectly repricing German equities. Traders watching the DAX without watching EUR/USD are basically playing with one eye closed.\nMacro Reality Check: Germany\u2019s Manufacturing & Energy Hangover\nGermany\u2019s brand has always been: build high-quality stuff, sell it to the world. That model is under pressure.\nRecent manufacturing PMI readings for Germany have been signaling weakness, often stuck in contraction territory. That means factories are not humming; they are running cautiously, sometimes at reduced capacity. Global orders are softer, and uncertainty about growth in China and other key markets is hitting sentiment. When PMI remains downbeat, the DAX tends to struggle whenever it leans too heavily on industrials, autos, and cyclical names.\nAdd to that the lingering impact of higher energy prices. While the extreme panic of the initial energy shock has faded, power and gas costs remain structurally less comfortable than in the old pre-crisis world. For energy-intensive German"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in full focus again, grinding in a tense zone where every candle feels like a vote on the future of the German economy. This is not a sleepy sideways market \u2013 it is a nervous, headline-driven battlefield where breakouts get faded and dips get hunted by opportunistic bulls. With ECB policy in play, energy costs lurking, and autos under pressure, the German index is moving in powerful swings rather than calm trends.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Dive into fresh YouTube DAX 40 breakdowns from real traders\n- Scroll the latest Instagram buzz on German stock market trends\n- Watch viral TikTok plays and DAX trading strategies in real time\nThe Story: The DAX 40 is currently trading in a zone where both risk and opportunity are elevated. Macro headlines and central bank expectations are steering intraday sentiment, while longer-term players are quietly positioning for whether Germany is heading into a deeper slowdown or staging a stealth comeback.\nAt the core of the story is the European Central Bank and its fight with sticky inflation versus a fragile growth backdrop. Christine Lagarde and the ECB have been walking a tightrope between keeping financial conditions tight enough to control inflation and not choking off an already weak Eurozone economy \u2013 with Germany, the DAX heavyweight, as the main casualty if they overdo it.\nEvery ECB meeting, every speech from Lagarde, and every surprise in inflation data is immediately reflected in the DAX:\n- When the market prices in easier policy, German blue chips often catch a strong relief rally as discount rates fall and growth stocks like SAP, tech names, and industrials get bid up.\n- When the tone shifts back to hawkish \u2013 talk of staying restrictive for longer or warning about wage pressures \u2013 the index tends to see sharp risk-off moves, with financials and cyclicals getting hit first.\nThe Euro/USD pair is the second pillar of this whole game. A weaker euro often acts like a hidden stimulus for the DAX, especially for export-heavy giants such as Siemens, SAP, and the big industrial and chemical players. When the euro drifts lower against the dollar, German exporters suddenly look more competitive on global markets, and that optimism is quickly priced into the DAX.\nFlip it around: a stronger euro and tighter ECB stance can act like a brake. Profit margins get squeezed, global demand looks less juicy in euro terms, and international investors suddenly find Wall Street more attractive than Frankfurt. That is why FX and DAX traders are essentially locked in the same macro trade \u2013 watching the same ECB press conferences, the same US data, the same inflation prints, and constantly recalibrating their risk.\nOn top of central bank drama, earnings season is adding more fuel to the volatility. SAP and Siemens are often the stabilizers, delivering relatively solid numbers and forward guidance that reassure tech and industrial bulls. But then you have the troubled corners: autos, cyclical manufacturing, energy-sensitive sectors. One cautious outlook from a major German name and suddenly the whole index feels heavy again.\nThe end result: the DAX is not in a boring drift. It is in a dynamic, news-driven phase where both bulls and bears can win \u2013 if they respect the macro triggers and avoid fighting the bigger flows.\nDeep Dive Analysis: The Automotive Sector Crisis, PMI Pain, and Energy Headwinds\nThe German auto industry is still the key emotional driver for DAX sentiment. Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes are not just stocks \u2013 they are symbols of German industrial powe"

Investors also looked ahead to Friday\u2019s inflation reading for clues on rate-cut bets, which were already dampened by a strong January jobs report.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell roughly 1.3%, or over 650 points, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell over 2%.\nGold (GC=F) futures sank 3%, while bitcoin (BTC-USD) also declined to around $65,000, as investors went risk-off.\nThe mixed picture comes as investors search for clues to the sectors vulnerable to AI disruption, which spurred the recent meltdown in software stocks. Trucking and logistics and real estate services stocks were the latest to get hit over concerns that artificial intelligence will impact those industries.\nMeanwhile, Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 12% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout. Nvidia (NVDA) stock also fell, while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steep losses \u2014 Apple falling around 5%.\nMeanwhile, attention is starting to turn to Friday\u2019s Consumer Price Index report. A softer reading will build hopes that price pressures are easing while economic growth remains intact.\nBefore then, the weekly reading on jobless claims \u2014 which showed a smaller decline than expected \u2014 came in focus after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January. The strength in hiring complicates expectations for Fed policy. A resilient labor market, paired with sticky inflation, is seen as reducing the likelihood of near-term interest-rate cuts \u2014 a key driver of recent equity gains.\nElsewhere on the earnings front, McDonald\u2019s (MCD) shares nudged higher after the burger giant's earnings beat. Looking ahead, Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are highlights on Thursday's docket, all due after the market close.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 20 updates- Ines Ferr\u00e9\nStocks, crypto, gold sink as investors go risk-off, AI disruption fears grow\nStocks fell on Thursday, retreating with the broader market as investors shifted to a risk-off stance amid fears that AI-driven disruption could ripple across industries from software to trucking and logistics.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell roughly 1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell nearly 2%.\nTechnology stocks led the declines as concerns that AI would upend the software industry spread to other sectors, including trucking, logistics, and real estate services.\nGold (GC=F) futures sank 3% while bitcoin (BTC-USD) also declined to $65,000 per token.\nThe move lower comes ahead of Friday\u2019s inflation report, which is expected to provide clues about what steps the Federal Reserve may take at its next policy meeting.\n4,978.20 +29.80 (+0.60%)As of 1:38:21 a.m. EST.

Renewed concerns over technology sector profits saw the Nasdaq 100 lead the declines, with futures down -1.9% at the time of writing.\nCisco (CSCO) shares plunged more than -13% after posting lower-than-expected margins, squeezed by surging RAM prices.

Earlier in the week, I noted that Dow Jones futures looked tired above 50k, the S&P 500 was struggling near its cycle highs, and the Nasdaq 100\u2019s rebound had faltered within its own messy range.\nIn a separate video, I outlined my preference for the Nasdaq 100 to lead any downside move should a bout of risk-off emerge \u2014 which is precisely what has unfolded.\nSource: TradingView, CME\nS&P 500 Futures (ES) Technical Analysis\nBulls repeatedly made hard work of a breakout above 7,000, with a series of low-volatility candles printing upper wicks and forming a lower high around that key level. With a clear break below 6,900, bulls are now clinging to the 100-day EMA for support \u2014 a break beneath it brings the February low (6,750.5) into focus.\nNasdaq 100 Futures (NQ) Technical Analysis\nWhile the Nasdaq 100 also printed low-volatility candles near resistance, its lower high formed considerably further below its record high relative to the S&P 500. Bulls attempted \u2014 but failed \u2014 to reclaim the 100-day EMA from below, with bearish momentum ultimately prevailing.\nGiven the Nasdaq 100 has led the downside move during this bout of risk-off, it remains my preferred short bias of the three, bringing the 200-day EMA (24,451) and cycle lows just above 24,000 into focus.\nDow Jones Futures (YM) Technical Analysis\nThe Dow Jones remains the leader of the pack, which in my view makes it less attractive for bears during pullbacks. It retains a clearly bullish trend structure on the daily chart, making it a market to monitor for potential long setups \u2014 should evidence of a swing low emerge.\nIdeally, we want to see all three indices confirm one another, but for now I assume the Dow woul"

City leaders could fight back.\nCongress' repeal of a D.C tax bill could cost the city more than $600 million in revenue.\nCongress' repeal of a D.C tax bill could cost the city more than $600 million in revenue.\nD.C. residents infamously suffer taxation without representation, but congressional Republicans have now ensured that even the taxation part of that second-class reality won\u2019t be easy.\nThe Senate on Thursday passed a resolution repealing a tax bill approved by the D.C. Council, following a similar vote in the House last week. The measure \u2014 which city officials say could lead to chaos for local taxpayers \u2014 heads next to President Donald Trump, who has indicated that he will sign it.\nThe move represents only the fifth time in D.C.\u2019s 50 years of home rule that Congress has repealed a local law, and the first time it has targeted local legislation setting tax policy for the city\u2019s residents.\nLate last year, the council passed a law decoupling the city\u2019s tax code from 13 provisions of the federal tax code that were changed by Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill, the massive tax-cut package approved by Congress. The move stopped some of the tax cuts \u2014 those exempting some tips and overtime work from taxation \u2014 from applying under the local tax code, which officials said would have cost an estimated $600 million in lost revenue over four years.\nInstead, the council repurposed some of that revenue to expand the city\u2019s match for the Earned-Income Tax Credit and to create a new Child Tax Credit, a decision that advocates say could benefit moderate- and low-income residents and families in the city.\nThe council\u2019s decision to decouple wasn\u2019t an outlier; at least a dozen states have similarly done so, but only in D.C. can Congress overrule such decisions. (Virginia and Maryland are among the states that chose to decouple.)\n\u201cThe elected representatives of D.C. looked at the big economic challenges\u2026 and they decided to shore up the city\u2019s fiscal health and bring down poverty at the same time. Who are you to overrule them?\u201d argued Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) during a debate on the Republican resolution on Wednesday evening.\nBut Republicans countered that D.C. lawmakers were denying residents and businesses the benefits of some of Trump\u2019s tax cuts, forcing them to step in.\n\u201cCongress is D.C.\u2019s legislative body,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott (R-Florida). \u201cThis means we have a constitutional responsibility to fight for those living here just like any legislature should fight for people living in their state.\u201d (Though unless Scott moves to Florida Avenue, there\u2019s no way for D.C. residents to vote for or against him.)\nStill, some uncertainty remained on Thursday as to the fate of the Republican effort to repeal D.C.\u2019s tax bill. Earlier in the day, Council Chairman Phil Mendelson contested whether or not Congress had acted in time, posting a document on the council\u2019s website indicating that the 30-day period that Congress had to repeal the bill had actually ended on Wednesday night \u2014 before the Senate voted. (Every bill passed by the council heads to Congress for a 30-day review, or 60 days if it involves changes to the city\u2019s criminal code.)\nAccording to Mendelson\u2019s office, the bill was sent to Congress on December 30, thus kicking off the 30-day review period \u2014 which would have ended on February 11. But the bill didn\u2019t appear in the official congressional record until January 7, when some congressional officials say the actual 30-day countdown begins.\nThe last time this was a point of contention was in 2023, when Mendelson and Republicans feuded over the 30-day congressional review period on a bill allowing non-citizens to vote in local D.C. elections. (The bill became law.) Later that same year, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb sided with Mendelson\u2019s interpretation, arguing that the law \u201cunambiguously\u201d says that the 30-day countdown starts as soon as the council sends a bill over to Capitol Hill.\nBut a"

What made the move unusual is that these assets often don\u2019t climb together \u2013 a stronger yen can hurt exporters, while rising bond prices usually point to softer growth expectations. The yen\u2019s jump also came as officials warned against excessive currency swings, language tra..\nders watch for potential intervention. Still, signs of froth are building: momentum indicators are flashing \u201coverbought,\u201d and some strategists are warning that a quick run higher can invite profit-taking.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Earnings are starting to matter more than the index.\nBig headline gains can hide a widening gap between winners and losers. Companies with improving outlooks have been rewarded, while firms that disappoint are getting punished \u2013 a pattern that often shows up when valuations look stretched. That makes upcoming results from heavyweight growth names especially important for sentiment across Japan\u2019s tech-linked stocks.\nThe bigger picture: Policy hopes are supporting risk assets but FX could complicate it.\nIf investors become more confident that spending and tax tweaks are coming, that can keep the \u201cJapan optimism\u201d trade alive.
