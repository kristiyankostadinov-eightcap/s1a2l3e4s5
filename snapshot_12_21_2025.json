                "body": "Precious metals continued their remarkable ascent Friday as gold and silver hovered near record territory, buoyed by American inflation data that reinforced expectations for additional interest rate reductions. The developments capped another strong week for metals that have captivated investors throughout a year of extraordinary gains.\nSpot gold traded near $4,330 per ounce by mid morning in London, positioning itself for a second consecutive weekly advance. Silver maintained its proximity to the record $66.89 level it established Wednesday, extending a rally that has seen both metals deliver their strongest annual performances since 1979.\nInflation reading shifts Fed calculus\nThursday\u2019s inflation report provided the catalyst for renewed precious metals enthusiasm. The core US consumer price index rose at its slowest pace since early 2021, offering ammunition to those anticipating lower borrowing costs ahead. Non yielding assets like gold and silver typically benefit when interest rates decline, making them more attractive relative to bonds and savings accounts that compete for investor dollars.\nHowever, complications cloud the inflation picture. A record six week government shutdown that concluded last month muddled the latest data, leaving economists uncertain about underlying price trends. The confusion adds another layer of difficulty to monetary policy decisions already fraught with political and economic crosscurrents.\nThe Federal Reserve delivered its third consecutive rate reduction last week but offered ambiguous guidance about future easing moves. Traders currently assign roughly 25 percent probability to a January rate cut, reflecting uncertainty about the central bank\u2019s next steps. President Donald Trump has publicly advocated for aggressive rate reductions throughout next year, adding political pressure to an already complex policy environment.\nGlobal monetary policy divergence emerges\nAsian markets provided a contrasting monetary policy narrative Friday. The Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest level since 1995, though officials declined to offer clear guidance about future tightening moves. The decision sent the yen lower against the dollar, illustrating how diverging central bank policies create currency volatility that often drives investors toward perceived safe havens.\nGeopolitical tensions have amplified gold\u2019s traditional appeal as a crisis hedge. Venezuela has emerged as a particular flashpoint after Trump ordered a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers off the country\u2019s coast. The move represents an escalation of pressure on Caracas coinciding with increased American military presence throughout the region, creating uncertainty that typically benefits precious metals.\nRecord breaking year approaches finale\nBoth gold and silver appear headed for their best annual performances in more than four decades. Silver has more than doubled in value while gold has jumped approximately two thirds, propelled by a combination of elevated central bank purchases and substantial inflows into bullion backed exchange traded funds.\nThe dual drivers appear likely to persist according to Goldman Sachs analysts including Daan Struyven. Their recent analysis suggests falling US interest rates have prompted ETF investors to compete with central banks for limited physical bullion supplies. The analysts anticipate that structurally high central bank demand combined with cyclical support from Federal Reserve rate cuts should lift gold prices further in coming months.\nCentral banks, particularly those in emerging markets, have dramatically increased gold reserves as they seek to diversify away from dollar denominated assets. This buying represents a structural shift rather than temporary speculation, providing sustained support for prices even during periods when other investors pull back.\nPlatinum joins the party\nPlatinum has emerged as another standout performer, more than doubling this year to trade a"

                "body": "Why gold is having its biggest year since 1979\nGold is having a gangbusters year \u2014 and that\u2019s typically a red flag about the state of affairs in the world.\nThis week, gold blew past $4,000 an ounce, and some on Wall Street are betting the rally is just getting started.\nWhen investors pile in to gold, it\u2019s not usually during good times, but when they feel like the world is on fire. It\u2019s long been the go-to safe haven during economic stress and worries about inflation.\nGold and stocks, both moving higher\nThe 2025 gains for the precious metal are historic, surpassing prior turbulent periods such as after the September 11 terror attacks, the 2008 financial meltdown or even the pandemic.\nGold is up 54% so far this year, on track for its best year since 1979, according to FactSet. Keep in mind that was a time when the United States was grappling with double-digit inflation and a full-blown energy crisis.\nWhat\u2019s unusual about today\u2019s gold spike is that it\u2019s coming in tandem with a booming stock market.\nCaptivated by the potential of artificial intelligence, investors have piled into a handful of Big Tech companies that are carrying the entire stock market higher.\n\u201cThe stock market and gold are marching to the beat of two very different drummers,\u201d said David Kotok, co-founder of investment firm Cumberland Advisors.\n\u2018Surging global demand\u2019\nThe gold rally reflects unease about the economy and lingering concerns about inflation, which has been stuck above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target for the past four and a half years. The United States has hiked tariffs to the highest level since the Great Depression, and Japan\u2019s incoming prime minister has endorsed lower interest rates and higher borrowing.\nGold has surged 5% so far this month as the US government shutdown leaves investors and Fed officials in the dark about the state of the economy by derailing major economic reports.\nAdvertisement\nAgainst this backdrop, investors are piling into an asset that isn\u2019t linked to a single government: gold.\n\u201cGlobal resilience has not yet been fully tested,\u201d Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, said in a speech on Wednesday. \u201cThere are worrying signs the test may come. Just look at the surging global demand for gold.\u201d\nOne of the biggest drivers of the rally in gold is the fact that the US dollar is having one of its worst years in decades.\nThe dollar\u2019s weakness has investors questioning the greenback\u2019s long-held status as a global safe haven.\nCentral banks around the world are also piling in to gold.\nThis gained traction after Washington and allies punished Russia for its invasion of Ukraine by freezing Moscow\u2019s assets held in the United States.\nThose sanctions raised further questions among foreign officials about where to keep their money.\nGoldman Sachs told clients this week gold will likely hit $4,900 by the end of next year. The Wall Street bank cited strong buying from central bankers, retail investors and looming rate cuts from the Fed.\nKen Griffin, the hedge fund billionaire who backed Trump in the last election, said this week it\u2019s \u201creally concerning\u201d that investors are starting to see gold as a safer bet than the US dollar.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing substantial asset inflation away from the dollar as people are looking for ways to effectively de-dollarize,\u201d Griffin told Bloomberg.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

                "body": "Gold\u2019s late-year rally has accelerated in December 2025, with spot prices holding firmly above the $4,200\u2013$4,300 zone as traders recalibrate expectations for US interest rates, the dollar, and global risk. In the space of a few sessions, the market has digested a Federal Reserve rate cut, a fresh warning from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) about \u201cexplosive\u201d price behavior in both US equities and gold, and a surge in silver that many analysts say is pulling precious metals higher as a complex. [1]\nSo what\u2019s the most realistic gold price forecast for the rest of December 2025\u2014and what would it take for XAU/USD to break to new highs or slip into a sharper pullback before year-end?\nWhere gold stands in mid-December 2025\nGold has spent the second week of December grinding higher and testing levels last seen in late October. On Friday, December 12, spot gold rose to about $4,293 per ounce after touching a seven-week high earlier in the session, while US gold futures settled around $4,328. [2]\nThat move followed a strong post-Fed reaction earlier in the week. On Thursday, December 11, Reuters reported spot gold up about 1.2% near $4,280, its highest level since October 21, with the US dollar sliding to an eight-week low\u2014conditions that typically support dollar-priced commodities like gold. [3]\nFrom a weekly-technical perspective, FXStreet\u2019s weekly note said gold added roughly 3% over the week, briefly flirting with the $4,350 area before settling around $4,330. [4]\nThe biggest December driver: the Fed cut rates\u2014by 25 bps, but with a split vote\nThe macro catalyst that mattered most for gold this month was the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy decision.\nOn December 10, the Fed cut the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50%\u20133.75%, while noting inflation \u201cremains somewhat elevated\u201d and emphasizing it would assess incoming data and risks when considering further moves. [5]\nImportantly for market psychology, the decision wasn\u2019t unanimous. The Fed statement shows three dissenters: one favored a larger 50 bps cut, while two preferred no change. That kind of split can increase uncertainty\u2014and uncertainty often helps keep safe-haven bids alive in gold. [6]\nFXStreet\u2019s coverage echoed the same core takeaway: the Fed delivered the widely expected 25 bps cut to 3.50%\u20133.75%, but the voting split and forward-looking uncertainty kept traders focused on what happens next rather than treating the move as \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d [7]\nWhy rate cuts matter for gold (and why this cut didn\u2019t end the debate)\nGold doesn\u2019t pay interest. That\u2019s why it often benefits when interest rates (and especially real yields) are falling, because the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of holding bullion declines.\nReuters\u2019 December 12 market wrap captured the current narrative: the Fed delivered its third quarter-point cut of the year, but signaled caution on further easing until more data arrives\u2014leaving traders to keep repricing the path of policy rather than locking in a single scenario. [8]\nThe result is a market that can still move sharply on each major data print\u2014because the direction of yields and the dollar can shift quickly if traders believe the Fed is done cutting, or conversely, if they see a faster easing cycle ahead.\nThe new complicating factor: BIS warns of \u201cexplosive\u201d behavior in gold and US equities\nIn the last few days, the most talked-about \u201crisk\u201d headline for gold hasn\u2019t been geopolitical\u2014it\u2019s been valuation and positioning.\nOn December 8, BIS published analysis noting that a statistical test frequently used to detect \u201cexplosive\u201d price behavior suggests both the S&P 500 and gold have entered \u201cexplosive territory\u201d in recent months\u2014something the BIS says has happened simultaneously only once in at least the last 50 years. [9]\nThe BIS also stresses a key nuance that matters for anyone using the \u201cbubble\u201d word too casually: even if a test detects bubble-like dynamics, it doesn\u2019t tell you when a correction might happen.

And I mean NOW!!!\u201d\nInternational energy traders have braced for massive disruptions following Iran\u2019s parliamentary vote to support the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a strategically important choke point for the world\u2019s oil supply.\nWithin hours after Saturday\u2019s attacks, roughly 50 oil tankers were seen scrambling to leave the strait between Iran and Oman, where roughly 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil and gas shipments pass through.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on it!\u201d energy Secretary Chris Wright responded to Trump\u2019s post. \u201cThanks to President Trump\u2019s leadership, America\u2019s energy security is stronger than ever before.\u201d\nU.S. crude oil futures surged by more than 6 percent to peak at $78 a barrel on Sunday \u2014 more than $1 higher than the price set at the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20.\nThe spike is likely to trickle down to gasoline prices as Americans prepare for a three-day Fourth of July weekend.\nAdvertisement\nIf there is a blockade, crude oil prices could soar as high as $120 or $130 per barrel, according to JP Morgan Chase analysts.\nThe White House is \u201cactively and closely monitoring this situation in the Strait of Hormuz and the Iranian regime would be foolish to make that decision,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News Sunday Morning Futures that Iran\u2019s closure would be \u201ceconomic suicide\u201d and a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d as he called on China to pressure Iran to avoid disrupting shipping lanes.\n\u201cIt would be, I think, a massive escalation that would merit a response, not just by us, but from others,\u201d Rubio said.\nTrump campaigned on lowering prices at the pump, repeatedly claiming that at gas prices should be \u201c$1.87\u201d \u2014 which would require a massive and extremely unlikely drop in crude oil prices.\nThe national average gas price for Trump\u2019s final week in office during his first term was $2.38 a gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Prices were averaging $3.12 per gallon when he returned to the White House.\nTrump claimed to have \u201ccompletely, totally obliterated\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear program in a series of missile strikes and bombings, marking explicit U.S. intervention into Israel\u2019s war that risks a wider international crisis.\nThe true extent of the damage remains unclear.

                "body": "Goldman Sachs has projected a significant decline in global oil prices in 2026, citing expectations of a sustained supply surplus and slower demand growth.\nIn its base-case forecast, the investment bank expects Brent crude to average around $56 per barrel in 2026, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is forecast to average approximately $52 per barrel. The outlook reflects Goldman\u2019s view that global oil markets will remain oversupplied as new production comes online and OPEC+ gradually unwinds production cuts.\nAccording to Goldman Sachs analysts, the projected surplus could reach around 2 million barrels per day through 2026. Rising output from non-OPEC producers, combined with weaker-than-expected global demand growth, is expected to exert downward pressure on prices.\nGoldman also warned that under more adverse conditions \u2014 such as a sharper global economic slowdown or a faster-than-expected removal of OPEC+ output restrictions \u2014 Brent crude prices could fall into the low $50s or even below $50 per barrel by late 2026. In a more extreme downside scenario, prices could drop into the $40 range, though the bank does not view this as its central case.\nDespite the bearish near-term outlook, Goldman Sachs maintains a more constructive long-term view. Analysts expect the oil market to tighten again after 2026 as years of underinvestment constrain future supply growth. Under this scenario, Brent crude prices could recover toward $80 per barrel by the latter part of the decade.\nOil prices have remained volatile in recent years, influenced by geopolitical tensions, shifting OPEC+ policies, and uncertainty surrounding global economic growth. Goldman Sachs emphasized that while the 2026 forecast reflects current fundamentals, changes in supply discipline or demand trends could alter the trajectory."

                "body": "Oil prices are limping into the final weeks of 2025 with Brent crude hovering just above $60 a barrel and traders fixated on one word: oversupply. As of Friday, December 12, Brent settled at about $61.12 per barrel and WTI at $57.44, both benchmarks down more than 4% for the week and sitting near their lowest levels in several years. [1]\nAt the same time, big agencies and Wall Street banks are rolling out fresh forecasts that increasingly point to sub\u2011$60 oil in 2026, even as OPEC insists the market will be roughly balanced next year. [2]\nThis article pulls together the latest December 2025 data, forecasts and analysis to sketch out a near\u2011term oil price forecast for December 2025, and what it might mean for 2026.\nWhere oil prices stand in mid\u2011December 2025\n- Spot prices:\n- Year\u2011to\u2011date performance:\nBrent has fallen roughly 18% in 2025 so far, while WTI is down close to 20%, as the market has steadily priced out the war\u2011driven risk premium of the early 2020s and refocused on swelling supply. [5] - Price levels vs recent history:\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that North Sea Dated crude (a physical benchmark related to Brent) averaged about $63.63 per barrel in November, its fifth monthly decline in a row and the longest losing streak in over a decade \u2014 effectively putting prices near four\u2011year lows. [6]\nIn short, December 2025 oil prices are weak, but not collapsing: Brent is holding around the low $60s, yet sentiment is sharply bearish because of what\u2019s happening in supply, demand and inventories.\nWhy the market has turned bearish going into December\n1. A supply surge colliding with only modest demand growth\nThe IEA\u2019s December 2025 Oil Market Report paints a clear picture:\n- Global oil demand is expected to rise by about 830,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and 860,000 bpd in 2026. [7]\n- But global oil supply is set to grow much faster \u2013 roughly 3 million bpd in 2025 and another 2.4 million bpd in 2026, driven heavily by non\u2011OPEC+ producers like the U.S., Brazil and Guyana. [8]\nThat imbalance is now showing up in stockpiles:\n- Observed global oil inventories hit around 8.03 billion barrels in October, the highest in four years, with stock builds averaging 1.2 million bpd in the first ten months of 2025. [9]\n- The IEA estimates the implied surplus at nearly 3.7 million bpd on average from Q4 2025 through 2026 \u2013 an unusually large overhang for this stage of the cycle. [10]\nThat\u2019s why recent IEA forecasts of a glut have become one of the main downward forces on prices this month.\n2. \u201cOil on water\u201d and the emerging \u201csuper glut\u201d narrative\nA big part of the story is where the barrels are sitting. The IEA highlights a surge in oil on water \u2014 crude in transit or temporarily floating \u2014 as sanctioned barrels struggle to find buyers and long\u2011haul shipments from the Americas to Asia jump. [11]\nPrivate\u2011sector and media analysis has picked this up and sharpened it:\n- A widely discussed Financial Times piece cites Trafigura\u2019s chief economist warning of a coming \u201csuper glut\u201d in 2026 as new supply projects ramp up while demand growth softens. He points to new output from Brazil and Guyana, cooling Chinese demand (partly due to EV adoption), and resilient U.S. supply. [12]\n- A detailed WRAL/FinancialContent analysis similarly describes a \u201csuper glut\u201d in crude, with non\u2011OPEC+ supply from the U.S., Brazil, Canada and Guyana consistently outpacing demand, while EV adoption and industrial slowdowns cap consumption. [13]\nTaken together, the narrative going into December is clear: there is simply too much oil around, and it\u2019s increasingly visible in both inventories and shipping data.\n3. Agencies now see lower average prices ahead\nThe latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Short\u2011Term Energy Outlook, released on December 9, 2025, explicitly bakes falling prices into its forecast: [14]\n- The EIA expects global oil inventories to keep rising through 2026, putting continuing downward pressure on prices.\n- It projects Brent cru"

Iran is also a major oil producer.\nCrude oil futures have gained about 10% since the conflict began, with a geopolitical risk premium of $12 baked into prices now, according to Goldman Sachs analysts in a Sunday note.\nAdvertisement\nGoldman Sachs analysts estimated that Brent oil prices could rise to a peak of around $90 a barrel if Iranian crude supply were to drop by 1.75 million barrels a day.\n\"If oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz were to drop by 50% for one month and then were to remain down 10% for another 11 months, we estimate that Brent would briefly jump to a peak of around $110,\" they wrote.\nThe Goldman analysts wrote they are still assuming no significant disruptions to oil and gas supply. They flagged risks to oil and gas prices.\n\"While the events in the Middle East remain fluid, we think that the economic incentives, including for the US and China, to try to prevent a sustained and very large disruption of the Strait of Hormuz would be strong,\" they wrote.\nOn Sunday, the Iranian parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against the US's action, although the final decision still lies with the country's top security officials, according to Iran's state-owned Press TV.\nThe developments are taking place amid the summer driving season when US gas demand peaks. Should the gains in oil prices be sustained, pump prices are likely to rise in the weeks ahead.\nThe price of gas typically rises by 2.4 cents per gallon when crude oil prices rise by $1, according to the Energy Information Administration. This translates into a gain of over 20 cents per gallon at current levels for oil futures.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

                "body": "What Trump's threatened 'blockade' on sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers means for gas prices\nOil prices jumped about 3% after Trump's threatened blockade.\nOil prices jumped about 3% after President Donald Trump this week threatened to blockade all sanctioned oil tankers traveling in and out of Venezuela.\nVenezuela, which has the largest known oil reserves in the world, exports hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil each day.\nThe threatened blockade risks a reduction of global oil supply and an amplification of geopolitical uncertainty -- both of which could further push up oil prices and, in turn, pinch drivers at the pump, some analysts told ABC News.\nBut, they added, the effect on prices will likely remain muted unless the conflict escalates significantly, since Venezuela accounts for less than 1% of global oil output and most of its oil is sold on the black market.\nHere's what to know about what the threatened U.S. blockade means for oil and gasoline prices:\nWhere does the blockade stand and how has Venezuela responded?\nOn Tuesday, Trump threatened what he called a \"blockade\" of all sanctioned oil tankers traveling in and out of Venezuela, ratcheting up pressure on the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose government depends in part on revenue derived from oil sales.\n\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" Trump wrote in a social media post. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before.\"\nA day later, Maduro said Venezuela would continue to trade oil, defying Trump's threat.\n\"Trade in and out will continue -- our oil and all our natural wealth that by the constitution and Bolivar's legacy belongs -- our wealth, our land, and our oil -- to its only legitimate owner, which for centuries and centuries has been our sovereign people of Venezuela,\" Maduro said on Wednesday, originally in Spanish.\nThe U.S. currently has 11 warships in the Caribbean -- the most in decades -- but even with an increased military presence, that would likely not be enough to put in place a blockade in the traditional sense, which involves sealing a country's coastline completely and would effectively have been a declaration of war.\nWhy has the threatened blockade pushed up oil prices?\nThe threatened blockade of sanctioned oil tankers drove up the U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures price -- a key measure of U.S. oil prices -- by about 3%, landing the price around $56.50 per barrel.\nThe measure had dropped to its lowest level since 2021 on Tuesday, just hours before Trump's announcement. The dip in prices stemmed from a glut of oil alongside relatively slow global economic growth, which has constricted demand for fossil fuels.\n\"Everybody and their grandmother is bearish on oil prices,\" Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, told ABC News.\nThe threatened blockade disrupted those price doldrums, at least to a minor degree, some experts said.\nVenezuela has exported about 749,000 barrels per day this year, with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler. That oil output amounts to less than 1% of global supply.\nThe news caused a \"knee-jerk reaction\" in oil markets due to heightened uncertainty tied to the U.S.-Venezuela conflict, Christopher Tang, a professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management who studies supply chains, told ABC News. A continued standoff could push oil prices up to around $65 or $70 per barrel, but they're unlikely to go much higher, Tang added.\n\"It's not going to go up to $100 a barrel,\" Tang said.\nWhat could the threatened Venezuelan oil blockade mean for gas prices?\nA jump in oil prices typically brings about an ensuing uptick in the cost of gasoline at the pump, some experts said, since crude oil makes up the key ingredient in auto fuel.\n\"The single most important price driver of gasoline is crude oil. As crude oil goes up, we expect gasoline to "

                "body": "EUR/USD December 2025: 1.17 Pullback Inside a 1.15\u20131.20 Bullish Range\nMacro divergence keeps EUR/USD tilted higher even as France adds noise\nEUR/USD has slipped back toward 1.1710\u20131.1740 after testing the 1.18 area, but the underlying macro structure is still EUR-positive. The ECB has frozen its key rate at 2.00% for a fourth meeting while raising its growth and 2026 inflation projections. Core Eurozone inflation is still around 3.1%, with services inflation pushing toward 4.2% and the ECB\u2019s Q3 negotiated wage tracker pointing to rising pay pressures. That combination makes another hike or a very long hold at 2.00% more likely than near-term cuts, keeping Euro yields and rate expectations relatively firm.\nOn the US side, the Fed has already cut by 25 bps, taking policy into a 3.50%\u20133.75% range, and weekly jobless claims hovering around 245,000 confirm a cooling labor market. November CPI at 2.7% year-on-year and core at 2.6% came in sharply below expectations, reinforcing the idea that 2026 will bring more Fed easing rather than a new tightening cycle. The policy gap is clear: the ECB is holding a 2.00% rate with upside risk, while the Fed has pivoted and is being priced for further cuts. That is the backbone of the medium-term uptrend in EUR/USD.\nFrench budget stress: why 1.1710\u20131.1730 in EUR/USD is political support, not a breakdown\nThe immediate catalyst for the latest dip in EUR/USD to around 1.1710 was France\u2019s announcement that Parliament will miss the year-end budget deadline, forcing a rollover law to carry the 2025 budget into next year. With French debt-to-GDP still above roughly 112% and memories of the sovereign crisis not far from traders\u2019 minds, any hint of fiscal dysfunction in a core Eurozone country hits the Euro first.\nHowever, so far the reaction is controlled, not a disorderly repricing. Price has drifted into a support band that multiple desks are watching: 1.1710 from the VT Markets move, the 1.1715\u20131.1730 shelf highlighted by intraday analyses, and the broader 1.1650\u20131.1685 zone that lines up with the 21-day EMA, a rising trendline, and prior resistance now turned support. As long as EUR/USD holds above roughly 1.1650 on a closing basis, the French story is headline risk inside a bullish structure, not a regime shift.\nOptions markets reflect this: one-month implied volatility has ticked up to about 7.8%, enough to reward straddle buyers but far from crisis pricing. That fits a scenario of noisy, exaggerated moves in thin year-end liquidity rather than a trend collapse.\nUS dollar side: DXY stuck around 98.50 despite \u201cbetter\u201d data and sentiment bounce\nThe US Dollar Index is grinding around 98.50 with a three-day winning streak, but the quality of that bounce is mediocre. Michigan Consumer Sentiment has improved from 51.0 to 52.9, slightly below the 53.4 forecast, and weekly jobless claims are still close to 236,000 even after a 13,000 drop from the prior revised level. The move in DXY looks more like a position clean-up into year-end than the start of a new USD bull leg.\nFor EUR/USD, that translates into consolidation rather than a clear reversal. Short-term flows can keep the pair capped under 1.18 when DXY spikes on light data days, but the macro backdrop \u2014 softer US inflation, a Fed already in cutting mode, and no near-term ECB cuts \u2014 still argues that the next big 500-pip move is more likely higher than lower.\nEvent risk map for EUR/USD into year-end: what can actually move the pair\nData is thinning into the holidays, but what remains is important for timing entries. US Q3 GDP second estimate around 3.8% on December 23 could give the dollar a short-term bid if growth surprises to the upside, but with CPI at 2.7% the narrative is more \u201cGoldilocks\u201d than overheating. ADP weekly employment data around the same time will be watched for renewed softening that would reinforce 2026 cut expectations and support EUR/USD on dips.\nFOMC minutes on December 30 are the key document. Markets will parse how broad the s"

These figures indicate the current state of the market concerning S&P 500 investments.\nElsewhere, the price of silver has reached new highs of $67.50. Gold prices have also increased, reaching $4,350 as it ignores the strong US dollar and bond yields.\nThe Currency Pair EUR/USD\nThe currency pair EUR/USD has rebounded, trading above 1.1730. Sentiments have improved in Wall Street, impacting the US dollar\u2019s recovery.\nGBP/USD remains below 1.3400 after the Bank of England cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

XRP targets a breakout above $2.00 alongside growth in ETF inflows.\nThere is analysis of broker options in 2025, accommodating various preferences and geographic regions. Recommendations include brokers with low spreads and high leverage.\nInvestment Risks\nFXStreet contains forward-looking statements and does not recommend buying or selling assets. Investment entails risks, and one should conduct thorough research before making decisions. The platform disclaims liability for errors or losses.\nThe massive shift in S&P 500 net positions, from -155.3k to a staggering -1.904M contracts, signals extreme bearishness from speculative traders. This represents the largest net short position we\u2019ve seen since the brief panic during the 2024 election cycle. We must consider that the market is positioned for a significant downturn heading into year-end.\nThis extreme positioning suggests we should expect heightened volatility in the coming weeks. The VIX has been climbing, recently breaking above 22 for the first time in the fourth quarter, up from an average of 18 in November. We see value in buying protective puts on major indices or using VIX futures to hedge long portfolios against a sudden drop.\nHowever, such a crowded short trade carries immense risk for the bears themselves. We remember the sharp rallies in early 2023 that were fueled by similar, though less extreme, pessimistic positioning. Therefore, buying cheap, out-of-the-money call options for late January could be a prudent, low-cost strategy to profit from a potential short squeeze.\nThe continued strength in gold, now consolidating near $4,350, reflects persistent inflation fears despite the Fed\u2019s hawkish stance through most of 2025. With the latest Core PCE data for November still holding at 3.1% year-over-year, the market believes the Fed\u2019s job is not yet done. We anticipate that traders will continue using gold call options and futures as a primary hedge against both inflation and equity market uncertainty.\nAs we enter the holiday season, trading volumes are expected to decline significantly. This thin liquidity can amplify price swings, meaning the massive S&P 500 short position could trigger a disproportionately large move on any news. We advise using carefully defined risk strategies, like credit or debit spreads, to avoid being caught on the wrong side of a sharp, low-volume move."

The Federal Reserve Has Reached Peak Rates And Markets Are Pricing Cuts, But The Final Stage Of Disinflation Is Proving Sticky, With US Inflation Still Above 2% And The Labour Market Only Slowly Cooling.

Such Price Action Usually Reflects A Mix Of Anxiety Over Growth And Expectations Of Lower Real Yields. In This Environment, Investors Prefer Gold And Cash Over High\u2013Beta Currencies, And Sterling Does Not Benefit Meaningfully, Keeping GBP/USD Capped Near 1.34.\nShort\u2013Term Technical Structure And Trading Levels\nFrom A Technical Angle, 1.3455\u20131.3470 Is The Immediate Resistance Band.

                "body": "By Ankur Banerjee and Rae Wee\nSINGAPORE, Dec 19 (Reuters) \u2013 A vague outlook from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda on Friday has given investors the nerve to add to their bets against the yen, which could soon put Japan\u2019s currency back at uncomfortably low levels for a government concerned it may already be too cheap.\nThese bets are particularly concentrated in euros and Australian dollars, dealers said, and grew after a well-telegraphed hike came with little sense of urgency to raise rates further.\nAfter the Bank of Japan took its benchmark rate to a three-decade high of 0.75% earlier in the day, Ueda told reporters future decisions would be data-dependent and made on a meeting-by-meeting basis, and he offered no new details about where Japan\u2019s neutral rate may lie.\nThat left investors feeling relaxed about so-called \u201ccarry\u201d positions, where they borrow yen cheaply and sell it to pay for income-earning assets elsewhere.\nIt\u2019s a potential headache for policymakers and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi because a falling currency raises the local prices of sensitive imports like energy and food, and it comes as concerns swirl over Japanese assets due to worries about the government\u2019s plans to borrow and spend.\nThe yen fell around 1% to 157 per dollar in the London session and skidded to a record low at 183.99 per euro, despite yields in Japan rising to new highs.\n\u201cWhile the market acknowledges more hikes could come, it\u2019s not fully buying into a fast or aggressive path,\u201d said Tareck Horchani, head of prime brokerage dealing at Maybank Securities in Singapore.\nHe said that shorting the yen against crosses avoids \u201cgetting tangled in USD dynamics\u201d and that the Aussie and South African rand offer attractive carry while the euro play is about policy divergence as Japan is only raising rates slowly.\nJapan\u2019s last rate hike was in January and, according to LSEG data, the next move is not fully priced in by traders until November 2026.\nData on speculative dollar/yen positioning was delayed by the U.S. government shutdown \u2013 and is still a little stale \u2013 but shows that a record long yen position amassed in April had collapsed by early December to reasonably close to neutral.\nBart Wakabayashi, branch manager at State Street in Tokyo, said clients were choosing to take yen views in other currencies, with overweight positions in Aussie/yen and euro/yen near their biggest in five years.\n\u201cI think that the yen will remain under pressure,\u201d he said.\nCARRY ON\nFriday\u2019s selling has the yen right back where it started the year and in a zone where domestic companies and Japan\u2019s government have been uncomfortable.\nLast month Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said the negative effects of yen weakness had started to become more pronounced than the positives, and as the dollar exchange rate neared 158 yen officials have repeatedly warned of possible intervention.\nA Tokyo Shoko Research poll published a week ago that surveyed more than 6,000 Japanese companies found that 41.3% felt the yen was too cheap and that domestic firms were looking for a rate around 133.5 per the dollar, roughly 18% stronger than current levels.\nTurning around a currency that has been sliding fairly relentlessly for five years is also likely to be a task beyond just the central bank, strategists said.\n\u201cThe weak yen is more of a delayed effect of the over-easing of the last 10 years, before Ueda stepped in, and it\u2019s really hard for Ueda to crack that just by a few hikes,\u201d said Naka Matsuzawa, Japan macro strategist at Nomura in Tokyo.\n\u201cWe need more messages coming from Takaichi or the government side,\u201d he said, on structural reform, deregulation and measures to drive growth and inbound investment.\nTo be sure, in the near term the finance ministry can sell dollars to stop yen falls and scare off speculators, but many analysts don\u2019t see that as a durable strategy \u2013 especially if the shift in tone that preceded the hike hasn\u2019t boosted the yen.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see a lot of signal or a continua"

                "body": "USD/JPY was up 220 pips on Friday and that's not what anyone in Japan wanted to see. As bad as that looks, the reality is worse.\nThe persistent strength of the US dollar against the yen since mid-year is increasingly problematic and Friday we might have hit a boiling point. That's because top Japanese officials did two things that would normally support the yen and the opposite happened. It highlights a market with abundant sellers that are unafraid.\nFirst, the Bank of Japan hiked rates to 0.75%. That's the highest in 30 years and though the move was widely (though not totally) expected, it still cuts down on the carry trade. Moreover, in the weeks leading up to the decision, as officials hinted that it was coming, it did nothing to stem the yen's fall. Now, we're just a half-cent below the November extremes.\nKeep in mind that the Federal Reserve cut US rates three times in the latter part of this chart and it led to little drag. It shows that the picture is worse than it appears and that may have prompted Friday surprise jump in USD/JPY.\nSecondly, Japanese finance minister Satsuki Katayama put out a rare statement late on Friday to say the ministry was alarmed over currency moves and 'will take appropriate action'. That's a strong hint at intervention and caused a rapid drop in USD/JPY to 156.94 from 157.34. However the market quickly concluded that buying the dip was the right trade and the move was wiped out in minutes.\nSo that's two strong actions from the BOJ and the Ministry of Finance that both fell flat. Not only that but the pair looks poised to closed at the highs of the day.\nZooming out at the USD/JPY chart, it doesn't look that bad. The November highs are still holding and the 2024 highs are more than 400 pips away. But notice the spike on the extreme left side of the daily chart. That was a level where the MoF intervened previously and they did again above 160.00.\nIt doesn't end there. The USD/JPY picture understates the weakness in the yen. If we pull up the EUR/JPY chart back to the inception of the euro, we can see the pair is at an all-time high and rapidly climbing. With a synthetic euro, we would need to go back to 1991 when the Japanese economy was in a much different place.\nGBP/JPY is also at a 30-year high.\nThere are some upshots to export competitiveness here but the brewing worry is imported inflation. Even worse, the cost of Japanese borrowing is rapidly rising. Thirty-year Japanese government borrowing costs are now at the highest in at least 30 years.\nThe 3.42% rate isn't high in absolute terms but it comes after a period where the Japanese government was able to finance its massive deficits for nearly nothing.\nAgain, the trajectory is also very problematic. At 4% it's likely to turn into a government crisis and that's something Katayama surely wants to head off, which is another reason to intervene.\nThis whole episode is also unfolding at an interesting time. From now through New Year is the least-liquid time of year in the forex market. That might be seen as an opportunity by Katayama with the potential to squeeze shorts by deploying less ammunition than usual. I would be very wary of holding USD/JPY longs over the next two weeks because of that."

                "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from $84,500 as the Bank of Japan raised interest rates on Friday, December 19, but signaled a cautious policy outlook. USD/JPY rallied 1.45% to close the session at 157.703, boosting yen carry trades into risk assets.\nHowever, the US BTC-spot ETF market saw net outflows in the week, leaving BTC below the $90,000 handle.\nDespite another choppy week, hopes for a Fed rate cut and easing concerns over a yen carry trade unwind indicate a bullish outlook.\nBelow, I consider the key drivers behind recent price trends, the short-term outlook, the medium-term trajectory, and the key technical levels traders should watch.\nThe US BTC-spot ETF market saw net outflows of $479.1 million in the reporting week ending December 19. Outflows for the week reversed inflows of $286.6 million from the previous week, weighing on sentiment.\nKey flow trends for the week included:\nDemand for US BTC-spot ETF flow trends remains key for the supply-demand balance. Outflows for the week left BTC down 0.20% for the current week despite Friday\u2019s BoJ-triggered 3.22% rally.\nUS BTC-spot ETF issuers have seen net outflows of $298.2 million in December, leaving BTC down 2.63% in the current month. November\u2019s net outflows of $3.47 billion sent BTC down 17.42% in the month.\nHowever, a more dovish Fed rate path, a resilient US economy, fading fears about a yen carry trade unwind, and progress toward crypto-friendly legislation support a bullish outlook.\nBlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was a talking point on Saturday, December 20, down 9.59% year-to-date. Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas commented on the ETF\u2019s ranking on the 2025 Flow Leaderboard, stating:\n\u201cIBIT is the only ETF on the 2025 Flow Leaderboard with a negative return for the year. CT\u2019s knee-jerk reaction is to whine about the return, but the real takeaway is that it was 6th place DESPITE the negative returns (Boomers putting on a HODL clinic). Even took in more than gold, which was up 64%. That\u2019s a really good sign long-term IMO. If you can do $25b in a bad year, imagine the flow potential in a good year.\u201d\nMarket intelligence platform Santiment also suggested a potential rebound based on social media trends, stating:\n\u201cFor both swing trading and long-term trading, prices typically follow the path that retail traders least expect. When there are expected price climbs, prices fall. When there are expected price falls, prices climb.\u201d\nSantiment shared a chart highlighting major fear across social media, signaling a rebound is more likely.\nThe Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index remains in the Extreme Fear zone. Extreme fear suggests that investors are overbearish, a potential buying opportunity. Crucially, a rebound would align with the bullish short- to medium-term price outlook.\nWhile analysts expect a price recovery, downside risks remain, including:\nThese scenarios would likely push BTC toward the November 21 low of $80,523.\nIn summary, the short-term outlook remains cautiously bullish as fundamentals outweigh the technicals. The medium- to longer-term outlook is constructive.\nDespite a recovery from the $80,000 handle, BTC remained below the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), signaling a bearish bias. However, fundamentals are beginning to diverge from the technical trend, suggesting a potential upswing.\nA breakout above the $94,447 resistance level would bring the 50-day EMA into play. A sustained move above the 50-day EMA would indicate a near-term bullish trend reversal, supporting a move toward the $100,000 psychological resistance level and the 200-day EMA. Significantly, a breakout above the EMAs would reinforce the bullish short- to medium-term price outlook.\nHolding above the $80,000 level would pave the way toward the upper trendline. A sustained move through the upper trend line would invalidate the bearish structure, affirming the bullish short-term (1-4 weeks) target of $95,000 and the medium-term (4-8 weeks) target of $100,000"

                "body": "Weekly Fundamental Crypto Outlook: Demand Remains Weak\nAlthough some cryptocurrencies attempted to recover value toward the end of the week, global macroeconomic dynamics have not allowed confidence to fully recover, and the weekly balance continues to point to a bearish bias on average over recent sessions. Part of this weakness can be explained by U.S. economic data, particularly employment and inflation, which have reintroduced a global environment of indecision and limited the recovery of risk assets, including the crypto market. As long as confidence fails to stabilize, dominant selling pressure may continue to shape the final market oscillations of 2025.\nDemand Continues to Show Weakness\nDuring the week, several key economic indicators were released that influence the outlook for the United States heading into next year. November employment data showed an NFP increase of 64,000 jobs, exceeding expectations of 51,000, while annual CPI surprised to the downside with a 2.7% reading, below the 3.1% forecast. This combination has generated indecision around the Federal Reserve\u2019s future stance, as softer inflation contrasts with a still-resilient labor market, potentially reintroducing inflationary pressures and limiting clarity around a sustained rate-cutting cycle in 2026.\nA lower interest rate environment typically supports risk assets by reducing borrowing costs and increasing liquidity. However, the current lack of macroeconomic clarity does not guarantee that the U.S. economy can sustain solid demand for cryptocurrencies in the short term. Adding to this uncertainty is the recent decision by the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates, reinforcing a more aggressive stance that could restore appeal to the bond market and divert demand away from assets such as cryptocurrencies, which do not offer fixed yields.\nThis global environment of indecision continues to weigh on Bitcoin demand, a dynamic also reflected in indicators such as Open Interest. While BTC ETF open interest showed a modest recovery toward the end of the week, reaching approximately $28 billion, it remains below levels observed in late November and early December. This suggests that position unwinding continues to pressure the market, limiting a sustained recovery in institutional demand.\nSource: Cryptoquant\nUnless more favorable macroeconomic conditions emerge or a meaningful catalyst directly benefits the sector, current uncertainty may continue to undermine confidence and open the door to additional selling pressure toward the end of 2025.\nBitcoin Versus Other Markets\nBitcoin has begun to show a loss of positive correlation with equity markets, particularly the S&P 500. The correlation coefficient has moved back toward neutral territory, indicating a lack of a clear relationship between the two markets over recent sessions. While the S&P 500 has managed to maintain a bullish bias near record highs, Bitcoin has posted mixed price action, pointing to greater relative weakness and failing to mirror the confidence seen in equities. It is important to note that correlation coefficients can change over time.\nSource: Data \u2013 TVC, StoneX, Tradingview\nThis suggests that confidence derived from recent economic data has primarily flowed into equity markets, rather than cryptocurrencies. In this context, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are not currently perceived as attractive risk assets compared to traditional markets, favoring a reallocation of capital flows toward equities. Unless a strong positive correlation with risk assets is restored, potential improvements in global economic confidence may not translate into meaningful support for the crypto market.\nConfidence Remains in Indecision\nThe Crypto Fear & Greed Index has posted another notable decline, hovering around 21 points and returning to the boundary between the \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cextreme fear\u201d zones. This behavior reflects a continued deterioration in short-term confidence across the crypto market.\nSource: Co"

                "body": "It's been nearly two years since the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were launched. In all, 11 new ETFs were approved by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), including ones from BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco, and Bitwise.\nTo say they've been successful would be a massive understatement. Collectively, they account for over $110 billion in assets under management, more than half of which comes from the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT +4.07%).\nBitcoin ETFs are an unusual case because there is structurally no difference between them. They all invest in spot Bitcoin. There's no selection methodology. There's no weighting strategy. They're functionally all the same.\nTo distinguish which Bitcoin ETF is better than another, you need to look at the details. For the most part, it comes down to cost -- which has the lower expense ratio and which has lower trading costs. Keeping the total cost of ownership as low as possible helps keep more returns in an investor's pockets.\nGiven those guidelines, here are the three spot bitcoin ETFs that I like for 2026.\nGrayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC +4.06%) has the best combination of low fees, tight spreads, and high liquidity.\nIt was designed to be the cheaper version of the much larger Grayscale Bitcoin ETF. That ETF maintained its 1.5% expense ratio when it was converted from a trust, making it easily the worst spot Bitcoin ETF of the group. Grayscale launched the Mini Trust ETF at just a tenth of the cost of its flagship ETF as a way to entice new retail buyers to its products without giving up the hefty revenue that GBTC has been bringing in.\nIts expense ratio of 0.15%, or $15 annually per $10,000 invested, is the cheapest within the spot Bitcoin ETF group. With about $3.6 billion in assets under management, this ETF is more than large enough to be highly liquid and tradeable throughout the day. Its minimal trading spread makes the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF the cheapest spot Bitcoin ETF in terms of total cost of ownership and the best option for retail traders to own.\nNYSEMKT: BTC\nKey Data Points\niShares Bitcoin ETF\nThe iShares Bitcoin ETF is the poster child for the spot bitcoin ETF category. It has more than $70 billion in assets and nearly crossed the $100 billion mark earlier this year during the big Bitcoin rally.\nThe ETF's 0.25% expense ratio is about average within this space and matches the fee charged by several other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Where it has its advantage is with liquidity and trading.\nIn terms of dollar volume, it trades nearly three times as much as all of the other spot Bitcoin ETFs combined. That makes spreads incredibly tight, creating a direct cost advantage with every trade. If you're a one-time buy-and-hold investor in a spot Bitcoin ETF, you may be better off with one of the funds carrying a lower expense ratio. If you're a more frequent trader, this ETF could be the better choice because the savings you'll see on trading spreads will likely outweigh the expense ratio deficit in just a few trades.\nNASDAQ: IBIT\nKey Data Points\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF\nI wrestled between the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC +3.99%) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF for the third spot on this list. The Bitwise ETF has the advantage on expense ratio (0.2% vs. 0.25%) and the trading spreads on both are pretty tight.\nNYSEMKT: FBTC\nKey Data Points\nUltimately, I decided to choose the greater liquidity of the Fidelity ETF over the lower expense ratio of Bitwise's option. Since their inception in January 2024, the performance of the two ETFs is virtually identical. As was the case in the earlier example, buy-and-hold investors might prefer Bitwise, while more frequent traders might do better with Fidelity.\nUltimately, it's probably splitting hairs. But remember that trading costs matter. It's not only the expense ratio that makes the difference. In many cases, just a few small details can give an ETF the advantag"

In a list of the top 25 funds by inflows, ranked first is Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO) with $145 billion, and ranked 25th is the iShares S&P 100 ETF (OEF) with $10 billion.\nOf the entire list of those top 25, noted Balchunas, IBIT is the only one with a negative return for the year \u2014 down 9.6% as of midday Friday. Even the SPDR Gold ETF (GLD) \u2014 in eight place with $20.8 billion \u2014 took in less money than IBIT despite showing a massive 65% advance in 2025.\n\"Crypto twitter's knee-jerk reaction is to whine about the [BTC] return,\" said Balchunas. \"But the real takeaway is that it was 6th place DESPITE the negative return (boomers putting on a HODL clinic).\"\n\"That's a really good sign long term,\" he continued. \"If you can do $25 billion in bad year imagine the flow potential in good year.\"\nMore For You\nProtocol Research: GoPlus Security\nWhat to know:\n- As of October 2025, GoPlus has generated $4.7M in total revenue across its product lines.

                "body": "Bitcoin ETF outflows look terrifying, but a hidden derivatives pattern proves the smart money isn\u2019t actually fleeing\nThe \"crypto winter\" vibe is back, yet a specific technical link suggests traders are de-risking, not panicking.\nBitcoin\u2019s ETF data is doing that annoying thing where it looks terrifying if you only read the headline.\nBig chunks of ETF buyers are sitting on losses, and every red flow day gets framed as the start of a stampede.\nBut if you look closely at the numbers, they tell a different story.\nOutflows are small relative to the pile of assets in the funds, and they keep landing at the same time futures and options positions shrink. That\u2019s what you see when traders are closing structured bets, not when long-term holders are throwing in the towel.\nStart with the uncomfortable headline: the consensus is that the market is in its most stressed phase of the cycle so far.\nInvestors are sitting on around $100 billion in unrealized losses, miners are pulling back on hashrate, and treasury-company equities are trading below their BTC book value.\nThe overall vibe is that it's a cold crypto winter.\nEveryone suddenly knows what the \u201cTrue Market Mean\u201d is, which is usually a sign that people are trying to negotiate with the chart.\nAnd yet, inside that stress, the ETF tape doesn't show doom.\nData from Checkonchain shows that, despite roughly 60% of ETF inflows occurring at higher prices, the market has seen only around 2.5% of BTC-denominated AUM in ETF outflows, about $4.5 billion.\nTranslated: yes, a lot of ETF buyers have worse entry points than today\u2019s screen, but the exit door isn't actually jammed.\nThe more interesting part is why it isn\u2019t jammed.\nThose outflows are matched with declines in open interest on CME futures and IBIT options. That frames the flow as basis or volatility trades unwinding, not a broad loss of conviction.\nThe ETF share count is moving, and the hedges that tend to sit next to it are moving too.\nTrade unwind, not investor flight: reading this week\u2019s tape\nThe flows this week weren't a clean sequence of money going out and price going down.\nThey were choppy, two-way, and noisy, the kind of flows you get when positioning is being adjusted rather than when a single holder base is rushing for the exit.\nNet flows swung between red and green, and the most useful takeaway is simply that the market couldn\u2019t sustain a one-directional drain.\nIf this were a true run on the ETFs, you\u2019d expect a steadier drumbeat of red across consecutive sessions.\nInstead, the flow tape kept snapping back. That\u2019s what trade unwinds look like: messy on the surface, small in net, and full of false certainty if you read it day by day.\nBitcoin's price makes that point even clearer.\nOver the same stretch, BTC moved in both directions regardless of whether flows were red or green. That\u2019s a polite way of saying the \u201cflows are driving everything\u201d storyline doesn't hold up.\nWhen price can rise into outflows and slip on an inflow day, you\u2019re usually looking at a market where ETF creations and redemptions are just one channel, and often not the dominant one at the margin.\nThe derivatives layer is where this thesis gets teeth.\nCME futures open interest now sits around $10.94 billion, well below the early-November zone near $16 billion. That suggests the regulated venue has been de-risking for weeks, not loading fresh leverage.\nThat matches the pattern: outflows are lining up with shrinking futures and options positioning. It\u2019s consistent with basis or volatility structures being closed rather than long-term holders abandoning the trade.\nZoom out one more notch, and total futures open interest is still large at about $59.24 billion, but it\u2019s split.\nCME and Binance are essentially tied near $10.9 billion each.\nThat matters because it hints at two different crowds tugging at the market.\nCME tends to be where you see structured hedges and carry, while offshore venues can respond faster to funding, weekend liquidity, and short-term reflexes.\nIn a"

The research focuses on Ethereum because this chain hosts about 52% of the global stablecoin supply, with USDT and USDC accounting for approximately 88% of the market share. The study points out:\n- Stablecoin payments (transfers between EOA accounts) account for about 47% of the total stablecoin transfer volume (about 35% if internal transfers between accounts of the same institution are excluded), indicating that not all on-chain stablecoins are used for trading or DeFi, but a large portion is used in payment scenarios.\n- In terms of transaction count, about 50% of stablecoin transactions are user-to-user payments (EOA-to-EOA), while the other half involves smart contracts (mainly DeFi).\n- In terms of transaction value, payments by institutions or large accounts make up the vast majority, showing that the value density of stablecoin payments is concentrated among large accounts.\n- Stablecoin transfers on Ethereum are mainly driven by a small number of wallets, with the top 1,000 wallets contributing about 84% of the total transaction volume, reflecting that payment activity in terms of actual value is highly concentrated among large holders or institutions."

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to act as a long-term value anchor, Ethereum (ETH) remains central to decentralized applications, and XRP is still widely discussed for its role in efficient on-chain transfers.\nWhat has changed is how people participate.\nIn 2026, more investors are looking for structured, rules-based income models tied to crypto assets-approaches that don't require constant trading decisions or technical expertise. This shift has quietly brought platforms like DBTCDeFi into broader public focus.\nWhy More Users Are Choosing DBTCDeFi\nFrom an outside perspective, DBTCDeFi's growing visibility appears to be driven by clarity rather than hype.\nInstead of offering complex financial narratives, the platform emphasizes:\nDefined participation periods\nClearly stated daily returns\nAutomated execution without manual involvement\nAccess to crypto-based income without infrastructure management\nFor many users, this approach reduces uncertainty. In an environment where volatility is normal, predictable structures often feel more approachable than open-ended strategies.\nLooking forward, DBTCDeFi's model aligns with a broader industry trend: making crypto participation simpler, more transparent, and less time-intensive for everyday investors.\nParticipation Plans Overview\nOfficial website: https://dbtcdefi.com\n\ud83d\ude80 Featured Participation Options\nClassic Plans\n\u25cf $500 | 6 days | $6/day | Total: $36\n\u25cf $1,500 | 10 days | $19.8/day | Total: $198\nMid-Term Plans\n\u25cf $3,000 | 15 days | $42.30/day | Total: $634.5\n\u25cf $10,000 | 25 days | $170/day | Total: $4,250\nHigh-Capacity Plan\n\u25cf $52,000 | 30 days | $1,014/day | Total: $30,420\nThese figures are provided as reference examples. Actual outcomes depend on market conditions and platform rules, which users are encouraged to review directly.\nAutomated Operation and Daily Settlement\nOne aspect frequently mentioned by users is DBTCDeFi's fully automated structure.\nOnce a plan is activated:\nOperations run without manual input\nResults are calculated on a daily basis\nFunds can be accessed according to platform schedules\nNo physical equipment or technical setup is required\nBecause everything operates online, participation is not tied to geography. Users can monitor results and manage accounts from anywhere.\nGrowing Interest Across Regions\nCommunity discussions and third-party commentary suggest that DBTCDeFi is seeing increased interest from users in multiple markets. The combination of automation, defined timelines, and visible returns appears to resonate with investors seeking alternatives to traditional crypto engagement.\nOfficial website: https://dbtcdefi.com\nFinal Takeaway\nAs the crypto market matures, platforms that focus on structure, transparency, and ease of use are gaining attention.\nDBTCDeFi represents a model aimed at reducing complexity while maintaining exposure to digital-asset-based income opportunities. While results always depend on market dynamics, its approach reflects how many investors prefer to participate in crypto today-through systems that are clear, automated, and measurable.\nFor individuals exploring structured crypto income options in the current market cycle, DBTCDeFi is a platform worth researching as part of a broader comparison process.\nShrewsbury\nDBTC DeFi is a technology-driven platform focused on blockchain computing power services and digital computing infrastructure.

For policymakers, the objective is to balance growth and innovation with market integrity and consumer protection. For the industry, the challenge is navigating an 18-month transition period in which the destination is clearer than ever \u2014 but still some distance away.\n\u201cThis is it for the U.K.,\u201d Dea Markova, director of policy at crypto infrastructure firm Fireblocks, said in an interview. \u201cThis is the definitive regime for regulating the issuance and intermediation of crypto assets.\u201d\nFrom discussion to definition\nThe latest consultations need to be viewed as part of a longer, carefully sequenced process, according to S\u00e9bastien Ferri\u00e8re, a financial regulation lawyer at Pinsent Masons.\nFor more than a year, the U.K. has been working through a regulatory roadmap that expands the FCA\u2019s jurisdiction over crypto. The first step has been legislative: Treasury-defined regulated activities determine what falls inside the perimeter. Only then can the FCA impose authorization requirements and detailed rules.\n\u201cOver the last year, things have really started to take shape,\u201d Ferri\u00e8re said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on a treadmill of consultations, but they are now forming a coherent framework.\u201d\nEarlier phases focused on stablecoin issuance and custody, prudential requirements such as capital and wind-down planning, and the application of existing FCA obligations \u2014 governance, systems and controls, operational resilience \u2014 to crypto firms. This week\u2019s consultations turn squarely to markets: trading platforms, intermediaries, staking, decentralized finance, admissions and disclosures, and crypto-specific market abuse rules.\nTaken together, Ferri\u00e8re said, the FCA is attempting to transpose the architecture of traditional financial regulation onto crypto markets, while tailoring it to reflect the technology\u2019s distinct risks.\nA hybrid regulatory model\nOne of the most consequential design choices is the U.K.\u2019s decision to extend existing financial services rules to crypto, rather than writing a standalone rulebook from scratch as the European Union (EU) did with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation.\nThat distinction matters, but not in a simplistic way. Ferri\u00e8re described the FCA\u2019s approach as a hybrid. Cross-cutting obligations \u2014 principles of integrity, conflict management and fair treatment of customers \u2014 are being applied largely as-is. Market-facing rules, however, are being written specifically for crypto.\n\u201cThere is a new admissions and disclosures regime and a new market abuse regime,\u201d Ferri\u00e8re said. \u201cThey are not simply lifting the rules for securities and applying them wholesale. They echo the existing framework, but they\u2019re drafted to reflect the parameters of crypto assets and crypto services.\u201d\nThe regulator, he added, is walking a tightrope. Being more permissive than in traditional markets would invite criticism that crypto is receiving preferential treatment. Being more restrictive could push activity offshore. The stated goal is \u201csame risks, same outcomes,\u201d even if the mechanics differ.\nSecond-mover advantage and its limits\nFor Markova, the U.K.\u2019s most important as"

As of December 21, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $125.78, yet analysts at Skybridge Capital have set an audacious price target of $2,500\u2014a figure that could redefine the altcoin landscape. With the total crypto market cap sitting at a staggering $3.08 trillion, the question on every investor\u2019s mind is whether Solana has what it takes to defy gravity and achieve this monumental leap. This isn\u2019t just about numbers; it\u2019s about the potential for Solana to become a cornerstone of the blockchain revolution\u2014and what that could mean for your portfolio. In this deep dive, we\u2019ll unpack the data, trends, and expert insights to help you understand why this matters now and how it could impact your financial future. Curious about getting started in the crypto space? Start trading with a trusted platform to explore opportunities like Solana firsthand.\nThe cryptocurrency market in December 2025 is a battlefield of innovation and volatility, with Solana emerging as a standout contender. Priced at $125.78 as of today, Solana has shown remarkable resilience with a year-to-date (YTD) performance of +85%, outpacing Ethereum\u2019s +15% and even Bitcoin\u2019s +29%, according to CoinGecko data. Yet, the road to $2,500\u2014a 1,887% increase\u2014requires more than just past performance. The broader market context shows Bitcoin and Ethereum still dominating with 57.27% and 11.66% market shares respectively, while the Fear & Greed Index lingers at a chilling 20, signaling extreme caution among investors.\nRecent developments have fueled both optimism and skepticism around Solana. A major network upgrade aimed at enhancing transaction speeds and scalability has addressed past congestion issues, potentially strengthening its competitive edge. Additionally, a high-profile partnership with a leading tech firm to integrate blockchain solutions into mainstream applications has boosted Solana\u2019s visibility. However, the current market sentiment, underscored by a flight to safe-haven assets like Monero (up 7.82% recently), suggests that fear could dampen short-term growth. These dynamics set the stage for a critical examination of whether Solana can capitalize on its momentum or falter under pressure.\nFor investors, Solana\u2019s potential ascent to $2,500 isn\u2019t just a speculative headline\u2014it\u2019s a call to action. If achieved, this price target would signal a seismic shift in the crypto hierarchy, positioning Solana as a serious rival to Ethereum in the decentralized application (dApp) and DeFi spaces. Such a surge could translate into massive returns for early adopters, but it also comes with significant risks given the current market\u2019s extreme fear sentiment. The data suggests that while Solana\u2019s +85% YTD growth is impressive, sustaining this trajectory requires overcoming both technical and macroeconomic hurdles.\nSo, what should you do? First, assess your risk tolerance. Solana\u2019s volatility means that while the upside is tantalizing, sharp corrections are possible, especially in a fear-driven market. Second, consider diversifying within the crypto space\u2014Solana could be a high-growth addition to a portfolio that includes stable assets like Bitcoin. Finally, stay informed about network upgrades and partnerships, as these could be pivotal catalysts. Ready to dive into the market? Open a trading account to position yourself for opportunities like Solana\u2019s potential rise.\nTo grasp Solana\u2019s potential for a $2,500 valuation, we must first understand the broader forces shaping the cryptocurrency"

For income-focused investors, 2026 could mark a turning point if the Federal Reserve continues its rate-cutting cycle.\nThe Rate Catalyst That Could Reshape REIT Valuations\nInterest rates are the single most important macro variable for RWR heading into 2026. Goldman Sachs Research (NYSE:GS) forecasts the Fed will deliver two more rate cuts next year, bringing the federal funds rate down to 3% to 3.25% from the current 3.75% to 4% range.

Welltower Inc (NYSE:WELL), the healthcare REIT comprising 11.5% of the portfolio, trades at 131x trailing earnings despite a 44% year-over-year decline in quarterly earnings. That premium valuation reflects investor optimism about aging demographics driving demand for senior housing, but leaves little room for disappointment.

With $3.3 billion in assets and an expense ratio of just 0.08% compared to RWR\u2019s 0.25%, USRT provides similar broad REIT exposure at one-third the cost. It holds nearly identical top positions, including Welltower and Prologis, but with slightly different weightings. The larger asset base also means tighter bid-ask spreads and better liquidity for investors trading larger positions.\nIf the Fed delivers on rate cuts and REIT fundamentals strengthen in 2026, watch for RWR\u2019s dividend growth trend and any narrowing of its valuation gap with the broader equity market.\nReleased: The Ultimate Guide To Retirement Income (sponsor)\nMost investors spend years learning how to pick good stocks and funds.

                "body": "London, 20 December 2025 \u2014 The London Stock Exchange (LSE) heads into the final full trading week before Christmas with a rare combination of momentum and uncertainty: the FTSE 100 is pressing toward the 10,000 milestone, helped by heavyweight miners, defence names and globally diversified earnings \u2014 even as the UK economy looks soft, consumer data stays choppy, and policymakers signal that future rate cuts won\u2019t be a straight line. [1]\nBecause today is a Saturday, the \u201clive\u201d story for the London market is really Friday\u2019s close \u2014 but the themes investors are carrying into Monday (22 December) are very much still in motion: the Bank of England\u2019s cautious easing, fiscal nerves, structural reforms meant to make London listings more attractive, and the LSE operator\u2019s own push deeper into data, AI and market infrastructure. Bottom line: London\u2019s market is acting stronger than its domestic economy, and that contrast is now the plot. [2]\nMarket snapshot: FTSE 100 holds the wheel while the domestic UK picture wobbles\nThe FTSE 100 ended Friday at 9,897.42 (+0.61%), with 1.61 billion shares traded, leaving the benchmark just below its recent highs (52-week range: 7,544.83\u20139,930.09). [3]\nOn a weekly basis, Reuters reported the FTSE 100 delivered its strongest weekly gain since mid-October, rising 2.6% over the week. That move came in a data-heavy stretch that included a Bank of England rate cut and fresh signs of a weakening jobs backdrop. [4]\nA key detail (and one investors keep relearning): London\u2019s blue-chip index is not a pure UK economic proxy. It\u2019s packed with firms whose revenues are earned globally, which can make the FTSE 100 behave more like an international value-and-dividend index than a domestic growth gauge. Reuters noted the FTSE 100 has climbed about 21.1% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s gain over the same period \u2014 helped notably by banks and insurers. [5]\nThe more UK-sensitive FTSE 250 was comparatively subdued at the end of the week, reflecting the tug-of-war between cheaper money and weaker domestic demand. [6]\nThe central bank pivot: Bank Rate falls to 3.75%, but the BoE stresses \u201cgradual\u201d from here\nThe Bank of England cut Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.75% in its December decision, stating that inflation has fallen significantly from its peak and that future reductions are likely to be \u201cgradual,\u201d depending on pay growth and services inflation trends. [7]\nThe vote was close: the MPC decided by 5\u20134 to cut, underscoring that the easing cycle is not a one-way conveyor belt. [8]\nFrom a London Stock Exchange perspective, this matters in three ways:\n- Equity valuations: lower rates tend to support multiples, but only if growth doesn\u2019t deteriorate faster than discount rates fall.\n- Currency effects: a softer pound can lift reported earnings for global earners (a big FTSE 100 feature).\n- IPO and fundraising conditions: rate stability is oxygen for new listings, rights issues, and secondary placings.\nThe BoE itself highlighted that inflation is 3.2% in the latest reading (still above target), and it frames its mission in classic BoE fashion: keep inflation returning to 2% and staying there. [9]\nUK data pulse: retail sales slip, borrowing stays uncomfortable\nFresh official data continued to paint a cautious picture for the consumer and the public finances:\n- Retail sales volumes fell 0.1% in November 2025 (after a 0.9% fall in October), even though the three-month trend was modestly positive. [10]\n- Public sector borrowing in the financial year to November 2025 was \u00a3132.3 billion, with public sector net debt estimated at 95.6% of GDP at end-November. [11]\nFor market mood, this is the awkward combo: rate cuts are supportive, but they\u2019re arriving because growth looks fragile and fiscal headroom is limited.\nMeanwhile, retailers are explicitly hoping for a late surge into Christmas \u2014 a \u201cpanic weekend\u201d narrative that speaks to consumer caution more than consumer confidence.

                "body": "FRANKFURT \u2014 Saturday, 20 December 2025. With the Frankfurt Stock Exchange shut for the weekend, investors are digesting Friday\u2019s final session before the Christmas stretch: the DAX ended the day modestly higher around the 24,300 level, while a flurry of market-structure headlines\u2014from Europe\u2019s first equities consolidated tape to a renewed debate about ultra-low-latency tactics on Eurex\u2014kept Frankfurt at the center of Europe\u2019s capital-markets conversation. [1]\nBelow is a full, up-to-date read of the latest Frankfurt Stock Exchange news, forecasts, and analysis as of 20.12.2025, including what moved German equities, what\u2019s changing in the plumbing of the market, and where major banks see the DAX heading in 2026.\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange recap: DAX ends Friday higher near 24,288 as expiry-day volume spikes\nGermany\u2019s benchmark DAX closed Friday at 24,288.40, up 0.37% on the day, after trading as high as roughly 24,305 intraday, according to a Frankfurt market wrap based on exchange data. The same report flagged a notable surge in turnover: about 129.7 million shares traded in DAX names versus a 30\u2011day average near 52.0 million, a jump consistent with the year-end derivatives expiration dynamics that tend to amplify flows. [2]\nThat \u201cexpiry-day\u201d effect was visible even before the close. A market report from dpa-AFX described Friday as a major expiration day for derivatives contracts, with the 24,000-point level in the DAX a psychological magnet for positioning into the holiday period. [3]\nSector leadership leaned defensive-to-cyclical rather than megacap tech momentum. A separate market close report noted gains in Food & Beverages, Insurance, and Utilities, with index gains also extending to the MDAX (+0.28%) and TecDAX (+0.19%). Among DAX constituents, RWE, Commerzbank, and Bayer were highlighted among the session\u2019s stronger performers, while implied volatility (via a DAX volatility index) eased. [4]\nEurope backdrop: STOXX 600 hits a record high; defence and insurers lead\nFrankfurt\u2019s move came as European equities closed at a record high, with defence and insurance stocks among the leaders into year-end. Reuters reported the STOXX 600 ended Friday at 587.50, up 0.4%, with Germany\u2019s DAX also up about 0.4% on the day\u2014framing the late-December mood as investors look for a calmer glide-path into the final trading sessions of 2025. [5]\nFrankfurt\u2019s \u201cplumbing\u201d headlines: EuroCTP picked for Europe\u2019s first equities consolidated tape\nOne of the most consequential Europe-wide market structure decisions of the year landed this week: ESMA selected EuroCTP as the EU\u2019s first Consolidated Tape Provider (CTP) for shares and ETFs.\nESMA called it a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d for EU equity-market attractiveness, saying the tape will provide \u201ca consolidated view of market activity\u201d for retail and institutional investors. Next steps involve authorisation; after that, EuroCTP would operate the tape for five years under ESMA supervision. [6]\nWhy Frankfurt cares (a lot): the EuroCTP shareholder base includes major European exchange groups\u2014among them Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2014and the product is intended to simplify a long-standing pain point in Europe: fragmented trading across venues with expensive, non-unified data feeds. [7]\nWhat it could change for Xetra, issuers, and investors\nMarket-data consolidation isn\u2019t glamorous, but it\u2019s foundational. A credible tape can:\n- Reduce the \u201cfog of liquidity\u201d created by multi-venue execution in Europe.\n- Make post-trade transparency easier and potentially cheaper to consume.\n- Shift competitive pressure toward execution quality rather than proprietary data packaging.\nIndustry groups welcomed the move while also stressing scope limits: AFME described the consolidated tape as a key step for transparency and efficiency, but noted the current scope is constrained\u2014suggesting plenty of debate ahead on how much pre-trade and post-trade detail Europe should standardize over time.

                "body": "German defence champion Rheinmetall AG has gone from investor darling to DAX problem child in just a few weeks. After hitting record highs above \u20ac2,000 in early October, the stock is now trading around the mid\u2011\u20ac1,400s \u2013 a drop of roughly 28% \u2013 as peace\u2011talk headlines and profit\u2011taking trigger a brutal sell\u2011off across European defence names. [1]\nAt the same time, Rheinmetall\u2019s fundamentals look stronger than ever: record sales, a \u20ac64 billion backlog and aggressive expansion of ammunition and air\u2011defence capacity. [2] Analysts still see substantial upside, but short\u2011term technicals have turned clearly bearish and volatility is high. [3]\nThis article looks at the latest price action, fresh news as of 2 December 2025, current forecasts and the key risks around Rheinmetall AG stock for medium\u2011 and long\u2011term investors.\nRheinmetall share price on 2 December 2025\nAs of Tuesday morning, 2 December 2025, Rheinmetall AG (ISIN DE0007030009, WKN 703000, ticker RHM) is changing hands on German exchanges at roughly \u20ac1,450\u20131,460 per share. Quotes from Xetra and other venues show: [4]\n- Last trade around \u20ac1,452\u20131,461, up slightly versus Monday\u2019s close of \u20ac1,448\n- Day range so far roughly \u20ac1,435\u20131,465\n- 52\u2011week range from about \u20ac593 to just over \u20ac2,000\nThat means the stock is still down almost 28% from its 52\u2011week high, even after a modest intraday rebound. [5]\nA number of German market commentaries talk about the share \u201ccrashing\u201d or \u201cfalling under the wheels\u201d as it slid to around \u20ac1,447.50 at the start of the week, with sentiment dominated by headlines rather than company news. [6]\nWhy Rheinmetall is falling now\n1. Peace\u2011talk headlines and sector\u2011wide sell\u2011off\nRheinmetall is being hit by a macro narrative rather than company\u2011specific bad news. On 24 November, Reuters reported that European defence stocks fell to four\u2011month lows as investors reacted to news of a \u201crefined peace framework\u201d discussed at U.S.\u2013Ukraine talks in Geneva. Rheinmetall dropped about 4% that day, alongside other major European arms makers. [7]\nThe logic in the market is simple (and somewhat simplistic):\nPeace talks \u2192 less war risk \u2192 less urgency for ammunition and weapons \u2192 time to take profits in defence stocks.\nAnalysts at Morningstar, quoted in the same Reuters piece, argue the reaction is \u201coverstated\u201d, stressing that European rearmament is driven by structural budget increases and that defence plans are unlikely to reverse even in the event of a ceasefire. [8]\n2. Profit\u2011taking after a massive multi\u2011year rally\nRheinmetall has been one of Europe\u2019s most explosive post\u20112022 winners. A recent MarketScreener/Citigroup commentary notes that: [9]\n- Rheinmetall shares are still up around 130% since the end of 2024, and\n- roughly 1,600% since the start of 2022,\n- even after falling nearly 30% from all\u2011time highs above \u20ac2,000.\nCitigroup points out that the broader European defence sector has corrected roughly 20\u201340% from October peaks, but views this more as an \u201centry opportunity\u201d than the end of the story for defence stocks. [10]\n3. Short\u2011term technical damage\nTechnical analysts have turned notably cautious:\n- StockInvest.us classifies Rheinmetall as a \u201csell candidate\u201d since 21 November, noting a \u201315.9% drop over the last 10 trading days and expecting, based on its model, a potential further \u201316.9% decline over the next three months, with a 90% probability band between roughly \u20ac1,176\u20131,445. [11]\n- The stock trades in the lower part of a wide falling trend and is oversold on RSI\u201114 (24), which can precede bounces but also signals elevated risk. [12]\n- A German XTB analysis highlights a clearly bearish chart: the share is below major moving averages (SMA 20/50/200), with possible downside targets around \u20ac1,374 or even \u20ac1,236 if it cannot regain its 200\u2011day line. [13]\nIn short: the stock is in a technical downtrend, even if long\u2011term fundamentals remain robust.\nFundamentals: record growth and a \u20ac64 billion backlog\nRheinmetall\u2019s latest official numbers are from its Q3 2025 financial"

                "body": "If you are wondering whether Nasdaq is still attractive after such a strong run, or if the upside has already been priced in, this article will walk you through what the numbers say about its value.\nNasdaq's share price has climbed to around $95.36, delivering roughly 1.9% over the last week, 10.9% over the last month, and 23.2% year to date, with 24.2% over 1 year, 62.4% over 3 years, and 138.1% over 5 years.\nBehind those gains, Nasdaq has stayed in the spotlight as a crucial infrastructure player in global markets, from trading platforms to regulatory technology and index licensing. Recent headlines have focused on its push deeper into technology and data solutions, as exchanges evolve from simple trading venues into full stack financial services platforms.\nDespite that momentum, Nasdaq currently scores just 0 out of 6 on our undervaluation checks. In the sections that follow, we will unpack what different valuation methods are saying about that score, then circle back to a broader way to think about Nasdaq's value by the end of the article.\nNasdaq scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.\nApproach 1: Nasdaq Excess Returns Analysis\nThe Excess Returns model looks at how much profit a company can generate above the minimum return shareholders demand on their equity, then capitalizes those surplus profits into an intrinsic value per share.\nFor Nasdaq, the starting point is its Book Value of $20.99 per share and a Stable EPS of $4.10 per share, based on weighted future return on equity estimates from 4 analysts. With an Average Return on Equity of 17.70% and a Cost of Equity of $1.97 per share, the company is expected to earn an Excess Return of $2.13 per share on its equity base.\nAnalysts also see Stable Book Value rising to $23.15 per share, supported by projections from 3 analysts. When these excess returns are projected forward and discounted, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of about $63.63 per share for Nasdaq, implying the stock is roughly 49.9% overvalued versus the current price near $95.\nThis framework suggests that even if Nasdaq continues to earn solid returns on equity, today\u2019s price already reflects a very optimistic trajectory.\nFor a profitable, mature business like Nasdaq, the price to earnings ratio is a useful yardstick because it links what investors pay today to the earnings the company is actually generating. In general, faster earnings growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or higher risk pull a fair PE down.\nNasdaq currently trades on about 33.5x earnings, a premium to both the Capital Markets industry average of roughly 25.1x and the peer average near 32.5x. On the surface, that suggests investors are willing to pay up for Nasdaq relative to its sector. However, Simply Wall St goes a step further with its Fair Ratio, an estimate of what PE you would reasonably expect given the company\u2019s earnings growth, profit margins, risk profile, industry and market cap. For Nasdaq, that Fair Ratio is 16.0x, implying the stock is trading at more than double the multiple that would typically be justified by its fundamentals.\nBecause the current PE is far above the Fair Ratio, this multiple based view also points to Nasdaq looking expensive at today\u2019s price.\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Nasdaq Narrative\nEarlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, an easy tool on Simply Wall St\u2019s Community page that lets you turn your view of a company into a simple story linked to a financial forecast and, ultimately, a fair value. In practice, a Narrative is your own explanation of what you think will drive Nasdaq\u2019s future revenue, earnings and margins, paired with numbers like growth rates, profit margins and the valuation multiple you believe is reasonable. The platform then connects that story to a dynamic forecast and a Fair Value estimate yo"

                "body": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Woodward (NASDAQ:WWD). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Woodward with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\nHow Quickly Is Woodward Increasing Earnings Per Share?\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Woodward's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 38%. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for Woodward remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 7.3% to US$3.6b. That's a real positive.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nAre Woodward Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nOwing to the size of Woodward, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they hold US$44m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. While their ownership only accounts for 0.3%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Woodward, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.\nThe Woodward CEO received US$10m in compensation for the year ending September 2025. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.\nShould You Add Woodward To Your Watchlist?\nWoodward's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. The sweetener is that insiders have a mountain of stock, and the CEO remuneration is quite reasonable. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that Woodward is worth considering carefully. Of course, just because Woodward is growing does not mean it is undervalued.

Nvidia also rose, adding fuel to the broader tech bounce, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained as chip names rallied. [2]\nThe Nasdaq Composite\u2019s close at 23,307.62 puts it squarely back in \u201crisk-on, but selective\u201d territory\u2014strong enough to reset near-term sentiment, not strong enough to end the debate about whether the AI trade is priced for perfection. [3]\nYear-to-date, the Nasdaq is up about 20.7% in 2025, outpacing the S&P 500 and reinforcing how dominant tech and AI-linked leaders have been in this cycle. [4]\nThe week\u2019s hidden plot twist: \u201cAI jitters\u201d didn\u2019t vanish\u2014they just paused\nIf the Nasdaq\u2019s late-year story has a subtitle, it\u2019s something like: \u201cThe AI boom masks the economy\u2026 until it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nReuters\u2019 week-ahead market analysis flagged two forces behind the recent volatility:\n- scrutiny around massive AI infrastructure spending, and\n- shifting expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2026. [5]\nThose themes didn\u2019t go away on Friday\u2019s rally\u2014they simply got temporarily outvoted by price action.\nAnd the AI spending question is not abstract. It\u2019s increasingly measurable in capital flows, financing structures, and real-economy constraints (power, land, chips, permitting). That matters because the Nasdaq is disproportionately exposed to the companies funding and benefiting from that buildout.\nFed outlook: Rate-cut hopes support the Nasdaq\u2014unless inflation (or \u201cdata weirdness\u201d) bites back\nThe Nasdaq\u2019s sensitivity to interest rates is almost comical: tech-heavy indices tend to react strongly to changes in the expected path of rates because future earnings are discounted more aggressively when yields rise.\nRight now, markets are trying to price a 2026 world where rates can come down\u2014but policymakers are signaling patience.\nNew York Fed President John Williams said there\u2019s no urgent need for another rate cut soon after the most recent move, while also highlighting how recent inflation data may be distorted (including complications after the 43-day government shutdown). [6]\nAt the same time, traders have been leaning toward multiple cuts next year, according to market pricing referenced in Reuters\u2019 market coverage. That tension\u2014market hopes vs. Fed caution\u2014is a core reason Nasdaq volatility has stayed lively. [7]\nA more pessimistic macro risk case is also making the rounds: Apollo\u2019s chief economist has warned that stagflation risk (slower growth with elevated inflation) could complicate the Fed\u2019s ability to cut in 2026\u2014exactly the kind of scenario that tends to hit growth valuations hardest. [8]\nMeanwhile, major investor outlooks (like Fidelity\u2019s) are emphasizing that 2026\u2019s market durability may require a \u201cbaton pass\u201d from valuation expansion to earnings growth, while noting that elevated valuations leave less room for disappointment\u2014again, a big deal for the Nasdaq given its growth tilt.

                "body": "Financial \"respond to excessive fluctuations\" Verbal intervention\nActual intervention raises U.S. diplomatic threshold\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) has raised its benchmark interest rate, but the weak yen has not been dampened.\nAccording to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei) and NHK, the yen-dollar exchange rate rose to 157.76 yen per dollar in the New York foreign exchange market on the 19th (local time). The yen fell about 2 yen to the dollar from the previous day, the lowest level in about a month.\nThe weakness was noticeable not only against the dollar but also against the euro. On this day, the yen-euro exchange rate rose to 184.77 yen per euro, and the yen's value reached a new all-time low since the introduction of the euro in 1999.\nThe market believes that the prospect of further tightening after the hike has stimulated the yen's sell-off, rather than the rate hike itself. As Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda maintained a cautious stance at a press conference after the monetary policy meeting, financial markets have widely interpreted that \"the pace of interest rate hikes will be slow in the future.\" NHK also said, \"As opinions spread that the Bank of Japan's rate hike will be moderate, there was a trend of selling yen and buying dollars.\"\nEarlier, the Bank of Japan decided to raise the short-term policy rate, which serves as the base rate, by 0.25 percentage points from \"about 0.5%\" to \"about 0.75%\" at the financial policy-making meeting on the 18th and 19th. As a result, Japan's benchmark interest rate has risen to its highest level in 30 years since 1995.\nHowever, prospects are mixed over the direction of the yen in the future. According to Nikkei, an analyst at Stone X Group predicted, \"If Ueda maintains a cautious attitude in the future, the yen may proceed further.\" On the other hand, an official from UBS Global predicted, \"If the interest rate difference between the U.S. and Japan gradually narrows, there is a possibility that the yen will rise over the next year.\"\nIn the meantime, interest in the foreign exchange market is shifting to the possibility of intervening in the yen purchase (currency defense). Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama warned on the 19th, \"We will respond appropriately to excessive fluctuations, including speculative movements,\" adding, \"There has definitely been a one-sided and rapid movement in the last half-day and several hours.\"\nExperts believe that the authorities' strong message itself could be a factor in buying the yen in the short term. Yujiro Goto, chief strategist at Nomura Securities, said, \"If the yen continues to weaken even after the interest rate hike, it is easier to justify the authorities' explanation that the exchange rate moves regardless of fundamentals (basic economic conditions).\" Akira Soga, chief strategist at Aozora Bank, also said, \"If the sense of caution grows, speculative forces will gradually weaken the pressure to sell yen and buy dollars,\" adding, \"If the realization of profits proceeds, there is room for a return to the level of 154 yen per dollar.\"\nHowever, there is still a view that the political and diplomatic thresholds are high until actual intervention. Masafumi Yamamoto, chief foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Securities, said, \"There are many views that we have not received a clear 'indulgence' for intervention from the U.S.,\" adding, \"It is difficult to rule out the possibility of the yen selling continuously, as if testing the authorities' attitude.\""

                "body": "Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) investors head into the weekend with a familiar Japanese-market paradox: the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has pushed rates to a three-decade high, yet the yen is still weakening\u2014forcing portfolio managers to rethink what \u201ctightening\u201d actually means for Japanese equities going into year-end and early 2026. [1]\nWith Tokyo markets closed on Saturday, December 20, 2025, the story is less about today\u2019s tape and more about how Friday\u2019s policy signals, currency swings, and exchange-level rule enforcement are setting up the next act on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\u2014across blue-chip exporters, banks, small caps, ETFs, and the steadily intensifying corporate governance push. [2]\nTokyo Stock Exchange market pulse: Nikkei and TOPIX rebound after the BOJ decision\nJapan\u2019s benchmark equity indices finished the week stronger after the BOJ\u2019s expected rate hike, supported by global risk appetite and a post-decision currency move that\u2014counterintuitively\u2014kept the yen soft rather than stronger. Reuters described Japan\u2019s Nikkei up about 1.3% in the broader \u201cAsia stocks rally\u201d context. [3]\nMarket data providers put Friday\u2019s close at roughly Nikkei 225 +1.03% (around 49,507) and TOPIX +0.8% (around 3,384), recouping recent losses. [4]\nThat split\u2014stocks up, yen down\u2014matters on the Tokyo Stock Exchange because it reshuffles leadership:\n- Exporters typically benefit when the yen weakens (overseas profits translate into more yen).\n- Banks and insurers tend to like higher rates, but only if the market believes the tightening cycle will keep moving.\nFriday\u2019s \u201crates up, yen down\u201d outcome suggests traders are not yet pricing an aggressive BOJ path\u2014even after the hike.\nBOJ raises rates to 0.75%\u2014and stays vague on what comes next\nOn Friday (Dec. 19), the Bank of Japan raised short-term interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5%, a level unseen since the mid-1990s. The move was widely expected and approved by a unanimous vote, but the market reaction hinged on the BOJ\u2019s guidance\u2014or lack of it. [5]\nKey takeaways shaping Tokyo Stock Exchange expectations:\n- The BOJ signaled it will keep raising rates if its forecasts materialize, while emphasizing real rates remain very low. [6]\n- Governor Kazuo Ueda offered few hints about pace and terminal level, leaving traders to infer the endpoint from data and the BOJ\u2019s \u201cneutral rate\u201d discussion. [7]\n- Reuters reported the BOJ\u2019s estimated neutral-rate range as 1.0%\u20132.5%, implying policy is still accommodative relative to that concept\u2014even after the hike. [8]\nFor the Tokyo Stock Exchange, this policy messaging is a big deal: it shapes whether 2026 leadership tilts toward financials (higher rates) or toward export-heavy cyclicals (weaker yen).\nYen volatility takes center stage\u2014and the \u201c160\u201d level returns to the conversation\nThe most market-moving \u201cheadline risk\u201d on Dec. 20 is currency policy signaling.\nJapan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said Tokyo is alarmed by \u201cone-sided, sharp moves\u201d and would respond appropriately to \u201cexcessive moves,\u201d referencing the framework that interventions should be reserved for combating excess volatility. [9]\nTwo details stand out for Tokyo Stock Exchange investors:\n- Dollar/yen moved to around the 157 range after the BOJ decision, and traders openly discussed 160 per dollar as a potential \u201cline in the sand,\u201d echoing the level near prior intervention episodes. [10]\n- Reuters also reported that a vague BOJ outlook emboldened bearish yen positioning (including \u201ccarry\u201d trades), with the next move not fully priced until November 2026 in market pricing cited in the report\u2014another signal that traders expect gradualism, not urgency. [11]\nWhy this matters for the Tokyo Stock Exchange: a rapidly weakening yen can lift exporter earnings optics, but it also raises import costs (energy, food), squeezes households, and can trigger policy responses that jolt markets. That\u2019s a cocktail for higher equity volatility into year-end.\nTokyo Stock Exchange mechanics: price-limit actions, new listings, and ET"
