The Japanese yen suffered a sharp drop in early trade, depreciating by 1.45% to 149.59 against the U.S. dollar. The currency\u2019s slide followed news that conservative figure Sanae Takaichi won the leadership of Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her as the country\u2019s next prime minister.\nThe ongoing budget impasse in the United States also lent support to safe-haven assets like gold. Despite the shutdown, broader U.S. risk markets appeared to largely disregard the political deadlock, according to market sources.\nAccording to CME FedWatch Tool, markets were positive that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates in October with a 99% odds for a 25 basis point rate cut. This followed the same amount of rates cut in September."

                "body": "By Elias Visontay\nThe price of gold has continued its climb to record heights, and Australians investors are jumping on board, as the US government shutdown becomes the latest element of economic uncertainty pushing investors to seek safety in the precious metal.\nAt the end of last week, bullion was trading at $US3886 ($5886) per ounce, after a stand-off over funding in the US Senate triggered a shutdown that sent gold\u2019s spot price to its record high of $US3897 on Thursday. It marks eight weeks of gains for the commodity, beginning its run from a price of $US3290 at the end of July.\nA range of factors has been driving the surge in the gold value, said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP.\nOne thing at play is that central banks have been increasing their gold holdings recently, \u201cfearful that if they have US dollars, it could work against them\u201d, said Oliver. In particular, BRICS countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 have reduced their reserves of US dollars.\nAdditionally, the low cost of borrowing in many economies means there is less of a trade-off between gold and other investments. \u201cGold doesn\u2019t pay any interest or yields, so the opportunity cost of holding it is high,\u201d Oliver explained.\nHowever, returns from other investments are less lucrative.\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years, central banks are cutting interest rates. So the lost opportunity from those investments is lower.\u201d\nInstability in the US is also bolstering the appeal. This includes a downswing in the US dollar. \u201cGold is priced in US dollars, so if the dollar goes down, gold goes up,\u201d Oliver said.\n\u201cGold is also seen as a hedge against geopolitical tensions, particularly between the US and China, or NATO countries and Russia.\u201d\nSigns from the Trump administration of \u201cincreasing authoritarianism\u201d are also fuelling appetite for gold, Oliver said, as are lingering concerns that inflation, instead of being defeated, is \u201clying dormant and could bounce back\u201d.\nHe also cited comments from Trump about having greater control of the US Federal Reserve. \u201cThat\u2019s a red flag, that\u2019s worrying investors as well,\u201d Oliver said.\nThe recent US government shutdown is another layer of uncertainty. \u201cThe shutdown is part of it, in that it feeds into that insecurity,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cGold is seen as a hard currency in the short term.\u201d\nConcerns about excessive public debt in the US, Japan and Europe also add to the appeal of gold, out of fears it will lead to debasing of currency to make it easier to service the debts.\nAdding to the activity surrounding gold have been the more accessible methods of investing in it. While there have long been barriers to accessing and trading physical bars of gold, and moving the commodity around is costly, there has been a rise in trading gold futures, said Oliver.\nGold ETFs are another method becoming increasingly popular. Justin Lin, investment strategist at gold ETF issuer Global X, said there has been strong demand for the company\u2019s products, with more than $180 million in net inflows in September.\n\u201cTotal Australian gold ETF flows [in 2025] now sits at $819 million, which is on track to smash the record set in 2020 [of $982 million],\u201d said Lin. \u201cGold\u2019s strong appeal in this environment is undeniable.\u201d\nGemma Dale, director of investor behaviour at NAB, said demand for gold investments has come from two types of retail investors.\nWhile seasoned, well-informed types who have played a wide range of resource opportunities account for a small chunk, she said \u201cthe real shift in has been through the wider base\u201d of investors.\n\u201cPeople who are building a portfolio or are managing a portfolio for their retirement, you\u2019re seeing them start to allocate for gold.\u201d\nIt\u2019s less about actively trading, and more about buying for the longer term, Dale said. \u201cThey\u2019re not there because they think it\u2019s going to run very hard; they\u2019re there because they are re"

                "body": "Members of the Opec+ oil cartel have agreed to raise supply by 137,000 barrels per day from next month as the group tries to wrestle back market share from the United States.\nThe oil production collective announced the monthly supply increase on Sunday despite experts at the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicting there would be insufficient demand to consume all of the oil on the market in the coming year. The increase in output was weaker than analysts had expected, with some predicting a rise in supply of up to 500,000 barrels per day.\nOpec+ consists of eight members: Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Oman and Kazakhstan. The cartel has been gradually unwinding previously agreed cuts to oil production to try to regain control of the market, which has been flooded with US oil exports yielded from the country\u2019s shale boom.\nAt the start of the year, the cartel\u2019s strategy was to lift oil prices by curbing supply, but there is now a greater emphasis on trying to recapture market share.\nAs of last Friday, the price of a barrel of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, was $64.53, down from a peak in 2025 of over $80 a barrel. A barrel of WTI, also a benchmark, fetches $61, down from a peak of $79 this year.\nPrices have been volatile in the past ten months owing to fears that President Trump\u2019s tariffs would curb global trade flows and the conflict in the Middle East which led to Israel and Iran trading rocket fire in June.\nOpec+ has progressively raised its annual oil output target by nearly 3 million barrels per day this year, representing 2.5 per cent of global consumption. Opec+ is also curtailing a production cut of 1.65 million barrels per day agreed in April 2023.\nThe Opec secretariat said: \u201cIn view of a steady global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories, the eight participating countries decided to implement a production adjustment of 137,000 barrels per day from the 1.65 million barrels per day additional voluntary adjustments.\u201d\nTypically, in the final quarter of the year, global demand for oil enters a lull after the stronger summer months when people go on holiday. The cautious increase in oil output reflects Opec+\u2019s hesitancy to put too much downward pressure on prices given the IEA\u2019s downbeat forecast for global oil demand in the coming year.\nOn Sunday, the cartel maintained non-committal guidance about its production plans in November and December, just as did in the previous month\u2019s meeting."

With the US government shutdown delaying key data releases, investors have shifted focus to private-sector indicators and commentary from Federal Reserve officials. Meanwhile, the euro is finding modest support from easing energy costs, which reduce import burdens for the region, even as sluggish growth data from Germany, France, and Italy weigh on sentiment.\nUS dollar undermined by delayed data\nThe US dollar\u2019s brief rebound lost steam last week, reflecting growing conviction that the Fed will cut rates further. Markets now expect two additional cuts before the end of 2025, and possibly another 50 basis points worth of easing in 2026.\nFriday\u2019s release of ISM services PMI and speeches from Fed officials couldn\u2019t inject much volatility.\nWith the government shutdown halting the release of critical labor market and inflation data, investors lack the evidence needed to justify a stronger dollar. On Friday, US Senators failed for a fourth time to pass spending proposals to reopen the government. This means that the shutdown is extending into the week ahead, and possibly longer.\nEuro benefits from energy weakness\nThe euro has quietly strengthened thanks to falling oil and gas prices, which lower import costs and help offset Europe\u2019s otherwise sluggish economic backdrop. The weakness in energy prices has provided a cushion for the single currency even as regional PMIs from major economies like Germany and France continue to signal contraction.\nThe European Central Bank remains cautious but comfortable with the current policy. There is growing speculation that the cutting cycle is effectively over, with no additional cuts anticipated in 2025 unless inflation or economic data undershoots sharply.\nKeep an eye on the upcoming eurozone data, with Sentix Investor Confidence due for release on Monday. Here\u2019s the rest of this week\u2019s data releases:\nWhat else to watch this week\nThe global risk sentiment remains positive which has been lifted by a surge in AI-driven tech stocks. This has supported risk-sensitive assets and currencies. This risk-on tone has indirectly helped the euro by keeping investor appetite away from safe-haven flows into the dollar.\nElsewhere, developments in other major economies could influence broader FX flows. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points to 2.75% this week, marking its tenth consecutive reduction since August 2024.\nMeanwhile, Canada\u2019s employment report on Friday could show continued weakness after two months of heavy job losses, keeping pressure on the loonie and indirectly supporting USD.\nShould the US government reopen soon, a backlog of economic data \u2013 such as non-farm payroll \u2013 could be released all at once, potentially sparking renewed volatility across major currency pairs including EUR/USD.\nTechnical EUR/USD outlook: Consolidation with mild bullish bias\nFrom a technical standpoint, the EUR/USD chart remains range-bound but biased to the upside. The pair is consolidating between 1.1700 and 1.1800, with potentially strong support at 1.1670 and 1.1600. Resistance lies at 1.1850, followed by 1.1900, while the key psychological barrier remains at 1.2000. The pair broke above a short-term bearish channel, which is a positive sign.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nStoneX Europe Ltd may make third party material available on this website which may contain information included but not limited to the conditions of financial markets.

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar Holds 1.1380 Ahead of CPI: Euro Defends Support as Fed Uncertainty Looms\nEuro steadies above its 50-day SMA at 1.1283 with traders watching for a breakout toward 1.1570 if U.S. inflation data softens and Fed maintains its wait-and-see stance | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD (Euro\u2013U.S. Dollar) Struggles for Direction as CPI and Fed Expectations Drive Volatility\nThe EUR/USD pair traded near 1.1380 late in the week, hovering above the monthly low of 1.1347, with traders balancing between resilient U.S. inflation expectations and Europe\u2019s slowing growth signals. The pair continues to respect the positive slope of its 50-day moving average at 1.1283, but momentum remains muted as market participants await the next set of macroeconomic triggers from the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) and FOMC minutes scheduled for release this week.\nDollar Consolidates as Fed Maintains a Cautious Tone\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) closed the week within a narrow consolidation zone, softening after a failed attempt to sustain its bullish momentum above the 106.00 handle. Despite a technical slowdown, the broader picture reflects the market\u2019s indecision over the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy trajectory. Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank is \u201cwell positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments,\u201d hinting that a rate cut is unlikely before clear evidence of slowing inflation.\nThe U.S. JOLTS Job Openings data came in slightly stronger than expected, while the ISM Services PMI softened marginally to 51.1, signaling a mixed economic landscape. The upcoming CPI print, forecast to show an annual headline rise of 3.4% and a core reading near 3.8%, could set the tone for the EUR/USD trajectory. A stronger reading would likely lift Treasury yields and pressure the euro back toward 1.1280, while a softer inflation surprise could reinforce dovish bets and propel the pair toward 1.1570, its April high.\nEuro Supported by ECB Patience but Faces Growth Constraints\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) remains in a holding pattern after the last meeting reaffirmed its wait-and-see stance. President Christine Lagarde signaled cautious optimism that inflation is easing but emphasized the need for sustained progress before any rate cuts. Despite the ECB\u2019s restraint, the Eurozone\u2019s manufacturing and services PMIs remain subdued, with the composite index barely above 50, pointing to sluggish activity.\nGermany\u2019s industrial output decline of 0.4% month-over-month and weak export data have weighed on sentiment, even as the euro held firm against a mixed dollar. The broader uptrend in EUR/USD since early 2025 remains intact, underpinned by relative euro strength across major crosses such as EUR/JPY, which has recently climbed above 173.00, marking multi-year highs.\nTechnical Landscape: Euro Bulls Defend Key Support Levels\nFrom a technical standpoint, EUR/USD has spent most of the past week consolidating between 1.1390 and 1.1440, corresponding to the 78.6% and 61.8% Fibonacci extension zones. A decisive break below 1.1347, the current monthly low, could expose the pair to the next support cluster between 1.1260\u20131.1280, followed by a stronger floor around 1.1170, the 50% Fibonacci retracement from the April\u2013June rally.\nOn the upside, buyers must clear resistance at 1.1495 to regain short-term control, opening a path toward 1.1560 and eventually 1.1617, the November 2021 high. Price action remains capped below 1.1500, signaling that the bulls are cautious despite the long-term uptrend still intact. The formation of an inside weekly candlestick with a long upper wick confirms indecision but does not invalidate the broader bullish structure.\nMarket Sentiment: Dollar Weakness Meets Euro Hesitation\nMarket sentiment has turned increasingly nuanced. Traders appear reluctant to commit heavily to either side as volatility remains subdued\u2014only about 15% of major currency pairs moved more than 1% last week. The euro\u2019s res"

As the market bias is bullish, the cross may explore the region around the psychological level of 177.00.\nA pullback toward the ascending channel would prompt the EUR/JPY cross to test the nine-day EMA of 174.02. Further declines would weaken the short-term price momentum and put downward pressure on the currency cross to approach the lower boundary of the channel around 173.00, followed by the 50-day EMA at 172.64.\nA break below the 50-day EMA would weaken the medium-term price momentum and put downward pressure on the EUR/JPY cross to navigate the region around the three-month low of 169.72, recorded on July 31.\nEUR/JPY: Daily Chart\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "The GBP/USD pair struggles to capitalize on Friday's strong move up and opens with a bearish gap at the start of a new week amid a broadly firmer US Dollar (USD). Spot prices, however, lack follow-through selling and seem to have stabilized below mid-1.3400s, still down over 0.30% for the day.\nJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader over the weekend. Given that Takaichi is viewed as fiscally dovish, the outcome raises the chance that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could delay raising interest rates further and trigger massive selling around the Japanese Yen (JPY). This, in turn, provides a goodish lift to the USD, which turns out to be a key factor weighing on the GBP/USD pair.\nThe upside for the Greenback, however, seems limited in the wake of the growing acceptance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs two more times this year. Apart from this, concerns that a prolonged US government shutdown could negatively impact the US economic performance, along with the risk-on mood, might keep a lid on the safe-haven USD. This, in turn, could offer support to the GBP/USD pair.\nMeanwhile, money markets are betting the Bank of England (BoE) will keep interest rates on hold for the rest of this year amid signs of faster inflation and a more resilient economy. This could benefit the British Pound (GBP) and further limit losses for the GBP/USD pair, making it prudent to wait for some follow-through selling before confirming that the recent bounce from the lowest level since August touched earlier this month has run out of steam.\nTraders now look forward to the release of the UK Construction PMI for a fresh impetus. The focus, however, will remain glued to the BoE Governor Andrew Bailey's speech later during the North American session, which will play a key role in influencing the GBP price dynamics and producing some meaningful trading opportunities around the GBP/USD pair.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a"

With markets flying blind, traders turned to fiscal and political signals in both Washington and London to assess short-term direction. The absence of the jobs report\u2014typically a high-volatility driver\u2014kept trading ranges tight, though the dollar\u2019s stability reflected confidence in U.S. fundamentals. Equities hovered near all-time highs, and Treasury yields stayed firm, suggesting investors still favored U.S. assets despite temporary disruption.\nDollar Fundamentals Stay Strong as Shutdown Masks Data\nCredit Agricole\u2019s latest forecast reinforced a medium-term bullish stance on the dollar, projecting GBP/USD to retreat to 1.33 by end-2026. The bank expects a rebound in U.S. growth next year, emphasizing that the Federal Reserve is likely to remain institutionally independent and avoid aggressive rate cuts. Strong capital inflows into U.S. equities and Treasuries\u2014viewed as unmatched globally\u2014should keep the greenback supported. Even with near-term political noise from the shutdown, Credit Agricole argues that the U.S. economy\u2019s structural advantage and lack of credible alternatives will sustain demand for dollar assets.\nUK Fiscal Pressure and Budget Risks Keep Pound Capped\nIn the United Kingdom, the outlook remains clouded by fiscal strain. The government faces a public-debt load exceeding 114 percent of GDP, the highest since World War II, and a 2024 deficit near 5.8 percent. Ahead of the late-November Budget, Chancellor Reeves must navigate a widening funding gap of \u00a320\u201340 billion, rising gilt yields near 5.6 percent, and strict fiscal rules mandating a falling debt ratio by 2029-30. Markets expect revenue-raising measures rather than major spending increases, possibly including frozen personal allowances, inheritance-tax tightening, and curtailed fuel-duty relief. The pound\u2019s resilience around 1.34 could weaken if early Budget leaks hint at heavier taxation or slower growth assumptions.\nBank of England Balances Caution and Inflation Risks\nThe Bank of England (BoE) remains cautious on rate policy. With inflation trending lower but the labor market still firm, policymakers are reluctant to deliver large rate cuts. The central bank\u2019s conservative tone contrasts with expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve later in 2026. Any surprise uptick in wage data or service-sector inflation could keep the BoE on hold longer, indirectly supporting sterling. Yet the market perceives only limited upside for GBP/USD beyond 1.35\u20131.36, as tightening fiscal policy may dampen domestic demand while U.S. yields remain attractive.\nGlobal Context: Dollar Strength vs. Mixed Risk Appetite\nAcross G10 FX, the pound underperformed the euro but held firmer than commodity-linked peers. EUR/GBP hovered near 0.8730, showing modest euro strength after better-than-expected revisions to French industrial output. The global backdrop favors the dollar, with most major currencies trading defensively as investors brace for renewed U.S. inflation data once the shutdown ends. Morgan Stanley sees EUR/USD at 1.25 by mid-2026, while MUFG targets 1.26 within 12 months, underscoring a mild dollar correction path\u2014yet Credit Agricole\u2019s opposing call for dollar recovery highlights deep market division.\nTechnical View: Support at 1.3380, Resistance at 1.3535\nTechnically, GBP/USD is consolidating between support at 1.3380\u20131.3410 and resistance at 1.3535\u20131.3560.

Meanwhile, the annual inflation gauge rose 3%, following the previous 2.8% increase. Traders will likely observe speeches from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) officials this week, which are expected to provide further insight into the central bank\u2019s policy outlook following the latest inflation data.\nThe RBA kept its Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 3.6% at the September monetary policy meeting. The Australian central bank warned that inflation has proven more persistent than expected, especially in market services, while the labor market remains tight.\nAustralian Dollar gains ground despite a stable US Dollar\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is gaining ground and trading around 98.00 at the time of writing. However, the Greenback may find challenges amid the rising likelihood of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in the upcoming meetings. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in a 95% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and an 84% possibility of another reduction in December.\n- The US Dollar may also struggle as concerns rise after United States (US) Senators failed to pass spending proposals to reopen the federal government for a fourth time, extending the ongoing shutdown into a new week. The closure has suspended key federal programs and delayed major economic reports, including September\u2019s jobs data originally due Friday.\n- The US ADP Employment Change report, released on Wednesday, showed that private sector payrolls declined by 32,000 in September, while annual pay growth was 4.5%. This figure followed the 3,000 decrease (revised from a 54,000 increase) reported in August and came in below the market expectation of 50,000.\n- The latest Job Openings showed the labor market is slowing, yet vacancies rose from 7.21 million to 7.23 million in August. Meanwhile, the hiring rate edged down to 3.2%, the lowest level since June 2024, while layoffs remained at a low level.\n- The White House announced that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Donald Trump will hold their first in-person meeting in Washington, D.C. on October 20 to discuss the Aukus nuclear submarine pact.\n- The S&P Global Australia Composite PMI fell to 52.4 in September from 55.5 in August, marking a full year of monthly growth but at the slowest pace since June.

Meanwhile, Exports fell by 7.8% MoM in August from 3.3% seen a month earlier as Gold exports declined after a run of strong months.

                "body": "Japan entered a new era on Saturday, October 4, after Sanae Takaichi won the Liberal Democratic Party election, potentially becoming Japan\u2019s first female prime minister. Takaichi\u2019s policies were under the spotlight going into the Monday, October 6, session, weighing on the yen and sending USD/JPY up 1.26% to 149.312.\nEconomists have touted Takaichi as a pro-stimulus advocate who favors ultra-loose monetary policy to boost growth. As former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, she will likely reintroduce the three arrows of Abenomics, these being monetary policy easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms. Ultra-loose monetary policy will likely weaken the yen, sending USD/JPY higher.\nLDP President Takaichi commented on the Bank of Japan and rising prices in a post-election press conference, stating:\n\u201cDemand-pull inflation \u2014 wage increases driving demand growth, leading to a gradual rising of prices and corporate profits \u2014 is the best outcome. Until such a situation emerges, we must maintain close communication with the Bank of Japan. We must stay in sync.\u201d\nThe yen\u2019s reaction underscored Takaichi\u2019s pro-loose monetary policy stance, potentially keeping the yen carry trade alive.\nThe election result followed Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s comments on Friday, October 3. He continued to raise concerns about the potential effects of US tariffs, which challenged bets on an October rate hike.\nEast Asia Econ commented on Governor Ueda\u2019s speech, stating:\n\u201cThe main takeaway from Governor Ueda\u2019s speech today was that he remains concerned about the impact of tariffs. That isn\u2019t unreasonable, and more than today\u2019s rise in UE, is a reason to think rate hikes aren\u2019t a done deal.\u201d\nAcross the Pacific, updates from Capitol Hill and Fed speakers will influence USD/JPY trends later Monday. A continued Senate stalemate could signal a lengthy US government shutdown, supporting bets on multiple Fed rate cuts in the fourth quarter.\nHistorically, the Fed has taken a more dovish monetary policy position in the absence of official economic data and the potential impact of a shutdown on the economy.\nHowever, traders should closely monitor the Fed\u2019s views on inflation, the economy, and the timelines for rate cuts. Increasing support for October and December Fed rate cuts may push USD/JPY toward the 200-day and 50-day EMAs. If breached, 146.5 would be the next key support level.\nOn the other hand, calls to delay easing monetary policy over concerns about sticky inflation could send USD/JPY toward 150. A sustained move through 150 would bring the August high of 150.917 into play.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: Politics and Shifting BoJ and Dovish Fed Risks\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nAs traders consider the LDP election result and potential influences on the BoJ\u2019s policy stance, inflation keeps traders focused on AUD/USD.\nTurning focus to the AUD/USD pair, Aussie inflation will draw interest in early trading on Monday, October 6. Economists expect the TD-MI Inflation Gauge to remain flat in September after declining 0.3% month-on-month in August.\nAn unexpected rise in the inflation gauge would likely further challenge expectations of a November RBA rate cut. A more hawkish RBA policy stance could send AUD/USD higher.\nConversely, another monthly decline may revive hopes for a fourth-quarter RBA rate cut, pushing AUD/USD lower. Economists regard the TD-MI Inflation gauge as a leading inflation indicator, making the Aussie dollar sensitive to the data.\nIn late September, a hotter-than-expected Monthly CPI Indicator\u2014rising from 2.8% in August to 3.0% in September\u2014had earlier fueled RBA concerns about price trends, sending AUD/USD higher.\nAUD/USD: Key Scenarios to Watch\nSee our full AUD/USD analysis for detailed trends and trade setups.\nWhile Aussie inflation data will influence the RBA rate path, Fed speakers could provide insights into the level of support for multiple Fed rate cuts in the fourth quarter.\nGrowin"

                "body": "The big news on the weekend was from Japan as Sanae Takaichi won the LDP leadership race to become the country's first female prime minister. She is known as a fiscal dove and markets are reacting accordingly to start the new week, though by quite some margins in the opening stages for now.\nUSD/JPY has opened with a gap up and has now raced higher to test the 150.00 level. That as the Nikkei soars by over 4% gains to jump up above the 47,000 level today. Big, big wins all around. Circling back to USD/JPY, the pair is once again seeking a breakout after the failed attempt two weeks ago:\nThe 100-week moving average is seen at 149.65 and that's also another key level to be mindful of on the week. That as the pair is now trying to contest a firmer break above the pivotal 150.00 level.\nThe drop in the Japanese yen comes amid a repricing in BOJ odds as we look towards the October decision. Market players were positioned for at least one more rate hike this year with odds of a move this month being around a little more than 60% previously. However, Takaichi's win now sees those odds flip drastically with only a ~22% probability of a rate hike priced in now for October.\nAll of this of course is tied to Takaichi's inherent views on fiscal and monetary policy. We are yet to officially see what her actions will be in her new capacity as prime minister and how she will balance all of that out.\nI would argue it is definitely a case that the BOJ will find it tougher to push for tighter policy from hereon. But to say that rate hikes going into next year will be completely off the table is a little premature, at least for now.\nI mean it wouldn't be the first time where a politician once elected, has to find a different way to balance out their election \"promise\". That being said, I would expect Takaichi to be firm on a lot of matters as she is after all Shinzo Abe's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nAnyway, USD/JPY is now basically up against a key technical test to start the week. Holding a break above 150.00 will do buyers a world of good in keeping with the gap to the upside to start the week. But on the week itself, that 100-week moving average at 149.65 will be one to be aware of in determining buyers' stranglehold on the pair.\nI'd be inclined to fade this upside jump but only if the pair continues to keep below 150.00 on the daily front. That's the key line in the sand at the moment."

                "body": "USD/JPY rises above 149.50, Takaichi wins as Japan's Prime Minister may delay BoJ rate hikes\n- USD/JPY jumps to around 149.65 in Monday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- Analysts believe Takaichi's victory reduces chance of a BoJ rate hike in the October meeting.\n- Two more Fed rate cuts are expected this year.\nThe USD/JPY pair climbs to near 149.65 during the early Asian session on Monday. The Japanese Yen (JPY) faces some selling pressure against the Greenback after a ruling-party vote for Sanae Takaichi to become Japan\u2019s next Prime Minister.\nReuters reported on Sunday that Japan's ruling party elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader on Saturday, positioning the 64-year-old to become Japan's first female Prime Minister. A vote in parliament to replace outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is scheduled for October 15. Takaichi is favoured as the ruling coalition has the largest number of seats.\nThe victory of Takaichi raises the chance that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will avoid raising interest rates this month, weighing on the JPY and acting as a tailwind for the pair. \"Takaichi is not seen as supportive of interest rate hikes, which could make it more difficult for the BOJ to proceed with tightening,\" said Kazutaka Maeda, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.\nOn the USD\u2019s front, fears of a prolonged US government shutdown might cap the upside for the pair. The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for September was due to be published on Friday, but was not released due to the government closure. If the shutdown lasts for a long time, investors will begin to question governability in the US. The rate futures market has priced in about 47 basis points (bps) of rate cuts for the remainder of the year, or just under two reductions, according to LSEG calculations.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

USD/JPY faces resistance at 147.70, support at 146.40 amid rising BoJ hike expectations | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY (USDJPY) Slides Below 147.00 as U.S. Data Weakens and BoJ Tightening Bets Grow\nThe USD/JPY pair retreated below 147.00, marking two-week lows near 146.60, as broad U.S. Dollar weakness gripped global markets. The correction follows disappointing ADP payroll data, showing a 32K job decline in September against expectations of a 50K increase, coupled with August\u2019s sharp downward revision from +54K to a 3K loss. The soft labor picture amplified bets for a Federal Reserve rate cut in October, now priced at 100%, while the probability of another in December surged to 86% from 60% just a week ago. The U.S. government shutdown and waning fiscal momentum add further drag to the greenback\u2019s outlook, deepening pressure across dollar pairs including USD/JPY, which now tests the lower end of its key short-term range.\nFed Easing and Political Tension Undermine Dollar Strength\nMarket pricing reflects growing anxiety about Fed independence as President Trump\u2019s administration considers reshuffling key governors. The potential removal of Lisa Cook from the Fed Board and speculation about Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s tenure after May have sparked fears of a dovish bias, weakening the policy credibility that supported the dollar through midyear. Swaps now imply 100 basis points of cuts by July 2026, front-loaded through two 25-basis-point moves before year-end. Beyond rate speculation, fiscal instability from the shutdown and rising Treasury issuance costs have tightened liquidity and curbed the greenback\u2019s resilience, breaking the long-standing correlation between USD/JPY and U.S. yields that was fractured earlier this year by the \u201cSell America\u201d episode following the Liberation Day tariffs.\nJapan\u2019s Policy Shift Adds to Yen Tailwinds\nOn the other side of the trade, the Japanese yen remains buoyed by the Bank of Japan\u2019s hawkish policy pivot. The recent Summary of Opinions hinted that some board members advocated a rate hike as early as October, an uncommon stance under Governor Ueda\u2019s leadership. Market odds of a 25-basis-point hike have climbed to 80% for November and are nearly fully priced for January 2026. Inflation momentum in Tokyo CPI readings, steady wage growth, and higher household consumption have strengthened the case for gradual normalization. The impending Liberal Democratic Party leadership election could reinforce policy continuity, as frontrunner Sanae Takaichi has signaled tolerance for modest rate increases to protect purchasing power. These dynamics make the yen a rare haven play amid global easing cycles, drawing renewed inflows into short-term JPY assets.\nTechnical Reversal: Double Bottom Formation and Range Compression\nFrom a technical standpoint, USD/JPY has established a double-bottom pattern near 146.50, confirming interim support after repeated failures to breach 151.00 resistance since April. The average true range (ATR) has contracted to 109 pips, down from the 90-day average of 126 pips, reflecting volatility compression before a likely breakout. RSI oscillates near 52, suggesting neutral momentum with a slight bullish bias, while MACD has crossed the signal line from below, hinting at early accumulation. A sustained push above 147.73, the immediate slope resistance, would target the 1.618 Fibonacci projection at 147.84, followed by 148.90 and 150.25. Conversely, failure to defend 146.40 exposes deeper retracement toward 142.50 and 140.25, levels tied to the 2025 trendline base.\nMacro Correlation and U.S. Yield Dynamics\nThe pair\u2019s historic link with Treasury yields weakened earlier in 2025, but it is now slowly rebuilding. Ten-year yields trade near 3.88%, down from 4.21% in August, compressing the interest rate differential with Japan to"

The pair holds between 1.3890 and 1.3980, indicating robust buying demand.

Rising inflation and labor market instabilities could keep U.S. Treasury yields high.\nOn the other hand, Canadian economic dependence on oil exports and global growth challenges could keep the CAD on its back foot. Even though the Canadian dollar recovered by the end of the week, it still saw a 0.1% weekly decline.\nThis marks its second weekly loss, hitting its lowest level since May earlier this week. Analysts credit the Loonie\u2019s weak performance to the declining crude oil prices and a downturn in the Canadian trade. Although oil rose 1% to $61.06 per barrel, it braced for a weekly dip amid the news that OPEC+ nations could increase production.\nIn light of these events, USD/CAD stays a strong candidate for USD-strength trades as we enter the fourth quarter, with the probability of challenging the 1.4000 level.\nUSD/CAD Key Events Next Week\nSome of the major events happening next week include:\n- Fed\u2019s Bostic Speech (Tuesday).\n- International Merchandise Trade (Tuesday).\n- FOMC minutes (Wednesday).\n- Initial Jobless Claims (Thursday).\n- Change in Employment (Friday).\n- Average Hourly Wages (Friday).\n- Unemployment Rate (Friday).\n- Participation Rate (Friday).\nUSD/CAD Weekly Technical Forecast: Make or Break at 1.4000\nTechnically, in the USD/CAD pair, the price is challenging a resistance level near 1.3969, staying closer to the highs from late August. The price is consistently rising above the 50-day (green), 100-day (yellow), and 200-day moving averages.

Takaichi would become the first female Prime Minister of Japan and is expected to oppose any further monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). This, along with the prevalent risk-on environment, is seen exerting intense pressure on the safe-haven JPY.\nMeanwhile, a steep decline in the JPY provides a strong boost to the US Dollar (USD) and pushes the USD/JPY pair beyond the 150.00 psychological mark during the Asian session. That said, the growing acceptance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs two more times this year and concerns that a prolonged US government shutdown could impact the US economic performance could act as a headwind for the USD. This, in turn, might cap gains for the currency pair.\nJapanese Yen retains bearish bias as Takaichi's win sparks fiscal easing bets, tempers BoJ rate hike bets\n- Sanae Takaichi was elected as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a run-off election held on Saturday and is now expected to be confirmed as Japan's first female Prime Minister during a parliamentary session in mid-October. Takaichi stood out in the race as the only proponent of big spending and loose monetary policy.\n- Expectations for more expansionary economic policies could complicate the Bank of Japan's task and also seem to have raised the chances that the central bank will avoid raising interest rates this month. The optimism lifts Japan's Nikkei 225 to a fresh record high and weighs heavily on the Japanese Yen during the Asian session on Monday.\n- Meanwhile, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated last week that the central bank will raise interest rates if the economy and prices move in line with forecasts. Moreover, markets are fully pricing in another rate increase by the BoJ early next year, which might continue to offer some support to the JPY and help limit deeper losses.\n- The BoJ's hawkish stance marks a significant divergence in comparison to rising bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs in October and in December. Adding to this, concerns about the economic impact of a US government shutdown might keep a lid on any further USD appreciation and cap the USD/JPY pair.\n- Important US macro releases scheduled at the start of a new month have been delayed due to the government closure, leaving the USD at the mercy of speeches from influential FOMC members. This, along with the broader risk sentiment, could drive the USD/JPY pair ahead of Japan's Household Spending data due for release on Tuesday.\nUSD/JPY seems poised to climb further following an intraday breakout above 150.00\nFrom a technical perspective, last week's bounce from the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a subsequent move up beyond the 150.00 round figure will be seen as a fresh trigger for the USD/JPY bulls. Given that oscillators on the daily chart have again started gaining positive traction, spot prices might then aim to test the August monthly swing high, around the 151.00 neighborhood, with some intermediate resistance near the 150.65-150.70 region.\nOn the flip side, any corrective slide below the 149.40 immediate support could be seen as a buying opportunity and remain limited near the Asian session low, around the 149.00 mark.

Just a week ago, Yen-weakness was all the range and as I highlighted, caution should be exercised when chasing breakouts in USD/JPY, as several bull traps have shown so far in the pair this year.\nLo and behold, USD/JPY pushed up towards the 150.00 level and fell just four pips shy of testing the big figure on Thursday. And then on Friday, a mild pullback showed. But after this week\u2019s open, Yen bulls and USD/JPY bears were very much on the attack and the pair has pushed right back down to range support. This has happened even as the decline in the US Dollar has been more moderate, illustrating the oncoming Yen-strength that\u2019s shown so far over the past week, begging the question as to whether we\u2019re on the cusp of a significant trend as Q4 trade gets underway.\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/JPY\nThe reversal has been perhaps a bit cleaner in EUR/JPY. I\u2019ve talked about the 175.00 level there quite a bit as that\u2019s been a rather dramatic price for the pair. There was one single daily close above that level last year \u2013 and that was the day before the start of the 2,000+ pip reversal, which was driven by both weaker US inflation and another round of intervention from the Bank of Japan.\nMore recently, bulls had started to show signs of stalling at that level but they were showing more and more willingness to test it when I updated on the pair last Wednesday.\nBut \u2013 as that stalling had started near the 175 level a rising wedge formation built \u2013 which is often approached with aim of bearish reversal. And that\u2019s what\u2019s played out so far this week with the pair dropping by more than 250 pips from that prior high.\nEUR/JPY Four-Hour Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/JPY: The Support Test\nSellers have been in firm control so far this week and there\u2019s now a support test taking place at a level that had held the lows in the first-half of September. This draws back to a Fibonacci retracement that set up in late-July, something that had impact through August and September trade. There was a steady build of support at the 38.2% retracement in the second-half of August, and then a show of resistance at the prior high of 173.90 in early-September. The pullback from that move held support at the 61.8% retracement \u2013 the same that is in-play right now after having set the low for yesterday. And even the rally from that support last month aligned with the Fibonacci setup \u2013 as the high printed right at the 127.2% extension of the July pullback move, just above the 175.00 handle.\nEUR/JPY Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/JPY\nWhile EUR/JPY can retain a case for bullish continuation and USD/JPY is holding range support which, in the longer-term backdrop of the pair can similarly be approached with a bullish bias, the picture in GBP/JPY is less optimistic on the long side after four intense days of selling.\nThe pair put in several tests of the 200.00 handle but ultimately was unable to remain above that price, and the pullback after the BoJ meeting last month has, so far, led into a pattern of lower-lows and highs that\u2019s intensified this week.

The technical analysis of the daily chart indicates strengthening of a bullish bias as the currency cross has broken above the ascending channel pattern.\nAdditionally, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) rises toward the 70 mark, suggesting that bearish bias is strengthening. A break above the 70 mark would suggest an overbought situation and a downward correction anytime soon. Additionally, the short-term price momentum is stronger as the EUR/JPY cross is positioned above the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\nOn the upside, the EUR/JPY cross reached an all-time high of 176.24, which was recorded on October 6. As the market bias is bullish, the cross may explore the region around the psychological level of 177.00.\nA pullback toward the ascending channel would prompt the EUR/JPY cross to test the nine-day EMA of 174.02. Further declines would weaken the short-term price momentum and put downward pressure on the currency cross to approach the lower boundary of the channel around 173.00, followed by the 50-day EMA at 172.64.\nA break below the 50-day EMA would weaken the medium-term price momentum and put downward pressure on the EUR/JPY cross to navigate the region around the three-month low of 169.72, recorded on July 31.\nEUR/JPY: Daily Chart\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "AUD/JPY rallies beyond 99.00, highest since November as fiscal easing bets pressure JPY\n- AUD/JPY opens with a bullish gap in reaction to Sanae Takaichi\u2019s election as the leader of Japan's ruling LDP.\n- The BoJ could delay raising interest rates amid hopes for more stimulus, which weighs heavily on the JPY.\n- Japan's Nikkei 225 rallies to a fresh record high amid stimulus hopes and also benefits the risk-sensitive Aussie.\nThe AUD/JPY cross builds on its weekly bullish gap opening and rallies to the 99.30 area, or its highest level since November 2024, during the Asian session. The strong intraday move up is exclusively sponsored by the heavily offered tone surrounding the Japanese Yen (JPY), which backs the case for a further near-term appreciating move.\nSanae Takaichi was elected as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a run-off election on Saturday and is expected to be confirmed as Japan's first female Prime Minister during a parliamentary session in mid-October. Takaichi is viewed as a fiscal dove and could announce more expansionary policies to support the economy. This, in turn, raised chances that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will avoid raising interest rates this month, which, in turn, is prompts aggressive selling around the JPY and provides a strong boost to the AUD/JPY cross.\nMeanwhile, hopes for more stimulus lifts Japan's Nikkei 225 to a fresh record high and further contribute to the safe-haven JPY's relative underperformance against the perceived riskier Aussie. Apart from this, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish outlook turns out to be another factor underpinning the Australian Dollar (AUD), which, in turn, validates the near-term positive outlook for the AUD/JPY cross. The RBA decided to leave the Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 3.6% at the end of the September monetary policy meeting last week.\nIn the accompanying policy statement, the central bank noted that the decline in underlying inflation has slowed and that inflation in the September quarter may be higher than expected at the time of the August meeting. This, in turn, reduces the odds of additional interest rate cuts by the RBA and favors the AUD bulls. Moreover, a breakout through the 99.00 mark suggests that the path of least resistance for the AUD/JPY cross is to the upside.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

This boost has solidified Bitcoin\u2019s role in the so-called \u201cTrump trade,\u201d with the president-elect\u2019s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class.\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: \u201cDoes Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?\u201d or \u201cWill Bitcoin go up?\u201d or \u201cWhere will Bitcoin be in 5 years?\u201d Let\u2019s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.\nOverview\nBitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis\nBitcoin price analysis\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faces bullish pressure toward $123K\n- Resistance for BTC is at $126,005\n- Support for BTC/USD is at $121,716\nThe BTC price analysis for 5 October confirms that BTC faces a surge in bullish volatility as the price moves around $123K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bullish channel.\nBTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces bullish pressure toward $123K\nAnalyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bullish pressure as it hovers around $123K. Currently, the BTC price is facing buying domination around immediate resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.65B, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $122,749, surging by over 0.77% in the last 24 hours.\nThe RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 69, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.\nBTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines\nThe 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines.

However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value.

                "body": "Bitcoin Keeps Breaking Records, But Each Halving Cycle Delivers Smaller Gains\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) historical price trajectory highlights a clear pattern. While the asset has consistently climbed to new highs after each halving, the gains have diminished.\nIn fact, new research revealed that \u201cthe degree of post-halving price gains has compressed over time since the second halving.\u201d\nReturns Are Shrinking Fast\nHalvings, which reduce the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation, have slashed block rewards by 87.5% since 2012 \u2013 from 25 BTC to the current 3.125 BTC. This has fueled scarcity narratives that have long supported upward price momentum. Over this period, Bitcoin\u2019s value has surged more than 9,110-fold, hitting $109,000 on September 1, 2025. A month later, the crypto asset has risen above $120,000.\nDespite this, CoinGecko stated that the magnitude of returns post-halving has waned. The second halving cycle in 2017 delivered peak gains of 29x, the 2021 cycle dropped to 6.7x, and the latest run in 2025 has seen a comparatively modest 93.1% increase.\nInterestingly, the cycle\u2019s rhythm changed when Bitcoin posted a record $73,400 in March 2024 \u2013 months before the fourth halving -challenging historical expectations. Meanwhile, market activity has exploded, as evidenced by daily trading volumes surging from approximately $20 million in 2013 to nearly $30 billion in 2025.\nThis has not deterred publicly listed companies from increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. As of October 3rd, 1,040,061 BTC was held by almost 200 listed firms, which is almost 5% of the total BTC supply. Strategy leads with 640,031 BTC. According to data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries, this represents 63.2% of all corporate-held Bitcoin, and added another 4,048 BTC on September 2.\nSeveral new companies are making significant moves into Bitcoin. Twenty One, backed by Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and SoftBank, has purchased 43,514 BTC since May. It has now become the third-largest corporate holder. Meanwhile, US-based healthcare firm KindlyMD expanded its holdings through a merger with Nakamoto BTC Holdings, and added 5,765 BTC. It had also announced plans to raise $5 billion for treasury growth.\nYou may also like:\n- Bitcoin (BTC) Could Surge to $170K in Q4: Report\n- Bitcoin\u2019s Bull Run Backed by Growing Long-Term Holders\n- Will Markets Move Even Higher When $3.3B Bitcoin Options Expire\nInternationally, organizations like MetaPlanet in Japan and Treasury BV in Europe are building sizable Bitcoin treasuries, with Treasury BV raising $147 million to acquire more than 1,000 BTC.\nBitcoin\u2019s Backbone Strengthens\nWhile institutional holdings climb, the network itself has seen remarkable expansion in computational power. The Bitcoin network\u2019s mining hash rate has been on a steady upward trajectory, as participation from both individual miners and institutional players has kept growing. Over the past year alone, the hash rate surged 88%, from 670 million TH/s to 1.266 ZH/s.\nUnder the Trump administration, the US mining ecosystem has expanded, aided in part by the relocation of Chinese mining hardware manufacturers such as Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT to the US, spurred by tariffs and regulatory pressures.\nMeanwhile, domestic firms including HIVE, Hut 8, Marathon, and CleanSpark are increasingly prioritizing alternative energy sources for new facilities.

                "body": "Analysts remain bullish on the Ethereum price, with projections suggesting ETH could climb to $6,500 by November as institutional inflows and network upgrades drive demand for ETH. The combination of ETF interest and developer activity continues to cement Ethereum as the dominant smart contract platform. But while ETH\u2019s growth outlook is strong, many investors are hunting for higher multiples \u2014 and tokens like Chainlink (LINK) and Layer Brett (LBRETT) are being tipped as the plays that could deliver gains up to 1500%.\nEthereum price outlook: Strength into year-end\nEthereum has been consolidating within a strong upward trend, benefiting from billions in ETF inflows and more than 33 million ETH locked in staking contracts. This supply squeeze is one of the biggest catalysts behind the bullish outlook, as fewer coins are available on exchanges. Analysts argue that once ETH reclaims momentum above key resistance zones, a push to $6,500 is likely within reach.\nUpgrades on Ethereum\u2019s roadmap \u2014 focused on scaling, fee reduction and improved network efficiency \u2014 are also helping investor confidence. These improvements set the stage for a surge in Layer 2 adoption, making ETH the backbone of decentralized finance, NFTs and on-chain innovation.\nChainlink: The oracle powering DeFi\nAlongside Ethereum, Chainlink (LINK) continues to solidify its role as the leading oracle provider for the blockchain ecosystem. DeFi protocols, gaming projects and enterprise integrations all rely on Chainlink for real-world data feeds. Analysts suggest that if ETH breaks higher, LINK could ride the wave of renewed DeFi activity, with some calling for a 5x\u201310x surge over the next cycle.\nLINK has historically rallied alongside ETH during bullish periods, and with its new cross-chain initiatives, its utility is expanding even further. For traders seeking exposure to infrastructure plays that benefit directly from Ethereum\u2019s growth, Chainlink remains a clear contender.\nLayer Brett: Meme power meets Ethereum Layer 2\nThe token drawing the most attention, however, is Layer Brett. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, LBRETT combines near-instant, ultra-low-cost transactions with meme-driven branding and viral community engagement. Unlike many meme coins, it offers both utility and culture \u2014 a combination that analysts say gives it one of the highest upside potentials heading into 2026.\nKey highlights fueling LBRETT momentum:\n- Ethereum Layer 2 scalability \u2013 instant, cheap and secure transactions\n- Over $4.2M raised in presale revenue already\n- 614% staking rewards still available for early adopters\n- More than 10,000 holders and growing rapidly\n- Viral social traction across X, Telegram and Discord\n- Analyst projections \u2013 tipped for 50x\u2013100x returns by 2026\nWith Ethereum\u2019s rise expected to drive fresh demand for scalable solutions, LBRETT is positioned at the crossroads of utility and meme hype \u2014 a rare blend that could send it soaring.\nFinal shot: Position before November\nThe bullish Ethereum price outlook suggests ETH could hit $6,500 before year-end but traders seeking 10x or more are eyeing plays like Chainlink and Layer Brett. As capital rotates into high-upside tokens, these ETH-linked projects could be the biggest winners of Q4. Missing out especially on Layer Brett (LBRETT) could mean paying a premium later.\nThe Layer Brett presale is live \u2014 secure your tokens now before the next stage sells out and staking rewards shrink.\nWebsite: https://layerbrett.com\nTelegram: https://t.me/layerbrett\nX: https://x.com/LayerBrett"

However, research suggests bitcoin\nSome 77% of bitcoin holders have never tried a BTCFi platform, according to a survey of more than 700 respondents across North America and Europe by BTC mining ecosystem GoMining. Just over 10% reported having experimented once or twice, while only 8% said they actively use BTCFi services for yield or lending.\nThe survey highlights a stark disconnect between the sector\u2019s promise and its actual reach.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous appetite for these opportunities, but the industry has built products for crypto natives, not for everyday bitcoin holders,\u201d said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan in a statement.\nThat appetite shows up in the data: 73% of respondents expressed interest in earning yield on their BTC through lending or staking, while 42% want access to liquidity without selling. Yet hesitation dominates. More than 40% said they would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products, underscoring the sector\u2019s trust and complexity problem.\nAwareness Gap\nPerhaps most striking is how invisible the industry still is. GoMining found that 65% of Bitcoin holders couldn\u2019t name a single BTCFi project.\nDespite millions in venture funding, BTCFi platforms appear to be speaking mainly to themselves rather than the market they\u2019re built to serve.\nThe report argues that BTCFi\u2019s adoption problem may stem from its reliance on Ethereum\u2019s DeFi model. Bitcoin users, GoMining suggests, are more conservative: they favor custodial services, regulated ETFs and simplicity over self-custody experiments and complex protocols.\n\u201cBitcoin holders aren\u2019t ether\nFor the industry, the survey is both a warning and an opportunity. Millions of Bitcoin holders want the yield and liquidity BTCFi promises, but they need to be met with products they can trust and understand.\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that the survey respondents were a \"random selection\" of just 700 GoMining users.\nGoMining is a digital BTC mining platform that connects users to real-world mining operations through Digital Miners non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a gamified ecosystem, so the survey's findings are subject to the extent to which its users represent typical bitcoin users.\n\"Our user base represents the bitcoin holders universe quite nicely,\" a GoMining spokesperson told CoinDesk over email. \"More than 80% of our users open their first crypto wallet with us and enter the Bitcoin ecosystem through our digital mining product.\"\nMore For You\nSolana\u2019s Upcoming Architectural Changes and Why They Matter\nVanEck says Solana\u2019s Alpenglow upgrade will make the network faster, more stable and easier to run, as developers prepare even deeper performance changes.\nWhat to know:\n- Asset manager VanEck says in a recent research report that Alpenglow, Solana\u2019s next big upgrade, will make the network faster, smoother, and easier to run.\n- The update should help Solana handle more activity while keeping costs low for users and operators.\n- Solana\u2019s team says Alpenglow will also bring new design changes that make the system more reliable over time."

                "body": "Ethereum has long been the crown jewel of smart contract platforms \u2014 the go-to chain for DeFi, NFTs, and more. But as 2025 unfolds, cracks are appearing in ETH\u2019s dominance: high gas fees, scaling challenges, and competition from aggressive new ecosystems. In the upcoming bull run, three contenders are emerging as potential outperformers: Tapzi (TAPZI), Remittix (RTX), and Avalanche (AVAX). Among them, Tapzi\u2019s presale momentum, unique GameFi model, and early entry give it an asymmetry many believe ETH no longer offers.\nThis article explores these best altcoins to buy now, tackles pain points in Ethereum, the opportunities ahead, and why Tapzi (TAPZI) may be the most compelling \u201cahead-of-ETH\u201d bet.\nEthereum\u2019s Headwinds: Why Challengers Have Room To Run\nEthereum\u2019s strengths are deep: network effects, developer tooling, and established DeFi/NFT ecosystems. But several limitations are mounting:\n- High transaction costs \u2014 During peaks, gas fees spike, pricing out everyday users.\n- Scalability tradeoffs \u2014 Even with rollups and Layer 2s, congestion and UX friction remain.\n- Competition in application layers \u2014 Newer chains are more aggressively optimizing for verticals like GameFi, payments, cross-chain bridging, etc.\nWhen whales, institutions, and retail capital look for higher ROI or smoother UX, newer entrants can take market share. That\u2019s where Tapzi, Remittix, and Avalanche come in.\nTapzi (TAPZI): The Gamefi Juggernaut In Presale Flight\nNow, onto the star of this article: Tapzi (TAPZI). Unlike Avalanche or Remittix (which compete indirectly with ETH), Tapzi competes in a vertical \u2014 GameFi / skill-to-earn \u2014 that Ethereum hasn\u2019t fully conquered. With Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2s and high gas costs, retail gaming UX has been hampered. Tapzi is positioning itself to capture that gap.\nTapzi\u2019s Highlights & Presale Momentum\n-\nPresale price: $0.0035 in the early stage.\n-\nExpected listing target: $0.01 (implying 3\u00d7 from presale to listing).\n-\nFunding traction: Tapzi has already crossed major presale milestones (>50 million raised), drawing investor attention.\n-\nUtility mechanics:\n- Stake TAPZI to enter competitive matches (Chess, Checkers, Rock-Paper-Scissors).\n- Match durations of ~5\u201315 minutes.\n- Rewards range from +10% to +200% depending on stake levels and opponent difficulty.\n- ELO-based matchmaking ensures fair pairing; AI anti-cheat systems monitor gameplay.\nBecause of these mechanics, Tapzi (TAPZI) is not a speculative meme token; it is the best altcoin to buy now with stability. Its value is tied to player engagement, staking demand, and ongoing utility.\nAvalanche (AVAX): Bridging Speed And Decentralized Ambition\nAvalanche (AVAX) is already one of the top challengers to Ethereum. Its core strengths:\n- High throughput & low latency \u2014 Avalanche\u2019s consensus architecture enables fast finality, making it competitive for DeFi and dApps.\n- Subnet flexibility \u2014 The ability to spin custom \u201csubnet\u201d blockchains gives projects tailored throughput, permissioning, and tokenomics.\n- Ecosystem support \u2014 Many DeFi and gaming projects are already building on AVAX, especially those seeking more favorable gas economics.\nThat said, Avalanche\u2019s market cap is already substantial. So while it can outperform ETH under certain conditions, the leverage it offers is more limited. If the next cycle is about vertical specialization (GameFi, payments, etc.), Avalanche will be a strong base layer contender but might not deliver 10x returns from here for early investors.\nRemittix (RTX): The PayFi Challenger Driving Financial Inclusion\nRemittix takes a very different approach compared to Ethereum\u2019s DeFi-first ecosystem. Instead of powering dApps and abstract financial instruments, RTX zeroes in on remittances, cross-border transfers, and real-world money movement. This sector directly impacts millions of families and workers worldwide.\n- Value Proposition: Remittix promises low-cost, high-speed settlements while leveraging cross-chain bridge liquidity to ensure funds move s"

Strengthening on-chain metrics and bullish derivative data signal rising investor confidence, with bulls setting their sights on the all-time high near $296.\nInvestors' growing confidence in SOL\nDeFiLlama data shows that Solana's stablecoin market capitalization currently stands at $15.11 billion, a new all-time high, and has been steadily rising since mid-September. Such stablecoin activity and value increase on the SOL project suggest a bullish outlook, as it boosts network usage and can attract more users to the ecosystem, driven by Decentralized Finance (DeFi), meme coins, and payment use cases.\nSolana Stablecoins market capitalization chart. Source: DefiLlama\nApart from growing the stablecoins market cap, Solana\u2019s Total Value Locked also rises from $10.78 billion on September 28 to $12.69 billion on Monday, nearing its record highs of $13.02 billion. Rising TVL indicates growing activity and interest within Solana\u2019s ecosystem, suggesting that more users are depositing or utilizing assets within SOL-based protocols.\nSolana TVL chart.

ETF filings, network upgrades, and DeFi expansion lift sentiment, but falling on-chain activity and declining CMF signal short-term pressure | That's TradingNEWS\nSOL-USD Momentum Builds Despite Fading On-Chain Participation\nSolana (SOL-USD) continues to capture investor attention as the market\u2019s momentum coin of October. The token trades around $229.40, only 1% lower on the day, after gaining more than 10.8% week-on-week and surpassing the $205 technical pivot. Market capitalization has risen to $126.1 billion, positioning Solana sixth among all cryptocurrencies. However, Glassnode data shows new wallet addresses have fallen to their lowest level in twelve months, suggesting enthusiasm among retail entrants is thinning even as prices rise.\nThis divergence is critical. Historically, shrinking participation during price rallies hints at momentum fatigue, and Solana\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator confirms the slowdown. The CMF sits near neutral territory, implying limited new capital inflows. Without renewed buying from either institutions or retail, the rally risks stalling below $232\u2013$250, the near-term resistance band visible on the daily chart.\nETF Speculation and Institutional Traction Fuel the Bull Narrative\nDespite weakening on-chain breadth, macro catalysts remain favorable. Major asset managers such as VanEck and Franklin Templeton have filed for Solana-based ETFs, following the SEC\u2019s streamlined approval pathway that recently green-lit XRP and Dogecoin spot funds. Traders now expect a potential Solana ETF announcement between October 6 and 10 2025. The mere prospect has amplified demand from structured-product desks, where Solana perpetual volumes exceeded $8.2 billion last session, even amid a 10.17% decline in turnover versus the prior day.\nInstitutional positioning remains cautious but constructive. Open interest in Solana futures on major exchanges sits 18% above September averages, indicating sustained speculative engagement. A confirmed ETF approval could propel SOL toward $262, aligning with the next Fibonacci extension level from its March-to-August rally.\nNetwork Upgrades Boost Throughput and Repair Credibility\nThe ongoing Alpenglow and Firedancer upgrades form the technical foundation of Solana\u2019s 2025 recovery narrative. Once complete, these updates are expected to increase throughput beyond 65,000 transactions per second and cut latency to under 400 milliseconds. Network fees average $0.02\u2013$0.03 per transaction \u2014 a fraction of Ethereum\u2019s median $0.60 \u2014 giving developers renewed confidence after last year\u2019s congestion episodes.\nDeFi activity is rebounding as well: total value locked (TVL) has stabilized near $7.3 billion, up 14% month-on-month. Still, some institutional allocators remain wary of prior outages, insisting on several quarters of stability before deploying large capital blocks.\nLiquidity Compression Signals Short-Term Volatility\nWhile technical structure remains bullish, liquidity trends flash caution. The Chaikin Money Flow has flattened, mirroring shrinking inflows from both new and existing investors. Whale-wallet transaction counts above $1 million have dropped 9% since mid-September. Should CMF slide further into negative territory, SOL could retest $221, its nearest support and a key retracement zone holding 38.2% of the latest rally\u2019s move.\nConversely, a decisive daily close above $232 would open the door to $242 and then $250, marking a full bullish continuation. Sustaining momentum beyond $250 could extend to $262\u2013$270, though that would require a rebound in participation metrics and stronger spot inflows.\nComparative Flows Shift Toward Emerging Altcoins and Presales\nA portion of the liquidity leaving Solana has migrated into new presale ecosystems such as Remittix (RTX) and Snorter (SNORT).

                "body": "Solana Price Prediction: Why Slowing Network Growth Could Limit SOL\u2019s Bullish Potential in the Short Term\nSolana (SOL) is currently trading at $229.84, up 1.54% in the past 24 hours; however, network data indicates a slowdown that could temper near-term bullish enthusiasm. According to Blockworks Research, Solana\u2019s Network Real Economic Value (REV) \u2014 which tracks transaction fees and out-of-protocol tips \u2014 has cooled considerably since its December 2024 peaks.\nBack then, weekly REV briefly surpassed $200 million, driven by surging decentralized exchange volumes and trading in memecoin.\nSince mid-2025, however, Solana\u2019s network activity has stabilized at a level closer to the $40\u2013$60 million range.\nThis normalization signals reduced user demand or transactional throughput, a factor that often limits the sustainability of price rallies when paired with technical resistance.\nSolana (SOL/USD) Technical Outlook: Channel Support in Focus\nOn the charts, the Solana price prediction appears bullish, as SOL is maintaining a rising channel structure, oscillating between support at $218 and resistance at $253.\nThe 50-day moving average ($218) and 100-day moving average ($217) are serving as dynamic support, reinforcing bullish structure despite the slowdown in on-chain metrics.\nCandlestick behavior reflects this balance \u2014 after facing rejection at $237, SOL is consolidating while printing higher lows, a pattern consistent with a market gathering strength before its next move. The RSI near 54 suggests a neutral setup, leaving room for either continuation or correction depending on whether buyers hold the channel base.\nShould SOL close above $237, the following targets lie at $244.85 and $253.44, in line with Fibonacci extension levels. Conversely, failure to defend $218 could expose SOL to a pullback toward $214 or $204, both of which have previously been tested as accumulation zones.\nSolana Long-Term Outlook: Fundamentals Still Intact\nWhile short-term activity has softened, Solana\u2019s broader ecosystem remains fundamentally strong. The blockchain continues to attract developer activity, with growing institutional interest in SOL-based tokenized assets and DeFi integrations.\nHowever, analysts warn that without a rebound in transaction-driven revenues, momentum may lag compared to its late-2024 highs.\nIn the near term, Solana\u2019s path depends on whether it can sustain both its technical structure and network usage. If demand accelerates alongside a confirmed breakout above $237, SOL could resume its upward trajectory toward $253, reaffirming its position as one of the leading altcoins heading into Q4 2025.\nPresale Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Blends Meme Power With Gym-Bro Energy\nMaxi Doge ($MAXI) is a meme-fueled token designed for degens who thrive on 1000x leverage and relentless hustle.

                "body": "October 5, 2025 \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are charting a robust upward trajectory, signaling a bullish start to trading as investors eagerly anticipate continued monetary easing from the Federal Reserve and maintain an insatiable appetite for artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. This market optimism is particularly palpable around key tech players like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), widely perceived to be in a \"buy zone,\" and Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), which appears poised for a significant rebound. These movements collectively underscore a market grappling with both technological transformation and evolving central bank strategies, with profound implications for the broader economy.\nThe current surge reflects a complex interplay of factors, including softer economic data that has bolstered expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and an unrelenting rally in AI-related stocks. Despite lingering concerns over market concentration and geopolitical uncertainties, the prevailing sentiment is one of resilience and growth, driven by the transformative potential of AI and a supportive monetary policy environment.\nThe Undercurrents of a Bullish Market: AI, The Fed, and Economic Shifts\nThe sustained rise in Dow Jones futures is a culmination of several powerful market-moving forces, shaping investor sentiment and driving strategic positioning across industries. A timeline of general market progression leading to this moment reveals a dynamic interaction between macroeconomic indicators, central bank decisions, and technological breakthroughs.\nIn recent months, market participants have closely monitored economic data, which, when showing signs of moderation or weakness (such as softer labor market reports or declining manufacturing indices), has paradoxically fueled market rallies. This is because such data often increases the likelihood of central banks adopting a more accommodative monetary policy. Indeed, expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have been a significant tailwind, as lower rates typically reduce borrowing costs for corporations, stimulate economic activity, and make equities more attractive relative to bonds. The market has priced in a high probability of further rate reductions, creating a favorable liquidity environment for risk assets.\nSimultaneously, the relentless march of technological innovation, particularly in Artificial Intelligence, has been a dominant theme. The AI revolution is not merely a sector-specific phenomenon but a fundamental shift driving productivity gains and creating new business models across the economy. News of breakthroughs in generative AI, new product launches, and robust earnings from leading AI companies have consistently ignited investor enthusiasm. This technological momentum has created a self-reinforcing cycle, where optimism about AI's transformative power drives investment, which in turn fuels further innovation and market gains.\nKey stakeholders in this environment include central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, whose policy pronouncements are meticulously scrutinized for clues on future rate decisions. Institutional investors, hedge funds, and retail traders are all actively positioning themselves to capitalize on these trends, using futures markets as an early indicator of market direction. Corporations, especially the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, influence the index through their earnings performance and strategic investments. The initial market reaction to these converging trends has been overwhelmingly bullish, with futures often signaling upward movements before the traditional trading day begins, reflecting widespread anticipation of continued growth.\nNvidia and Palantir: Bellwethers of the AI-Driven Economy\nThe current market rally is particularly illuminated by the strong performances and optimistic outlooks for companies at the forefront of the AI revolution, notably Nvidia and Palantir.

                "body": "The FTSE 100 leading index of shares has risen an impressive 12% since 1 January. But such healthy gains have not been universal, and some top-quality UK shares have dropped sharply for a variety of factors.\nI think these unloved FTSE 100 stocks could now prove great dip buys for long-term investors to consider. Here\u2019s why.\nGlencore\nGlencore\u2018s (LSE:GLEN) share price has recovered ground in recent months, but remains down 6% since the start of 2025. Commodities prices (like copper) have picked up but risks remain as China\u2019s manufacturing sector splutters.\nIndeed, latest purchasing managers index (PMI) data showed factory activity still shrinking in September. It marks the most protracted slump since 2019.\nEspecially worrying for Glencore are the troubles in China\u2019s steel industry. Strong steelmaking coal prices are essential to the miner\u2018s bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA slumped 14% in the first half as weakness endured.\nHowever, City analysts are confident Glencore\u2019s shares will rebound over the next 12 months. Worsening supply shortages in key markets are helping offset weak demand and driving industrial metals higher.\nWith these troubles becoming more widespread, broker consensus suggests Glencore will rise 9% in value between now and next October, to 375.6p per share. Analysts are also hopeful further interest rate cuts from global central banks will revive commodities consumption.\nOver the long term, Glencore has significant opportunities to grow profits thanks to the growing green and digital economies. Metals like copper, nickel, aluminium and cobalt play critical roles in industries like electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, consumer electronics and data centres.\nThe FTSE 100 company also has a sprawling marketing division to help it capitalise on these trends. Pleasingly, this unit also reduces Glencore\u2019s reliance on its mining operations to drive earnings.\nBarratt Redrow\nBarratt Redrow (LSE:BTRW) shares have retraced 11% since the start of 2025 amid rising worries over the housing sector.\nReturning inflationary pressures, and the impact on Bank of England interest rate policy, has seen the industry recovery moderating in recent months. So has enduring weakness in the domestic economy and a downturn in the jobs market.\nSpeculation that a new property tax may replace Stamp Duty is also hampering home sales. Latest HMRC data showed residential property transactions dipped 2% month on month in August.\nYet City analysts are unanimous in their belief Barratt Redrow\u2019s shares will stage a spectacular recovery. The average price target among them is 506.2p, representing a 31% premium from today\u2019s levels.\nDespite the current gloom among investors, there are reasons to be optimistic for Britain\u2019s largest housebuilder. Private reservations rates are improving nicely \u2014 up 16.4% in the first half, at 0.64 per week. It is also benefitting from accelerating cost benefits following last year\u2019s mega-merger, helping the enlarged business better weather current tough conditions.\nI think Barratt shares could recover as optimism builds over its long-term earnings picture. Demand for homes looks set to grow strongly as the domestic population booms. Government plans to ease planning restrictions should make it easier for housebuilders like this to capitalise on this favourable backdrop.\nFor patient investors, I think picking up quality FTSE 100 shares Glencore and Barratt is worth serious thought."

                "body": "Time for Germany's 'sugar rush' to hit: Mike Dolan\nBy Mike Dolan\nOne of the most transformative economic policy shifts in a turbulent year - Germany's market-moving fiscal boost - is about to kick in, but there's some trepidation about how all this spending and reform will actually pan out.\nDespite all the focus on Washington's sweeping upheavals over the past nine months, arguably the biggest macro market driver of 2025 has been Germany's post-election plan to lift its stifling, self-imposed debt brake and spend almost a trillion euros on defense and infrastructure.\nWhile the multi-year investment plan was always expected to truly begin hitting in 2026, markets almost immediately priced in a significant boost to the long-dormant growth potential of Europe's biggest economy as well as expected ripple effects across the continent.\nThis explains a sizeable chunk of the dollar's drop this year, as much as anything that's happened in Washington.\nThe euro's 13% surge against the greenback this year has all come since Germany's election in February. And this fiscal boost is one of the main reasons investors think the European Central Bank will not cut interest rates below the current 2% level through next year.\nExpectations of a borrowing binge have pushed up 10-year German bund yields almost 30 basis points this year, even as the ECB has cut rates by a full percentage point. And 30-year rates have climbed about 70bp.\nBut the real lift came to the equity market, with the German DAX benchmark up 22% in the year to date and the mid-cap MDAX index also up over 20%, both outstripping Wall Street benchmarks by almost 10 percentage points. The electrified euro defense sector has climbed a whopping 75% in 2025 thus far - more than three times the gains for Wall Street's megacap 'Magnificent Seven'.\nAnd even though euro zone aggregate corporate earnings growth estimates for 2025 have dwindled to zero, forecasts for 2026 have inflated to more than 12%.\nIn short, there's quite a lot riding on Germany delivering.\nThe problem is that the excitement around the plans went a bit flat over the summer amid wrangling over how and where the spending should be allocated, what vehicles should be used and how much of the other promised reforms will emerge in 2026.\n\"SUGAR AND PROTEIN\"\nDeutsche Bank argues that investor frustration at the lack of delivery so far is \"somewhat moot\", as nothing was ever likely to happen before the final quarter of this year anyway, as the 2025 budget law was only passed last month.\nChief economist Robin Winkler reckons the 2025 federal government draft implies a steep rise in spending in the fourth quarter, not least because the deficit through July was only running at about 41 billion euros against a plan for 143 billion euros, or 3.3% of GDP.\nHowever, he said investor concerns about existing spending items being shifted to the country's infrastructure fund are more \"substantive\" as this means less of this fund may now be used for new investment projects.\nAs a result, Deutsche Bank said its original estimate that the overall plan could lift potential German growth by about half a percentage point to 1% by the end of the decade looks \"increasingly hopeful\".\n\"The sugar rush is coming and likely to boost cyclical growth for a while,\" Winkler wrote late last month. \"Yet the long-term growth implications look dimmer than in the spring.\"\nWhat's just as important for business confidence, Deutsche argues, is the government's structural reform plan - the \"protein\" to back up the \"fiscal sugar\".\nAnd there's mixed progress on these. Areas such as reducing energy levies and red tape or speeding up planning processes are in the works for next year, but there's less movement on reforming social security, pension systems and work incentives or on changing the longer-term debt brake.\nEconomic data is sending mixed signals. German firms' six-month business expectations, captured by the monthly Ifo survey, hit the highest level in more than "

                "body": "Tech Stocks Hit New Record Highs Amid Rate Cut Anticipation\nAtrin Farnamfar\nStaff Writer\nFrom the smartphones in our pockets to the artificial intelligence shaping our future,\ntechnology has become the undeniable motor-engine of the modern economy. For investors,\nthis has translated into a rollercoaster of highs and lows. This week, we\u2019re firmly at the top of\nthe ride. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index soared to a new all-time high, fueled by\noptimism that the Federal Reserve may soon ease interest rates. What\u2019s fueling this surge, and\nis this a sign of sustained growth or simply a fleeting moment of market euphoria?\nWhat\u2019s Driving the Rally?\nThe primary catalyst for this record-setting week is mounting belief that the Federal Reserve\nwill begin cutting interest rates before year\u2019s end. Tech companies, especially those in\naggressive growth phases, are extremely sensitive to interest rate policy. Higher rates make\nborrowing money for R&D, expansion, and innovation more expensive, squeezing margins.\nThe prospect of lower rates acts as a shot of adrenaline for the sector. This optimism is rooted in recent inflation data showing signs of cooling, the narrative is that\npast rate hikes may finally be exerting downward pressure on price growth. That gives the\nFed some leeway to pivot from tightening to supporting growth.\nRecord Highs and Stock Leaders\nAs of October 2, 2025, the Nasdaq Composite closed at 22,844.05, marking a new all-time\nhigh. The S&P 500 also reached a fresh closing high of 6,715.35 on the same day.\nMajor tech names led the way. NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL)\nsaw outsize gains, with investors crowding into the top performers. In 2025 so far, NVDA is\nup about +35.5 % total return (with dividends reinvested), MSFT about +24.5 %, while\nAAPL is roughly +6%.\nReaction on Wall Street\nThe moment inflation prints surprised to the downside, market sentiment shifted rapidly. The\nS&P 500\u2019s rally broadening beyond just tech is a sign this optimism isn\u2019t isolated. Stocks that\nhad been penalized in a high-rate environment are seeing rebounds. Volatility has compressed as well, the market\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d the VIX, has drifted to lower levels, signaling high confidence among investors. Speculative names in AI, cloud software, and semiconductors saw some of the most dramatic jumps.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Investors and the Market?\nWhile the momentum is strong, investors know risk remains. All eyes will be on the next Fed\nmeeting, but there\u2019s a complication: due to the ongoing government shutdown, key economic\ndata (particularly the monthly jobs report) has been delayed, leaving the Fed with one less\nreliable signal to guide its decision.\nAny pushback from Fed Chair Jerome Powell against market expectations of rate cuts could\nrip the rug out from under this rally, especially with incomplete data muddying the waters.\nFor now, though, the bias is toward the bulls. With inflation cooling and AI-driven growth\nexpected to reshape industries, many see the conditions lining up for a longer leg higher in\ntech. Is this the start of a sustained bull run or just another bubble in waiting? In the world of\nfinance, only time will really tell.\nContact Atrin at atrin.farnamfar@student.shu.edu"

                "body": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) stock is up an impressive 110% over the last five years.\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nOver half a decade, Nasdaq managed to grow its earnings per share at 10% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Nasdaq's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\nWhat About Dividends?\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Nasdaq the TSR over the last 5 years was 125%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\nA Different Perspective\nIt's good to see that Nasdaq has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 23% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 18% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Nasdaq ."

                "body": "TORONTO -- Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s playoff career before Saturday was not befitting a $500 million franchise cornerstone. The Toronto Blue Jays first baseman managed just three hits in 25 plate appearances and didn't hit a ball over the fence across six games. More important, the six games, split into two-game slices over three postseasons, were all Blue Jays losses.\nThat all flipped in a 10-1 win over the New York Yankees, the franchise he has long openly despised, in Game 1 of the American League Division Series on Saturday.\nStarring in front of a raucous Rogers Centre crowd hungry for playoff baseball, Guerrero delivered an all-around clinic in the Blue Jays' first playoff win since Game 4 of the 2016 AL Championship Series with a diving catch and three hits to fuel an offensive explosion.\n\"He's the face of our franchise and a big reason why we go, a big part of why we're here,\" Blue Jays starter Kevin Gausman said. \"So it's been nice to see him have the night that he had.\"\nAt the plate, Guerrero swatted his first career postseason home run and finished 3-for-4 with two RBIs and a run scored to fuel an offense that pounded 14 hits, including three home runs and three doubles. Defensively, his diving catch of Ryan McMahon's lineout at first base -- while a bat shard whizzed by him -- initiated an inning-ending double play in the second.\nBlue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk complemented Guerrero's effort with his first two career postseason home runs. Right fielder Nathan Lukes contributed two hits, including a two-run double, with three RBIs and a diving catch down the right-field line. Shortstop Andres Gimenez went 2-for-4 as the Blue Jays chased Luis Gil after 2\u2154 innings and forced the Yankees to use six pitchers.\n\"I think having him get the scoring going, the double play at first with McMahon, it's nice,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said of Guerrero. \"It gives you a little bit of a jolt because it's Vlad and what he means to this team.\"\nGuerrero did not waste time in providing that energy, swatting a 90 mph changeup from Gil in the first inning to give the Blue Jays a lead they wouldn't relinquish. He added singles in the second and eighth innings and a sacrifice fly in the Blue Jays' game-busting four-run seventh, igniting the sellout crowd on a gorgeous day in Ontario with the building's roof open.\nThat it happened against New York was fitting. Guerrero's dislike of the Yankees, he has said, dates back to two incidents over two decades ago: the Yankees pulling a contract offer for his father, a Hall of Fame outfielder, in 2003 and Yankee Stadium security telling his father to take him off the field when he was a boy.\n\"For me, I bring the same energy every game regardless who I'm playing, especially now in the playoffs,\" Guerrero said. \"That's all I've got on my mind is to go out there and play hard.\"\nWhatever his motivation, the five-time All-Star has enjoyed facing the Yankees during his seven-year career. Entering Saturday's matchup -- the first ever between the two clubs in the postseason -- Guerrero was batting .302 with 22 home runs and a .918 OPS in 102 career games opposite the Yankees.\nHe improved those gaudy numbers Saturday, adding another highlight reel to a year that began with him committing to Toronto with a 14-year, $500 million contract extension in April and that he hopes ends with the franchise's first championship since 1993 later this month.\n\"For me, my goal always is to win a World Series, to bring the World Series here,\" Guerrero said. \"My father, he never had the chance to win a World Series. That's one of my goals, always been one of my goals, to do that for me, for him.\""

                "body": "LONDON \u2014 Despite being headlined by a genuine star and staged at one of London\u2019s premier theaters, a play about the foundation of a sprawling and troubled public service seemed unlikely to provoke night after night of standing ovations.\nBut that\u2019s what happened with \u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service.\nThe play, written by Tim Price and directed by Rufus Norris, came at an inflection point for the NHS, as it\u2019s known. Almost 80 years after it was founded, the medical service once touted as the envy of the world is \u201cbroken\u201d and suffering the \u201cbiggest crisis in its history,\u201d the government says. The crisis at this national bedrock is part of a bigger malaise at the heart of British culture: rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.\n\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d\nSheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.\nThough second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.\nNow, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.\nThrough all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)\nBut just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.\nIt\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d\nThough the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.\n\u201cWe have to figh"

                "body": "Elder Matthew S. Holland, General Authority Seventy, spoke during the Sunday afternoon session of October 2025 general conference about Jonah and not forsaking one\u2019s own mercy. The following is a summary of what he said.\nElder Holland\u2019s talk summary\nThere are powerful lessons in Jonah\u2019s experiences in the Old Testament \u2014 resisting a call to serve, willingness to sacrifice to help others, surviving a storm by being swallowed by a \u201cgreat fish,\u201d praying to be delivered, accepting the call to preach and saving a city (Jonah 1:17).\nBut when Jonah resents the mercy shown to his enemies, \u201cGod patiently teaches Jonah that He loves and seeks to rescue all His children.\u201d\nJonah shows how \u201call are fallen.\u201d\n\u201cHaving a doctrinal understanding and spiritual witness of why every single one of us struggles with moral, physical and situational challenges is a great blessing.\u201d\nA testimony of the Fall doesn\u2019t excuse sin, but it can \u201ctemper our frustrations when things just go wrong\u201d and point people to become more like God.\n\u201cEven greater than manifesting the effects of the Fall, Jonah\u2019s story powerfully directs us to Him who can deliver us from these effects.\u201d\nJonah\u2019s plea is a cry \u201cof a good man in crisis, one largely of his own making.\u201d\n\u201cMy plea, inspired by Jonah, is: Forsake not your own mercy. You have immediate access to divine help and healing despite your human flaws. This awe-inspiring mercy comes in and through Jesus Christ.\u201d\nNotable quotes\n\u201cHaving a doctrinal understanding and spiritual witness of why every single one of us struggle with moral, physical, and situational challenges is a great blessing.\u201d\n\u201cEven greater than manifesting the effects of the fall, Jonah\u2019s story powerfully directs us to Him who can deliver us from these effects.\u201d\n\u201cWhether we are facing a deep, Jonah-like catastrophe, or the every-day challenges of our imperfect world, the invitation is the same, forsake not your own mercy.\u201d\nWho is Elder Holland?\n- Elder Matthew S. Holland is the oldest son of Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n- Born in Provo, Utah, he also spent time in his growing up years in California, Washington and Connecticut before his family returned to Utah where his father eventually became president of Brigham Young University.\n- He has spent two periods of his life in North Carolina: first as a young graduate student at Duke University and then again when he and his wife were called to head the North Carolina Raleigh Mission in 2018.\n- He served as president of Utah Valley University from 2009 until 2018.\n- He is married to Paige Batemen, and they are the parents of four children.\nWhat has Elder Holland done recently?\n- He spoke on \u201cThe Exquisite Gift of the Son\u201d in the October 2020 general conference. He also spoke in the April 1983 general conference as a teenager.\n- Elder Holland, who leads the Church\u2019s Church\u2019s global communications efforts, was at the Eighth Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, held at the Palace of Independence in Astana, Kazakhstan, in September 2025. He spoke during a special session on preserving sacred spaces, saying protecting holy ground has never been more important.\n- Elder Holland represented the Church of Jesus Christ at the inauguration Mass for Pope Leo XIV in May 2025 and delivered the congratulatory letter from the First Presidency to the Vatican.\n- He was the keynote speaker at the 2024 Patriotic Service, part of the America\u2019s Freedom Festival at Provo, Utah, in July 2024.\n- He was at the rededication of the St. George Utah Temple on Sunday, Dec. 10, 2023.

Yaskawa Electric Corp jumped over 20%, while Japan Steel Works was up 14%. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries added 13% and 12% respectively.\nGiven the government's economic policy of a \"high-pressure economy,\" Takaichi is likely to ask the Bank of Japan to maintain its accommodative monetary policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB wrote in a note over the weekend following the results, adding that she would be open to a 25-basis-point rate hike by the BOJ by January 2026.\n\"A Takaichi administration, recognising that the current economy is still weak, is expected to completely shift policy direction to a new approach (complete overhaul) that seeks to expand investment and demand through public-private partnerships,\" CA-CIB's note said.\nSimilarly, the Topix rose as much as 3% to hit an all-time high.\nThe yen weakened by over 1.72% to briefly hit the psychological mark of 150 against the greenback, before going to 149.97 per dollar.\nThe last time the yen weakened to the 150-level was in August, according to data from LSEG, raising concerns from Japan's finance minister Katsunobu Kato. In October 2022, the yen briefly weakened beyond the 151 mark against the dollar, which prompted an intervention by the country's Ministry of Finance.\nLoading chart...\n\"Our base case is for near-term losses in the JPY towards 150 as the market adjusts to the surprise, but not material weakness beyond,\" Deutsche Bank wrote in a note published Monday.\nWhile the probability of a hike by the Bank of Japan in October should fall, the market has only been pricing a terminal rate around 1%, which may still be achievable under Takaichi's leadership.\n\"A weak yen has been contributing to domestic concerns from overtourism to property price, so further weakness from already depressed levels could be unwelcome even for the government,\" the analysts added.\nJapan's 30-year bond yield rose over 10 basis points to 3.263%, while the yield on the 20-year debt added over six basis points to 2.674%. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is little changed at around 1.659%.\nAustralia's ASX/S&P 200 rose 0.19%.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.22%, while the Hang Seng Tech Index declined 0.66%.\nChinese and South Korean markets were closed for holidays.\nLast Friday in the U.S., the three major averages closed higher.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, trading higher by 238.56 points, or 0.51%, to finish at 46,758.28.

On Monday (October 6), Japan's stock market surged while the yen fell to a near nine-week low against the US dollar. Asian equities climbed to record highs, led by Japanese shares, while gold prices reached new all-time highs and Bitcoin hovered near recent peaks.\nThe Nikkei 225 index soared over 4%, marking its largest single-day gain since April. The MSCI Asia-Pacific stock index rose for a sixth consecutive day, pushing it to a new high. US stock futures also advanced.\n(Source: Bloomberg)\nFollowing her victory in the Liberal Democratic Party leadership election on Saturday, Sanae Takaichi is expected to become Japan\u2019s first female prime minister in a parliamentary vote later this month. Investors had anticipated that Shinjiro Koizumi, from a prominent political family, would win; he was seen as more fiscally cautious and likely to allow the Bank of Japan to continue normalizing monetary policy.\nThe yen plummeted 1.5% against the US dollar, moving closer to the closely watched level of 150 yen per dollar. The yen also dropped to an all-time low against the euro. Meanwhile, Japan's 40-year government bond yield rose by 14 basis points to 3.52%. #Yen Depreciation#\n(Source: Bloomberg)\nAnna Wu, Cross-Asset Investment Strategist at VanEck Australia, commented: \"This could be more positive for equities. Given her overall fiscal policy stance, I wouldn't be overly surprised if long-term bond yields edged higher on Monday.\"\nAs the US government shutdown continued, investors flocked to safe-haven assets, driving gold prices to another record high at the start of the week. Spot gold hit a record peak of $3,920.77 per ounce, surging nearly $35 in a single day.\nDriven by a broader risk rebound triggered by the U.S. government shutdown and widespread optimism surrounding the 'October rally,' Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged past the US$125,000 mark, setting a new all-time high.\nRichard Kaye, Co-Head of Japanese Equity Strategy at Comgest Asset Management, noted that domestically oriented stocks and small-cap equities may gain support driven by expectations of economic growth, while bank stocks, which had previously risen on rate hike expectations, could face pressure.\nThe rise in Asian stock markets and U.S. futures indicates that the tech stock rally fueled by artificial intelligence bets will resume after a brief pause on Friday. Despite the absence of key non-farm payroll data due to the U.S. government shutdown, swap traders remain confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by another 25 basis points in October.\nCharu Chanana, Chief Investment Strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore, stated, 'Dovish Japanese policies will increase global liquidity and generally support risk appetite. As long as yen carry trades continue, this tends to be positive for global equity and credit markets.'\nLast week, a series of new partnerships and OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, reaching a valuation of $500 billion, spurred market enthusiasm. This year, the stock market has repeatedly hit record highs, with prospects of accommodative monetary policy and resilient earnings enhancing optimism about artificial intelligence, further fueling bullish momentum.\nFrank Benzimra, Head of Asian Equity Strategy at Societe Generale in Hong Kong, stated, 'The U.S. economic situation is collectively driving all these markets. The timing of the Federal Reserve's rate cuts comes amid an economic environment that is not recessionary but accompanied by rising inflation risks. This is favorable for the U.S. stock and gold markets and also has implications for Asian markets.'"
