                "body": "What began as Trump\u2019s Liberation Day may end as China\u2019s says strategist\nGold prices have been soaring this year. And with each tick higher, more and more market pundits and investors are coming out of the woodwork, asserting that US dollar debasement is the reason. Is that the correct reason, or might gold be in a momentum-fueled speculative bubble like many other assets?\nThe answer has significant implications for the price of gold. If the answer is that reality aligns with current popular perceptions, gold prices\u2014despite recent increases\u2014may be fairly valued or even undervalued. However, if the answer reveals that the narrative is seriously flawed, gold prices could easily drop by 25-50% or more. To answer our questions, let\u2019s examine the popular definitions of dollar debasement promoted by those supporting the dollar debasement theory to determine if they are valid.\nThis article does not discuss the rationale of owning gold as a long-term asset. Instead, it questions the recent jump in gold prices and whether the current levels are fundamentally justified.\nThe following Bloomberg graph shows that the instances of media stories using the word \u201cdebasement\u201d are soaring.\nDefining US Dollar Debasement\nThe following bullet points are the most popular traits of dollar debasement:\n- Excessive increase in the money supply\n- Declining purchasing power\n- Loss of confidence in the currency\nInstead of assuming all or some of the three factors are facts, let\u2019s quantify them, put them into proper context, and see how well the debasement theory holds up.\nBefore proceeding, it\u2019s worth noting that the true definition of dollar debasement is different than those above. Per our article Debasement: What It Is And Isn\u2019t:\nConversely, debasement implies a structural dilution of a currency\u2019s value. This is vastly different than inflation. In a \u201cdebasement\u201d scenario, governments take conscious actions to reduce the \u201cstructure\u201d of the currency. In Rome, for example, the government reduced the amount of silver in minting coins to increase the number of coins produced to pay its creditors. However, debasement is not a reality in a fiat system like ours, where the linkage to gold or silver is nonexistent. In other words, when the government is \u201cprinting paper,\u201d it is impossible to dilute the \u201cstructure.\u201d\nRegardless of which definition of dollar debasement you prefer, the popular ones, bullet-pointed above, are what support the surge in gold prices. Accordingly, that\u2019s what matters for this discussion.\nExcessive Increase In The Money Supply\nThis is believed to happen when the government and/or the central bank print much more money than the economy demands. To appreciate how that could happen in America, it\u2019s essential to recognize that neither the Fed nor the government prints money. All money is lent into existence. Per our article Where Does Money Come From?:\nThe money supply changes based on the banking system\u2019s willingness and ability to lend money and consumers\u2019 demand and ability to borrow it.\nWhile the Fed doesn\u2019t print money, it can incentivize lending and borrowing, i.e., money creation, with its policies. They can also disincentivize money creation.\nCurrently, the Fed is disincentivizing money creation. As we share below, the Fed\u2019s Fed Funds rate is currently well above the current and expected inflation and economic growth rates. Furthermore, the Fed is reducing its balance sheet (QT) by $40 billion a month. Doing so leaves banks with fewer reserves to generate loans.\nBottom line: the Fed, via restrictive monetary policy, is disincentivizing money supply growth.\nThe government can borrow money, which in turn creates money. One can argue that their massive fiscal deficits over the past few years should be concerning from a money supply perspective. However, doing so fails to consider that banks have limited reserves. If they are forced to buy government debt, which is akin to making a loan, they have fewer reserves in which to lend to the publ"

                "body": "Gold Price Forecast - Defends $4,100 as Inflation Cools and Central Bank Demand Fuels $5,000 Outlook\nGold steadies near $4,115, finding support from global monetary easing, record bullion accumulation by central banks, and a weaker dollar | That's TradingNEWS\nGold (XAU/USD) Holds Above $4,100 as Inflation Cools and Fed Cut Bets Mount\nGold (XAU/USD) is trading near $4,115 per ounce, consolidating after its first weekly decline in over two months. The metal briefly dipped to $4,050 before rebounding as cooling inflation revived expectations for another Federal Reserve rate cut. The latest CPI reading of 3.0% year-over-year, below forecasts of 3.1%, strengthened investor conviction that the Fed will ease policy at its upcoming meeting. Despite a 2% weekly pullback from the recent $4,375/oz peak, gold continues to find solid support above the $4,000 mark, signaling that safe-haven demand remains intact even amid profit-taking and ETF outflows.\nCentral Bank Gold Purchases Drive a Global Supply Squeeze\nGlobal central banks continue to dominate the demand landscape, with record-breaking purchases that have reshaped gold\u2019s supply dynamics. Nations including China, India, and Turkey have accelerated accumulation programs, collectively purchasing thousands of tonnes of gold over the past year. China\u2019s central bank has now added to its reserves for twelve consecutive months, while emerging markets collectively account for over 70% of global central bank demand. This steady removal of physical gold from the LBMA and COMEX exchanges has created an ongoing supply deficit that mining production cannot offset. With mine output capped near 3,600 tonnes annually, and energy and ESG-related costs driving production expenses up to $1,600 per ounce, the structural imbalance continues to favor higher long-term prices.\nFed Policy and Dollar Weakness Reinforce Gold\u2019s Uptrend\nThe Fed\u2019s dovish shift remains the single most powerful short-term driver for gold. Market participants now expect the Federal Funds Rate to decline from 4.25% to 4.00%, a move that would further depress real yields and lift non-yielding assets like gold. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has weakened to around 103.4, its lowest level in two months, undercutting the greenback\u2019s global dominance. As more countries establish bilateral trade settlements outside of the U.S. dollar, demand for dollar alternatives has surged\u2014bolstering gold\u2019s value as a reserve asset. In this environment, XAU/USD remains supported by both monetary easing expectations and the structural erosion of dollar liquidity in global markets.\nGeopolitical Risks and Trade Tensions Sustain the Safe-Haven Premium\nHeightened geopolitical risk continues to feed gold\u2019s safe-haven narrative. Renewed conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, alongside escalating trade friction between the U.S. and China, have kept investors defensive. Recent tariff actions sent gold above $4,300/oz last week before profit-taking set in. With the U.S. government still facing a partial shutdown and fiscal negotiations at an impasse, global capital continues to flow into gold as a hedge against political instability and policy uncertainty. The persistent bid above $4,000 underscores that traders remain unwilling to reduce exposure ahead of the FOMC decision, suggesting that geopolitical hedging is now a structural feature of the market rather than a short-term trade.\nFutures Market Dynamics Highlight Controlled Consolidation\nOn the COMEX, December futures contracts trade near $4,120, with open interest slightly lower following a speculative surge earlier this month. Technical traders are closely watching the $4,200 resistance zone\u2014aligned with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the last up-leg. Support sits at $4,000\u2013$4,050, an area reinforced by consistent buying from Asian physical markets. The RSI at 46 and a cluster of Doji and spinning-top candles around $4,130 reflect indecision before the Fed announcement. A decisive breakout abov"

                "body": "The OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for October 2025 was published recently. The last month reported in most of the OPEC charts that follow is September 2025 and output reported for OPEC nations is crude oil output in thousands of barrels per day (kb/d). In the OPEC charts below the blue line with markers is monthly output and the thin red line is the centered twelve month average (CTMA) output.\nOPEC 12 output for July 2025 was revised higher by 25 kb/d and August 2025 output was revised lower by 32 kb/d compared to last month\u2019s report. OPEC 12 output increased by 524 kb/d with the largest increases from Saudi Arabia (248 kb/d), UAE (98 kb/d), Iraq (65 kb/d) and Iran (44 kb/d). Nigeria (-21 kb/d) saw decreased crude output. All other OPEC members had small increases of 27 kb/d or less (net increase for the 7 other OPEC members was 90 kb/d).\nThe chart above shows output from the Big 4 OPEC producers that are subject to output quotas (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, and Kuwait.) After the pandemic, Big 4 average output peaked in 2022 at a centered 12 month average (CTMA) of 20849 kb/d, crude output has been cut by 954 kb/d relative to the 2022 CTMA peak to 19895 kb/d in September 2025. The Big 4 may have about 954 kb/d of spare capacity when World demand calls for an increase in output. Since April 2025 the OPEC Big 4 have increased output from 18346 kb/d to 19895 kb/d, an increase of 1549 kb/d in just 5 months (an average monthly increase of 310 kb/d.) If the average rate of increase of the past 5 months continues for another 3 months, OPEC spare capacity will be reduced to 24 kb/d by the end of 2025.\nThe chart above shows the most recent 36 month average annual increase of 134 kb/d for the Other 6 OPEC group which excludes the Big 4 and Iran and Venezuela. Iran and Venezuela have seen their output rise over the past 3 years at an annual rate of 386 kb/d which I believe will fall to zero in the near future. The chart below shows the long term trend for the OPEC Other 6 which is roughly flat (a small average annual rate of decrease of 4 kb/d over the past 11 years.) I expect the Other 6 will see their output return to this flat trend in the next few years.\nRefinery crude throughput is a measure of World demand for C+C (though imperfect because some crude is burned directly in power plants in the middle east.) OPEC data shows the peak was 81.68 Mb/d in 2018. For the most recent 4 quarters the average World refinery throughput was 81.34 Mb/d, the previous 4 quarters had average refinery throughput at 81.00 Mb/d and 2024 had refinery throughput at 81.04 Mb/d. If the recent rate of increase continues (about a 450 kb/d annual rate of increase) we may see a new peak in annual average World refinery throughput in 2026.\nPreliminary August 2025 data show that OECD commercial inventories fell slightly by 0.5 Mb, m-o-m, to stand at 2,793 Mb. At this level, OECD commercial stocks were 45.7 Mb less than the same time last year, 92.2 Mb lower than the latest five-year average, and 192.0 Mb below the 2015\u20132019 average.\nOPEC has again reduced its estimate of US tight oil output in 2025 and 2026 compared to last month\u2019s report by 20 kb/d for both years.\nOPEC\u2019s estimate for US C+C output is a bit more pessimistic than the EIA\u2019s recent STEO where 13.53 Mb/d is forecast for annual US C+C in 2025 and 13.51 Mb/d in 2026, 210 kb/d less in 2025 for the OPEC estimate compared to the STEO and 300 kb/d less in 2026 for the OPEC estimate compared to the EIA forecast. Both agencies predict a near term peak in 2025 for US C+C. Also note that most of the increase in US liquids output in 2025 comes from increases in NGL output and all of the 2026 liquids increase in 2026 is due to higher NGL output according to OPEC estimates.\nLonger term the AEO 2025 reference case has US C+C output reaching a peak of 14 Mb/d in 2027, but that case also forecasts higher oil prices with average wellhead oil prices at about $84-86/b in 2024$ from 2024 to 2026, rising to $92/b in"

The latest 90-day share price return of 27.1% is impressive, and its 60.25% year-to-date gain suggests momentum is firmly on the side of shipping companies. Over the long haul, shareholders have enjoyed a stellar 155% total return over three years and a remarkable 495% over five, showing that Frontline\u2019s appeal extends well beyond short-term news events.\nIf you\u2019re interested in what else is gaining traction in markets, now is a smart time to broaden your search and discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership\nHowever, with Frontline already delivering significant gains and optimism riding high, the key question now is whether its stock still offers upside for new investors or if the market has already priced in future growth prospects.\nMost Popular Narrative: 10.8% Undervalued\nWith Frontline\u2019s last close at $23.54 and the most widely followed narrative forecasting fair value at $26.40, the share price sits notably below the consensus view. This suggests investors may be missing some powerful drivers beneath the surface, making it essential to understand the logic shaping this valuation.\nThe increase in compliant oil exports, that is, non-sanctioned sources from the US, Brazil, Guyana, and the Middle East, is driving longer trade routes, especially with more US Gulf exports heading to Asia.

The chart below shows the long term trend for the OPEC Other 6 which is roughly flat (a small average annual rate of decrease of 4 kb/d over the past 11 years.) I expect the Other 6 will see their output return to this flat trend in the next few years.\nRefinery crude throughput is a measure of World demand for C+C (though imperfect because some crude is burned directly in power plants in the middle east.) OPEC data shows the peak was 81.68 Mb/d in 2018. For the most recent 4 quarters the average World refinery throughput was 81.34 Mb/d, the previous 4 quarters had average refinery throughput at 81.00 Mb/d and 2024 had refinery throughput at 81.04 Mb/d. If the recent rate of increase continues (about a 450 kb/d annual rate of increase) we may see a new peak in annual average World refinery throughput in 2026.\nPreliminary August 2025 data show that OECD commercial inventories fell slightly by 0.5 Mb, m-o-m, to stand at 2,793 Mb. At this level, OECD commercial stocks were 45.7 Mb less than the same time last year, 92.2 Mb lower than the latest five-year average, and 192.0 Mb below the 2015\u20132019 average.\nOPEC has again reduced its estimate of US tight oil output in 2025 and 2026 compared to last month\u2019s report by 20 kb/d for both years.\nOPEC\u2019s estimate for US C+C output is a bit more pessimistic than the EIA\u2019s recent STEO where 13.53 Mb/d is forecast for annual US C+C in 2025 and 13.51 Mb/d in 2026, 210 kb/d less in 2025 for the OPEC estimate compared to the STEO and 300 kb/d less in 2026 for the OPEC estimate compared to the EIA forecast. Both agencies predict a near term peak in 2025 for US C+C. Also note that most of the increase in US liquids output in 2025 comes from increases in NGL output and all of the 2026 liquids increase in 2026 is due to higher NGL output according to OPEC estimates.\nLonger term the AEO 2025 reference case has US C+C output reaching a peak of 14 Mb/d in 2027, but that case also forecasts higher oil prices with average wellhead oil prices at about $84-86/b in 2024$ from 2024 to 2026, rising to $92/b in"

                "body": "The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in 1975 by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, signed into law by President Gerald Ford. It was established in response to the 1973-1974 oil embargo, which highlighted the U.S. economy\u2019s vulnerability to oil supply disruptions. Those who were around at the time, like your author, witnessed long lines at the gas stations as the price of a gallon of gas jumped as much as 43%. In fact, the national average cost of gas rose from about $0.385 per gallon in October 1973 to $0.551 per gallon in June 1974. Under President Biden\u2019s administration, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve released more than 200 million barrels of oil, primarily through emergency sales in 2022. The most significant release was 180 million barrels in response to supply disruptions caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. While a difficult situation, most feel that this was not what the SPR was created for.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points:\n- President Trump has pledged to buy 1 million barrels of oil to refill the SPR to a safe level.\n- With West Texas Intermediate hitting its lowest levels since 2021 recently, the President has picked the right time to buy and refill the SPR.\n- While 1 million barrels is small compared to the average daily trading volume of millions of barrels, it\u2019s an important move for the U.S. should we have an emergency need.\n- Millions of Americans keep making 5 basic mistakes with insurance and keep overpaying every year, sometimes by thousands of dollars. But, it\u2019s easy to avoid if you know how.\nOil prices fell below $60 per barrel recently due to a combination of oversupply and weak demand. Global oil inventories are rising, putting downward pressure on prices. At the same time, both OPEC+ and U.S. production are increasing amid relatively stable global oil demand. Some banks expect West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil Prices to Be Below $60 for the remainder of 2025. OPEC+ recently announced plans to unwind its production cuts; the increases are lower than those initially proposed. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects the price of crude oil to fall below the current $60 per barrel by the end of the year and average near $50 per barrel through 2026, as more supply is added to an already well-supplied market.\nWith benchmarks hitting 2025 lows and reaching levels not seen since 2021, it makes sense for investors to consider buying some of the biggest and best mega-cap integrated leaders. Five stocks make sense now; all pay dependable dividends, and all are rated Buy at major Wall Street firms.\nBP\nThis company is one of the premier European integrated oil giants, paying shareholders a substantial 5.71% dividend.

The muted U.S. CPI reading at 3.0%, slightly below expectations of 3.1%, has reinforced confidence that the Federal Reserve will proceed with a 25-basis-point rate cut, bringing its target range closer to 3.75%\u20134.00%. However, stronger U.S. manufacturing PMI at 52.2 and services PMI at 55.2, both marking multi-month highs, revealed that the American economy still retains momentum, complicating the Fed\u2019s dovish path. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), hovering at 98.94, managed a mild recovery, limiting the Euro\u2019s upside potential after its early-week gains toward 1.1650 were capped by resistance at the 100-day moving average (1.1658).\nEurozone Economic Recovery Offsets France\u2019s Fiscal Concerns\nAcross Europe, the narrative remains mixed. The latest HCOB Flash PMIs climbed to 50.0 for manufacturing and 52.6 for services, both exceeding expectations and signaling that the Eurozone\u2019s recovery momentum is gradually returning. Industrial production data from Eurostat showed a 0.8% month-over-month increase, driven by improved factory output in Germany and the Netherlands. Yet optimism was tempered after Moody\u2019s revised France\u2019s outlook to negative, warning that political uncertainty and fiscal deficits above 4.4% of GDP could hinder reform implementation. This downgrade added a layer of caution to Euro traders, with markets now expecting the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintain a restrictive stance through Q4 2025 to defend price stability near its 2% inflation goal.\nGovernment Shutdown and Trade Uncertainty Weigh on U.S. Sentiment\nIn the United States, the prolonged government shutdown\u2014now stretching into its fourth week\u2014has begun to erode business and consumer confidence. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index was revised lower to 53.6, missing expectations, while one-year inflation expectations eased slightly to 4.6%. According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report, the shutdown is shaving roughly $2 billion per week off Q4 GDP growth. Simultaneously, the Trump administration\u2019s renewed trade investigation into China has reignited uncertainty over global supply chains, curbing risk appetite and reinforcing defensive positions in the dollar. Traders remain cautious ahead of the FOMC decision, with the CME FedWatch Tool showing an 88% probability of a November rate cut, although mixed macro data keeps volatility subdued.\nTechnical Landscape: EUR/USD Trapped Between 1.1550 and 1.1660\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains neutral but slightly tilted toward the downside. The pair trades below its 20-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages, both converging near 1.1655, signaling a zone of resistance. Support holds at 1.1600, followed by 1.1550, where dip-buying has consistently emerged. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits below 50, indicating limited bullish momentum. A breakout above 1.1700 could trigger a run toward 1.1800, coinciding with the July highs, while a close below 1.1550 would expose the pair to the August low at 1.1390. Options data reflect a market expecting rangebound trading, with the Cboe EuroCurrency Volatility Index (EVZ) at 6.5, its lowest since August, suggesting limited hedging activity ahead of next week\u2019s Fed and ECB meetings.\nInstitutional Outlooks Diverge: Wells Fargo, ING, and RBC Split on EUR/USD\u2019s Path\nForecasts from major institutions underline the divergence in long-term outlooks.

It expects this combination will provide net dollar support.\nImportantly, the bank remains convinced that the US currency is not losing its reserve status in global markets.\nOfficial data has indicated that the proportion of reserves held in dollar reserves has declined, but Wells Fargo considers that the vast majority of this move is due to valuation changes rather than a structural move away from the US currency."

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast: Pound Struggles at 1.33 as U.S. CPI Falls to 2.8% and Growth Gap Widens\nSterling remains capped below 1.3350 after five days of losses, pressured by weak UK GDP (0.1%), sticky inflation, and strong U.S. data | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Faces Tight Consolidation as U.S. CPI Cools and Pound Struggles Near 1.33\nThe GBP/USD pair trades narrowly around 1.3325, stabilizing after five straight sessions of declines. Despite softer U.S. CPI data showing inflation at 2.8%, sterling has failed to gain momentum as the UK\u2019s sluggish Q3 GDP growth of just 0.1% weighs on sentiment. The currency pair oscillates in a short-term consolidation zone, supported slightly above the 1.3300 level but capped by resistance at the 100-hour moving average near 1.3354. The pound\u2019s inability to reclaim that resistance reflects persistent weakness stemming from inflation challenges, weak domestic demand, and policy uncertainty within the Bank of England\u2019s framework.\nDollar Strength Meets a Fragile Pound as Monetary Divergence Deepens\nThe U.S. dollar\u2019s resilience remains rooted in shifting market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, following a string of softer inflation reports. The CPI decline to 2.8% marks the third consecutive monthly slowdown, fueling speculation that the Fed could pivot earlier than initially projected. However, while this has temporarily eased dollar pressure, the broader macro environment still favors the greenback due to robust employment and consumer spending data in the U.S.\nIn contrast, the British pound continues to struggle under the weight of persistent inflation, forcing the Bank of England into a precarious stance. With consumer prices still exceeding forecasts and energy costs remaining high, policymakers are caught between controlling inflation and preventing recession. This divergence between U.S. and UK monetary policy has widened rate differentials, strengthening the dollar and leaving GBP/USD unable to mount a sustainable recovery.\nTechnical Crossroads: 1.3247 Support and 1.3350 Resistance Define the Battlefield\nFrom a technical standpoint, GBP/USD trades within a compressed channel defined by support at 1.3247 and resistance at 1.3350, with a clear downside bias. A decisive break below 1.3247 would open the path to the 1.3140 cluster, which includes the 38.2% retracement of the 1.2099\u20131.3787 range, a key technical confluence. Below that, traders are eyeing the 200-day moving average near 1.3225 as a critical pivot.\nOn the upside, reclaiming 1.3354 (the 100-hour moving average) would be the first signal of recovery, but momentum indicators remain weak, and RSI continues to hover around neutral territory. The failure of bulls to sustain rallies beyond 1.3340 after the CPI release shows that sellers remain firmly in control. Should sterling manage to break above 1.3526, it could trigger an acceleration toward 1.3725\u20131.3787, though that scenario requires a major shift in sentiment around UK growth prospects.\nMacro Headwinds: UK CPI Pressures, Stagnant Growth, and Policy Fatigue\nThe latest UK CPI report revealed inflation still running hot, eroding real wages and straining household budgets. Persistent inflation above the 2% target has cornered the BoE, limiting its room to maneuver. With GDP growth stuck at 0.1%, the UK economy risks stagflation \u2014 a toxic mix of slow growth and elevated prices.\nThe British pound\u2019s weakness also stems from investor doubts about the BoE\u2019s strategy. Market participants perceive hesitation within the central bank as inflation expectations remain unanchored.

                "body": "S&P 500, Nasdaq Forecast for The Week Ahead\nStocks set fresh all-time-highs on Friday with both SPX and NDX gapping at the open and refusing to fill that in, helped along by the Friday CPI report. Next week brings some massive drivers with the Fed and Core PCE report set for release on Friday.\nThe tariff scare of two weeks ago is now firmly in the rear view as stocks were able to overtake prior highs this week, helped along by a strong opening gap on Friday following the CPI report. With the US government remaining shut down and the Fed highly expected to cut rates next week, there seems to be few reasons for investors to consider anything other than the rally that\u2019s remained in place for much of the time since the April pullback.\nInterestingly, however, it\u2019s Powell\u2019s performance at next week\u2019s rate meeting which could potentially present some counter-trend motive. At the rate cut announcement in September, stocks initially pulled back on the announcement. There was a gap-higher the next morning and that gap came in as support a week later; but at Powell\u2019s presser in July investors were starting to second guess rate cuts and that led to a large sell-off a day later, and that even lasted into the end of the week following the release of Non-farm Payrolls, when USD rallies were quickly extinguished in most major pairs.\nI bring this up because chasing at this point, particularly after the unfilled gap on Friday fueled by that CPI release, is incredibly difficult from a strategy perspective. This isn\u2019t necessarily something that\u2019s attractive to fade because bulls have just continued to push, but it can highlight the value of patience and trying to pick an opportunistic mechanism for trend continuation.\nFrom the daily chart of SPX there\u2019s now a rising wedge that\u2019s built and these are often approached with aim of bearish reversal. I would want to first see a breach of the 6700 handle before I would entertain short-term bearish stances, but even then, I think I\u2019d prefer to bias this as bullish and wait for support to come into play at a level like 6550.\nFor shorter-term support, it\u2019s the Friday gap that begins at 6738 and runs up to 6772 that remains of interest.\nS&P 500 Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nNasdaq 100\nThe Nasdaq 100 similarly gapped-up on Friday and set a fresh all-time-high but the difference is that ahead of the move, there was a horizontal level of resistance that had held around 25,180. That, combined with the higher-lows, made for an ascending triangle and those are often approached with aim of bullish breakout, which is precisely what hit on Friday morning after the CPI report was priced-in.\nThat level also presents an attractive area to look for support to play. It\u2019s a clear and obvious level so if it doesn\u2019t hold, the concern is for a greater retracement or pullback scenario as likely something in the fundamental backdrop has shifted. And if that\u2019s happening, patience on the pullback would likely be a warranted way forward, looking for something similar to what I had talked about in the Q4 forecast for equity indices.\nNasdaq 100 Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\n--- written by James Stanley, Senior Strategist\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

Click here for details-\nYellow metal has experienced a 55% growth rate year-to-date. However, it fell by over 6% this week, halting the nine-week winning streak. Earlier in the week, gold reached an all-time high near $4,381 before returning to $4,003 per ounce. T\nhis move was driven by easing US-China trade tensions and India\u2019s declining physical gold demand post-Diwali. Consequently, gold recalibrated itself instead of continuing a downtrend, as analysts suggested it had outpaced the short-term economic factors.\nIn the US, the dollar strengthened after the inflation data came in softer but stable. The September CPI revealed a 0.3% MoM and 3.0% YoY increase, below the forecast. Meanwhile, the PMI data suggested unstable growth across sectors, reinforcing expectations of Fed easing at the Oct 29-30 meeting.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch, future markets are priced at a 96% probability of rate cuts. The lower interest rates typically weigh on the greenback and support assets like gold.\nGold\u2019s Key Events Next Week\nThe significant events next week include:\n- Fed\u2019s Monetary Policy Statement\n- Fed Interest Rate Decision\n- FOMC Press Conference\n- Initial Jobless Claims\n- Chicago PMI\n- US GDP\n- US Core PCE\nNext week, traders look forward to initial jobless claims, the FOMC press conference, the Fed\u2019s monetary policy and interest rate decision, US GDP, and the US Core PCE figures for insights into labor conditions and expectations of Fed easing and policy direction.\nGold\u2019s Weekly Technical Forecast:\nThe gold chart indicates consolidation after its sharp rally in October. After it reached an all-time high near the $4,381 level, it corrected to close the week above $4,100. The price stays above the key moving averages, with the 20-day MA around $4,050 as the short-term support, suggesting a bullish bias.\n-Are you interested in learning about the forex signals telegram group?

                "body": "Takaichi trade sends USD/JPY up 1.5% to close the week at 152.868, its highest weekly close since late January 2025. Sanae Takaichi became Japan\u2019s first woman prime minister. Her election win raised expectations for a stimulus package and a more dovish Bank of Japan monetary policy stance, weighing on the Japanese yen.\nThe weaker yen came despite a pickup in Japanese inflationary pressures, where the annual inflation rate rose from 2.7% in August to 2.9%. Slower services sector activity and a deeper contraction across the manufacturing sector overshadowed the inflation numbers.\nThis week, the Bank of Japan will take center stage, with economists widely expecting policymakers to keep interest rates at 0.5%. Forward guidance will be pivotal, given recent economic data and Takaichi\u2019s election win. Although the BoJ interest rate decision, forward guidance, and GDP and inflation forecasts will influence USD/JPY trends, traders should closely monitor upcoming economic data releases.\nOn Wednesday, October 29, consumer confidence figures will provide insights into household spending trends. Economists forecast the Consumer Confidence Index to rise from 35.3 in September to 35.6 in October.\nA higher-than-expected reading could signal a pickup in consumer spending, fueling demand-driven inflation. Uptrends in household spending and inflation would support a more hawkish BoJ rate path, lifting demand for the yen. On the other hand, a lower print may suggest a softer inflation outlook, weighing on the yen.\nWhile consumer confidence is a key stat, the Bank of Japan\u2019s interest rate decision on Thursday, October 30, will be the main event. GDP and inflation forecasts and Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s press conference will also be key drivers for the week.\nBarring a surprise rate hike, traders should consider the BoJ\u2019s forecasts and Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s press conference. Upward revisions to GDP and inflation could fuel speculation about a December or January hike, lifting the yen. Conversely, weaker forecasts could sink bets of monetary policy tightening and weigh on the yen.\nHowever, Governor Ueda will have the final say. Views on Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s monetary policy stance and plans for fiscal stimulus would likely be crucial near-term USD/JPY trends.\nOn Friday, October 31, several key economic data releases will round off a potentially volatile week for USD/JPY.\nEconomists forecast retail sales to increase 0.7% year-on-year (YoY) in September after falling 1.1% in August. A sharper rise could signal a pickup in economic momentum, given that private consumption contributes about 55% to Japan\u2019s GDP. Furthermore, a rebound in retail sales may drive inflation, supporting a more hawkish BoJ policy stance. On the other hand, a continued decline in retail sales could temper BoJ rate hike bets, dampening appetite for the yen.\nEconomists expect Tokyo\u2019s annual inflation rate to rise from 2.5% in September to 2.7% in October, moving further from the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. A higher print could raise expectations of a near-term BoJ rate hike, supporting a stronger yen. However, a lower reading may allow policymakers to delay rate hikes.\nEconomists forecast the unemployment rate to drop from 2.6% in August to 2.5% in September. A tighter labor market could boost wages and drive household spending, supporting a BoJ monetary policy adjustment. Conversely, another increase in unemployment may raise concerns about wages and spending, potentially delaying rate hikes.\nFollow our real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nCrucially, a move toward 155 could fuel speculation about a Ministry of Finance intervention, mirroring events in 2024. Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG.com, commented:\n\u201cMeanwhile, FX intervention, which is the remit of the Ministry of Finance and independent of BoJ policy, remains possible if USD/JPY rallies above ~155.

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Forecast - Yen Climbs to \u00a5152.80 as Strong U.S. PMI and Japan\u2019s Fiscal Plans Pressure Yen\nThe dollar strengthens for a sixth session, with USD/JPY testing multi-decade highs near \u00a5153.27 amid resilient U.S. data, weak Japanese policy signals, and rising speculation of government intervention | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY Holds Firm at Multi-Decade Highs Amid Diverging Policy Paths\nThe USD/JPY pair trades around \u00a5152.80, maintaining six straight days of gains as the yen\u2019s decline deepens against a resurgent dollar. Market momentum remains strong after a brief pause below the \u00a5153.26 resistance, a level closely watched since the Bank of Japan\u2019s last intervention attempts. Traders are positioning around this zone ahead of crucial monetary policy decisions from both the Federal Reserve and BoJ, with volatility expected to surge next week. The dollar\u2019s dominance continues to be fueled by widening yield differentials, as U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hover near 4.65%, maintaining a decisive premium over Japan\u2019s near-zero rates.\nU.S. Data Strength Reinforces Dollar Upside Despite Softer Inflation\nRobust economic data from the U.S. provided the foundation for the dollar\u2019s strength. The S&P Global Flash Composite PMI climbed to 54.8 in October, up from 53.9 in September, marking the fastest private-sector expansion in three months. The Services PMI advanced to 55.2, while the Manufacturing PMI rose slightly to 52.2, signaling widespread sectoral growth. Although the U.S. CPI eased to 0.3% month-on-month, below the 0.4% forecast, the overall inflation rate of 3.0% year-on-year keeps the Fed cautious. Market participants anticipate a rate cut at the October 29\u201330 meeting, but the resilience in business activity suggests that monetary easing may proceed at a slower pace than initially priced in.\nJapanese Inflation and Fiscal Policy Fuel Yen Weakness\nIn Japan, inflation continues to climb but fails to bolster the yen. The core CPI rose to 2.9% in September, up from 2.7% in August, a level unseen in decades. Yet, expectations for further tightening by the Bank of Japan remain muted. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s administration has hinted at a new fiscal stimulus program aimed at alleviating the cost-of-living crisis, potentially through tax cuts on gasoline and income. Finance Minister Katayama acknowledged that additional bond issuance may be required, raising market concerns about fiscal discipline. HSBC analysts argue that fiscal expansion could delay BoJ normalization into 2026, undercutting yen strength even if inflation persists near 3%.\nTechnical Structure Signals Strong Resistance at \u00a5153.27, Next Targets \u00a5154.82 and \u00a5156.26\nTechnical momentum remains bullish. The USD/JPY pair has surged 4.4% off the monthly low, carving out a six-day rally that now tests the upper end of an ascending pitchfork pattern. The immediate resistance lies between \u00a5153.08 and \u00a5153.27, where price has repeatedly stalled. A daily close above this threshold would open the path to \u00a5153.83, followed by \u00a5154.82, the 78.6% retracement of the 2025 range. A further extension targets \u00a5156.26\u2013\u00a5156.29, which aligns with the 1.618% Fibonacci expansion from April\u2019s advance. On the downside, initial support rests at \u00a5151.63\u2013\u00a5151.95, with deeper support near \u00a5150.88, representing the August high and 100% extension of the April rally. Any break below this region would imply the potential for a corrective pullback toward \u00a5149.80.\nMarket Overvaluation and Intervention Risk Cloud the Short-Term Outlook\nWhile momentum favors the dollar, valuation models from major banks, including HSBC, indicate that USD/JPY is overvalued above \u00a5152, implying potential retracement toward the mid-147 range if global risk sentiment shifts. Traders are alert to the possibility of Ministry of Finance intervention, similar to the measures deployed during the 2022 and 2024 yen defense campaigns.

                "body": "- Traditional drivers have faded in USD/JPY influence\n- Yen weakness tied to politics and energy costs\n- Fed and BoJ decisions dominate this week\u2019s focus\n- Tokyo CPI and fiscal signals add extra risk\n- USD/JPY directional risks skewed higher\nSummary\nUSD/JPY has shrugged off traditional drivers like rate spreads and risk sentiment, with correlations to U.S. yields turning mildly negative. Temporary factors such as Japan\u2019s political shift and higher energy costs have added pressure, but the focus now shifts to Fed and BoJ decisions, Tokyo CPI and fiscal signals. U.S. tech earnings could also sway carry trade flows. With price action firm and momentum strong, directional risks for USD/JPY remain skewed to the upside.\nAssessing Fundamental Influences\nHistoric drivers such as interest rate differentials, risk appetite and implied market volatility have shown little to no influence on USD/JPY movements over the past month, as shown by the correlation coefficients in the chart below. Rather than a positive correlation with U.S. yields and yield spreads between the United States and Japan, the relationship has been mildly negative. That suggests other factors are behind the yen\u2019s recent weakness.\nSource: TradingView\nSanae Takaichi\u2019s elevation to Japanese PM has been part of the story, with traders betting on more stimulatory fiscal and monetary policy settings than what would otherwise have been the case. Large increases in energy prices late last week may have also contributed to the yen\u2019s slide, reflecting Japan\u2019s status as a significant energy importer. Those influences are likely to prove temporary unless sustained, suggesting interest rates and market sentiment may once again take over as key influences on the yen.\nWhat\u2019s been interesting is USD/JPY\u2019s strengthening inverse relationship with shifts in relative nominal growth expectations in the United States and Japan, as proxied by the 2s10s yield spread between the two nations. It has not been the strongest relationship over the past month, but at 0.75 it suggests the relative growth outlook in both nations may be something to consider for anyone trading USD/JPY. You can see the relationship visually between the two in the left-hand pane in the chart above.\nFed, BoJ Rate Decisions Loom Large\nA big influence on nominal growth expectations is the interest rate outlook in both nations, adding extra importance to monetary policy decisions from the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan over the coming days. The key economic events in the week are shown in the calendar below, with red shading indicative of those most likely to generate volatility in USD/JPY. Times are shown for the East Coast of the United States. Wednesday looms as the most important day with the Federal Reserve decision followed hours later by the BoJ.\nSource: TradingView\nWhen it comes to the Federal Reserve, this meeting will not contain any new forecasts, meaning the wording of the policy statement, FOMC voting split and chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference will be the key things to watch should it cut rates by 25bps to a range of 3.75\u20134% as is fully priced by markets. Six weeks ago, the FOMC statement said that job gains had \u201cslowed\u201d and suggested that downside risks to employment had \u201crisen.\u201d On inflation, it noted that it had moved up and remained \u201csomewhat elevated.\u201d With so little data received due to the government lockdown, common sense suggests there may not be any changes to those assessments, although there is a risk the language on inflation may shift slightly more dovish given the soft September inflation report released last Friday.\nWithin the statement, there is also a chance the Fed will announce an end to its quantitative tightening program, although on the balance of probabilities it is more likely to come in December. What\u2019s important to note with Fed balance sheet adjustments is that an end to asset runoffs is entirely expected, with the only question being timing and what mix the bank will feel c"

                "body": "Takaichi trade sends USD/JPY up 1.5% to close the week at 152.868, its highest weekly close since late January 2025. Sanae Takaichi became Japan\u2019s first woman prime minister. Her election win raised expectations for a stimulus package and a more dovish Bank of Japan monetary policy stance, weighing on the Japanese yen.\nThe weaker yen came despite a pickup in Japanese inflationary pressures, where the annual inflation rate rose from 2.7% in August to 2.9%. Slower services sector activity and a deeper contraction across the manufacturing sector overshadowed the inflation numbers.\nThis week, the Bank of Japan will take center stage, with economists widely expecting policymakers to keep interest rates at 0.5%. Forward guidance will be pivotal, given recent economic data and Takaichi\u2019s election win. Although the BoJ interest rate decision, forward guidance, and GDP and inflation forecasts will influence USD/JPY trends, traders should closely monitor upcoming economic data releases.\nOn Wednesday, October 29, consumer confidence figures will provide insights into household spending trends. Economists forecast the Consumer Confidence Index to rise from 35.3 in September to 35.6 in October.\nA higher-than-expected reading could signal a pickup in consumer spending, fueling demand-driven inflation. Uptrends in household spending and inflation would support a more hawkish BoJ rate path, lifting demand for the yen. On the other hand, a lower print may suggest a softer inflation outlook, weighing on the yen.\nWhile consumer confidence is a key stat, the Bank of Japan\u2019s interest rate decision on Thursday, October 30, will be the main event. GDP and inflation forecasts and Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s press conference will also be key drivers for the week.\nBarring a surprise rate hike, traders should consider the BoJ\u2019s forecasts and Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s press conference. Upward revisions to GDP and inflation could fuel speculation about a December or January hike, lifting the yen. Conversely, weaker forecasts could sink bets of monetary policy tightening and weigh on the yen.\nHowever, Governor Ueda will have the final say. Views on Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s monetary policy stance and plans for fiscal stimulus would likely be crucial near-term USD/JPY trends.\nOn Friday, October 31, several key economic data releases will round off a potentially volatile week for USD/JPY.\nEconomists forecast retail sales to increase 0.7% year-on-year (YoY) in September after falling 1.1% in August. A sharper rise could signal a pickup in economic momentum, given that private consumption contributes about 55% to Japan\u2019s GDP. Furthermore, a rebound in retail sales may drive inflation, supporting a more hawkish BoJ policy stance. On the other hand, a continued decline in retail sales could temper BoJ rate hike bets, dampening appetite for the yen.\nEconomists expect Tokyo\u2019s annual inflation rate to rise from 2.5% in September to 2.7% in October, moving further from the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. A higher print could raise expectations of a near-term BoJ rate hike, supporting a stronger yen. However, a lower reading may allow policymakers to delay rate hikes.\nEconomists forecast the unemployment rate to drop from 2.6% in August to 2.5% in September. A tighter labor market could boost wages and drive household spending, supporting a BoJ monetary policy adjustment. Conversely, another increase in unemployment may raise concerns about wages and spending, potentially delaying rate hikes.\nFollow our real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nCrucially, a move toward 155 could fuel speculation about a Ministry of Finance intervention, mirroring events in 2024. Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG.com, commented:\n\u201cMeanwhile, FX intervention, which is the remit of the Ministry of Finance and independent of BoJ policy, remains possible if USD/JPY rallies above ~155. This would be a repeat of the 2022/2024 scenarios, when the MoF conducted yen\u2011buying intervention in respon"

The rally ended a five-day outflow streak and confirmed that institutional buyers\u2014led by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC\u2014remain firmly positioned for accumulation. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF absorbed $32.68 million, while Fidelity\u2019s FBTC brought in $57.92 million, reinforcing the ongoing shift of institutional capital back into Bitcoin after the October 11 sell-off. Bitcoin has now recovered nearly 8% from its recent low near $103,000, posting a seven-day high of $114,000 and outperforming all major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD).\nInstitutional Momentum Returns as BlackRock and Fidelity Dominate Bitcoin ETF Leadership\nThe renewed inflows into Bitcoin ETFs mark a critical inflection point in institutional sentiment. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT remains the market leader with an extraordinary $89.17 billion in assets under management (AUM), while Fidelity\u2019s FBTC holds $22.84 billion, both establishing dominance in the regulated digital asset arena. Historically, such surges in ETF demand have preceded short-term price expansions between 5\u201310% within days, a pattern repeating now as Bitcoin consolidates above $110,000.\nETF inflows over the past week totaled $446 million, lifting cumulative inflows to $61.98 billion, equivalent to 6.78% of Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization, which currently stands at $1.49 trillion. This institutional expansion illustrates a maturing digital-asset market\u2014no longer speculative but increasingly viewed as a structural part of global asset allocation.\nBTC-USD Price Strength Builds on Liquidity Expansion and Macro Policy Shifts\nThe surge in ETF inflows aligns with easing inflationary data and dovish central-bank tone across the U.S. and Europe. The Federal Reserve\u2019s projected rate cut on October 29\u201330 has reignited appetite for risk assets, particularly Bitcoin, which continues to benefit from its \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative amid a weakening U.S. dollar. As yields soften, Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with gold and tech equities strengthens, attracting cross-asset flows from traditional portfolios.\nThis macro tailwind is supported by increased liquidity from ETFs, where Bitcoin spot ETF assets now total $149.96 billion, underscoring deep institutional participation. The demand rebound follows a steep $1.23 billion outflow between October 13 and 17, when Bitcoin plunged from $121,000 to $103,000 during the short-lived \u201ccrypto crash.\u201d The swift reversal suggests that institutional managers view any weakness as a tactical entry point into the dominant digital asset.\nRotation From Ethereum to Bitcoin Underscores Renewed Store-of-Value Thesis\nWhile Bitcoin ETF inflows surged, Ethereum ETFs recorded a second consecutive week of redemptions, totaling $243.9 million in outflows, with BlackRock\u2019s ETHA ETF leading withdrawals at $100.99 million. Analysts point to a pronounced capital rotation from Ethereum to Bitcoin as investors favor the relative stability and stronger macro narrative of BTC-USD.\nThis shift reflects growing preference for Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply and long-term deflationary structure\u2014particularly as global rate cuts and sovereign debt expansion erode fiat value. Cumulative Ethereum ETF inflows still stand at $14.35 billion, but Bitcoin\u2019s $61.98 billion total dwarfs it, solidifying BTC\u2019s dominance in institutional allocations. Market data shows Bitcoin ETFs representing 6.78% of the coin\u2019s circulating value, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 5.55%, further emphasizing the asset-clas"

Collectively, they now account for nearly one-third of Bitcoin\u2019s total network hashrate.\nHashrate represents the total computational power miners contribute to securing the Bitcoin blockchain. Realized hashrate, however, measures actual onchain performance, or the rate at which valid blocks are successfully mined.\nFor publicly traded miners, it also serves as a closer indicator of operational efficiency and revenue potential, making it a key metric ahead of third-quarter earnings season.\nBitcoin miners ramp up hash wars\nIn the race for market share, Bitcoin mining companies are taking on record levels of debt as they expand into new mining rigs, artificial intelligence infrastructure and other capital-intensive ventures.\nTotal debt across the sector has surged to $12.7 billion, up from $2.1 billion just 12 months ago, according to research by VanEck. The researchers noted that miners must continuously invest in next-generation hardware to maintain their share of Bitcoin\u2019s total hashrate and avoid falling behind competitors.\nSome mining companies have turned to AI and high-performance computing workloads to diversify revenue streams and offset declining margins following the 2024 Bitcoin (BTC) halving, which reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC."

If Selig is confirmed by the Senate \u2014 a hurdle Quintenz didn't manage to clear \u2014 he'll likely be shaping the implementation of new U.S. crypto policies.\nWhite House Crypto Czar David Sacks confirmed that Selig, long rumored to be Trump's top choice, would be given the nod early Saturday.\n\"Mike has not only been instrumental in driving forward the President's crypto agenda as Chief Counsel of the SEC Crypto Task Force, he also brings deep experience in traditional commodities markets from his time working at the CFTC under former Chairman Chris Giancarlo,\" Sacks said in a post on X.\nSelig has been serving as a senior official on the SEC's crypto effort, so he would be intimately familiar with the industry's wants when it comes to a comprehensive U.S. regulatory regime. CoinDesk reported in early October that Selig had become the frontrunner for the role.\nSelig said he was \"honored\" to be nominated in a post on X.\n\"I pledge to work tirelessly to facilitate Well-Functioning Commodity Markets, promote Freedom, Competition and Innovation, and help the President make the United States the Crypto Capital of the World,\" he said.\n\"Mike\u2019s deep expertise in financial markets and digital assets at the SEC makes him exceptionally well positioned to bring clarity, balance, and forward-looking guidance to the commission\u2019s work,\" said Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, herself a recent commissioner at the CFTC.\nThe CFTC has long been engaged with the U.S. crypto industry, and for years during SEC Chair Gary Gensler's tenure it was considered the friendlier of the two markets regulators. In 2015, the CFTC gave bitcoin\nIf Congress gives the CFTC hands-on authority over spot trading in crypto commodities such as bitcoin and Ethereum's ether\nMeanwhile, the SEC's crypto efforts in which Selig has played a part have accelerated under Chairman Paul Atkins, who declared that industry regulation is the agency's top priority. Under Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, the CFTC has sought to keep pace with her \"crypto sprint.\"\nPham has been seeking to leave her commission post, a departure that was delayed when Trump's White House paused Quintenz's confirmation, which was openly opposed by Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss. Though the rest of the industry sent a letter to Trump strongly in favor of quickly getting former az16 Crypto executive Quintenz into the job, the lobbying fell short.\nNow the industry is shifting toward the new nominee, Selig.\n\"He understands the tech and the need to allow room for innovation, but also cares about getting to the right legal answer,\" noted Amanda Tuminelli, executive director of the DeFi Education Fund, in a statement.\n\"Selig's deep regulatory experience and informed approach to financial innovation make him the right choice to lead the CFTC at this pivotal moment,\" said Ji Kim, the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, in a statement.\nUPDATE (Oct. 25, 2025, 21:12 UTC): Adds Selig tweet.\nMore For You\nStablecoin payment volumes have grown to $19.4B year-to-date in 2025.

Hence, the cumulative crypto market capitalization has reached $3.75T, indicating a slight 0.04% rise. However, the 24-hour crypto volume has plunged by 14.08%, reaching $135.56B.

                "body": "With the market positioning itself for yet another possible bull run, Solana (SOL) has again stolen the limelight with fresh optimism building around its network strength and developer ecosystem. But even as investors analyze Solana\u2019s price forecast, traders are quietly focusing on what may be the best cheap crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM).\nPriced at only $0.035 and in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM is fast becoming the next big crypto in decentralized finance (DeFi). Its novel dual-lending model, which combines Peer-to-Peer and liquidity pool mechanisms, has the potential to revolutionize on-chain lending efficiency to a degree of practical innovation that Solana\u2019s network innovations are yet to maximally leverage. With increasing hype, solid tokenomics, and presale momentum building, Mutuum Finance takes center stage as the low-cap altcoin pacing the field in 2025.\nSolana (SOL) Price Prediction: Bulls Eye a Rebound After Key Rejection\nSolana (SOL) is also experiencing near-term bearish pressure after rejection from the 20-day EMA at approximately $198, an indication that bears continue to control the trend. Price now trades close to the key channel support area of $170 to $165, a must-hold spot for buyers. A bounce off this support and successful retake of the $198\u2013$205 resistance can trigger a short-term rally into the $220+ area, restoring confidence in Solana\u2019s upside momentum. Breakdown below the channel, however, can open the doors for a deeper correction into $155\u2013$145, where buyers can start to re-enter for value plays. Although near-term market sentiment remains bearish, analysts comment that a powerful bounce would be enough to reverse momentum at speed, a scenario that is seeing many traders also looking at high-upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project increasingly coming into view as the most compelling next big crypto opportunities of 2025.\nMutuum Finance Breaks New Presale Record\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently the best cheap crypto to buy now in the DeFi sector. Its presale continues to explode, with more than 17,400 investors presently investing in excess of $17.85 million. The token is currently at its lowest potential level of $0.035 in Stage 6, providing a limited-time discount for early participants to join the next big crypto before the upcoming bull market explosion.\nMutuum Finance allows holders to generate passive income by lending cryptocurrency assets like USDT to the liquidity pool and receiving returns in the form of annual percentage yield (APY), based on market demand. At the same time, lenders can lend without relinquishing holdings by collateralizing assets like ETH to lend USDT, with the interest rate on APY by markets and without a repayment plan, to cover initial stakes but allow flexibility.\nThe platform will reach a key milestone later this year as its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, Version 1 (V1), will launch live on the Sepolia Testnet. V1 will bring in fundamental DeFi building blocks like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and Liquidator bot, all automated with native ETH and USDT lending, borrowing, and collateralization, offering users a fast, scalable, and secure multi-asset trading experience while freeing their crypto to achieve its highest potential without restrictions.\nAlready raising more than $17.85 million with more than 17,400 investors already signed up, Mutuum Finance\u2019s Phase 6 presale is selling out at a record-breaking speed, with more than 75% of tokens sold. For only $0.035, this is as cheap as MUTM will be before the $0.04 explosion in Phase 7. Early movers are scooping up for what many consider the best cheap crypto to buy now, with actual DeFi functionality and breakthrough potential. While Solana stumbles in momentum, Mutuum Finance is leading buy charts and ruling investor focus as the next big crypto of 2025.\nFor more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: h"

The move comes after weeks of consolidation between $175\u2013$200, now giving way to a renewed rally that positions Solana among the strongest-performing Layer-1 assets in Q4 2025. The network\u2019s market capitalization of $105 billion places it firmly behind Ethereum and BNB, yet its velocity of development and institutional engagement suggests a structural re-rating is underway.\nInstitutional Demand Expands as Fidelity and ETF Approvals Bridge Solana to TradFi\nSolana\u2019s institutional footprint has expanded sharply after Fidelity Investments began offering direct SOL access to U.S. brokerage clients, opening exposure to over 40 million retail accounts and $5.8 trillion in managed assets. This milestone aligns with Hong Kong\u2019s approval of the first Solana spot ETF, which triggered a 40% surge in trading volume in Asian sessions. These developments collectively anchor Solana as the third major blockchain\u2014after Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014to penetrate mainstream finance infrastructure. ETF inflows and regulatory clarity have shifted sentiment decisively positive, creating a pathway toward sustained capital inflow through 2026.\nWhale Accumulation Signals Renewed Confidence in Solana\u2019s Long-Term Value\nThe recent $47 million whale purchase over four days has drawn significant attention across crypto markets. Large-scale buying during neutral market sentiment reflects conviction in Solana\u2019s scalability, throughput, and ecosystem depth. Historically, similar whale activity preceded major rallies such as the $20 to $250 breakout in 2021 and the $80 to $200 recovery in early 2025. Trading volumes have risen 22% week-over-week, and social engagement metrics surged 18%, indicating that institutional and high-net-worth investors are quietly re-entering positions ahead of the next liquidity cycle.\nNetwork Fundamentals: Revenue, Activity, and Resilience Strengthen Solana\u2019s Core\nSolana\u2019s fundamentals continue to outperform peers. Annualized revenue hit $2.1 billion, up 212% year-over-year, ranking it first among Layer-1 chains for profitability per validator. DeFi total value locked (TVL) has grown 13% week-over-week to $4.1 billion, while NFT marketplace volume climbed 30% in October, reflecting organic on-chain demand. Solana\u2019s network stability also reinforced investor confidence: during a major AWS cloud outage, Solana remained fully operational, outperforming centralized infrastructure competitors such as Base and MetaMask. Its stablecoin market cap now exceeds $15 billion, underscoring trust and liquidity strength across its ecosystem.\nTechnical Structure: Ascending Triangle Targets $300 and Beyond\nFrom a technical perspective, Solana is tracing a powerful ascending triangle pattern between $180 and $210, a formation that historically precedes breakout moves. Key resistance at $210\u2013$220 marks the trigger zone, where a daily close could target the $280\u2013$300 range, representing a 35\u201345% upside from current levels. Indicators confirm bullish alignment: MACD remains positive, RSI holds near 62, and EMAs are trending upward on both daily and weekly frames. The broader price structure implies accumulation rather than exhaustion, and analysts expect a decisive leg higher should whale inflows persist\nRead More\n-\nJEPI ETF Holds $57.46 With 8.4% Yield as Investors Flock to JPMorgan\u2019s $40B Income Powerhouse\n25.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nRipple XRP ETFs Rally as XRPR Tops $20.67 and XRPI $14.93, $100M AUM and CME Volume Fuel Institutional Surge\n25.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingN"

That put sales at their highest point since mid-2022, with fashion and online shopping leading the charge. On top of that, the S&P Global PMI Composite rose to 51.1 in October, signaling private sector growth and marking the first manufacturing output increase in a year. All told, this economic resilience buoyed market sentiment and pushed the FTSE 100 into positive territory. NatWest\u2019s shares surged nearly 5% after the bank posted strong profits and signaled confidence in future income, with cost controls and strategic shifts clearly paying off. GSK notched a key US approval for a cancer drug combo, but shares slipped as investors weighed sector challenges.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Optimism makes a comeback.\nStronger retail and private sector numbers gave investors a jolt of confidence, sending the FTSE 100 upward. Consumer-focused companies and banks, like NatWest, saw particular gains, with healthy margins and clear strategy paying dividends. On the flip side, some healthcare names lagged even after positive regulatory news, showing that not every win lands with investors if the outlook is still hazy.\nThe bigger picture: Growth resilience shapes expectations.\nThe UK\u2019s better-than-expected numbers surface as global markets wrestle with uncertainty, providing a rare patch of optimism. Rising retail sales and expanding private sector activity could nudge policymakers as they weigh growth momentum against lingering inflation. And as companies pivot strategies to navigate new headwinds, how banks and pharma groups fare will be worth watching on the FTSE 100\u2019s road ahead.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

The blue-chip index has risen for four sessions in a row, having dipped to 9354 at the end of last week.\nRentokil Initial led the top flight with a surge of 10%, up 42p to 449.3p after the pest control firm provided more signs of a recovery in its North America performance.\nThe group left full-year guidance unchanged after organic revenues growth accelerated to 3.4% in the third quarter.\nLondon Stock Exchange shares were also in recovery mode after a poor performance so far this year.\nThey rallied 6% or 522p to 9242p after the financial data and analytics business said its \u201cstrong momentum\u201d continued in the third quarter, with an underlying margin seen at the top of guidance for 2025.\nLloyds Banking Group shares were unchanged at 84.5p as investors balanced robust underlying trading with the impact of motor finance redress on Q3 results.\nThe 36% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a31.17 billion was slightly better than expected, while the lender left its guidance for 2026 unchanged.\nUnilever rose 84p to 4737p after the Dove and Hellmann\u2019s maker reported underlying sales growth of 3.9% for the third quarter.\nStronger trading in emerging markets boosted the performance as Unilever reiterated guidance for growth between 3% and 5% in the full year.\nOil giants rally on Brent Crude price surge, gold steadies\nBP and Shell shares are up 2% after the announcement of US sanctions against Russian oil lifted the price of Brent Crude by 4% to $65 a barrel.\nThe spike ends a period of downward pressure after oversupply fears caused the commodity to fall from more than $75 in June to near $60 earlier this week.\nBP lifted 10p to 431.5p and Shell improved 65p to 2826p.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold has firmed after two days of losses to stand at $4114 an ounce.\nLondon Stock Exchange rallies on Q3 progress, launches new products\nLondon Stock Exchange shares today rose 5% or 448p to 9168p after it said its \u201cstrong momentum\u201d continued in the third quarter. The improvement narrows the year-to-date fall for shares to just under 20%.\nThe financial data and analytics business reported total income growth of 6.4% and said it expects an underlying earnings margin at the top of guidance for 2025.\nChief executive David Schwimmer added that new products positioned LSEG as the \u201cpartner of choice in AI with the likes of Microsoft and Databricks\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cWe have significantly accelerated our strategic progress in the last few months, driving the long-term growth potential of the business.\u201d\nLloyds shares steady despite profits fall\nLloyds Banking Group shares are broadly unchanged at 84.4p after the lender reported a smaller-than-forecast 36% fall in third quarter profit to \u00a31.17 billion.\nThe performance was impacted by an additional \u00a3800 million of motor finance redress costs, leading to reduced guidance for return on tangible equity in 2025.\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: \u201cThis has turned out to be something of a quarter to forget fo"

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lorenzo.\nLorenzo Simonelli: Thank you, Chase. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. First, I\u2019d like to provide a quick outline for today\u2019s call. I will begin by discussing our strong third quarter results. Next, I will highlight key awards announced during the quarter and provide some thoughts on the broader macro environment. Following this, I will share an update on the current progress in the LNG sector. I will then hand it over to Ahmed, who will present an overview of our financial results, followed by an update on our continued focus on portfolio management, including the Chart Industries acquisition. To conclude, I will summarize the main points before we open the line for questions. Let us now turn to the key highlights on Slide 4.\nWe continue to execute at a high level, delivering another quarter of strong results. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $1.24 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance range. This performance reflects continued momentum from our business system deployment, positive trends in gas technology and strong outperformance in U.S. land, where our leverage to production is a clear advantage. Oilfield Services and Equipment margins softened in response to the broader macro environment, while Industrial and Energy Technology reported improved results, contributing to a 20 basis points year-over-year increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to 17.7%. This margin progression highlights the resilience of our portfolio and the foundation we have built through disciplined execution.\nGiven the strong operational performance year-to-date, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA for the total company to exceed $4.7 billion. Turning to orders. IET continues to build strong momentum, achieving $4.1 billion during the quarter, driven by LNG equipment, record Cordant Solutions orders and ongoing strength in gas infrastructure and power generation. As a result, IET backlog grew 3% sequentially, reaching a new record of $32.1 billion, further reinforcing the durability and visibility of our growth outlook. Through the first three quarters, IET orders totaled nearly $11 billion, including $1.6 billion from New Energy, already reaching the high end of the $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion guidance range. With good visibility into fourth quarter awards, we now expect full year IET orders to exceed our prior midpoint.\nLooking ahead, we are targeting at least $40 billion of IET orders over the next three years. This outlook is supported by the breadth and versatility of our technology portfolio, which continues to generate a robust pipeline across an expanding range of end markets. We expect growth to be led by gas infrastructure, power ge"

                "body": "A look inside The Octagon, one of Washington D.C.'s oldest \u2013 and most haunted \u2013 homes\nThe White House may be the most well-known home in Washington D.C., but just blocks away from the presidential mansion sits a lesser known home with its own piece of U.S. history.\nThe Octagon is an approximately 10,000 square foot home designed by William Thornton, who served as the first architect of the U.S. Capitol. The building sits at the corner of New York Avenue NW and 18th Street NW in Washington, D.C., and was completed in 1801.\nBuilt as a second residence for Virginia's prominent Tayloe family who were friends of George Washington, the more than 200-year old building gets its name from the shape of the main room at the main entrance. Amanda Ferrario is the manager of the house, which now doubles as a museum and event space. It's owned and maintained by the Architects Foundation, the philanthropic partner of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), which purchased the property in 1902.\n\"The Octagon name comes from this room that we're standing in,\" Ferrario told CBS News during a tour of the home. \"In order to build a circular room, you make the structure out of an octagonal shape and then builds it in with various building materials to give this nice smooth circle,\" she added.\nFerrario says the epicenter of the house was in the basement, where several enslaved people lived and worked mostly out of sight of the wealthy occupants.\n\"(The basement) is the absolute epicenter of all of the activity,\" Ferrario said. \"Not only for the enslaved who would live and work here, they were sleeping here. They were working here around the clock, but also in order to operate a house of this caliber,\" she added.\nThe Octagon also served as a home for one of America's early first families. President James Madison and his wife, Dolley Madison, temporarily relocated to the home after the British burned down the White House in 1814. Ferrario says the rent for the temporary stay was about $6,000 for their 6-month stay. She also noted the specific reason why the British did not destroy the prominent home.\n\"But during this time, Mr. Tayloe was quite savvy, and invited a French ambassador to stay here. He knew that if there was a French flag flying, no one's going to touch this house,\" Ferrario said. \"And it was spared, and rightfully so, because in preparation for the British coming. And Dolley Madison did send over a few of her items that meant a lot to her, so that they would be extra protected.\"\nPresident Madison used the residence to conduct official business including signing the Treaty of Ghent which ended the War of 1812. He signed the document in the home's circular office, Ferrario told CBS News.\nDolley Madison brought cherished items from the White House including curtains, silverware and her pet bird. The former first lady would go on to host what became known as \"squeezes\" in the first floor sitting room. The events were gatherings of Washington's elite at the time.\nOver the years, The Octagon was transformed for different uses including a Catholic school for girls, a federal office building and later as tenement housing.\nIts storied past includes spooky and unexplained events reported by guests throughout the building's lifetime. Doors opening, lights flickering and security alarms going off without any explanation have been common occurrences in the building.\n\"We have an ongoing, I guess it's kind of an ongoing joke with our security monitoring company, that if the security monitors go off on the second or third floor, everything is okay. It's just our friends playing.\"\nFerrario also says Jackie Kennedy Onassis \u2014 then known as Jackie Bouvier \u2014 may have had her own chilling experience in the home when she was working for a local newspaper.\n\"She wrote about a time when she came through to the Octagon and she was standing right where you're standing,\" Ferrario explained to CBS News. \"And she felt the overwhelming presence and a smell of lilac, "

                "body": "- Global\n- 2 min read\nJapan plans first visa fee hike in nearly five decades amid record visitor surge\nCurrently, Japan\u2019s single-entry visa costs 3,000 yen (approximately USD 20 or around INR 1,670), while a multiple-entry visa is priced at 6,000 yen (about USD 40 or INR 3,340). These are among the lowest visa fees globally. In comparison, short-stay visas cost around USD 185 (approx. INR 15,400) for the United States, USD 177 (roughly INR 14,700) for the United Kingdom, and about \u20ac90 (USD 105 or INR 8,740) across Schengen countries such as France, Germany, and Italy.\nJapan is preparing to revise its visa application fees for the first time since 1978, aligning them more closely with charges imposed by other major economies. The move comes as the country faces record inbound tourism and rising administrative costs linked to visa processing.\nAccording to Nikkei Asia, the new fee framework will benchmark prices against those in Group of Seven (G7) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. While the exact scale of the increase has yet to be finalised, the revision could take effect in the next fiscal year following a period of public consultation.\nCurrently, Japan\u2019s single-entry visa costs 3,000 yen (approximately USD 20 or around INR 1,670), while a multiple-entry visa is priced at 6,000 yen (about USD 40 or INR 3,340).

The first half of 2025 saw 21.5 million visitors entering Japan\u2014an all-time high for that period\u2014crossing 20 million for the first time. Authorities believe a moderate fee hike will not discourage travellers but could help manage overtourism in heavily visited destinations.\nThe government is also considering collecting visa fees upfront at the time of application, similar to systems in the U.S. and Europe, a measure expected to streamline processing and reduce frivolous submissions.\nJapan currently requires visas from over 120 countries, including China, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In 2024, Chinese travellers accounted for 5.24 million visas\u2014or roughly 70% of Japan\u2019s total issuances\u2014followed by 570,000 for the Philippines and 320,000 for Vietnam. Travellers from 74 countries\u2014including the U.S., South Korea, and Australia\u2014remain eligible for short-term visa exemptions.\nThe planned visa fee changes are part of broader policy discussions aimed at sustainably managing Japan\u2019s booming tourism sector. Lawmakers are also considering increasing other travel-related charges, such as departure taxes, while reassessing tax exemptions for foreign shoppers. Between April 2024 and April 2025, Japan\u2019s international tourist tax generated a record 48.1 billion yen (approx. INR 2,680 crore), marking a 33% rise year-on-year.\nIf approved, the revised visa structure would mark the country\u2019s first adjustment in nearly five decades\u2014signalling a transition toward a fee model that reflects Japan\u2019s growing global tourism footprint.\nAccording to Nikkei Asia, the new fee framework will benchmark prices against those in Group of Seven (G7) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations.
