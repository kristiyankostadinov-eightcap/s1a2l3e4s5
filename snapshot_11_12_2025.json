December gold futures slipped as investors locked in profits after the metal\u2019s recent run, and precious metals broadly followed suit: silver slid 0.4%, with other metals falling too. While gold initially benefited from last week\u2019s softer dollar, shifting policy bets have injected more volatility. Right now, CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool sees a 68% chance of a December rate cut, edging up from 64%. Fed Governor Stephen Miran even floated the possibility of a deeper 50-basis-point cut if inflation continues cooling and jobless numbers tick up.

Since gold doesn\u2019t generate income, declining bond yields give it the shine \u2014 making the direction of rates and the dollar key market movers. Recent inflows into gold ETFs signal that plenty of investors still see the metal as a solid hedge, even with broader market ups and downs.\nThe bigger picture: Policy pivots ripple through global assets.\nFed policy shifts don\u2019t just jolt gold \u2014 they move currencies, stocks, and commodities across the board.

                "body": "Trump\u2019s Fed Feud: Fears Over Fed Independence Benefit Gold\nTrump\u2019s vow to replace Powell with someone more loyal has deepened concerns that risks to Fed independence are at the highest level since the Nixon era.\nUncertainty over the autonomy of the Federal Reserve under US President Trump echoes historical executive overreach, and is boosting gold\u2019s safe-haven appeal.\nIn its annual Precious Metals Investment Focus report, published on October 25, Metals Focus highlighted a number of factors amplifying gold\u2019s safe haven appeal and driving prices above US$4,000 per ounce.\nOne of the factors was fears over the independence of the Fed. As the agency tasked with setting the country\u2019s monetary policy, the Fed is coming under increasing political pressure by Trump to lower interest rates.\n\u201cConcerns over the Fed\u2019s independence and the challenges concerning US fiscal policy have eroded confidence in the US dollar, while geopolitical risks have also provided support,\u201d stated the firm \u201cThese factors have boosted demand for gold for portfolio diversification, with gold\u2019s strong price performance further enhancing its appeal to investors.\u201d\nThe Fed's independence has long been a cornerstone of US monetary policy. Its purview includes managing the country\u2019s money supply, setting interest rates as well as buying and selling of US Treasury securities on the open market.\nIn order to protect both democracy and the integrity of the capital market system from political pressures, the Fed must be free to conduct these operations independently from the president or Congress.\nTrump spars with Powell over interest rates\nTrump appointed Powell as Fed chair during his first presidential term, but nevertheless took to Twitter in August 2019 to ask, \u201cwho is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?\u201d\nThe statement came after Powell made comments at an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, suggesting Trump\u2019s trade policies vis-\u00e0-vis China were weighing on economic growth.\nMore recently, in April of this year, the president blasted Powell for keeping interest rates unchanged: \"The Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down, that's the only thing he's good for.\u201d\nWhile the Fed has cut rates twice this year, it only amounts to 50 basis points, with rates now in a range of 3.75 to 4 percent. Powell has publicly balked at the idea of making deeper cuts \u2014 further stoking Trump\u2019s ire.\nFollowing the first rate cut in September, a Politico reporter asked Powell what may signal to Americans that the Fed is no longer acting nonpartisanly. \u201cWe don\u2019t frame these questions at all or see them in terms of political outcomes. In another part of Washington, everything is seen through the lens of does it help or hurt this political party, this politicians,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThat\u2019s the framework. People find it hard to believe that\u2019s not at all the way we think about things at the Fed. We take a longer perspective, we\u2019re trying to serve the American people as best as we can.\u201d\nWhat history tells us about political pressure, the Fed and stagflation\nWhen asked about the growing concerns over Fed independence in an October interview with the Investing News Network, Adam Rozencwajg, managing partner at Goehring & Rozencwajg, explained that questioning the independence of the Fed is not a new phenomenon. Its ability to operate outside of the influence of the elected government branches has been debated and tested frequently since its inception in 1913.\n\u201cThere's no secret as to the president's feelings towards Chairman Powell. Trump wants lower interest rates and a more accommodative Fed, and has been very vocal in saying that, to the extent that everyone is now saying Fed independence is at risk. And look, it might be, but it's not like we haven't been here before,\u201d he said.\nA prime example, said Rozencwajg, occurred alongside the Vietnam War in the mid-1960s. President Lyndon B.

                "body": "New York, NY \u2013 November 11, 2025 \u2013 The financial markets are abuzz with the anticipation of further US interest rate cuts, a sentiment that has propelled gold prices to unprecedented highs. This bullish momentum for the yellow metal is largely influenced by a confluence of factors, including signs of a softening US economy, a recent government shutdown delaying crucial economic data, and the Federal Reserve's cautious but clear pivot towards monetary easing. As of today, investors are keenly watching the Fed's next moves, with many betting on a December rate cut, which promises to reshape investment strategies and impact a wide array of public companies.\nThe immediate implication of this environment is a reduced opportunity cost for holding non-yielding assets like gold. With interest rates expected to trend downwards, the appeal of traditional interest-bearing investments diminishes, making gold a more attractive safe haven. This dynamic, coupled with persistent global uncertainties, has sent gold surging, marking an extraordinary year for the precious metal and signaling a significant shift in market sentiment.\nThe Fed's Delicate Dance: Data Delays and Dovish Signals\nThe Federal Reserve finds itself in a challenging position, likened by Chair Jerome Powell to \"driving in the fog,\" primarily due to the ongoing US government shutdown that has delayed the release of critical economic data. Key reports, including the national jobs report for October and comprehensive inflation data, which are usually vital for the Fed's monetary policy decisions, are currently unavailable. This data vacuum complicates the Fed's ability to accurately assess the economy's health.\nDespite these data gaps, a narrative of economic weakness has emerged from preliminary indicators. October saw job losses, particularly in government and retail sectors, while consumer sentiment in early November experienced a sharp decline, reflecting growing financial concerns among households. These signals have intensified market expectations for further monetary easing.\nThe Fed has already initiated an easing cycle with two 25-basis-point (bps) rate cuts in September and October 2025, bringing the federal funds rate to a target range of 3.75%-4.00%. Market probabilities for a December 2025 cut currently range from 60% to 70%. While some Fed policymakers, like Governor Stephen Miran, have even suggested a more aggressive 50 bps cut, Chair Powell has maintained that a December cut is \"not a foregone conclusion,\" emphasizing the need for more clear economic data once the shutdown ends. Firms like Goldman Sachs Research, however, still forecast a December cut, followed by two more 25-basis-point reductions in March and June 2026.\nKey players involved in this unfolding scenario include the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), market analysts from institutions like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, and gold traders and investors who are actively responding to interest rate expectations. The initial market reaction in the gold sector has been overwhelmingly bullish, with prices surging to multi-week highs and some analysts predicting it could test resistance levels around $4160 in the very short term, with forecasts of $4,500 to $4,700 per ounce by the end of 2026, and even surpassing $5,000 per ounce.\nWinners and Losers: Corporate Fortunes in a Shifting Landscape\nThe anticipated trajectory of US interest rate cuts and the sustained rally in gold prices create a distinct set of winners and losers across various public companies.\nGold Mining Companies (Potential Winners): The sustained high gold prices are a boon for gold mining companies, directly boosting their revenues and profit margins.\n- Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM): As one of the world's largest gold producers, Newmont's profitability is highly sensitive to gold prices. High prices directly enhance its earnings and cash flow.\n- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD): Another major global gold miner, Bar"

That would drive prices up by 56% to 75% initially to between $140 and $157 a barrel, says the report.\nThe World Bank also describes a \"medium disruption\" risk scenario in which crude reaches $109 to $121 per barrel. In the case of a \"small disruption\" oil prices would increase to a range of $93 to $102 a barrel.\nThe report says high prices of oil and other commodities \"would intensify food insecurity in the region and across the world.\"\n\u201cIf a severe oil price shock materializes, it would push up food price inflation that has already been elevated in many developing countries,\u201d said Ayhan Kose, the World Bank\u2019s deputy chief economist.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the World Bank\u2019s baseline outlook, crude is expected to average $90 a barrel in the current quarter before declining to an average of $81 a barrel in 2024 as the global economy slows.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) crude futures hovered above $82 and $88 per barrel Tuesday midday, down about 8% over the last 10 days.\nPrices surged more than 4% in one day after Hamas attacked Israel earlier this month, amid fears the fighting would bring in nearby Iran, an oil-producing country.\nThe World Bank report points out the conflict's modest impact on commodity prices so far reflects a more diversified world oil supply market, individual countries' petroleum reserves, and reduced overall oil dependence.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But it did much more than this: it reversed the balance of energy power in the world from where it had been left at the end of the 1973 Oil Crisis. As forecasts for the demand for gas continue to surge on fears of further global conflicts and on the dramatic expansion of data centres around the globe, the Middle East is looking to expand its own gas production, particularly with a view to developing its own shale resources. The U.S., in this context, is seen by these countries \u2013 most notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) \u2013 not as a future competitor but as a key knowledge resource, which is a status Washington is happy to adopt. After all, becoming an integral part of any country\u2019s energy production on the ground is as good a way as any \u2013 and a lot better than most \u2013 to keep those relationships running to the U.S.\u2019s best advantage.\nIt is interesting to note at this point the circularity of history here, albeit with a twist. Prior to 1973/74, the global oil industry had effectively been run by a small group of Western oil firms known as the \u2018Seven Sisters\u2019, as detailed in my latest book on the new global oil market order. These firms \u2013 comprised of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (which changed its name in 1935 to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and is now BP), Royal Dutch Shell, three iterations of Standard Oil (Standard Oil of California, Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Standard Oil Company of New York), Gulf Oil, and Texaco -- were able to control oil exploration, development, transport and pricing for decades up to October 1973. At that point, OPEC members \u2013 led by Saudi Arabia -- plus Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia, began an embargo on oil exports to the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Canada, and the Netherlands in response to their support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War. By the end of the resulting Crisis, in March 1974, the price of oil had risen from around US$3 per barrel (pb) to nearly US$11 pb before settling down for a while, before trending higher again. This, in turn, stoked the fire of a global economic slowdown, especially felt in the West. The then-Saudi Minister of Oil and Mineral Reserves, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, highlighted that the extremely negative effects on the West of the oil embargo marked a fundamental shift in the world balance of power between the developing nations that produced oil and the developed industrial nations that consumed it.\nHowever, from that point onwards, the U.S. was determined to keep the power of these Middle Eastern countries in check, which it largely achieved through a policy variant of Henry Kissinger\u2019s \u2018triangular diplomacy\u2019 that he advocated in formulating the dealings of the US with the two other major powers of the time, Russia and China. Kissinger served as National Security Advisor from January 1969 to November 1975 and as Secretary of State from September 1973 to January 1977. This variant was focused more on the simple \u2018divide and rule\u2019 principle that undermines opponents over time by playing one side off against the other, leveraging whatever fault lines ran through target areas at either a community, national or international level. These fault lines could be economic, political, or religious, or any combination thereof. This is what broadly marked U.S. policy in the Middle East up to the advent of its Shale Revolution. This in turn prompted the 2014-2016 Oil Price War with OPEC, again led by Saudi Arabia, which ultimately saw the U.S. triumphant, as also analysed in full in my latest book.\nAside from any other lessons that may have been learned by senior OPEC member countries was that the U.S. had extraordinarily managed to transform its then-nascent shale oil sector at the time of the breakout of the 2014-206 Oil Price War into a lean, mean, low-cost oil product"

                "body": "The United States has once again shattered its own crude oil production records, reaching unprecedented levels that are sending significant ripples through global energy markets. With production soaring to over 13.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in August 2025 and consistently maintaining figures above 13.6 million bpd in weekly October 2025 reports, the nation solidifies its position as the world's leading oil producer, a title it has held since 2018. This surge in output is creating an environment of abundant supply, directly contributing to a notable slump in global commodity prices and raising critical questions about the future of energy markets and the strategic policies of major oil-producing cartels like OPEC+.\nThe immediate implications are clear: a market awash with crude oil. Brent crude prices, a global benchmark, have dipped to just over $65 per barrel in early November 2025, marking a significant decline from the previous year. This downward pressure is anticipated to persist, with forecasts suggesting further drops into 2026. The robust US production, driven by advanced extraction technologies and favorable economic conditions, is reshaping the supply-demand balance, leading to increasing global oil inventories and intensifying competition among producers worldwide.\nUnprecedented Output Reshapes Global Energy Landscape\nThe trajectory towards record-breaking US crude oil production has been a consistent narrative over the past few years, culminating in a series of new benchmarks. After setting an annual record of 12.9 million bpd in 2023, surpassing the previous high from 2019, the momentum continued unabated. Monthly production figures steadily climbed, exceeding 13.3 million bpd in December 2023, then 13.4 million bpd in August 2024, and finally reaching an impressive 13.8 million bpd in August 2025, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Weekly figures in October 2025 consistently hovered around 13.6 million bpd, underscoring the sustained high output. The EIA (Energy Information Administration) forecasts an average of 13.5 million bpd for the full year 2025, with similar levels expected into 2026.\nThis remarkable surge is predominantly attributed to continuous technological advancements in the US shale industry. Innovations in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) have dramatically increased the efficiency and profitability of extracting oil from shale formations, allowing producers to achieve higher yields from new wells and sustain output from existing ones, even with a relatively stable or declining rig count. Beyond technology, favorable market dynamics, improved breakeven economics, and the imperative for operators to meet debt service requirements have incentivized maximum output. Key players driving this production boom include major independent producers operating in prolific basins like the Permian in Texas and New Mexico, alongside larger integrated companies.\nInitial market reactions have been characterized by a palpable sense of oversupply. Crude oil stocks in the US have shown an uptick, and global inventories are expected to swell through 2026. This abundance, coupled with increased production from other non-OPEC+ nations and the strategic easing of output curbs by some OPEC+ members aiming to reclaim market share, has created a bearish sentiment in the oil market. The consistent flow of crude from the Western Hemisphere, particularly from the US, combined with robust output from the Middle East, is contributing to a globally saturated supply environment, putting significant downward pressure on prices.\nWinners and Losers in a Saturated Market\nThe landscape of record US crude production creates a clear delineation between potential winners and losers within the energy sector, impacting public companies across the value chain.\nPotential Winners:\n- US Independent Producers: Companies heavily invested in shale plays, particularly in the Perm"

                "body": "- Fed cut pricing influencing EUR/USD moves\n- U.S. Data return may spark volatility\n- Watch 1.1550 support and downtrend resistance when assessing directional risks\nSummary\nEUR/USD remains tightly linked to Fed rate expectations, with correlations near extreme levels. With U.S. data flow still restricted and both central banks in wait-and-see mode, the pair may tread water until major releases return. Price action near key resistance suggests potential for a breakout, but until clearer signals emerge, traders should treat short-term moves with caution.\nFed Pricing Tightens Grip\nEUR/USD has been highly correlated with shifts in market pricing for Fed rate cuts out to the end of 2026 over the past month, especially the past week. That can be seen in the rolling correlation coefficients in the right-hand pane of the chart below, with scores over the past five, 10 and 20 days sitting at 0.94, 0.72 and 0.84, respectively. That\u2019s a strong and significant relationship between the two variables, and a far stronger one than for U.S. yields further out the curve or outright yield differentials between Europe and the U.S. over the same period. That means for anyone trading EUR/USD, any event that can meaningfully move Fed pricing deserves ample attention.\nSource: TradingView\nWhile an end to the U.S. government shutdown means top-tier U.S. economic data could start to arrive as soon as next week, before those volatility events hit, there\u2019s very little on the U.S. calendar to influence Fed pricing other than a raft of FOMC speakers. And given they, like us, don\u2019t have access to any official data to give an informed view on the likely path for rates, you have to question whether they\u2019ll deliver any true surprises. With ECB policy seemingly on autopilot for the time being, an equally busy speakers\u2019 calendar in Europe could easily deliver far more noise than signal.\nThe broader assessment therefore suggests we could enter a holding pattern until the big U.S. data events arrive, unless we receive some unscheduled headlines that meaningfully shift the Fed outlook. It also hints that price signals should be treated with extra caution until clarity is restored.\nEUR/USD Bulls Eyeing Breakout\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at EUR/USD on the daily chart, the pair is now wedged hard up against downtrend resistance running from the highs set in September. It took a look above the level earlier in the session, but the break didn\u2019t stick, with bears forcing it back beneath for now. However, with horizontal support at 1.1550 just over 30 pips below, there\u2019s a sense we may see a decent move soon.\nHaving delivered a three-candle morning star pattern last week and an engulfing candle on Tuesday, recent price signals have been bullish, pointing to the risk that if there is to be a move, it may be a topside breakout rather than a move lower. The signals from RSI (14) and MACD back this up, with the former now pushing back towards the neutral 50 level while the latter has already crossed over from below and is also starting to push higher. It\u2019s not an outright bullish message on momentum, but more a warning sign for bears that downside momentum is diminishing fast.\nIf we see a break and close above the September trendline, longs could be established above the level with a stop beneath for protection, targeting either 1.1650, the 50-day moving average or 1.1780.\nAlternatively, if the price reverses and closes beneath 1.1550 support, it would allow for shorts to be established with a stop above, targeting the November low at 1.1455 or the August 1 swing low of 1.1400."

The pair may continue its winning streak as the Euro (EUR) could further gain amid a cautious tone surrounding the European Central Bank (ECB) policy outlook. The ECB is expected to keep interest rates unchanged for now, backed by steady economic performance and inflation near target.\nTraders will likely observe the upcoming German inflation data, including Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for October, to gain further impetus on the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) policy outlook.\nThe EUR/USD pair maintains its position as the US Dollar (USD) holds gains due to optimism over the ongoing process to reopen the United States (US) government. The US Senate completed its job and passed the bill that would end the government shutdown. The House is set to vote on the bill on Wednesday, sending it to US President Donald Trump for signature. That would reopen the government, sending paychecks and unleashing economic data releases.\nHowever, the Greenback faced challenges as weaker-than-expected Automatic Data Processing (ADP), on Tuesday, employment data reinforced expectations of policy easing.

The CME FedWatch Tool shows markets pricing in a 68% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economi"

The pair\u2019s recent price behavior reflects a battle between recovering Euro sentiment and a fragile U.S. Dollar, as the market digests the end of the U.S. government shutdown and renewed speculation about a Federal Reserve rate cut in December.\nThe pair has oscillated between 1.1520\u20131.1580, caught in a tight corrective structure that highlights the absence of conviction on both sides. Despite improved European data and stabilizing political sentiment, the euro struggles to gain sustained traction against the greenback as traders await confirmation of U.S. economic direction following weeks of delayed data.\nFrom a broader lens, EUR/USD remains down nearly 2.3% from its October highs around 1.1830, reinforcing that the primary trend remains mildly bearish even as near-term corrections unfold.\nDollar Index and Macro Drivers Behind the Move\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) trades near 99.63, consolidating after rebounding from its 99.25 support zone. The dollar initially advanced on optimism surrounding the Senate\u2019s approval of a bill to reopen the government, ending the record 41-day shutdown. Yet, traders quickly shifted focus to weaker macro signals: the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell sharply to 50.3, its lowest since June 2022, underscoring growing concern about labor softness and declining confidence.\nThis combination\u2014shutdown relief and weak consumer data\u2014has trapped the dollar in a tug-of-war between short-term optimism and long-term policy anxiety. Futures now price a 62% probability of a 25-basis-point cut at the December Fed meeting and nearly 80% odds of a deeper easing cycle by early 2026.\nWith Treasury yields hovering near 4.10% on the 10-year note and inflation expectations softening, the greenback\u2019s upside momentum remains capped. That backdrop keeps EUR/USD supported above 1.1500, as investors hedge against a potential dovish pivot from the Fed.\nEuro Fundamentals: Stability Amid Modest Growth\nWhile the euro\u2019s upside remains limited, the fundamental picture in Europe has turned incrementally brighter. The European Central Bank (ECB) maintains a \u201csteady policy\u201d stance, with Vice President Luis de Guindos reaffirming that rates are \u201cappropriate\u201d given that inflation is nearing the 2% target. Markets no longer expect rate adjustments before late 2026, providing a relative policy cushion against the Fed\u2019s potential shift toward easing.\nAt the same time, the ZEW Economic Sentiment Survey, due midweek, is anticipated to reflect marginal improvement, driven by easing energy costs and resilient manufacturing orders in Germany. Analysts forecast the ZEW index to rise to 29.5 from 25.1 in October, which could fuel short-term buying in EUR/USD if realized.\nTechnical Landscape: Euro Caught Between Channel Resistance and Support\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains confined within a descending channel established since mid-October. The pair\u2019s recent high at 1.1580 marked a rejection from the channel\u2019s upper boundary, aligning with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 1.1588 and the 20-day EMA near 1.1580\u2014forming a tight resistance cluster.\nThe 50-day EMA at 1.1620 defines the structural barrier to any medium-term trend reversal. A daily close above this level would invalidate the current bearish setup, potentially opening a path toward 1.1675 and 1.1730, where the 100-day EMA sits.\nConversely, failure to hold above 1.1530 could invite renewed pressure toward 1.1470, with deeper"

The CME FedWatch Tool shows markets pricing in a 68% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling.

                "body": "The British Pound (GBP) faced significant headwinds today, 11/11/2025, as a wave of downbeat labor market data from the United Kingdom effectively \"snapped a four-day winning streak\" for the GBP/USD exchange rate. The unexpectedly weak figures have not only challenged the currency pair's recent rebound but have also dramatically intensified expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will implement an interest rate cut as early as December. This immediate depreciation of the Pound underscores the profound sensitivity of currency markets to economic indicators, painting a concerning picture for the UK's economic outlook and its standing in global financial markets.\nDetailed Coverage: A Deteriorating Labor Landscape\nThe latest set of UK labor statistics, covering the period from July to September 2025 and extending into October, revealed a troubling deterioration across several key metrics. The unemployment rate climbed to 5.0% in the July-September quarter, an unwelcome increase from 4.8% previously and surpassing market forecasts of 4.9%. This marks the highest level of joblessness seen in the UK since early 2021, signaling a significant cooling in the labor market. Further compounding the concerns, the number of payrolled employees experienced a notable decline, falling by 32,000 in both September and an additional 32,000 in October, reaching a total of 30.3 million. This represents the largest consecutive monthly fall since November 2020, with early October data indicating an even larger annual decline of 180,000 payrolled employees between September 2024 and October 2025.\nWage growth, a critical component in the Bank of England's fight against inflation, also showed signs of deceleration. Annual growth in average regular earnings (excluding bonuses) slowed to 4.6% in the July-September quarter, down from 4.7% and hitting its lowest point since April 2022. Total earnings, including bonuses, also saw a dip in annual growth to 4.8% in the same period, a decrease from 5.0% in August and slightly below the forecasted 4.9%. A more timely indicator, the HMRC median pay growth, slumped sharply to 3.1% year-on-year in October, suggesting a further weakening of wage pressures. These figures, alongside a modest increase of 2,000 in job vacancies (reaching 723,000) and a significant rise of 29,000 in the claimant count in October, collectively point to a labor market that is losing momentum rapidly.\nThe immediate reaction in the currency markets was swift and decisive. The British Pound experienced an instant slump of approximately half a percent against the US Dollar (USD), with the GBP/USD pair plunging to a low of $1.3120 from an opening around $1.3174. Other reports indicated a fall to $1.3128 from $1.3170, a 0.4% drop to 1.3120 from an opening of 1.3174, and trading around 1.3131, down 0.40% on the day. This sharp downturn not only halted the pair's recent upward trajectory but introduced a \"fresh bearish challenge,\" leaving the Pound \"hamstrung just south of the 1.3200 handle.\" The recovery from the 1.30 level met resistance at 1.32, leading to a sharp decline back towards 1.3125.\nFollowing the data release, market pricing for a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Bank of England in December surged from 60% to 80%, indicating a strong belief among investors that the central bank will be compelled to ease monetary policy to stimulate the slowing economy. Analysts, including those at Goldman Sachs, are now anticipating a greater degree of rate cuts from the BoE in the coming months, which is expected to further weigh on the Pound. From a technical perspective, the GBP/USD is now at a \"critical juncture,\" with increased downside risks. A sustained break below 1.3260 could initiate a neutral phase, and a decisive breach of a medium-term ascending trendline might expose further support levels at 1.3190 and 1.3140, potentially neutralizing the medium-term bullish outlook.\nCompanies Brace for Impact: Winners and Losers in a Weakening UK Econ"

                "body": "GBP/USD, DAX Forecast: Two trades to watch\nGBP/USD slumps as weak jobs data fuels BoE rate cut expectations\nGBP/USD is falling 2131 after weaker-than-expected labour market data boosted expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates next month.\nThe unemployment rate climbed to a four-year high of 5% up from 4.8% in the previous reading and exceeding expectations of 4.9%. Meanwhile, the employment level fell for the first time since 2024. The number of employees on payroll fell 32,000 following a downwardly revised 32,000 in September.\nRegular pay growth slowed to 4.6% the weakest level since February to April 2022. Well, total pay, including bonuses, rose to 4.8% slightly below the 4.9% forecast\n. The data highlights a weakness in the UK jobs market following the Chancellor\u2019s Budget, which increased the tax burden on employers. From April, employer National Insurance contributions rose, as did the minimum wage, making it more expensive for businesses to employ staff.\nFollowing the data, the market lifted BoE December rate cut expectations to 80% from 68% on Monday.\nThe report provides further evidence that the UK jobs market is weakening. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey voted to keep rates unchanged this month but signalled he could be persuaded to cut next month if incoming data confirmed that inflationary pressures were easing and that the labour market was continuing to weaken.\nAttention will now turn to GDP figures out on Thursday, which are expected to show growth of 0.2% down from 0.3% in Q2.\nThese data points come ahead of the November 26 budget, in which Reeves is expected to raise taxes on households to fill a funding gap. Increase tax code, slow growth, and inflation.\nGBP/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nGBP/USD\u2019s recovery from 1.30 ran into resistance at 1.32 before rebounding sharply lower to 1.3125 at the time of writing. Sellers will look to extend the selloff towards 1.31 and below here 1.30. A break below 1.30 opens the door to a much deeper selloff towards 1.27, the April low.\nAny recovery would need to rise above 1.32 to expose the 200 SMA at 1.3270\nDAX rises for a second day following a US government shutdown deal\nThe darks, along with their European peers, are rising on Tuesday as investors weighed up the potential end to the most extended U.S. government shutdown in history and looked ahead to the ZEW economic sentiment data.\nGlobal stocks had a strong start to the week, with European shares posting their largest daily gain in six months on Monday amid a relief rally following signs the US government shutdown was ending late last night. The US Senate passed a deal to restore U.S. Federal funding to reopen the government after its longest-ever shutdown. This will now be voted on in the House\nThe end of the shutdown restores economic stability and could also mean the resumption of crucial official data releases.\nGerman data from ZEW economic sentiment will be released today and is expected to rise to 40, up from 39.3 in October. Economic sentiment was weighed down in October by sluggish economic performance. However, recent German PMI figures showed that business activity was at a 2-year high, which could help boost economic sentiment. Upbeat data could help support the DAX.\nLooking ahead, the US ADP 4-week payroll average will be released and could provide some insight into the health of the labour market amid the data drought.\nDAX forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nThe DAX ran into resistance at its record high of 24,770 and eased lower. The price continues to trade above the rising trendline and consolidates on the 50 SMA.\nBuyers will look to extend above 24,400, the late October high, to bring 24,770 and fresh record highs into focus.\nSellers will need to break below the 50 SMA at 24000 to test the rising trendline support at 23,650. Below here the 200 SMA at 23,400 and the horizontal support come into focus.\nBy Fiona Cincotta\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the gene"

The AUD/USD pair declines as the US Dollar (USD) gains support from the ongoing process to reopen the United States (US) government.\nThe AUD may regain support from cautious sentiment surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy outlook. RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser said on Wednesday, \u201cOur best estimate is that monetary policy remains restrictive, though the committee continues to debate this.\u201d Hauser added that if policy is no longer mildly restrictive, it would have significant implications for future decisions.\nRBA Assistant Governor (Financial System) Brad Jones delivered a speech on Wednesday at the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) Conference in Broadbeach. Jones noted that markets are underestimating geopolitical risks and that global valuations remain complacent. He also highlighted early signs of fragmentation appearing in central bank Gold reserves.\nUS Dollar receives support as government shutdown nears end\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is halting its five-day losing streak and trading around 99.50 at the time of writing. Traders will likely observe the upcoming speeches from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials, including Christopher Waller, Raphael Bostic, and Stephen Miran, later in the day.\n- The US Senate completed its job and passed the bill that would end the government shutdown. The House will vote on the bill on Wednesday, sending it to President Donald Trump for signature. That would reopen the government, sending paychecks and unleashing economic data releases.\n- US President Donald Trump, on Monday, backed a bipartisan deal to end the US government shutdown, signaling a likely reopening within days. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he expects Trump to sign the bill once Congress passes it.\n- President Trump issued a premonition that inflation will reach 1.5% \"pretty soon\", a level of inflation that has evaded the US economy for nearly four years after shooting above that level in February of 2021. 1.5% inflation is also well below the long-run average for US inflation over ten years.\n- US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that the US federal shutdown's impact is getting worse for the economy. Making substantial progress on inflation and expecting prices to come down over the coming months, Bessent added.\n- Job losses in October, mainly in the government and retail sectors, and a drop in consumer sentiment to a three-and-a-half-year low in early November have reinforced expectations of policy easing. The CME FedWatch Tool shows markets pricing in a 68% chance of a 25 bps rate cut in December.\n- China's Ministry of Commerce said on Monday that it would temporarily lift its ban on approving exports of \u201cdual-use items\u201d related to gallium, germanium, antimony, and super-hard materials to the US. The suspension takes effect from Sunday until November 27, 2026. Any change in the Chinese economy could impact the AUD as China is a major trading partner for Australia.\n- National Bureau of Statistics of China reported on Sunday that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 0.2% year-over-year in October, recovering after a decline of 0.3% in September. The market consensus was for 0% in the reported period. CPI inflation increased 0.2% MoM in October, against 0.1% prior.

Forecasters predict a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.4%, down from the 4.5% recorded in September that marked a nearly four year high in the measure. The fall in the unemployment rate is predicted to be supported by a 20,100 employment increase for the month, also an improvement on a month earlier. However, with the notional breakeven number for employment a bit above 30,000, it\u2019s likely economists are assuming a lower participation rate in October.\n(Source: Trading Economics)\nA weak jobs report would put the RBA into a scary dilemma\nThe employment data comes hot on the heels of an RBA decision which saw the central bank adopt a decidedly hawkish stance. Owing to a shocking surprise in recent quarterly CPI data, which not only revealed an expected leap in headline inflation but also a very unexpected rise in underlying inflation to 3%, the RBA struck a very cautious tone about the prospect of future rate cuts. The central bank projected an inflation rate that would persist above target for much of 2026, leading to the markets pricing out the likelihood of further cuts. Pricing leading into the latest jobs report implies a roughly fifty-fifty chance the RBA cuts rates again from here. The markets had been discounting a full cut at the December meeting only weeks ago.\n(Source: RBA)\nWhile the RBA revised its forecasts meaningfully for inflation, the revision for the labour market wasn\u2019t quite as stark. The central bank lifted the projection for where it thinks the Australian unemployment rate will level-out at; however, the 4.4% forecast for the end of 2025 is below the current rate of 4.5%. It suggests the RBA is assuming a degree of resilience in the Australian economy and that the labour market ought to remain tight enough to avoid any uncomfortable trade-offs between jobs and inflation. A higher than expected unemployment rate in this week\u2019s data could push the RBA into the dilemma of prioritising one of its goals and the expense of the other. That could create policy uncertainty for the markets and potentially lead to heightened volatility.\nAustralian labour market conditions will impact the AUD/USD\u2019s long-term trend\nThe AUD/USD\u2019s 2025 uptrend, which has been largely a function of a broad-based US Dollar weakness, appears to be slowing down. Meanwhile, the pair\u2019s longer-term downtrend remains structurally in place, with the weekly chart revealing a loss of upside momentum. Labour market strength or weakness could be a major determinant of the short-term and long-term trend for the AUD/USD. A softening labour market could weigh on the pair, with the markets possibly repricing for the higher of odds of rate cuts, either on the belief that it could reflect more spare capacity in the economy and therefore lower inflationary risks, or that the RBA will sacrifice controlling inflation to protect the labour market. Alternatively, a jobs market that remains in a strong enough position for the RBA to remain solely focused on its inflation mandate could prop-up the AUD/USD, although such a dynamic could be offset should the US Dollar continue to appreciate.\n(Source: Trading View)\n(Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results)"

Bank of Japan monetary policy uncertainty and the US Senate vote on opening the government pushed USD/JPY to a nine-month high of 154.494 on Tuesday, November 11.\nThe BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions reflected division amongst policymakers. Policymakers expressed concerns about the effect of US tariffs on demand and a softer inflation outlook.\nMeanwhile, worries about a weaker yen leading to higher import prices and dampening households\u2019 purchasing power capped USD/JPY gains. In recent weeks, the Japanese government threatened yen intervention at 154 levels, raising the risk of a sharp reversal.\nOn Wednesday, November 12, Japanese economic indicators signaled resilience despite lingering concerns over tariffs.\nThe Reuters Tankan Index jumped from 8 in October to 17 in November, well above an expected 10. The Index climbed to its highest level since January 2022.\nEconomists view the monthly survey of manufacturers and non-manufacturers as a leading indicator of the BoJ\u2019s quarterly Tankan surveys. November\u2019s rise indicated a significant increase in private sector firms stating that business conditions were good rather than poor.\nCrucially, a marked improvement in sentiment across the manufacturing sector sent the Index higher, potentially easing the BoJ\u2019s concerns about US tariffs squeezing margins. The electronics and auto sectors were two highlights.\nUSD/JPY dropped from 154.089 to a post-data release low of 154.046 before climbing to a high of 154.162. Market reaction to the data underscored ongoing uncertainty about the BoJ raising interest rates in December, despite the upbeat data.\nThis mix of economic resilience and policy divergence has traders questioning whether intervention looms before year-end.\nNotably, the pair soared 4.2% in October. Uncertainty surrounding the BoJ, fueled by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s election victory and her commitment to an ultra-loose monetary policy, weighed on sentiment. However, USD/JPY has gained just 0.06% in November, with intervention threats limiting the upside.\nWhile Japanese data drew market attention early in the Wednesday session, Capitol Hill will take center stage later. The Senate approved a funding package to reopen the government on Tuesday, November 11, passing the bill to the House.\nMarkets expected a House vote to approve the Senate\u2019s measure, potentially reopening the government this week. However, USD/JPY is exposed to the risk of the House failing to approve the bill, given that it differs from the bill the House had originally passed to the Senate.\nFurther delays to the US government returning to office could trigger a US dollar sell-off, sending USD/JPY toward 153. On the other hand, the pair could rise toward 155 if the House approves the bill. However, a move toward 155 may draw the Japanese government\u2019s attention and potentially trigger more yen intervention threats, suggesting a choppy session.\nWhile Capitol Hill will take center stage, traders should monitor FOMC members\u2019 speeches. Views on inflation, labor market conditions, and potential economic fallout from the shutdown will influence bets on a December Fed rate cut.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a Fed rate cut in December were finely balanced, rising from 62.4% on November 10 to 67.9% on November 11.\nDespite near-term strength, the broader outlook remains bearish as narrowing rate differentials may favor the yen. The Fed remains on a dovish rate path, while the BoJ continues to keep a rate hike on the table, supporting a narrowing in rate differentials in favor of the yen.\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nFor more in-depth analysis, review today\u2019s USD/JPY trading setups in our latest reports and consult the economic calendar.\nWith over 28 years of experience in the financial industry, Bob has worked with various global rating agencies and multinational banks.

The intraday pullback followed disappointing labor data from the United States, which added to signs of a cooling job market and reinforced expectations for further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve (Fed).\nData released by ADP showed that the United States lost an average of 11,250 private-sector jobs in the four weeks ending October 25, compared with 14,250 previously. The weak reading heightened worries about slowing labor momentum, strengthening the view that the Fed may need to act sooner to support the economy. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets now price in a 70% probability of a December rate cut, up from 62% a day earlier.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback\u2019s value against a basket of six major peers, is holding near 99.40, close to a two-week low, marking five consecutive days of declines.\nMeanwhile, in Japan, remarks from Economy Minister Yoshitaka Kiuchi earlier on Tuesday highlighted renewed concern about the effects of a weak Yen and elevated inflation. Kiuchi said the government aims to achieve wage growth that exceeds inflation, while pledging to expand and implement measures to cushion the impact of higher prices on households. He acknowledged that the Yen\u2019s depreciation is raising import costs and that persistent inflation is weighing on private consumption.\nThe Japanese government is also preparing a new growth-oriented stimulus package, expected to be finalized on November 21, which will call on the BoJ to focus on sustainable economic growth alongside price stability. A key adviser to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi recently urged the central bank to avoid raising rates this year, warning that premature tightening could undermine Japan\u2019s fragile recovery.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

The dollar initially rallied to a fresh nine-month high at 154.50, before retracing as softer U.S. employment numbers reinforced expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets now assign a 70% probability of a 25-basis-point cut next month, up from 62% a day earlier. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slipped to 99.40, marking its fifth consecutive daily decline.\nBoJ\u2019s Reluctance to Tighten Policy Deepens Yen Weakness\nThe Japanese Yen remains under pressure as policymakers continue to resist further rate hikes. Minutes from the latest BoJ meeting revealed no urgency to act, with officials emphasizing the need for more economic data before considering another move. Japan\u2019s Economy Minister Yoshitaka Kiuchi warned that the weak yen, now hovering near 154 per dollar, is amplifying import costs and straining household budgets. The government aims to roll out a new stimulus package by November 21, designed to offset inflationary pain and spur domestic demand.\nAdding to dovish sentiment, Takuji Aida, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, cautioned that a rate hike in December would be \u201crisky,\u201d suggesting a more feasible path for tightening could emerge in early 2026 if growth conditions improve. This reinforced market expectations that monetary policy will remain ultra-loose into year-end. As a result, investors continue to sell the yen on rallies, keeping USD/JPY well bid near the upper boundary of its long-term range.\nU.S. Data Softens: Fed Cut Bets Strengthen\nThe U.S. labor market continues to lose momentum, amplifying expectations that the Federal Reserve may begin easing sooner than anticipated. ADP data showed the U.S. shed an average of 11,250 private-sector jobs in the four weeks ending October 25, down from 14,250 previously. The weakness, combined with a five-day slide in the dollar index, has prompted bond yields to stabilize near 4.35% on the 10-year Treasury, signaling cooling inflation expectations.\nThe ISM Services Index surprised to the upside, holding above 50, while the manufacturing index remained stuck in contraction territory. This divergence highlights a two-speed U.S. economy\u2014resilient in services but slowing in goods production. If this pattern persists, markets could price in not just one but two rate cuts in 2026, increasing the downside risk for the dollar over the medium term.\nTechnical Setup: Bulls Defend Key Support at 151.90, Eye Break Above 155\nTechnically, USD/JPY remains coiled in a tight range, with strong support near 151.92\u2013151.95 and firm resistance at 154.82\u2013155.03. The 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the yearly range defines this resistance zone, while the 200-day moving average at 149.32 serves as long-term support. The pair\u2019s recent consolidation suggests a potential breakout pattern\u2014if the price closes decisively above 155.00, momentum could carry the pair toward 156.50 and later 157.70, levels corresponding to the 100% Fibonacci extension of the April advance.\nMomentum indicators support this bullish bias. The RSI holds near 63, showing moderate strength without signaling overbought conditions, while the MACD remains positive. However, a failure to hold above 151.90 on a weekly close could trigger a correction toward 149.30\u2013148.90, the lower channel of the multi-month uptrend.

                "body": "USD/CAD Analysis: Is the Canadian Dollar Starting to Recover?\nOver the past three trading sessions, the USD/CAD has begun to show a renewed bearish bias, reflecting a rebound in the strength of the Canadian dollar. In the short term, the pair has recorded a decline of around -0.77%, accompanied by steady selling pressure, partly driven by expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which has contributed to the recent weakness of the U.S. dollar. If this factor remains relevant, downward pressure is likely to persist in USD/CAD price movements over the coming sessions.\nLower Rates Ahead?\nIn recent days, the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy outlook has begun to shift, as the CME Group FedWatch Tool now shows a 67.4% probability that the U.S. central bank will announce a rate cut, lowering its benchmark from the current 4.00% to 3.75% at the December 10 meeting. This expectation reinforces the view of a more accommodative Fed heading into the end of 2025, signaling a trend toward lower interest rates.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nIn contrast, the Bank of Canada (BoC) appears to be maintaining a more stable outlook. The probabilities indicate that the central bank will keep its policy rate at 2.25% during its December 10 meeting, with an estimated 90% likelihood of no changes. Unlike the Fed, the BoC seems to be adopting a neutral short-term stance, which could narrow the interest rate differential between the two central banks. This adjustment could, in turn, increase the short-term appeal of Canadian dollar-denominated assets.\nSource: Bankofcanadaodds\nAdditionally, the softer tone adopted recently by the Federal Reserve has led to a decline in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which have fallen from 4.15% to 4.12%. This reduction lowers the attractiveness of U.S. bonds, which in turn may be dampening foreign demand for U.S. dollars while supporting the Canadian dollar in the short term.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nAs a result, the recent policy shifts in the United States may be narrowing the divergence between the Fed and the BoC. Combined with lower bond yields, this environment could sustain a weaker U.S. dollar, reinforcing consistent selling pressure on USD/CAD. If this trend continues, the pair could experience continued bearish corrections in the coming sessions.\nUSD/CAD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend Still Intact: Despite the current short-term pullback in USD/CAD, the chart shows that the upward trendline established since late July remains intact. Recent declines have not been deep enough to threaten this structure. Moreover, a notable technical crossover has emerged, with the 50-period moving average crossing above the 200-period moving average, confirming that the long-term structural momentum remains bullish. Therefore, a deeper correction would likely be needed before the dominant bullish bias loses relevance. For now, the uptrend line continues to serve as the primary technical structure on the daily chart.\n- RSI: The RSI indicator shows a steady downward slope, gradually approaching the neutral 50 level. This reflects a balance between buying and selling pressure, suggesting that the pair could enter a period of indecision over the next few sessions, with no clear short-term direction as long as this technical neutrality persists.\n- MACD: The MACD shows a similar pattern, with its histogram fluctuating around the zero line, indicating a lack of directional strength. This setup suggests a neutral and range-bound scenario, typical of a consolidation phase in price action.\nKey Levels to Watch:\n- 1.41144 \u2013 Key Resistance: Corresponds to the recent highs and represents the most important bullish barrier to watch. A breakout above this level could reactivate a buying bias and strengthen the upward trendline that still dominates the chart.\n- 1.40326 \u2013 Current Barrier: A zone of indecision corresponding to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level on the chart. While price remains near this area, a sh"

The pair appreciates as the US Dollar (USD) gains support from the ongoing process to reopen the United States (US) government. Traders will likely observe the upcoming speeches from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials, including Christopher Waller, Raphael Bostic, and Stephen Miran, later in the day.\nThe US Senate completed its job and passed the bill that would end the government shutdown. The House will vote on the bill on Wednesday, sending it to US President Donald Trump for signature. That would reopen the government, sending paychecks and unleashing economic data releases.\nUS President Donald Trump, on Monday, backed a bipartisan deal to end the US government shutdown, signaling a likely reopening within days. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he expects Trump to sign the bill once Congress passes it.\nHowever, the Greenback faced challenges as weaker-than-expected Automatic Data Processing (ADP), on Tuesday, employment data reinforced expectations of policy easing. The CME FedWatch Tool shows markets pricing in a 68% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December.\nPrivate employers shed an average of 11,250 jobs per week on average in the four weeks ended October 25, compared with 14,250 previously. The report suggested the labor market slowed in the second half of October, compared with earlier in the month.\nThe USD/CAD pair faced challenges as the Canadian Dollar (CAD) advanced on increasing cautious sentiment surrounding the Bank of Canada (BoC) policy outlook, driven by last week\u2019s stronger-than-expected labor market data.\nAdditionally, the commodity-linked CAD received support from higher crude prices, given the status of Canada is the largest Oil exporter to the United States (US). West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price steadies after three days of gains, trading around $60.80 per barrel at the time of writing.\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, popularly known as OPEC+, is scheduled to publish its monthly market report later in the day, followed by the International Energy Agency\u2019s annual energy outlook. Both reports are expected to provide insights into forecasts through 2026 amid persistent concerns about oversupply.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CA"

                "body": "The USD/CAD pair is strengthening, reaching around 1.4035 in early European trading on Tuesday. This comes as the US Senate passes a funding bill that could soon end the federal government shutdown, boosting the US Dollar against the Canadian Dollar.\nIn Canada, the job market showed unexpected growth in October, which supports the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision to hold interest rates. The unemployment rate fell to 6.9% from 7.1%, and 66,600 jobs were added, marking a second month of surprise gains.\nFactors Influencing The Canadian Dollar\nThe Canadian Dollar is influenced by factors such as Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rates, Oil prices, and economic health. The US economy, Canada\u2019s largest trading partner, also affects the CAD\u2019s value. Higher Oil prices and strong economic data often lead to a stronger Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada sets interest rates to control inflation between 1-3%, impacting the Canadian Dollar. Changes in Oil prices and inflation data can directly affect the CAD\u2019s value. Economic indicators such as GDP and employment data play a role in determining the strength of the Canadian Dollar, with strong data generally leading to a rise in value.\nAs we look at the market on November 11, 2025, the USD/CAD pair is showing less strength than it did during historical periods of US fiscal stress, now trading closer to 1.3750. We remember when the pair pushed above 1.4000 during the government shutdown resolved under the Trump administration. Today\u2019s situation is different, as the market seems to be pricing in recurring budget negotiations as a standard feature of US politics.\nThe focus on the US side remains on fiscal policy, as the Congressional Budget Office recently projected the federal deficit to approach $2 trillion for the upcoming fiscal year. This ongoing fiscal pressure could weigh on the US Dollar, creating opportunities for traders to use options to hedge against or speculate on potential USD weakness. Consequently, buying CAD call options or USD put options could be a considered strategy to position for downside risk in the pair.\nCanadian Economic Developments And Strategies\nOn the Canadian side, the economic picture has evolved significantly since the period described. The Bank of Canada\u2019s key interest rate is now at 4.5%, substantially higher than the 2.25% level held back then. With Canada\u2019s unemployment rate holding steady at a relatively low 6.2% as of last month\u2019s data, the robust interest rate differential continues to favor the Canadian Dollar.\nFurthermore, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, a key Canadian export, has remained resilient, hovering around $80 per barrel. This provides a fundamental support level for the loonie that was also a factor in the past. For derivative traders, this backdrop makes strategies like selling USD/CAD futures contracts attractive, anticipating that strong oil prices and favorable interest rates will continue to bolster the CAD.\nGiven the competing forces of US fiscal uncertainty and strong Canadian fundamentals, implied volatility in the pair may increase in the coming weeks. This environment is suitable for traders considering volatility strategies like straddles, which could profit from a significant price move in either direction. Traders should also watch the upcoming US ADP employment figures closely, as any signs of weakness could accelerate a move lower in USD/CAD."

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair consolidates near a two-week peak, surpassing 203.00, as traders anticipate UK employment data. The pair\u2019s recent upward trend has paused due to caution amid the Bank of Japan rate hikes\u2019 uncertainty and UK\u2019s fiscal concerns, impacting the cross.\nUK\u2019s job report could justify a Bank of England rate cut, with unemployment projected to rise to 4.9%, the highest since 2021. A softer labour market may support further BoE easing, limiting aggressive bets on GBP and capping GBP/JPY gains. The Japanese Yen continues to underperform due to BoJ rate hike uncertainty.\nBank Of Japan Policy Considerations\nBoJ\u2019s policymakers expressed uncertainty over new policies\u2019 impact on their economy and future interest rate hikes. BoJ\u2019s cautious policy stance and market optimism lessen JPY\u2019s safe-haven appeal, slightly supporting GBP/JPY, though potential Japanese intervention limits currency pair gains.\nThe UK\u2019s ILO Unemployment Rate, a key economic indicator, highlights labour market health and significantly influences GBP valuation. An increase in unemployment signifies economic weakening, typically bearish for GBP, while a decrease is bullish. The next data release, scheduled for 11th November 2025, will provide further market insights.\nThe UK jobs report released today, November 11, 2025, shows unemployment has risen to 4.9%, the highest level we have seen since 2021. This confirms a cooling labor market and strengthens the case for a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut in the coming month. This data suggests that any strength in the British Pound will likely be limited.\nIn the coming weeks, we should consider strategies that benefit from potential Pound weakness against the Yen. Buying put options on GBP/JPY could be a prudent way to position for a downward move, as it offers a defined risk if the pair unexpectedly rallies. We are essentially betting that the bearish UK economic data will outweigh other factors.\nJapanese Yen\u2019s Persistent Weakness\nHowever, we must remember the Japanese Yen\u2019s own persistent weakness. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains uncertain about its next rate hike, citing concerns over the new prime minister\u2019s policies and wage growth. This ongoing hesitation to tighten policy has consistently undermined the Yen and should provide some support for the GBP/JPY pair, preventing a steep fall.\nLooking back, the Yen\u2019s depreciation has been a dominant theme since the global inflation surge of 2022-2023, as the BoJ diverged from other central banks. While Japanese authorities may talk about intervention, their actions have historically offered only temporary relief for the currency. Therefore, we should see any dips in GBP/JPY as a battle between two weakening currencies rather than a one-sided decline.\nThe critical factor for us is that UK inflation has been falling, with the latest figures from October showing the Consumer Price Index at 3.1%. This is significantly down from the multi-decade highs we saw a few years ago. With inflation trending down and unemployment now rising, the BoE has a much clearer justification to begin easing monetary policy.\nThis sets up a dynamic where the BoE is signaling future rate cuts more clearly than the BoJ is signaling rate hikes. Consequently, we should be cautious about long positions and watch for signs that selling pressure on the Pound is accelerating. The market will be highly sensitive to any further dovish comments from BoE officials."

The GBP/JPY extended its reversal from Monday\u2019s highs near 203.20 to session lows right above 202.30, before picking up to the 202.60 area at the time of writing.\nData released by National Statistics earlier on the day showed that the ILO Unemployment Rate rose to a four-year high of 5% in the three months to September, against expectations of a steady 4.9% reading.\nThe higher jobless rate comes on the back of a 29,000 increase in jobless claimants in October, which surpasses the market consensus of a 20,300 increase following a 400 increase in the previous month. These figures have taken the claimant count rate to 4.4% in October,, up from 4.3% in September.\nBeyond that, wage growth has eased to a 4.8% year-on-year pace in the three months ending in September, from 5% in the previous month, disappointing markets, which were expecting a 4.9% reading. These figures, coupled with the steady consumer inflation numbers released in October, pave the path for further BoE monetary easing in December.\nFrom a broader perspective, the pair remains steady near recent highs with Yen weakness keeping the Sterling from falling further.

Margins compress, and the floor is your energy cost.\u201d\nThiel painted a picture of a maturing and more brutal industry, where only miners with access to low-cost, reliable energy \u2014 or new business models \u2014 will survive. Increasingly, he said, many mining firms are pivoting to adjacent fields, such as artificial intelligence or building out high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Others are simply being outcompeted by players who deploy their own hardware at a lower cost, including major manufacturers and companies like Tether.\n\u201cYou have hardware vendors running their own mining operations because customers aren\u2019t buying as much equipment,\u201d Thiel said. \u201cThe global hashrate keeps growing, which means everyone else\u2019s margins keep shrinking.\u201d\nTough path ahead\nThiel warned that the landscape for miners could become even more dire after the next bitcoin halving in 2028, when block rewards will be cut in half again \u2014 this time to just over 1.5 BTC. Unless transaction fees rise or the price of bitcoin surges, the economics of mining will become unsustainable for many.\n\u201cBitcoin was designed with the idea that transaction fees would eventually replace the subsidy,\u201d Thiel said. \u201cBut that hasn\u2019t happened. If bitcoin doesn\u2019t grow at 50% or more annually, the math gets very tough after 2028 \u2014 and even tougher in 2032.\u201d\nDespite several short-lived spikes, transaction fees on the bitcoin network remain relatively low. Most of the recent fee surges, like those caused by Ordinals and inscriptions, haven\u2019t sustained long enough to replace block subsidies. Thiel said miners are watching for new trends, such as banks pre-purchasing block space to guarantee settlement priority, that could change the dynamic \u2014 but nothing concrete has emerged.\nIn this environment, smaller miners face serious pressure. Larger players are adapting by controlling energy sources and investing in private infrastructure for AI, while leaner operators may be forced to shut down.\n\u201cOur strategy is to be in the lowest quartile in terms of production cost,\u201d Thiel said. \u201cBecause in a tight market, 75% of the other guys have to shut down before we do.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Thiel expects the market to self-regulate as miners hit profitability limits. But the threshold is rising fast. \u201cBy 2028, you\u2019ll either be a power generator, be owned by one, or be partnered with one,\u201d he said."

Thiel explained that it gets tougher for everyone else when more individuals join in. This is because profit declines, and one\u2019s minimum cost is the funds spent on energy, he added.\nMARA CEO raises concerns about the situation surrounding the Bitcoin mining industry\nThiel noticed that several mining firms are shifting their focus to related areas such as artificial intelligence or developing high-performance computing (HPC) systems.\nAccording to his findings, others struggled because they cannot keep up with the pace of those operating their own hardware at minimal cost, such as leading manufacturers and companies like Tether.\n\u201cYou have hardware suppliers running their own mining businesses since customers are not buying as much equipment,\u201d Thiel stated. Based on his argument, the global hashrate continues to surge, affecting everyone else\u2019s profits, causing them to shrink.\nFollowing the intense nature of this situation, the MARA CEO cautioned that things could worsen for miners after the next Bitcoin halving in 2028. At this time, the block reward for miners will reduce to approximately 1.5 BTC per block.\nTherefore, if transaction charges do not increase or if Bitcoin\u2019s price does not escalate significantly, Thiel warned that mining could be profitless for many.\nTo further explain his argument, he claimed that Bitcoin was designed with the idea that transaction charges would ultimately replace subsidies. However, Thiel mentioned that this idea has not yet materialized, leading him to conclude that if Bitcoin does not increase by 50% or more each year, it will become challenging after 2028 and considerably tougher in 2032.\nIn the meantime, analysts discovered some temporary increases in the industry. Still, sources declare that, although there have been some temporary increases, transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are generally low. According to these sources, the latest hikes in charges, such as those from inscriptions and Ordinals, have not lasted long enough to replace block subsidies.\nThiel believes the mining industry market will eventually balance itself\nThiel mentioned that miners should pay close attention to new developments, such as banks purchasing block space in advance to ensure priority in transactions. According to the CEO, this move is a game-changer in the industry, but nothing is solid yet.\nIn such a scenario, smaller miners are extremely stressed. Large entities adapt to the situation by controlling their energy sources and investing in private AI infrastructure, while smaller companies may be forced to close down.\nTo address this issue, Thiel stated that they plan to maintain their production costs in the lowest 25%. With this percentage in place, the MARA CEO asserted that in a tough mining market, 75% of their competitors will have to close before they do.\nLooking forward, Thiel believed that the market would eventually balance itself as miners attain their profit limits. However, he noted that this limit is rising swiftly. \u201cBy 2028, you\u2019ll either need to generate power yourself, be owned by a power generator, or team up with one,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cThe time for being a miner connected directly to the grid is running out.\u201d\nWant your project in front of crypto\u2019s top minds?

                "body": "Most Reliable Bitcoin Boom Indicator Just Went Off-Script: Expert\nChartered Market Technician (CMT) Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d Severino argues that Bitcoin\u2019s most dependable macro tell\u2014the copper-to-gold ratio\u2014has broken character at the very moment the market typically enters a parabolic phase, leaving the post-halving script in disarray and altcoins without their usual rotation.\nWhy The Copper/Gold Ratio Is Crucial For Bitcoin\nIn a 16-minute video analysis published on November 10, Severino frames the copper/gold ratio as a \u201cgrowth versus fear index,\u201d where copper strength signals expansion, rising yields and appetite for risk, while gold outperformance maps to recession risk, falling yields and risk-off behavior.\n\u201cWhen gold is performing better than copper, it typically means economic slowdown [and] general recession fears,\u201d he said, adding that copper\u2019s industrial demand anchors the ratio to the business cycle. The punchline: the ratio\u2019s cyclical turn that historically coincides with Bitcoin\u2019s vertical phase simply never arrived. \u201cThey say the most dangerous thing to say in investing is that this time is different. Well, this time is different,\u201d Severino said. \u201cThe business cycle based on the copper versus gold ratio did not turn back up.\u201d\nSeverino contends that the four-year halving lore is at best incomplete and at worst misattributed. He overlays prior halving dates with a Fisher Transform signal on the copper/gold ratio and observes that the true inflection has historically been macro, not supply-driven. \u201cI never really thought it was the halving,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same halving date started a bull run in the Nasdaq [\u2026] the halving in Bitcoin would not really have any effect on tech stocks.\u201d In his construction, the halving has coincided with, rather than caused, the ratio\u2019s upswing and a risk-on impulse that typically propels Bitcoin beyond prior highs into a final, parabolic leg.\nThis cycle diverged. After briefly producing a \u201chigher high\u201d in the ratio\u2014the first since roughly 2010\u2014copper/gold failed to establish a higher low and instead printed \u201canother lower low,\u201d marking, in Severino\u2019s words, the lowest reading in about 15 years on his chart\u2014\u201csince pretty much since the Great Recession.\u201d\nThe Fisher Transform that had historically flipped up to confirm the risk-on window never delivered the full follow-through. \u201cIt was supposed to send Bitcoin into the final stage of its parabolic rally [\u2026] we didn\u2019t go parabolic after going above all-time high. We\u2019re just kind of meandering sideways.\u201d\nIs The Bitcoin Cycle Top In?\nTiming-wise, that failure matters. Severino measures roughly a year between the ratio\u2019s go-signal and Bitcoin\u2019s cycle top in prior episodes. By that yardstick, \u201cwe really should have topped\u201d already or, if anchored to the March breakout above the 2021 high, would at least be entering a risk-off window. But without the definitive risk-on impulse, the cycle landmarks blur. \u201cBecause we didn\u2019t get the full risk on, I don\u2019t know where the risk off signal is,\u201d he said.\nThe implications extend to altcoins and Bitcoin dominance. Historically, the ratio\u2019s green \u201crisk-on\u201d phase lined up with \u201calt season,\u201d but this time the setup never materialized. \u201cYou normally get your alt season at these green points [\u2026] We didn\u2019t get it here,\u201d Severino said, noting Bitcoin dominance is holding key support on higher-timeframe views. He also highlights an \u201cextremely strong negative correlation\u201d between Bitcoin and the copper/gold ratio at present; in past cycles, correlation drifting toward zero tended to coincide with altseason. \u201cNone of the conditions for altcoin season seem to be here based on past economic signals,\u201d he added.\nSeverino stops short of a deterministic call. The ratio\u2019s trend structure is ambiguous\u2014one failed breakout from a long downtrend does not make an uptrend\u2014and the Fisher signal could still turn. But until it does, he argues, macro says caution.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the fear sort of side of this ratio. We need to still be defe"

                "body": "November 11, 2025 \u2013 The digital asset treasury (DAT) sector, once hailed as a gateway for traditional investors into the burgeoning crypto market, is currently grappling with a significant downturn. Several prominent Ethereum-focused firms, including BitMine Immersion Technologies (NASDAQ: BMNR), ETHZilla (NASDAQ: ETHZ), and SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET), have seen their stock prices consistently trade below the intrinsic value of their underlying Ethereum (ETH) holdings. This unsettling trend, which has intensified throughout the latter half of 2025, signals a profound shift in investor sentiment and raises critical questions about the viability of indirect crypto exposure models.\nThe immediate market reaction has been stark, with these companies experiencing substantial stock declines and a rapid erosion of the market premiums they once commanded. What began as isolated dips has evolved into a sustained re-evaluation by investors, who are increasingly scrutinizing the business models and dilution risks associated with these entities. This phenomenon is not merely a fleeting market anomaly but an ongoing indicator of a maturing, and perhaps more discerning, crypto investment landscape. It underscores a growing preference for direct crypto exposure over equity vehicles, challenging the foundational premise of many publicly traded crypto treasury companies.\nMarket Impact and Price Action\nThe underperformance of Ethereum treasury firms has manifested in sharp price declines and a significant compression of their market-to-Net Asset Value (mNAV) multiples. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NASDAQ: BMNR), a key player in the Ethereum holding space, saw its stock price fall below its ETH holdings in late 2025. By October 19, 2025, BMNR's mNAV had dipped below 1.0, signifying that its market capitalization was less than the value of its Ethereum assets. Earlier, on August 27, 2025, the stock experienced a notable pullback despite announcing an increase in its ETH holdings, highlighting investor skepticism towards expansion via dilution. By November 7, 2025, BitMine was reportedly facing approximately $2.1 billion in unrealized losses on its Ethereum holdings, with its stock down 20-30% over the preceding month.\nSimilarly, ETHZilla (NASDAQ: ETHZ), which pivoted to an Ethereum treasury strategy in August 2025, quickly encountered headwinds. After an initial surge, shares plunged nearly 30% on August 26, 2025, following disclosures of a potential convertible share offering. By September 12, 2025, ETHZilla was trading at a 20% discount to its net asset value, and by early October, it had fallen over 84% from its mid-August peak. A 1-for-10 reverse stock split on October 20, 2025, provided a temporary per-share price boost but failed to address the underlying valuation issues, with the stock also declining over 20-30% in the month leading up to November 9, 2025. SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET), another firm that transitioned to an Ethereum treasury model, also saw its shares drop over 20% on July 19, 2025, after announcing a significant stock sale to fund ETH acquisitions. By October 19, 2025, SBET's mNAV had also fallen below 1.0, with shares slipping approximately 13% over October.\nThis widespread underperformance is largely attributed to aggressive share dilution through \"At-The-Market (ATM)\" equity programs. While effective for raising capital to acquire more crypto when stocks trade at a premium, this strategy has led to an oversupply of shares, depressing prices when investor demand for these indirect crypto plays wanes. The market's shift away from viewing these firms as growth plays towards seeing them as expensive wrappers for underlying assets has also contributed to the decline. The correlation with Ethereum's price volatility remains a significant factor; broader crypto market corrections, including an ETH price slide in early November 2025, directly exacerbated the stock declines of these treasury firms.\nThe situation bears "

Sustained support from LTHs and rising sentiment could fuel this upward trajectory, allowing ETH to escape its bearish grip.\nETH Price Analysis.

The token has shown remarkable resilience after the October correction, remaining comfortably above $150 and maintaining upward momentum as the broader market stabilizes.\nAt the same time, a new project is leading the meme-coin narrative -- AlphaPepe (ALPE). Built on BNB Chain, AlphaPepe is combining meme-culture enthusiasm with transparency and verifiable functionality. As Solana cements its position as the market's high-performance blockchain, AlphaPepe is drawing both retail and whale attention as one of the most credible meme-coin presales of 2025.\nSolana (SOL) is currently trading around $165-$170, marking a steady climb from early-November lows and putting it within reach of its summer highs. Technical indicators show consistent support between $150-$155, while resistance is forming around $175-$180. A sustained close above that range could set Solana on track to retest the $190-$200 zone in the near term.\nWhat makes Solana particularly impressive is its on-chain consistency. The network processes tens of thousands of transactions per second with near-zero fees, maintaining high throughput even during periods of volatility. This performance has made Solana one of the most active ecosystems in the crypto market, powering a growing range of applications in NFTs, DeFi, gaming, and payments.\nRecent reports show daily active addresses and network activity remaining robust, confirming that the blockchain's fundamentals are driving long-term engagement. As liquidity flows back into altcoins, Solana's low-cost and high-speed model continues to attract developers and users seeking efficiency.\nAnalysts describe Solana's current structure as \"constructive consolidation\" -- a healthy period of accumulation following a sharp uptrend. The key levels to watch remain $150 as support and $175-$180 as immediate resistance. Maintaining these levels suggests buyers are confident that Solana's growth trajectory will persist.\nIn the medium term, factors that could drive Solana's next move include increased institutional interest in the Solana ecosystem, broader adoption of decentralized applications, and continued improvements in network stability and developer tooling. Many investors now view Solana as one of the most scalable alternatives to Ethereum, capable of handling mainstream adoption without sacrificing performance.\nWith transaction costs near zero and user engagement climbing, Solana appears well-positioned to maintain its strength heading into 2026.\nWhile Solana continues to dominate the infrastructure narrative, AlphaPepe (ALPE) is leading the charge in meme-coin excitement. The project has raised nearly $400,000 in its presale phase, attracting a fast-growing community of over 3,500 holders and gaining momentum with every weekly price increase.\nOne of AlphaPepe's most innovative features is instant token delivery. Unlike most presales that require investors to wait until launch, AlphaPepe sends tokens directly to buyers' wallets immediately upon purchase -- a sign of transparency and operational readiness that builds trust from day one.\nThe project also offers staking rewards during the presale, allowing holders to earn passive income before listing. Its USDT reward pool has already distributed more than $9,000 to early participants, confirming that AlphaPepe's reward systems are active and functioning.\nSecurity and trust are at the forefront of AlphaPepe's design. The project achieved a 10/10 audit score from BlockSAFU, and liquidity will be locked at launch, protecting investor funds. AlphaPepe also features NFT rewards for top holders and a referral program that pays a 10% bonus for invited purchases -- further fueling organic community growth.\nFor investors, AlphaPepe's structured approach sets it apart from traditional meme-coin launches.

It appears to be a tense environment where Solana is being accumulated while at the same time facing negative market sentiment. The current level below $160 has been identified as a point of relevance as it is a reversal level between $145 & $155.\nA hold above this level could spark a resurgence to $200, while a breakdown could see additional declines. In a period where traders monitor SOL\u2019s make-or-break levels, a question arises as to which cryptocurrencies to buy, having the potential to explode while having a safety net from volatility. The indication increasingly shifts from volatile leaders to a trailblazing defi crypto project, which is in the final level of presale, positioning itself as the next crypto to explode, founded on actual use.\nSolana\u2019s Institutional Test\nThe case of Solana is a classic example of a challenge between the on-chain data and market price. The large influx of funds into the ETF indicates strong institutional confidence in the long-term validity of the ecosystem, thanks to the high transaction rate. The decrease in price, however, indicates a strong reliance on the market environment.\nAltcoin Gordon, an analyst, identifies this region as an exceptional accumulation opportunity in light of Solana\u2019s pattern of recovering from a similar level of support. Nevertheless, from the perspective of investors looking for a clearer indication of where to put their investment in crypto, this period of consolidation can be considered a waiting game, whose results remain ambiguous. This ambiguity is propelling investment to a certain crypto based on mechanics-driven growth.\nMutuum Finance: The Unshakable DeFi Player\nMutuum Finance (MUTM), is a very timely and one-of-a-kind investment opportunity for those looking for the best crypto to buy. The presale has raised a monumental amount of $18,580,000, thanks to a strong community of 17,850 members. The final stages of phase 6 are being concluded, offering tokens as low as $0.035.\nA point of critical mass has been achieved, because more than 90% of this round has been sold, which is the absolute final call to buy MUTM at this price. The next round, Phase 7, will implement a near 20% jump to $0.040, cementing a 400% ROI on the initial investors at $0.06. This is more than an investment; it is a limited opportunity to stake a claim on the next crypto to explode.\nDual Lending Architecture\nThe essence of Mutuum Finance\u2019s value chain lies in the innovative dual lending model, which focuses on maximizing capital efficiency. The lending protocol has two interacting markets, including the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools supporting high liquidity assets such as ETH and USDT, referred to as high-liquidity assets, as well as the Peer-to-Peer markets, which support lending on non-high liquidity tokens.\nIn essence, this provides a guarantee that both conventional yield farmers as well as sophisticated traders looking for tailored conditions have a place within the ecosystem. This refined use case is exactly what sets MUTM completely apart as a defi crypto asset, as it is in no way speculative, as many assets are today.\nThe Imminent V1 Protocol Launch\nAdding another layer of irrefutable credibility, Mutuum Finance has formally announced the upcoming launch of the V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet this quarter. This development will mark the first step from the theoretical whitepaper to being a working lending and borrowing platform, integrating elements such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidation.\nThe initial support for ETH & USDT will give a proven market for actual testing, thus reducing the risks associated with investment, as it will demonstrate the project\u2019s dedication to a timely & transparent rollout. For investors deliberating on which crypto to invest in, this development progress"

                "body": "US stock futures extended their gains in the Asian session on Wednesday, November 12. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 eyed three-day winning streaks. Market optimism that the House will pass the funding bill to reopen the US government lifted demand for risk assets after Monday\u2019s Senate vote.\nRising optimism about the US economy and lingering hopes for a December Fed rate cut contributed to the modest morning gains. In contrast to optimism across corporate America, consumer pessimism over the job market is soaring.\nThe Kobeissi Letter shared the latest statistics, stating:\n\u201c71% of US consumers expect an increase in unemployment over the next 12 months, the highest since the 1980s peak. This percentage has DOUBLED in less than a year and is now above the 2008 peak. Additionally, the perceived probability of job loss among consumers hit 23%, the 2nd-highest in at least 15 years. Such grim labor market sentiment has never been seen outside of a recession.\u201d\nA sharply deteriorating labor market and cooling inflation would allow the Fed to cut rates aggressively to bolster the economy. However, US stock futures remain exposed to stagflation risks. The Fed could delay cutting rates if inflation remains elevated, even if the economy shows signs of slowing. While rate cuts could bolster risk appetite, growing stagflation concerns may limit gains.\nFutures extended gains during Wednesday\u2019s Asian session. The Dow Jones E-mini gained 21 points, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini climbed 83 points, while the S&P 500 E-mini rose 10 points.\nLater on Wednesday, the House vote on the funding bill to reopen the government will take center stage. US stock futures could retest their October all-time highs if the House passes the funding bill.\nWill the House vote spark a risk rally or trigger a pullback?\nGiven changes to the bill that the House had previously sent to the Senate, markets remain exposed to a prolonged shutdown.\nTraders will also continue to monitor FOMC members\u2019 speeches for views on inflation, the labor market, and potential economic fallout from the US government shutdown. Calls to delay rate cuts amid concerns over sticky inflation could raise stagflation risks and weigh on US stock futures. On the other hand, support for a December rate cut to bolster the labor market and broader economy may lift sentiment.\nMeanwhile, corporate earnings will also be in focus, with Cisco (CSCO) in the spotlight.\nRecent gains have pushed US stock futures further from key technical levels, indicating a bullish bias.\nNear-term trends will hinge on the House vote, Fed chatter, and earnings. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nTraders brace for a pivotal session as the crucial House vote on the funding bill dominates sentiment.\nMeanwhile, Fed speakers, speculation about the Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Trump\u2019s tariffs, and earnings will provide a market distraction.\nGiven these key market drivers, US stock futures remain exposed to increased volatility in the coming sessions.\nFollow our live coverage and consult the economic calendar for real-time market updates.\nWith over 28 years of experience in the financial industry, Bob has worked with various global rating agencies and multinational banks.

                "body": "New York, NY \u2013 November 11, 2025 \u2013 The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has today surged to an unprecedented all-time high, pushing past significant milestones and reinforcing a complex, yet largely optimistic, sentiment across the financial markets. This monumental achievement signals a robust, albeit cautious, wave of investor confidence, underpinned by a unique blend of economic expectations and corporate performance. The blue-chip index's ascent reflects a broader narrative of economic resilience, even as underlying currents hint at a discerning shift in investment strategies.\nThe immediate implications of this record-breaking performance are multifaceted. While the headline figure paints a picture of widespread prosperity, a closer look reveals a nuanced market landscape. Investor confidence, particularly in established blue-chip companies, has received a significant boost, fueled by positive corporate earnings and the anticipation of continued monetary policy easing. However, this optimism is tempered by a notable divergence, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite experiencing a slight dip, suggesting a rotation out of high-growth technology stocks and into more value-oriented sectors. This shift indicates that while the overall market is strong, investors are becoming increasingly selective, seeking stability and perceived undervaluation in a dynamic economic environment.\nUnpacking the Ascent: A Detailed Look at the Market's Milestone\nToday's record close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average marks a significant moment in the financial calendar of 2025. While specific point figures are still being tallied, the index's climb above previous thresholds, reportedly approaching the 48,000 mark, signifies its 16th record close for the year, a testament to sustained bullish momentum. This remarkable achievement is not a sudden phenomenon but the culmination of several key factors that have been shaping market sentiment and investor behavior throughout the year.\nThe timeline leading up to this moment has been characterized by a series of pivotal developments. Expectations of continued interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have been a significant catalyst, with market participants eagerly awaiting further easing of monetary policy to stimulate economic growth. This anticipation has been closely tied to the availability of critical labor and inflation data, which, despite a temporary U.S. government shutdown earlier in the year, was expected to resume its flow, guiding the Fed's decisions. Strong corporate earnings reports from many Dow components have consistently reinforced investor enthusiasm, showcasing solid revenue growth and improved profit margins across various sectors. Companies like Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK), Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN), and Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) have been cited among those leading the charge, demonstrating the appeal of established firms with robust fundamentals. Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) also contributed to renewed confidence with positive long-term projections and an expanded share buyback program.\nKey players in this market ascent include the Federal Reserve, whose monetary policy decisions continue to wield immense influence over market direction, and the corporations themselves, whose earnings and forward guidance dictate investor appetite. The political landscape, particularly the resolution of the temporary government shutdown, also played a crucial role in bolstering confidence by ensuring the continuity of economic data essential for informed decision-making. Initial market reactions, beyond the general optimism, have highlighted a distinct rotation from growth-oriented technology stocks, which had previously benefited from the \"AI bull trade,\" towards value stocks and broader sectors of the U.S. economy, such as healthcare, energy, and consumer staples. This shift suggests a cautious approach by investors, who are increasingly scrutinizing valuations and seeking more stable, less overvalued ass"

The total number of people seeking work climbed to a five-year high of 1.79m, levels last seen when Britain was in Covid lockdown.\nAt the same time, pay growth in the public sector soared to a two-year high of 6.6pc, while private sector pay growth slumped to 4.2pc, its weakest since early 2021.\nThe pound fell and the FTSE 100 hit a new record high as traders increased bets that the Bank of England would cut interest rates to support the jobs market.\nThomas Pugh, chief economist at RSM UK, said the \u201cfurther slowing in private sector pay growth throws the door wide open to a December rate cut \u2013 as long as the Budget is as deflationary as the Chancellor hinted at last week\u201d.\nThe change in rate expectations sent the cost of short-term government borrowing down to its lowest level in more than a year.

                "body": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The seventh iteration of Made in L.A., the Hammer Museum\u2019s biennial exhibition showcasing artists working in the greater Los Angeles area, contains few surprises. The curators\u2019 self described \u201cno-methodology methodology\u201d results in a scattered exhibition that feels bland and curatorially unimaginative.\nDespite this, the show contains some strong work, especially in cases where the artists have been given their own rooms \u2014 for example, Hanna Hur\u2019s gorgeous five-panel installation \u201cSuspension\u201d (2025), installed in a vault-like gallery. Each painted panel consists of a grid of faint white lines dotted with white flower-like patterns. The interaction between the grid and the flower motif creates a sense of spatial confusion when viewing the work. This effect is only enhanced by the room\u2019s architecture: The lines in the cement floor and the curved shadows cast from a panel, which appears to be floating in midair, become a vital part of the viewing experience. Hur\u2019s quiet work transforms one\u2019s perception of both the viewer\u2019s physical space and the spaces she creates within each painting.\nNa Mira disorients histories and mythologies in \u201cSugungga (Hello)\u201d (2025).\u201d The work references a Korean allegory in which a sick dragon king trying to cure itself lures and is subsequently tricked by a rabbit. Two videos are projected onto opposite sides of a holographic glass \u2014 one filmed in a cab driving around the outside perimeter of a walled former military building, constructed by the Japanese army and later used as a US military base, and the other showing an inflatable rabbit sculpture inside of the grounds. These projections collapse inside and outside. They cast ghostly moving shadows and distorted imagery around the room and onto other viewers. The story of Korea\u2019s occupiers is literally embodied by this one building, and the work\u2019s confusing boundaries cast the viewer as both victim and complicit co-conspirator, as both inside and outside systems of power.\nAnother standout is an assemblage by Gabriela Ruiz comprised of cartoonishly painted screaming faces, a surveillance camera that displays the viewer on a screen, and an LED streetlamp. This piece perfectly embodies our fraught relationship with technology, wherein we willingly allow ourselves to be surveilled by social media platforms under the guise of connecting with others. These platforms have also manipulated and damaged our thought patterns, siloing us into our own personalized echo chambers and flattening commerce, memes, life milestones, and horrifying news clips into a single bland stream of content vying for our attention. The work is appropriately titled \u201cCollective Scream\u201d (2025).\nOther highlights include Amanda Ross-Ho\u2019s hilarious and poignant oversized replicas of her father\u2019s residential nursing home door adorned with seasonal decorations, Carl Cheng\u2019s singular erosion machines, and Patrick Martinez\u2019s installation of a ruined and graffiti\u2019d cinderblock structure, \u201cBattle of the City on Fire\u201d (2025).\nWithout a clear curatorial thesis, Made in L.A. reverts to the default modus operandi of large museum group exhibitions, which is to add legitimacy and cultural capital to artists who have already been vetted by the market or other institutions. Even as a relative newcomer to Los Angeles (I moved here about five years ago), many of the artists included are already familiar to me and have been showing regularly throughout the city. I\u2019d love to see the next Made in L.A. go \u201coff menu\u201d a little more.\nMade in L.A. 2025 continues at the Hammer Museum (10899 Wilshire Boulevard, Westwood, Los Angeles) through March 1, 2026. The exhibition was organized by Essence Harden and Paulina Pobocha, with Jennifer Buonocore-Nedrelow."

                "body": "Baltimore, Maryland, Nov 11, 2025 / 12:15 pm\nArchbishop Paul Coakley of Oklahoma City was elected to serve as the next president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) in a secret ballot on Nov. 11.\nBishops chose Bishop Daniel Flores of Brownsville, Texas, to serve as vice president. Flores, who serves in the southernmost diocese in Texas, finished second in balloting for president. Coakley subsequently won a runoff.\nCoakley, who was previously secretary of the USCCB, will serve a three-year term as president, succeeding the former president, Archbishop Timothy Broglio. The bishops held the election at the Fall Plenary Assembly in Baltimore.\nHe has a history of promoting a culture of life, opposing gender ideology, and supporting migrants.\nThe archbishop, who turned 70 years old in May, became a bishop in 2004. He has served in the Oklahoma City Archdiocese since 2011. He holds a licentiate in sacred theology.\nCoakley\u2019s defense of a culture of life is a continuation of Broglio\u2019s leadership on the subject. Under Broglio, the bishops maintained that abortion is the \u201cpreeminent priority\u201d in elections.\nIn 2022, Coakley praised Oklahoma lawmakers \u201cfor supporting pro-life measures\u201d following a law that banned nearly all abortions. He said, to build a culture of life, one must recognize \u201cthe inherent dignity of every person [and it] requires the protections afforded by pro-life legislation and a profound change of heart.\u201d\nCoakley has criticized the Oklahoma government for its support of the death penalty. In 2022, he said: \u201cThe use of the death penalty only contributes to the continued coarsening of society and to the spiral of violence.\u201d\nIn 2023, he expressed concern about the rise of gender dysphoria and the promotion of gender ideology in American society. He provided advice to parents but criticized drugs and surgeries used to facilitate a gender transition.\nCoakley has also criticized the mass deportation efforts taken by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. In February of this year, he said deportations are \u201ccreating fear and even distress for our immigrant, migrant, and refugee neighbors who have arrived in search of the same dreams that awaited many of our ancestors at a different moment in time.\u201d\nHe also said in the statement that \u201cillegal immigration is wrong, and renewed efforts should be considered to protect our nation\u2019s borders.\u201d He mentioned concerns about human and drug trafficking but said the majority of people who entered the country illegally \u201care upstanding members of our communities and churches, not violent criminals.\u201d\nFlores to serve as vice president\nFlores is former president of the USCCB Committee on Doctrine and was the only southern-border bishop in contention for the role of president.\nFlores will serve a three-year term as vice president, succeeding the former vice president, Archbishop William Lori.\nFlores, who is 64 years old, holds a doctorate in sacred theology and is a former theology professor. He has been a bishop since 2006. He was one of 12 bishops to serve on the Ordinary Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod on Synodality and is a promoter of synodality in the Church.\nIn 2017, Flores said support for mass deportations is \u201cformal cooperation with an intrinsic evil,\u201d similar to driving someone to an abortion clinic. He has expressed concern about polarization in the Church and urged \u201ccivil conversation \u2026 to seek what is good and make the priority how to achieve it and how to avoid what is evil.\u201d\n(Story continues below)"

                "body": "Japanese Yen hits fresh low since February against USD after Takaichi's comments\n|- The Japanese Yen remains depressed as Takaichi flags a looser fiscal goal, urges BoJ rate hike caution.\n- A positive development to end the US government shutdown also undermines the safe-haven JPY.\n- Dovish Fed expectations and economic concerns weigh on the USD and might cap the USD/JPY pair.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) adds to its intraday losses and drops to a fresh low since February 12 against a broadly firmer US Dollar (USD) during the Asian session on Wednesday. The latest comments from Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi underscored her preference for keeping interest rates low to support a fragile recovery. Moreover, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has been reluctant to commit to further interest rate hikes on the back of Takaichi's pro-stimulus stance. This, along with the optimism over a potential deal to end the US government shutdown, continues to undermine the safe-haven JPY.\nMeanwhile, a summary of BoJ policymakers' opinions at the October meeting released on Monday left the door open for an imminent interest rate hike in December. Adding to this, speculation that Japanese authorities may step into the market to stem any further weakness in the domestic currency might hold back the JPY bears from placing fresh bets. Moreover, dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations and concerns about an economic fallout from the US government closure might keep a lid on any meaningful appreciation for the US Dollar (USD), which might contribute to capping the USD/JPY pair.\nJapanese Yen bears retain control as Takaichi further temper December BoJ rate hike bets\n- Japan's Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, said this Wednesday that inflation driven by food prices could hurt the economy and the government will work closely with the Bank of Japan to ensure Japan sees inflation driven by wages. Takaichi hopes for the BoJ to conduct policy so that Japan sees sustainable achievement of price target.\n- Takuji Aida \u2013 an economist chosen to join Premier Sanae Takaichi's panel to debate her administration's growth strategy \u2013 told the Nikkei newspaper that the Bank of Japan should avoid raising interest rates in December. Aida added that the central bank should wait at least until January next year as Japan's economy likely contracted in the third quarter.\n- The Japanese government is expected to finalise an economic stimulus package on November 21. According to a draft outline, the package will urge the BoJ to focus on achieving strong economic growth accompanied by stable prices, underscoring Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s preference for keeping interest rates low to support a fragile recovery.\n- The US Senate voted to pass legislation to reopen the federal government and end the longest government shutdown in the nation\u2019s history. The positive development triggers a fresh wave of the global risk-on trade, which, along with the BoJ rate hike uncertainties, continues to undermine the safe-haven Japanese Yen during the Asian session on Wednesday.\n- Meanwhile, economists estimate that the prolonged US government closure might have already shaved approximately 1.5 to 2.0% off quarterly GDP growth. Moreover, investors seem tilted towards a more dovish US Federal Reserve and have been pricing in a greater chance of another rate cut in December. This, in turn, keeps the US Dollar depressed.\n- In contrast, a summary of BoJ policymakers' opinions at their October meeting released on Monday reflected a view that the time for another interest-rate hike is approaching. Adding to this, the risk of a government intervention to stem further JPY weakness warrants caution for bears, and before positioning for further upside for the USD/JPY pair.\n- In the absence of any relevant market-moving US economic releases on Wednesday, traders will look forward to speeches from a slew of influential FOMC members for cues about the Fed's future rate-cut path. This will drive the USD demand, whi"
