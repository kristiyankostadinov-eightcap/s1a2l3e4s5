Spot gold traded up 2.1% at $5,022.06 an ounce, marking a 1.2% rise for the week. U.S. gold futures for April settled at $5,046.30, up 2%.

(Reuters)\nInterest-rate futures pushed the probability of a June Fed rate cut to almost 70% after the CPI numbers landed, and the market now expects around 64 basis points of easing for the year.

Despite choppy price movements, gold is set to end this week higher.\nElsewhere, Chinese markets are closed next week for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: Silver is in one of those phases where the chart looks like a coiled spring: not a euphoric moonshot, not a full-blown collapse, but a tense, watchful consolidation. Bulls see a potential breakout brewing after a shining rally earlier in the cycle; bears are pointing to repeated rejections at important zones and warning of a heavy flush if macro winds turn against metals. Volatility is calm on the surface, but order-flow is telling you: this market is loading up for its next big move.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch deep-dive Silver price breakdowns from top YouTube traders\n- Scroll through the latest Silver stacking flex and storage hacks on Instagram\n- Binge viral TikTok clips calling the next Silver Squeeze move\nThe Story: Silver is never just a shiny metal. It is a macro barometer, an industrial workhorse, and a meme asset rolled into one. To understand the current setup, you have to zoom out from the 5-minute chart and look at the big drivers: central banks, inflation, the US dollar, and the green-energy megatrend.\nRight now, the macro script looks like this:\n- Fed & Rates: The Federal Reserve is stuck in a delicate balancing act. Inflation cooled from its peak but remains sticky in key sectors like services and housing. Powell\u2019s messaging is cautious: he does not want to cut rates too fast and re-ignite inflation, but he also knows that holding rates too high for too long risks choking growth. For Silver, this tug-of-war is everything. When the market starts to price in slower rate hikes or future cuts, real yields tend to ease and precious metals often catch a strong bid as the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets falls.\n- Inflation Narrative: Official inflation is off the highs, but anyone paying rent, buying food, or running a business knows: prices are still elevated. That persistent cost pressure keeps the inflation-hedge story alive. Gold usually grabs the headlines, but Silver \u2013 the so-called Poor Man's Gold \u2013 offers retail traders a more affordable way to express the same hedge narrative with higher beta. That higher beta cuts both ways: when inflation fears flare, Silver can stage a shining rally; when those fears fade, Silver can see a sharp cool-down.\n- US Dollar Strength: The US dollar index has been swinging between strength and fatigue, reacting to every new data point on jobs, inflation, and growth. A firm dollar tends to pressure Silver because it makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for the rest of the world. When the dollar flexes, Silver often struggles, drifting or selling off. But whenever the dollar shows cracks \u2013 softer economic data, dovish Fed tones, or rising risk appetite in emerging markets \u2013 Silver can quickly flip from defensive to explosive on the upside.\n- Geopolitics & Safe-Haven Flows: Tensions in multiple regions, energy supply risks, and election cycles in major economies keep uncertainty elevated. Gold is the classic safe haven, but Silver piggybacks on those flows. When investors rotate toward safety, Silver tends to benefit, especially when risk aversion mixes with concerns over currency debasement.\nCombine these elements and you get today\u2019s mixed but charged backdrop: Silver is not in an all-out panic nor a full-blown mania. Instead, it is in a suspenseful middle zone where every new Fed comment or macro data print can tilt the balance either way. That is exactly the kind of environment where prepared traders can find asymmetric risk-reward \u2013 and unprepared traders can get chopped to pieces.\nDeep Dive Analysis: To really unders"

Spot silver was recently quoted at about $77.3 per ounce, Kitco data showed. https://www.kitco.com/charts/silver\nThis week, the metal swung between behaving like a risk asset and acting as a safe haven, sometimes switching direction within the hour. For traders, it\u2019s all about whether Friday\u2019s inflation reprieve sticks when futures start up again Sunday evening.\nA softer U.S. inflation reading gave markets a boost. Traders in Fed funds futures, tracking expectations for the central bank\u2019s policy rate, now see almost a 70% chance for a June rate cut, according to Reuters. The contracts are factoring in about 64 basis points of easing\u2014that\u2019s 0.01 percentage point per basis point. \u201cAs long as CPI remains in check \u2026 the Fed is likely to proceed cautiously lowering rates a couple of times later this year,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. https://www.reuters.com/business/us-rate-futures-raise-odds-fed-eaasing-june-after-inflation-data-2026-02-13/\nSilver doesn\u2019t offer any yield, which is key here. If investors expect policy rates to drop, real yields usually slip and the dollar tends to lose some strength. That combination typically gives dollar-priced bullion a bit of a tailwind.\nMarkets bounced back after a sharp drop Thursday, when upbeat U.S. labor numbers dashed hopes for imminent rate cuts and set off a wave of stop-loss selling. \u201cThose stops have been triggered \u2026 causing prices to slump in a short period of time,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, in comments to Reuters. Silver ended the day down 8.9%. https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-silver-dip-dollar-rises-after-strong-us-jobs-data-2026-02-12/\nSilver stocks bounced sharply Friday. iShares Silver Trust (SLV) tacked on 2.9%. Pan American Silver jumped 6.1%, with First Majestic Silver not far behind, up 6.35%, according to historical figures from Investing.com. https://www.investing.com/etfs/ishares-silver-trust-historical-data https://www.investing.com/equities/pan-american-silver-corp-historical-data https://www.investing.com/equities/first-majestic-silver-historical-data\nStill, losses for the week lingered. According to a Reuters report carried by Dawn on Friday, spot silver was tracking roughly 2.1% lower for the week at that stage, recovering after Thursday\u2019s steep 11% plunge. https://www.dawn.com/news/1972907\nNow, traders are eyeing the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure to see if it leaves the \u201ccuts later this year\u201d narrative standing. Reuters noted in its CPI coverage that PCE inflation numbers are coming next week\u2014a release with the power to jolt rate bets. https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-prices-rise-less-than-expected-january-2026-02-13/\nWith U.S. stock markets closed Monday for Washington\u2019s Birthday/Presidents Day, traders face a thinner tape\u2014liquidity could dry up, especially for silver-linked ETFs and miners. https://www.nyse.com/trade/hours-calendars?icid=SGLPUSOENCCDSCAKJ12&lid=SGENCBLBALNTLWSGlobalForeignCurrencyAccountBALN\nStill, the rebound could be a mirage. A fresh upside jolt in growth or inflation would likely send yields climbing again, tightening financial conditions and knocking silver back down \u2014 particularly with positioning on edge after this week\u2019s stop-fueled turbulence.\nThe next hurdle isn\u2019t far off.

MCX gold closed about 1.1% higher at \u20b91,54,498 per 10 grams, while silver jumped nearly 2.6% to \u20b92,42,500 per kilogram, though both metals remain range-bound.\n- Republic Business\n- 2 min read\nGold and silver prices rebounded sharply on Friday, closing the week on a firmer note after softer-than-expected US inflation data weakened the US dollar and revived interest in precious metals.\nOn the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for April delivery settled higher by \u20b91,662, or about 1.1%, at \u20b91,54,498 per 10 grams, recovering from recent lows. Silver futures for March delivery ended the session up \u20b96,065, or nearly 2.6%, at around \u20b92,42,500 per kilogram, marking a stronger rebound compared with gold.\nCPI Data Triggers Dollar Pullback\nThe recovery followed the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which came in lower than market expectations, easing concerns over prolonged tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve. The softer inflation print led to a decline in the US dollar index, supporting demand for dollar-denominated assets such as gold and silver.\nEarlier in the week, bullion prices had come under pressure due to stronger US economic indicators and a firmer dollar, which had reduced expectations of near-term interest rate cuts. Friday\u2019s data helped reverse some of that sentiment, though traders remained cautious.\nAdvertisement\nWide Trading Ranges Persist\nDespite the rebound, precious metals continue to trade within broad ranges. MCX gold has oscillated between \u20b91,50,000 and \u20b91,58,000 per 10 grams in recent sessions, while silver has seen sharp swings in the \u20b92,35,000\u2013\u20b92,70,000 per kg band, reflecting ongoing global macroeconomic uncertainty.\nAdvertisement\nPublished By : Shourya Jha\nPublished On: 14 February 2026 at 13:49 IST"

                "body": "By Nicole Jao, Shariq Khan, Marianna Parraga and Arathy Somasekhar\nNEW YORK (Reuters) \u2013 Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf Coast refineries, making it the top foreign refiner of the OPEC country\u2019s oil since the United States captured President Nicolas Maduro in January, sources said on Friday.\nValero was among the first U.S. refiners to resume imports of Venezuelan crude after the United States struck a flagship $2 billion oil supply deal with the country\u2019s interim government and began to ease sanctions. If Valero succeeds in snapping up 10 or more cargoes next month, equivalent to around 210,000 barrels per day, it could surpass U.S. oil major Chevron as the top U.S. refiner of Venezuelan crude.\nThat would also be the most Venezuelan crude oil Valero would process since the United States first sanctioned the country\u2019s oil industry in January 2019.\nChevron, the only U.S. major producing oil in Venezuela, is expected to boost exports of Venezuelan crude to some 300,000 bpd in March, from 220,000 bpd in January, sources told Reuters last month. Chevron typically refines up to half of those exports at its own refineries, and sells the rest to other U.S. refiners.\nA large portion of Chevron\u2019s sales of Venezuelan oil to U.S. refiners typically goes to Valero. In March, Chevron is expected to supply Valero with most of the volume the refiner is planning to import, six sources said.\nValero has also negotiated some cargoes from trading houses including Trafigura, which were the first companies authorized by the U.S. government last month to join Chevron in trading Venezuelan oil.\nVitol has separately scheduled three naphtha cargoes to be delivered to Venezuela\u2019s state company PDVSA between February 22 and March 3, according to a shipping plan seen by Reuters.\nThe sources cautioned that loading schedules have not been finalized and are still subject to revision. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information.\nVitol and Trafigura declined to comment. Chevron and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA Valero spokesperson referred to comments made by executive Randy Hawkins after its fourth-quarter earnings release on January 29. In those comments, Hawkins confirmed Valero was in talks with authorized sellers of Venezuelan crude and expected it to make up a \u201cpretty large part\u201d of its heavy-crude purchases in February and March.\nValero, which has the second-largest U.S. refining network capable of processing Venezuelan heavy oil, had a long-term supply agreement to buy crude from PDVSA before U.S. sanctions.\nValero\u2019s total refining capacity for Venezuelan crude oil was around 240,000 bpd before an expansion at its 435,000-bpd refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, in 2023. The company now expects to be able to process a much larger volume of Venezuelan oil, Hawkins said.\nVenezuela Exports Ramp Up\nVenezuela\u2019s oil production and exports are expected to have a \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in the coming months, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in Caracas this week. The country\u2019s output reached 1 million bpd this month after production cuts were reversed, while exports bounced to some 800,000 bpd in January.\nOil sales from Venezuela under U.S. control have totaled $1 billion since Maduro\u2019s capture and another $5 billion is expected to go into a U.S.-controlled fund in the next months, Wright told NBC News on Thursday.\nThe United States has been issuing general licenses since January authorizing oil exports, fuel supplies to Venezuela, provision of equipment for oil and gas production, oilfield expansions and new investments.\nValero has been considering buying oil directly from PDVSA under the new authorizations, which could help expand volumes further, according to three sources.\nPDVSA, however, is so far refusing to sell to companies without individual U.S. licenses as questions remain on what is permitted and what is off-limits, source"

                "body": "The massive unconventional oil boom underway in Argentina continues to gain momentum. During late 2024, Argentina, which is South America\u2019s second largest economy after Brazil, overtook Colombia to become the continent\u2019s fourth largest oil producer. The surge in petroleum revenues, coupled with President Javier Mieli\u2019s economic reforms, is a boon for one of the world\u2019s most unstable and crisis-riven economies. There are signs of strong production growth ahead with shale oil and gas output expanding at a solid clip.\nGovernment data shows that for December 2025, Argentina pumped a record of 861,380 barrels of crude oil per day. This was 2% greater than a month earlier and an impressive 14% higher year over year. As the chart illustrates, that solid number is nearly double the 494,721 barrels per day lifted for the same period a decade ago.\nSource: Argentina Ministry of Economy.\nNatural gas production has also grown significantly over the last decade. December 2025 output of 4.6 billion cubic feet per day was 7.4% higher than a month prior and 5.7% greater than the same month a year earlier, although that number is still below recent historical highs. As the chart below shows, December 2025 natural gas output is well below the record monthly high of 5.7 billion cubic feet per day reported for July 2025.\nSource: Argentina Ministry of Economy.\nIt is rapidly growing shale oil and gas production, which is responsible for the impressive expansion of Argentina\u2019s hydrocarbon output. The successful exploitation of the 8.6-million-acre Vaca Muerta shale formation is responsible for this strong growth in hydrocarbon output, particularly with production from Argentina\u2019s higher-cost mature oil fields declining.\nThe rapid growth of unconventional hydrocarbon production in Argentina is occurring despite the naysayers asserting a lack of investment, infrastructure, and expertise is curbing production growth. Government data shows December 2025 shale oil production hit an all-time high of 593,488 barrels per day, with it making up a record 69% of all petroleum lifted. That was 0.6% greater than a month prior and 31% higher year over year, while being more than several thousand times greater than a decade earlier.\nA similar phenomenon is occurring with shale gas. For December 2025, Argentina\u2019s shale gas production of 3 billion cubic feet per day represented a 12% increase when compared to both a month and a year earlier. Although it is 18% lower than the all-time high of just under 3.8 billion cubic feet reported for July 2025. Nonetheless, December 2025 shale gas output was still responsible for 65% of Argentina\u2019s total natural gas production.\nThere are signs of significant shale gas production growth ahead, particularly with the Vaca Muerta now the engine room for Argentina\u2019s fossil fuel output. It is Argentina\u2019s national oil company, YPF, which is the leading developer and producer of hydrocarbons in the Vaca Muerta. The driller is 51% owned by Argentina\u2019s state and federal governments after it was nationalized by President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in April 2012. YPF plans to become a pure unconventional oil and gas company by the end of the decade.\nThe national oil company for December 2025 lifted 384,397 barrels per day, representing 55% of Argentina\u2019s total petroleum production for that month. Of that total petroleum output, 86%, or barrels per day, was shale oil pumped from the Vaca Muerta. YPF\u2019s natural gas output for that period was 947,191 million cubic feet per day, which represents 20% of Argentina\u2019s total production of the fossil fuel for December 2025. Shale gas comprised 80% of YPF\u2019s total natural gas production for the period, underscoring how the company is rapidly moving to a pure play shale oil and gas driller.\nYPF expects production to grow at a solid clip. Not only is the development of the company\u2019s Vaca Muerta acreage at an early stage of development but the integrated energy major plans to spend nearly $36 billion be"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in full drama mode: German blue chips are hovering in a tense zone, with price action flipping between cautious optimism and sudden risk-off waves. No confirmed fresh data timestamp means we stay in SAFE MODE: no exact price points, only the big picture. But that big picture is loud: German bulls are trying to hold a critical area while macro headwinds keep hammering at the door.\nRight now, the index is showing a choppy, nervous structure \u2013 not a clear, smooth uptrend, not a brutal collapse, but a volatile sideways range where every ECB headline, every energy-price spike and every German PMI print can flip the intraday narrative in minutes. Day traders love it, longer-term investors are sweating.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch deep-dive YouTube breakdowns of the latest DAX setups\n- Scroll fresh Instagram vibes on German stock market momentum\n- Swipe through viral TikTok strategies on DAX trading moves\nThe Story: The real driver of the DAX 40 right now is not just earnings or single-stock hype \u2013 it is policy and macro. The European Central Bank under Christine Lagarde is stuck in a classic trader\u2019s nightmare: bad choices only.\nInflation has cooled from the wild peaks, but it is still not comfortably dead. Growth data from Germany \u2013 especially manufacturing and industrial production \u2013 looks weak, recessionary and fragile. So the ECB is trapped between two pain trades:\n- If they stay too tight for too long, they crush already weak growth, hit corporate earnings and keep pressure on cyclical sectors like autos, banks and industrials.\n- If they cut too aggressively, they risk a renewed inflation spike and a weaker euro, importing more price pressure via commodities and energy.\nThe DAX 40 sits exactly at this crossroads. Every ECB press conference, every Lagarde statement, every line about \"data-dependent\" policy moves the German benchmark. Traders are laser-focused on the path of future rate cuts, not just the current level.\nWhy the Euro / USD pair matters so much for the DAX:\nFor an export-heavy market like Germany, the euro-dollar exchange rate is basically another chart you must watch if you are trading the DAX:\n- A weaker euro against the US dollar tends to help German exporters: cars, machinery, chemicals, industrial equipment. Their products become cheaper in global markets, boosting revenue when converted back into euros.\n- A stronger euro can squeeze margins, especially when global demand is not booming. It acts like a mini-headwind on earnings outlooks.\nSo, when the ECB hints at staying \"higher for longer\" with rates, that can support the euro \u2013 but potentially hurt growth-sensitive DAX names. When they open the door to faster cuts, the euro can slide, helping exporters but signaling they are worried about the economy. The DAX is constantly repricing this tug-of-war.\nAt the same time, US markets and the Federal Reserve add another layer. If the Fed is slower to cut than the ECB, the dollar can stay strong, again feeding into that euro/dollar dynamic. This is why the DAX 40 often reacts violently not only to Frankfurt headlines, but also to Powell, US CPI, and NFP prints.\nSector Check: Old Economy Pain vs. New Economy Hope\nThe DAX is not just one index, it is a battlefield between structurally challenged cyclical sectors and scalable, tech-driven winners.\n1.

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Stuck at 1.36 as Fed Cut Hopes Clash With UK Weakness\nCable defends 1.3600 support with 1.35\u20131.37 the key zone after softer US CPI at 2.4% lifts rate-cut bets, even as sluggish UK growth and 3.1% inflation cap sterling upside | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD \u2013 Sideways near 1.36 as dollar support and UK stagnation cap upside\nGBP/USD \u2013 Current price zone, channel structure and key bands\nGBP/USD is trading around 1.3620, almost unchanged on the day and only about 0.12% higher on the week after fading from highs above 1.3700. Price sits right on the lower edge of a rising channel drawn from the November\u2013January advance, with a tight support band at 1.3620\u20131.3600. Below that, the next layers are 1.3570\u20131.3585 from recent intraday pivots, 1.3540 as the 38.2% retracement of the prior leg higher, and the heavier 1.3500\u20131.3510 base where the late-January low around 1.3507 aligns with the 55-day EMA near 1.3509. On the upside, 1.3650 is the first meaningful break level, followed by 1.3700, the 1.3710\u20131.3725 band, and then 1.3732\u20131.3733 where recent swing highs converge. Above 1.3732, the path re-opens toward 1.3867 and, on a larger horizon, toward the 1.4248\u20131.4284 resistance area tied to the 2021 peak and the long-term 38.2% retracement from 2.1161 to 1.0351. As long as GBP/USD holds above 1.3008, the broad move from 1.0351 is still treated as an ongoing bullish phase rather than a completed rebound.\nGBP/USD \u2013 US CPI at 2.4%, yield reaction and what it means for the dollar leg\nThe latest US inflation numbers were just soft enough to shift rate expectations but not weak enough to break the dollar. Headline CPI slowed from 2.7% to 2.4% year-on-year, below the 2.5% consensus, while core CPI eased from 2.6% to 2.5%. That combination drove US 2-year yields down toward roughly 3.40% and 10-year yields toward 4.05%, as markets moved to price a higher probability of a first Fed cut around June. At the same time, the USD has not sold off aggressively: the dollar index is still trading close to recent highs because the market assumes Jerome Powell will stress independence and avoid signalling a rapid easing cycle. For GBP/USD, that means lower yields remove some support for the dollar but do not generate a free-fall. The pair gets enough room to hold above the 1.3600 floor, yet struggles to build a clean rally through 1.37\u20131.38 without a much clearer dovish pivot from the Fed.\nGBP/USD \u2013 UK macro mix: 3.1% inflation, 0.5% growth and a BoE trapped in an awkward corner\nOn the UK side, the macro profile remains weak. Inflation is still around 3.1%, clearly above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, while 2025 GDP growth came in near 0.5%, signalling a flat economy running on high rates. That forces the BoE to keep policy tight longer than ideal, even though domestic demand is fragile. Compared with the US \u2013 which just reported a 215,000 increase in January non-farm payrolls on top of earlier resilient data \u2013 the UK offers weaker growth with still-sticky prices. That mix does not justify a major re-rating of the pound. As long as the BoE is constrained between slow growth and persistent inflation, GBP/USD rallies tend to stall in the mid-1.37s unless the Fed softens much faster than expected or UK data show a clear upside surprise in activity or disinflation.\nGBP/USD \u2013 Momentum, RSI and why price looks more like a range than a trend\nMomentum indicators confirm the range narrative. On the daily chart, GBP/USD is still moving inside an ascending channel, but price is hugging the lower boundary rather than pushing toward the top. The 14-day RSI has cooled back to roughly 51 after earlier overbought readings, signalling neutral momentum rather than a directional impulse. Daily stochastics are slipping and a bearish Tension Indicator points to weakening price action, yet intraday measures are already rebounding from oversold levels around 1.3600. That mix \u2013 neutral RSI, soft but stabilising intraday momentum and a well-defined stru"

Derivatives markets now price roughly 60\u201361 bps of Fed easing by year-end, versus about 58 bps before the release, and see around a 65% probability that the first cut arrives between June and July. Near-term odds for a March move remain low, near 10%, but the direction of travel for expectations is clear: the Fed is still on track to ease in 2026, not to tighten again.\nFed versus ECB: structural pressure points favor EUR/USD on medium-term horizons\nRate path assumptions now work against the dollar on a structural basis. The Fed is expected to cut policy rates by around 50\u201360 bps in 2026. At the same time, the European Central Bank is widely seen leaving rates unchanged, while the Bank of Japan is expected to add another 25 bps of tightening. That mix implies narrowing rate differentials versus both Europe and Japan.\nFor EUR/USD this is important. If the Fed is the only major central bank easing, while the ECB is effectively on hold, the interest-rate spread that supported the dollar over the past cycle erodes. That supports a higher euro over the medium term, even if the pair is currently locked in a tight range. The ECB is already signaling discomfort with excessive euro strength: officials like Martins Kazaks are \u201cin monitoring mode\u201d on the currency and warn that a \u201csizeable and pacey\u201d appreciation could pull inflation under target. That acts as a soft cap on aggressive EUR/USD upside, but it does not change the basic fact that policy divergence now tilts against the dollar, not in its favor.\nEUR/USD \u2013 compression around 1.1850 shows a market waiting for a breakout trigger\nTechnically, EUR/USD has compressed around 1.1850, which is behaving like a short-term magnet.

In that scenario, dollar resilience would likely show up across the board, not only against the euro.

                "body": "USD/JPY plunged 2.9% to close the week ending February 13 at 152.629. Intervention warnings, optimism about Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s adoption of prudent fiscal policies, a more hawkish BoJ, and softer US inflation sent the pair sharply lower.\nThis week\u2019s reversal was the largest since November 2024, and since the yen carry trade unwind in mid-2024, supporting the bearish short- to medium-term outlook.\nBelow, I examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nThis month, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi won a landslide election, giving the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Japan Innovation Party (JIP) a supermajority in the Lower House.\nThe coalition\u2019s supermajority removed the need for smaller parties to form a government, delivering political stability. Furthermore, Prime Minister Takaichi no longer needs to make concessions to lesser parties to pursue her fiscal policy goals. This has eased jitters that excessive fiscal spending would balloon Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio.\nNotably, 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields have pulled back from January\u2019s multi-decade high of 2.382%, as risk premiums for holding JGBs eased. Improved sentiment fueled demand for the yen.\nAhead of the election, we suggested a potential shift in sentiment toward Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal policies in the event of a landslide victory, supporting a bearish outlook for USD/JPY.\nAs the dust settles from the election, the market focus turns to crucial Japanese economic indicators and the BoJ\u2019s policy stance.\nOn Monday, February 16, preliminary Q4 GDP numbers will influence sentiment toward a spring BoJ rate hike and yen demand. Economists forecast the Japanese economy will expand by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in Q4 after contracting by 0.6% in Q3.\nAn economic recovery would raise bets on an April BoJ rate hike, fueling buying interest in the yen. A stronger yen would send USD/JPY lower.\nHowever, traders should also consider trends in private consumption and external demand. The BoJ continues to monitor the effect of US tariffs on external demand, while private consumption fuels demand-driven inflation. Stronger-than-expected external demand and private consumption would further boost spring rate hike bets.\nImportantly, forecasts align with the BoJ\u2019s hawkish quarterly projections, which contributed to the USD/JPY pair\u2019s drop below 153.\nMeanwhile, Japanese trade data will require consideration on Wednesday, February 18. Economists expect exports to surge 12% year-on-year in January, up sharply from 5.1% in December. Strong external demand would signal a pickup in economic momentum and potentially boost corporate profits.

                "body": "Bank of Japan Rate Hike to 1% in April 2026 Could Crash Bitcoin Price\nThe global crypto market is back under pressure as expectations grow that the Bank of Japan could raise interest rates to 1% in April 2026. Bank of America warns that tighter policy in Japan may reduce global liquidity and trigger another sharp Bitcoin sell-off, similar to the 3% drop seen after January\u2019s hike.\nBank of Japan Rate Hike to 1% in April 2026\nAccording to Bank of America Global Research, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to increase interest rates by 25 basis points, which could push the interest rate to 1% in April 2026.\nThe Bank of Japan is expected to implement a 25 basis point interest rate increase, which will bring interest rates to 1% in April 2026, according to Bank of America Global Research\nThis would mean that interest rates in Japan would reach their highest interest rate level since the 1990s because Japan maintained its interest rates close to zero for an extended period.\nsymbiote@cryptosymbiioteF\u00e9vr 13, 2026\ud83d\udea8BREAKING:\nBANK OF JAPAN IS EXPECTED TO HIKE RATES TO 1% IN APRIL, ACCORDING TO BANK OF AMERICA\nTHIS WILL DUMP MARKET HARD\nHERE IS WHY:\nJapan didn't have 1.00% since 1990s and last time it was in that zone world was already getting hit\nMost ppl think of Japan as a slow\u2026 pic.twitter.com/4amkNt0x4S\nJapan has always been the primary force behind the yen carry trade because it maintains interest rates between zero and near-zero for multiple years now.\nThe Bank of Japan already raised rates to 0.75% in January 2026, as rising inflation, stronger wage growth, and pressure on the weak yen continue to push policymakers toward further tightening.\nWhy Japan\u2019s Monetary Policy Matters for Bitcoin Price\nJapan holds the title of the largest creditor nation worldwide because it possesses approximately $1.2 trillion worth of U.S. Treasuries. Japanese banks and institutions also invest heavily in global bonds, stocks, and other risk assets, making Japan a key source of global liquidity.\nIf the Bank of Japan proceeds with another rate hike in April 2026, analysts warn that risk appetite could weaken further. A stronger yen and falling USD/JPY would signal reduced global leverage, which often pressures Bitcoin and altcoins.\nCurrent predictions on the Polymarket prediction platform show 81% likelihood that no rate hikes will occur in March, suggesting the next move could depend on future economic data.\nBitcoin Price After BOJ Rate Hike\nLooking at the earlier BOJ rate hike data shows strong sensitivity to Japan\u2019s interest rate changes. The Bitcoin price after BOJ rate hike in January 2026 reflected this clearly, as Bitcoin fell nearly 3% shortly after the Bank of Japan raised rates to 0.75%. This showed how quickly crypto markets react when global liquidity conditions change.\nWhen interest rates increase, borrowing becomes more expensive, which reduces the flow of capital into risk assets like Bitcoin.\nIf the Bank of Japan raises rates again toward 1%, analysts warn Bitcoin could face more downside pressure. Some estimates suggest a possible 4% to 5% decline, which may push the Bitcoin price closer to the $60,000 level.\nFAQs\nWhy does a Bank of Japan rate hike impact global crypto markets?Japan is a major source of global liquidity due to its large holdings of foreign assets. When the BOJ raises rates, it strengthens the yen and unwinds yen carry trades, reducing the flow of capital into risk assets like Bitcoin and causing market pressure.\nHow does Japan\u2019s interest rate policy affect the yen carry trade?Japan has kept rates near zero for years, making it the primary source of the yen carry trade. When the BOJ hikes rates, the yen strengthens, making these trades more expensive to maintain and forcing investors to sell off risk assets like crypto.\nWhat is the current likelihood of a Bank of Japan rate hike in March?Current predictions on Polymarket show an 81% likelihood that no rate hikes will occur in March. This suggests the central bank is wait"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - EUR Steadies Near 1.1870 as Softer 2.4% CPI Knocks the Dollar Index\nUS inflation undershoots at 2.4%, DXY eases toward 96.9 and rate-cut bets for 2026 grow, leaving EUR/USD supported as the ECB holds firm and the BOJ signals further tightening | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD \u2013 CPI relief keeps the pair pinned near 1.1870 as policy gap with the Fed widens\nUS inflation cools to 2.4% and takes the edge off the dollar rally\nJanuary US CPI rose 0.2% month-on-month and 2.4% year-on-year, below the 2.5% forecast and down from 2.7%. Core CPI increased 0.3% on the month, with the annual core rate easing to 2.5% from 2.6%. That combination signals disinflation is still advancing, even if underlying price pressure is not collapsing.\nThe dollar index slipped about 0.01% on the session and pulled back from an intraday high near 97.15, giving up earlier gains as Treasury yields fell and rate-cut bets firmed. Derivatives markets now price roughly 60\u201361 bps of Fed easing by year-end, versus about 58 bps before the release, and see around a 65% probability that the first cut arrives between June and July. Near-term odds for a March move remain low, near 10%, but the direction of travel for expectations is clear: the Fed is still on track to ease in 2026, not to tighten again.\nFed versus ECB: structural pressure points favor EUR/USD on medium-term horizons\nRate path assumptions now work against the dollar on a structural basis. The Fed is expected to cut policy rates by around 50\u201360 bps in 2026. At the same time, the European Central Bank is widely seen leaving rates unchanged, while the Bank of Japan is expected to add another 25 bps of tightening. That mix implies narrowing rate differentials versus both Europe and Japan.\nFor EUR/USD this is important. If the Fed is the only major central bank easing, while the ECB is effectively on hold, the interest-rate spread that supported the dollar over the past cycle erodes. That supports a higher euro over the medium term, even if the pair is currently locked in a tight range. The ECB is already signaling discomfort with excessive euro strength: officials like Martins Kazaks are \u201cin monitoring mode\u201d on the currency and warn that a \u201csizeable and pacey\u201d appreciation could pull inflation under target. That acts as a soft cap on aggressive EUR/USD upside, but it does not change the basic fact that policy divergence now tilts against the dollar, not in its favor.\nEUR/USD \u2013 compression around 1.1850 shows a market waiting for a breakout trigger\nTechnically, EUR/USD has compressed around 1.1850, which is behaving like a short-term magnet. The 1.18 area below is reinforced by the 50-day EMA, creating a layered support zone. As long as the pair holds above that band, the price action looks like consolidation after an upside break rather than a failed move.\nA clear daily close below the 50-day EMA and 1.18 would argue that dollar strength is back in charge and open room for a deeper retrace. In that scenario, dollar resilience would likely show up across the board, not only against the euro. Conversely, a sustained push above the recent highs near the 1.19 handle would confirm that the pair is building a new, higher range in line with the Fed\u2013ECB divergence story.\nRead More\n-\nIVV ETF Price Forecast: Is $684 Still Worth Paying For S&P 500 Exposure?\n14.02.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETF Rally: XRPI at $8.09 and XRPR at $11.60 as XRP-USD Rebounds Toward $1.47\n14.02.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Futures Price Holds Around $3.20 as Storage Tightens and Winter Premium Fades\n14.02.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast: Yen Strength Turns 152 into a Make-or-Break Level\n14.02.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nUSD/JPY \u2013 yen resilience tests the upper bound of the dollar cycle\nUSD/JPY remains the purest expression of how far the dollar can stretch when domestic rates are expected to fall while foreign yields rise.

So the FTSE 100 forecast is in focus for this week\u2019s weekend indices outlook. We have plenty of UK, European and US earnings to look forward to as the week progresses, while key data from the UK and US will make rate cut expectations a key talking point on both sides of the pond.\nThe week that was\nIt was a pretty choppy week for the major indices last week, with US tech weakness being the highlight but overall nothing too significant to report with major indices holding key support levels. A strong US jobs report was followed by US inflation data coming in weaker than expected at 2.4% year-on-year, falling relatively sharply from the previous month\u2019s 2.7% reading.\nThat soft inflation print has pushed markets to start pricing in more aggressive Fed easing, again, with traders seeing around a 30% chance of a rate cut by April, and more than an 80% chance of easing by June.\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 100 continued to trade near record highs as expectations for Bank of England rate cuts increased thanks to some further signs of weakness in the UK economy, while the resulting weakness in the pound also helped the cause. The UK economy certainly ended 2025 on a fairly weak note. Construction and business investment were particularly soft, which highlights ongoing growth concerns. However, this wasn\u2019t really new information for the Bank of England. Policymakers already knew the economy was slowing, which explains why the pound didn\u2019t sell off aggressively after the data. That said, the pound remains fundamentally fragile, especially against commodity dollars like the Aussie or kiwi.\nFTSE 100 forecast: Looking ahead to the new week\nLooking ahead, we\u2019ve got plenty of market-moving data coming up. In the UK, we get wages data on Tuesday and CPI on Wednesday \u2013 both crucial for shaping expectations around future BoE rate cuts, putting the FTSE 100 forecast into focus. Among other data highlights, we\u2019ll see global PMIs, followed by US GDP and core PCE inflation, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, all on Friday.\nTop 10 Company Earnings This Week\nThe results of UK companies will undoubtedly impact the FTSE 100 forecast in the week ahead. But it is not just UK companies reporting. Looking at the broader market, we have some interesting earnings coming up from other major markets too.\nHere\u2019s the top 10 list of U.S. & European companies reporting earnings in the week ahead:\nTuesday, Feb 10\n1. BP\n2. AstraZeneca\n3. Barclays\n4. S&P Global\n5. The Coca-Cola Company\n6. Robinhood Markets\nWednesday, Feb 11\n7. Cisco Systems\n8. McDonald\u2019s\nThursday, Feb 12\n9. Unilever\n10. Anheuser-Busch InBev\nWhat are the key data highlights this week?\nMonday, Feb 9\n- Japan GDP\n- Eurozone industrial production\nTuesday, Feb 10\n- UK Jobless claims, average earnings index and employment data\n- German ZEW Economic Sentiment\n- Canadian CPI\n- US Empire State Manufacturing Index\nWednesday, Feb 11\n- RBNZ interest rate decision - no change expected\n- UK CPI - expected to ease to 3.0% from 3.4%\n- US durable goods orders, housing starts, building permits and FOMC minutes\nThursday, Feb 12\n- Australia employment data\n- US Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Manufacturing Index and Pending Home Sales\nFriday, Feb 13\n- Global PMIs\n- UK retail sales\n- Canada retail sales\n- US Advance GDP, Core PCE Price Index and New Home Sales\nFTSE 100 Key levels\nAggressive recent dip buying means we don\u2019t have to look too far below to identify key short term levels, unless an unexpected stimulus drives markets sharply lower. Among support levels to watch, 10,400 is important, below which 10,375 comes into focus next, followed by 10,300 and 10,280. Resistance is in short supply, with the exception of 10,480ish - above which is the all time high at 10,545.\nWhat about the pound?\nEverything you need to "

While stronger rebound cannot be ruled out, upside should be limited by 55 D EMA (now at 1.3752) to complete the pattern.

Deeper fall could be seen as the pattern extends, to 61.8% retracement of 1.2005 to 1.4791 at 1.3069. For now, medium term outlook will be neutral at best, until there are signs that the correction has completed, or that a bearish trend reversal is confirmed.\nIn the long term picture, rising 55 M EMA (now at 1.3569) remains intact. Thus, up trend from 0.9056 (2007 low) should still be in progress. However, considering bearish divergence condition M MACD, sustained trading below 55 M EMA will argue that the up trend has completed with five waves up to 1.4791, and turn medium term outlook bearish for correction to 38.2% retracement of 0.9056 to 1.4791 at 1.2600."

                "body": "USD/JPY plunged 2.9% to close the week ending February 13 at 152.629. Intervention warnings, optimism about Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s adoption of prudent fiscal policies, a more hawkish BoJ, and softer US inflation sent the pair sharply lower.\nThis week\u2019s reversal was the largest since November 2024, and since the yen carry trade unwind in mid-2024, supporting the bearish short- to medium-term outlook.\nBelow, I examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nThis month, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi won a landslide election, giving the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Japan Innovation Party (JIP) a supermajority in the Lower House.\nThe coalition\u2019s supermajority removed the need for smaller parties to form a government, delivering political stability. Furthermore, Prime Minister Takaichi no longer needs to make concessions to lesser parties to pursue her fiscal policy goals. This has eased jitters that excessive fiscal spending would balloon Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio.\nNotably, 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields have pulled back from January\u2019s multi-decade high of 2.382%, as risk premiums for holding JGBs eased. Improved sentiment fueled demand for the yen.\nAhead of the election, we suggested a potential shift in sentiment toward Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal policies in the event of a landslide victory, supporting a bearish outlook for USD/JPY.\nAs the dust settles from the election, the market focus turns to crucial Japanese economic indicators and the BoJ\u2019s policy stance.\nOn Monday, February 16, preliminary Q4 GDP numbers will influence sentiment toward a spring BoJ rate hike and yen demand. Economists forecast the Japanese economy will expand by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in Q4 after contracting by 0.6% in Q3.\nAn economic recovery would raise bets on an April BoJ rate hike, fueling buying interest in the yen. A stronger yen would send USD/JPY lower.\nHowever, traders should also consider trends in private consumption and external demand. The BoJ continues to monitor the effect of US tariffs on external demand, while private consumption fuels demand-driven inflation. Stronger-than-expected external demand and private consumption would further boost spring rate hike bets.\nImportantly, forecasts align with the BoJ\u2019s hawkish quarterly projections, which contributed to the USD/JPY pair\u2019s drop below 153.\nMeanwhile, Japanese trade data will require consideration on Wednesday, February 18. Economists expect exports to surge 12% year-on-year in January, up sharply from 5.1% in December. Strong external demand would signal a pickup in economic momentum and potentially boost corporate profits. Rising profits may enable firms to raise wages, fueling consumer spending and demand-driven inflation.\nOn Friday, February 20, national inflation figures will wrap up a busy week. Economists forecast headline inflation to drop from 2.1% in December to 1.9% in January, below the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. However, the so-called core-core inflation rate is expected to ease from 2.9% to 2.8% in January, holding well above the target. A modest drop in core-core inflation would continue supporting the hawkish BoJ policy stance, strengthening the yen.\nIn summary, upbeat data would affirm the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nWhile the Japanese data will influence buying interest in the yen, US economic indicators and Fed chatter will dictate demand for the US dollar.\nOn Wednesday, February 18, the FOMC Minutes will come under market scrutiny.

                "body": "The FX markets continue to dislike the dollar owing to concerns over the health of US labour market and an overall positive backdrop for risk appetite. On the case of the latter, well this has been evident with global equity markets remaining near record levels, which has seen the commodity currencies and the more cyclical currencies outperform. Meanwhile the ongoing weakness in US labour market was highlighted once again by all major data releases last week, which means expectations are running low ahead of the publication of US nonfarm payrolls report later today, on which the near-term USD/JPY forecast will rely on.\nDollar remains on the back foot ahead of NFP\nWith demand for the dollar fading, this is keeping appetite strong for precious metals, and we have seen gold climb to near $5100 area. Pro-cyclical currencies like the Canadian and New Zealand dollars were racing ahead, too, as uncertainty around the future path of Fed policy is also weighing on sentiment towards the dollar.\nYesterday\u2019s release of US retail sales data didn\u2019t help the dollar whatsoever given that both the headline and core retail sales measures missed expectations with prints of zero, respectively.\nDespite the retail sales miss and a cooling labour market, other US macroeconomic indicators have been suggesting that growth is still holding up reasonably well. Still, markets are fully convinced that around two rate cuts are on the way. This should point to a softer dollar, although not a full-blown collapse given that US equity markets remain quite strong.\nWhat to expect from the jobs report\nThe delayed NFP report is expected to show that 66,000 jobs were created last month, up from 50,000 in December. But could we see a miss, given the weak pre-NFP leading indicators we got last week? It is worth pointing out that some disappointment is already priced in, so don\u2019t be shocked by the dollar\u2019s reaction if it doesn\u2019t fall as much as you\u2019d normally expect on the back of a potentially softer number. By the same token, a small beat could amplify its potential upside reaction too, boosting the USD/JPY forecast. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is seen unchanged at 4.4% while average hourly earnings are seen climbing by another 0.3% month-on-month.\nUSD/JPY forecast: Yen shows relative strength for a change\nOne FX pair that is starting to look interesting again is the USD/JPY, which has drifted lower with the yen finding support on the back of the newly empowered LDP government in Japan.\nThe USD/JPY has already fallen for three days in a row, in what still arguably is a bullish trend. Therefore, we could see some dip-buying, particularly if the jobs report isn\u2019t too disappointing. Still we could see key resistance levels hold, so long as the jobs report is not super strong. Among resistance levels to watch, 154.50-155.00 now marks a pivotal zone. Break that and 155.50/5 would become the next obvious upside objective. On the downside, 153.00 is a short-term support level, but the trend line near 152.00 is a far more interesting level for the bulls to defend. Lose that and then 150.00 will come into focus next.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R"

                "body": "What Has Trump Media Filed With the SEC?\nTrump Media & Technology Group has submitted paperwork to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for two new cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded funds, according to a company announcement. The filings were made through its Truth Social Funds arm and include the proposed Truth Social Bitcoin and Ether ETF as well as the Truth Social Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF.\nThe registration has not yet taken effect and remains subject to regulatory review. If approved, the products would give investors exposure to Bitcoin and Ether \u2014 the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization \u2014 along with a separate fund tied to Cronos, the native token of Crypto.com\u2019s blockchain.\n\u201cWe plan to provide an investment platform for investors covering multiple aspects of digital and crypto investing with both capital appreciation and income opportunities,\u201d Steve Neamtz, president of Yorkville America Equities, which is expected to serve as investment adviser to the funds, said in the announcement.\nInvestor Takeaway\nHow Would the Proposed ETFs Be Structured?\nThe Bitcoin and Ether ETF would track the combined performance of BTC and ETH while also capturing staking rewards generated by Ether holdings. The Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF would follow CRO\u2019s price performance and include staking income tied to the Cronos blockchain.\nTrump Media is working in partnership with Crypto.com on the proposed products. The exchange is expected to provide custody, liquidity and staking services if regulators approve the ETFs. Investors would access the funds through Crypto.com\u2019s broker-dealer affiliate, Foris Capital US LLC.\nEach ETF is expected to carry a management fee of 0.95%, placing the products at the higher end of the current fee spectrum for spot crypto ETFs in the US.\nHow Does This Fit Into Trump Media\u2019s Broader Crypto Push?\nThe ETF filings extend Trump Media\u2019s expanding involvement in digital assets. In April last year, the company announced a partnership with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to launch a series of \u201cMade in America\u201d ETFs blending digital assets with traditional securities, including exposure to sectors such as energy.\nIn September, Trump Media also reached an agreement with Crypto.com to establish a joint treasury entity focused on accumulating CRO tokens. The arrangement began with an initial acquisition of roughly 684.4 million CRO, valued at about $105 million at the time, funded through a mix of stock and cash.\nThe new ETF proposals suggest a continued effort to build a branded crypto investment suite rather than a single product offering. By incorporating staking income into two of the proposed funds, the structure goes beyond passive price tracking and enters the yield-focused segment of digital asset investing.\nInvestor Takeaway\nWhat Is Happening in the Broader Bitcoin ETF Market?\nThe filings arrive as spot Bitcoin ETFs face sustained outflows. According to data from SoSoValue, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded four consecutive weeks of net withdrawals, with the most recent weekly total showing $360 million in outflows.\nFlow data across late January and early February shows volatile but net-negative activity. Notable daily withdrawals included $817.87 million on Jan. 29, $509.70 million on Jan. 30 and $544.94 million on Feb. 4. Positive sessions were smaller in comparison, including inflows of $561.89 million on Feb. 2, $371.15 million on Feb. 6, $166.56 million on Feb. 10, $145.00 million on Feb. 9 and $15.20 million on the most recent Friday.\nThe cooling in ETF demand comes amid broader uncertainty in crypto markets, with investors reassessing exposure after a strong run earlier in the cycle. Any new entrant into the ETF landscape will need to contend not only with regulatory approval but also with a more selective flow environment.\nWhat Comes Next?\nThe proposed Truth Social ETFs remain subject to SEC review, and there is no guarantee of approval. If cleared, the products would j"

                "body": "Truth Social files for Bitcoin ETF \u2013 Risky gamble or a game-changer?\nThe biggest takeaway from the 2025 cycle? Risk assets are officially no longer following the usual post-halving playbook. With a 7.85% yearly close, the TOTAL crypto market cap didn\u2019t ride the 2024 halving rally.\nBasically, the 2024 halving cut Bitcoin [BTC] rewards, slashing the amount of new BTC entering the market. Historically, that kind of scarcity sparks a post-halving pump, but this time, the market didn\u2019t follow the textbook.\nSo, what changed? Investors realized that Bitcoin ETFs can cut both ways. During the Q4 2025 rally, BTC ETFs dumped roughly $4 billion in a single quarter, just as the market turned risk-off, making Bitcoin\u2019s dip even worse.\nNotably, that same dynamic is playing out in 2026.\nSo far, Bitcoin ETFs have posted two consecutive months of outflows, totaling nearly $2.3 billion. That aligns with BTC\u2019s 21.3% drop and is already shaping up to be the worst Q1 performance since the 2018 cycle.\nUnsurprisingly, this momentum has spilled over to ETF firms as well. For instance, BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) is down 21.5%, adding to last year\u2019s 6.4% loss. As a result, HODLers are now significantly underwater.\nAgainst this backdrop, U.S President Donald Trump\u2019s media platform, Truth Social, is stirring the market again. The big question now \u2013 Can his ETF push actually reverse the trend, or could it end up adding risks that make post-halving pumps even harder to come by?\nBitcoin faces ETF headwinds despite Trump\u2019s crypto filing\nLately, any move by the President makes timing even more important.\nIn this context, President Trump\u2019s media platform, Truth Social, has filed with the SEC for two crypto ETFs. One targets Cronos [CRO], while the other, Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH], along with Ethereum staking.\nNotably, the market reacted fast. Bitcoin jumped by 4%, still shy of the $70k-mark, while ETH rallied harder, up 5.2% \u2013 Breaking the $2k psychological resistance, though it\u2019s still a long way from its previous highs.\nEven so, big ETF players are feeling the heat. BlackRock\u2019s ETH ETF (ETHA) saw $9.3 million in outflows, marking the seventh straight day of redemptions, with ETHA shares now 30% underwater so far in 2026.\nAll in all, one thing is clear \u2013 Bitcoin ETFs have become a major signal of market sentiment. Despite the big headlines, the price reaction has been relatively muted, evidence that investors are staying cautious.\nIn this environment, it\u2019s hard to see President Trump\u2019s ETF endorsement turning the trend around. Instead, with ongoing outflows, the risk of more pressure on prices and a slowdown in post-halving rallies is only growing.\nFinal Summary\n- Ongoing outflows have amplified dips, with Bitcoin down 21.3% and some ETFs like BlackRock\u2019s IBIT and ETHA deeply underwater.\n- Despite the SEC filings, investor caution and persistent outflows suggest post-halving rallies may be still at risk."

The move represents roughly 0.65% of the fund\u2019s $369.14 million in assets under management, a meaningful single-day allocation shift for a geared product.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading at $69,566.01, down about 30.95% over the past three months as crypto volatility has reasserted itself after 2025\u2019s rally. Short-term momentum remains fragile, with the one-day technical signal flashing Sell, underscoring that BITU buyers are leaning into weakness rather than following a confirmed rebound.\nThe contrast between bearish technicals in spot Bitcoin and fresh inflows into a leveraged long ETF highlights growing risk appetite among speculative traders, who may be positioning for a sharp reversal or short-covering rally. Yet with Bitcoin still digesting a steep drawdown, BITU holders face amplified directionality, and any further downside in BTC-USD could translate into outsized losses for late entrants chasing the bounce.\nFor a more detailed analysis and real-time sentiment trends, check the live cryptocurrency prices here."

This movement indicates a significant acceleration in the adoption of the asset, especially among DeFi participants and cryptocurrency traders seeking regulated digital dollars.\nLaunched in late 2024 as a digital asset backed by fiat currency and structured under regulatory standards, RLUSD was designed to serve institutions, developers, and retail investors. In approximately 14 months, the volume issued on Ethereum grew almost tenfold compared to the previous year, reflecting greater integration with liquidity protocols, lending, and decentralized trading.\nCurrently, Ethereum holds approximately 77% of the total RLUSD supply, while the XRP Ledger accounts for the remaining portion. Ripple's strategy combines the reach of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem with the efficiency of XRPL, focused on fast settlements and reduced costs. This operational division expands the use of the stablecoin in both institutional applications and exchange-to-exchange transactions.\nIn addition to the increased supply, RLUSD's market capitalization has already surpassed US$1,5 billion. This growth is supported by listings on major trading platforms, support for direct deposits, and a greater presence in spot pairs. The recent integration with Binance, including trading on the Ethereum network, has broadened the asset's global visibility and increased trading volume.\nRipple has also begun expanding RLUSD to Ethereum's second-layer solutions, such as Base and Optimism. This initiative aims to reduce operational costs and improve liquidity across different networks, making the stablecoin more competitive in arbitrage operations, decentralized credit, and corporate cash management.\nIn the institutional field, the company is aiming to gain ground in the face of Tether and Circle's dominance. The use of traditional infrastructure, such as Hidden Road and Fedwire, has been incorporated into the strategy to improve access and efficiency in settling dollar-backed transactions. This integration brings the traditional financial market closer to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, creating an operational bridge between banks, exchanges, and DeFi protocols.\nThe rise of RLUSD on Ethereum reinforces the trend of expansion for regulated stablecoins. With greater legal clarity in different jurisdictions, the appetite for digital assets pegged to the dollar is growing, especially among institutions that prioritize transparency and compliance."

Sign up now!\nVibe Check: Ethereum is in a high-volatility zone right now. Price action has been wild, with aggressive swings, fakeouts around key zones, and brutal liquidations on both sides. Trend-wise, ETH is battling to prove it is still the king of smart contracts while the market debates whether this is a consolidation before a huge breakout or just the calm before another nasty flush. No guarantees, no comfort \u2013 just pure crypto chaos.\nWant to see what people are saying? Here are the real opinions:\n- Watch brutal honest Ethereum price predictions on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest Ethereum hype and FUD drops on Instagram\n- See viral Ethereum trading plays and wins on TikTok\nThe Narrative: Ethereum\u2019s story right now is a tug-of-war between tech, economics, and raw emotion.\nOn the tech side, Ethereum is no longer just a single chain \u2013 it is a whole ecosystem of Layer-2s (L2s) stacked on top of Mainnet. Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and others are handling a massive share of user activity. DeFi degens are farming yield on L2s, NFT volume is rotating across rollups, and gas fees on Mainnet swing from surprisingly calm to painfully high whenever a narrative pops off.\nHere is what is driving the current market mood:\n- Layer-2 Scaling War: Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zk-based rollups \u2013 all racing to lock in users, TVL, and devs. This is bullish for Ethereum\u2019s long-term network effect, but it creates short-term confusion: if everything moves to L2, does ETH still capture enough value on L1?\n- Vitalik and the Roadmap: Vitalik and core devs keep pushing toward a more modular Ethereum \u2013 danksharding, Verkle trees, Pectra. The market knows upgrades are coming, but the timing is always fuzzy, and delays can trigger impatience and selloffs.\n- Regulation and ETFs: The SEC, global regulators, and institutional products like potential ETH ETFs and staking-related rules are acting like a constant background noise machine. Any headline can flip sentiment from euphoria to panic in hours.\n- Macro and Liquidity: Broader macro conditions \u2013 interest rates, dollar strength, risk-on vs risk-off \u2013 are still a huge driver. When macro looks shaky, even the strongest crypto narratives get temporarily ignored as traders de-risk.\n- Social Sentiment Split: On YouTube and TikTok you see aggressive moon calls and doomsday warnings living side by side. Instagram reels are full of quick bullish snippets, while long-form crypto channels are more cautious and focused on risk.\nWhales are playing this environment with precision. On-chain data and order book flows often show them accumulating during extreme fear, then offloading into euphoric spikes. Retail traders, meanwhile, are chasing breakouts on leverage and getting rekt when volatility snaps back.\nThe current Ethereum narrative is not just \"up only\" anymore. It is more nuanced: can Ethereum maintain dominance as the settlement layer for an entire multichain universe, or will L2 tokens, alt-L1s, and new narratives siphon off its energy?\nLayer-2s: Boosting Ethereum Or Cannibalizing It?\nLayer-2 solutions are the real meta right now. Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync, Scroll, and others are attacking Ethereum\u2019s biggest pain point: gas fees and throughput. Instead of trying to replace Ethereum, most L2s settle back to ETH Mainnet, paying fees to use Ethereum for final security.\nHere is how that impacts Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals:\n- More Transactions, Different Places: A ton of user activity is leaving L1 and moving onto L2s where gas is cheaper and UX is smoother. That sounds bearish for L1 fees at first glance, but long term it is designed to increase Ethereum\u2019s total ecosystem throughput and keep it competitive.\n- Mainnet Still Gets Paid: Rollups post data and proofs back to Ethereum.

                "body": "Solana\u2019s divergence explained \u2013 Is SOL undervalued or not?\nWhen price diverges from fundamentals, it\u2019s often seen as a bullish signal. Strong on-chain metrics suggest investors aren\u2019t giving up. Instead, they\u2019re still committing capital and betting on the network\u2019s long-term potential. Any short-term pullback? That\u2019s usually just weak hands getting shaken out, setting the stage for a rebound once speculation cools off.\nConsidering this, it\u2019s easy to see why Solana [SOL] could be following a similar path.\nSOL has pulled back 31% so far in 2026, putting it among the weaker performers this year. And yet, the network\u2019s activity remains robust, with capital continuing to flow into growth areas like RWAs, hitting new all-time highs.\nBuilding on this momentum, Solana\u2019s DeFi TVL hit a new all-time high of $80 million, fueled by strong stablecoin inflows. When you put it all together, TVL is one of the clearest indicators of investor conviction in SOL.\nHigh liquidity and a growing TVL show that capital is being locked, signaling confidence in the network. This is also confirmation that fundamentals are diverging from price, a pattern usually seen when a token is undervalued.\nSo, naturally, the question arises \u2013 Is SOL undervalued? If it is, it could set the stage for a rebound once market sentiment flips to risk-on. That said, a closer look suggests this might still be an overly optimistic view for Solana.\nSpeculative buzz returns to Solana amid memecoin mania\nMemecoin performance is putting SOL\u2019s market momentum to the test.\nOver the past 30 days, their performance has diverged sharply. The memecoin sector\u2019s market cap fell by 3.5% to $30.2 billion, while SOL dropped by 8.5% over the same period. In short, memecoins outperformed Solana.\nOn-chain data might explain this gap too. According to Dune Analytics, Solana meme launchpads processed nearly $100 million in daily volume. Meanwhile, new token launches have averaged 30,000 per day this week.\nPut simply, the data highlighted the ongoing speculative frenzy on the network.\nFurther backing this trend, Pippin [PIPPIN] surged over 100% in a single week, surpassing $535 million market cap. By comparison, core memecoins like Dogecoin [DOGE] and Shiba Inu [SHIB] posted declines.\nWhy does this matter? High memecoin activity can be bearish, as these tokens are often traded for short-term gains. In this context, Solana\u2019s divergence on-chain and in price might not reflect a textbook bullish setup.\nInstead, it might be indicative of how speculation is masking the network\u2019s strength. As a result, the argument that Solana is undervalued is weaker, making its climb back to the $100-level a challenging one.\nFinal Summary\n- Solana\u2019s on-chain activity, DeFi TVL, and capital inflows seemed to be illustrative of strong long-term investor conviction.\n- Surging Solana memecoins emphasize speculative trading, undermining the case for SOL being undervalued."

                "body": "In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrencies, stability is rare. Yet, Solana (SOL) continues to shine. This week, the Solana ecosystem saw a small but steady gain of 1.4% in its total market cap. While many coins face ups and downs, SOL holds its ground, proving why it\u2019s a top choice for investors.\nMeme coins on Solana, however, tell a different story. These fun, community-driven tokens swung wildly, with big drops for some. This mix of calm and chaos shows the split nature of the Solana network: solid tech meets high-risk plays.\nSOL\u2019s price stayed strong above key support levels. Even as broader crypto markets dipped, Solana\u2019s native token avoided major losses. This strength comes from growing adoption, fast transactions, and low fees that attract developers and users.\nThe full Solana ecosystem market cap now sits comfortably higher than last week. This modest rise points to quiet confidence among holders. Key metrics like total value locked (TVL) also look healthy, with DeFi projects pulling in more liquidity.\nNot everything was quiet. A few standout assets led the gains:\nThese projects highlight Solana\u2019s strength in DeFi and real utility. They draw users who want more than hype.\nMeme coins stole the show for volatility. Tokens like BONK, WIF, and POPCAT faced heavy sell-offs. Some dropped over 20% in days, wiping out quick gains from earlier pumps.\nWhy the swings? Meme coins thrive on social buzz and whale moves. A single tweet or influencer post can send prices soaring\u2014or crashing. This week, fading hype led to profit-taking and fear-driven sales.\nInvestors in memes face high risk. But for thrill-seekers, Solana\u2019s speed makes trading them exciting.\nBeyond prices, big news shaped the week:\nOpenEden announced new tools for tokenized real-world assets on Solana. This brings stable yields from treasuries to the chain, appealing to yield farmers tired of volatile APYs.\nSolana Mobile revealed updates to its Saga ecosystem. New features for on-chain apps and Web3 gaming aim to make crypto phones mainstream. Expect more dApps optimized for mobile.\nThese steps show Solana building for the long term, not just short pumps.\nSolana\u2019s edge? Scalability. It handles thousands of TPS without Ethereum\u2019s gas pains. Upgrades like Firedancer will make it even better.\nPlus, a vibrant dev community. Over 1,000 projects live, from NFTs to AI agents. This diversity keeps the ecosystem growing.\nCompare to meme frenzy: SOL offers real tech. Meme coins? Pure speculation. Smart money flows to SOL.\nWatch for:\nTraders: Dollar-cost average into SOL for stability. Dip-buy memes wisely.\nThe Solana ecosystem proves resilient. while memes ride wild waves.

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The Dow Jones is in a tense, high-stakes zone where every headline from the Fed, every inflation print, and every earnings call can flip sentiment from euphoria to panic in a heartbeat. Price action has been choppy and emotional, with sharp rallies followed by nervous pullbacks, signaling a market that is unsure whether it wants to explode higher or roll over into a deeper correction.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch live Dow Jones trading rooms and market breakdowns on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest Wall Street charts and sentiment threads on Instagram\n- Binge viral TikTok breakdowns on fast Dow Jones and US30 trading tips\nThe Story: What is actually driving the Dow right now? It comes down to a three-way cage match: the Federal Reserve, US macro data, and blue-chip earnings.\nThe Fed is still the main character. Traders are hanging on every word from Jerome Powell, trying to decode whether rate cuts will come sooner or later, and how aggressive they might be. The market has been swinging between optimism that the tightening cycle is essentially done and fear that sticky inflation will force the Fed to stay hawkish longer than the Bulls want.\nInflation prints like CPI and PPI are the loudest catalysts. When inflation data comes in cooler than expected, you see relief rallies across the Dow as rate-cut hopes get priced back in. When the data is hotter, you immediately feel that risk-off wave: defensive sectors outperform, cyclical names wobble, and traders rotate into safer corners of the market. This tug-of-war is exactly why US30 has looked unstable: the macro narrative is not settled.\nEarnings season adds gasoline to the fire. Remember, the Dow is packed with old-school blue chips: industrials, financials, healthcare giants, consumer brands, and a handful of mega-cap tech and tech-adjacent names. Investors are laser-focused on:\n- Margins: Are companies maintaining pricing power in a slower economy, or are higher wages and input costs crushing profits?\n- Guidance: CEOs talking about a soft landing versus recession risk can swing sentiment instantly.\n- Buybacks and dividends: In an uncertain rate environment, predictable cash flows and shareholder returns keep Dow components attractive for institutional money.\nRecently, the narrative around the US economy has been strangely split. The hard data shows resilience: unemployment remains relatively low, consumer spending is not collapsing, and corporate balance sheets are not in crisis mode. But at the same time, you see warnings: tightening credit conditions, cautious CEOs, and parts of the manufacturing and housing sectors that show clear fatigue.\nThat tension is exactly why the Dow is experiencing these emotional swings: the index is trying to price in a path where growth slows, inflation cools, but the economy does not collapse. If the data confirms that \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario, the market can stage a powerful continuation rally. If not, we could see a deeper correction as lofty valuations and fragile optimism get repriced.\nOn social media, the split is obvious. One crowd is screaming \"Crash incoming\" on every downtick, pointing to debt levels, geopolitical risks, and stretched valuations. The other crowd is yelling \"Buy the dip\" and looking at every pullback as a launchpad for the next big leg higher. The truth, as always, is somewhere in the middle: this is a market where both aggressive Bulls and high-conviction Bears can make or lose serious money very quickly.\nDeep Dive Analysis: To understand the Dow\u2019s next big move, you need to zoom out to the"

                "body": "^DJI Today, February 14: CPI Cools; Nasdaq Lags on AI Jitters\nDow Jones today edged higher after January CPI cooled to 2.4% year over year, lifting rate cut bets for June. The Nasdaq lagged on AI disruption fears as investors rotated toward value and rate\u2011sensitive groups. Utilities, financials, and industrials drew bids, while tech and communications saw pressure. Volatility stayed elevated into a holiday\u2011shortened U.S. trading week. We break down what cooling inflation means for policy, how sector leadership is shifting, and how to position as earnings and macro catalysts keep price action choppy.\nCooler CPI lifts rate cut bets; indexes diverge\nJanuary\u2019s 2.4% CPI print eased pressure on the Federal Reserve and revived talk of a first rate cut by June. Futures pricing reflected a higher chance of mid\u2011year easing as growth cools but remains intact. For Dow Jones today, a softer inflation path supports value exposure and cash\u2011flow stability. The holiday\u2011shortened week may amplify swings as traders recalibrate to the updated inflation track.\nThe Dow inched up while the Nasdaq slipped as investors questioned near\u2011term AI monetization and the cost of compute. Tech and communications names stayed heavy, keeping breadth uneven. Global flows also tracked these worries, as noted by Reuters and Bloomberg. For Dow Jones today, defensive balance helped offset growth weakness and preserved gains despite higher day\u2011to\u2011day volatility.\nSector rotation: who is winning and who is lagging\nCooling inflation and firmer rate cut bets aided financials by stabilizing the curve and supporting loan growth visibility. Industrials benefited from steady order books and infrastructure demand. Utilities, with reliable dividends, found support as bond yields eased. For Dow Jones today, these groups helped cushion index declines elsewhere and signaled investors are favoring earnings durability over speculative growth.\nInvestors trimmed exposure to cloud, digital ads, and chip\u2011tied plays as AI disruption fears met questions about profitability. Elevated capex for data centers and GPUs pressures margins until revenue ramps. Communications names faced similar concerns around ad budgets and streaming economics. The tilt away from mega\u2011cap growth kept the Nasdaq behind, while Dow Jones today held up better on value leadership and dividend support.\nPortfolio playbook as rate cut bets firm\nWith cooling inflation and a possible June cut, we prefer balanced duration in high\u2011quality bonds and a ladder across short to intermediate Treasuries. Investment\u2011grade credit remains favored over high yield while default risks normalize. Cash still matters, but reinvestment risk grows if policy eases. For Dow Jones today context, modestly higher equity income can complement the bond sleeve.\nStay focused on quality: pricing power, strong free cash flow, and conservative balance sheets. Favor value, dividends, and select cyclicals tied to infrastructure and reshoring. Keep a barbell with selective AI beneficiaries where earnings visibility is clearer. Use staggered buys, defined stop\u2011losses, and periodic rebalancing. For Dow Jones today, that mix helps manage swings without abandoning growth entirely.\nWhat to watch next: levels and catalysts\nThe Dow sits near recent highs, supported by steady breadth and leadership from financials and industrials. The S&P 500 shows resilience but relies on broader participation to extend gains. The Nasdaq remains more sensitive to AI headlines and guidance. For Dow Jones today, watch pullbacks to rising moving averages and how sector rotation behaves on down days.\nA holiday\u2011shortened U.S. week can magnify moves as liquidity thins. Watch follow\u2011through after the CPI cooldown, upcoming corporate guidance around AI spending, and commentary on demand, pricing, and capex. For Dow Jones today, sustained leadership from value and rate\u2011sensitive sectors would support higher lows, while renewed tech selling could keep the Nasdaq volatile and cap index adva"

We are seeing a mix of nervous chops, sharp squeezes, and attention-grabbing reversals \u2013 the kind of action that punishes lazy positions and rewards traders who actually have a plan. Because current data cannot be fully verified to today\u2019s exact date, we stay disciplined: think in zones and momentum adjectives, not exact point levels.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch live Dow Jones battle streams and trader reactions on YouTube\n- Scroll the freshest Wall Street chart art and news drops on Instagram\n- Binge viral TikTok plays and bite-size investing hacks before the Opening Bell\nThe Story: Right now the Dow Jones Industrial Average \u2013 the granddaddy of blue-chip indices \u2013 is being pulled by three huge forces: the Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves, the real health of US corporate earnings, and the global capital flows reacting to inflation and growth expectations.\nOn the macro front, every new inflation print \u2013 CPI, PPI, PCE, you name it \u2013 is acting like a stun grenade for Wall Street. A slightly hotter number and you see a sudden risk-off wave: financials wobble, industrials take a hit, defensives try to catch a bid, and high-beta Dow components get smacked. A cooler number and suddenly traders are screaming \\\"soft landing\\\" again, yields ease off their peaks, and the Dow stages a confident relief push.\nThe Fed is still the main character. Jerome Powell\u2019s press conferences, FOMC minutes, and even offhand comments from regional Fed presidents are driving algo spikes. The Street is constantly repricing how many cuts or hikes are on the table. When the market leans too aggressively toward rapid rate cuts, any pushback from Powell hits like a bucket of ice water: bond yields jump, the dollar firms up, and the Dow often reacts with a choppy, downside-biased session. When the Fed sounds more relaxed about inflation and hinting that they can be patient or even slightly dovish, you see relief: big industrial names, global exporters, and consumer-sensitive Dow stocks catch a bid as the probability of a harsh recession gets priced down.\nEarnings season is another huge driver. The Dow is full of real-economy businesses \u2013 think banks, industrial conglomerates, healthcare majors, consumer giants. When these names beat expectations and guide higher, it signals that Main Street is not as weak as the doomers claim. But when guidance is cautious \u2013 companies warning about slower demand, tighter credit conditions, or margin pressure from wages and input costs \u2013 the index reacts with sudden air pockets. The market is laser-focused on forward guidance right now, not just backward-looking earnings beats.\nMeanwhile, recession fears vs. soft landing optimism are in a full-on tug-of-war. You have one camp on social and YouTube screaming \\\"Dow crash incoming\\\" every time there is a red day and a spike in yields. On the other side, you have the \\\"buy the dip\\\" crowd arguing that as long as employment holds up and inflation cools gradually, any sell-off in blue chips is just a discounted entry into long-term quality. That tension is exactly why price action has been so dramatic: sharp sell-offs, violent bounces, and plenty of bull and bear traps in between.\nOn CNBC and the broader financial media stream, the narrative keeps rotating between three key themes:\n- Fed and rates: Will the next moves be restrictive enough to cause a hard landing, or can they engineer a smooth glide path?\n- Inflation: Are we tr"

Money doesn't create happiness but a lack of it or mismanagement of it can create stress,\" she said.\n\"That doesn't mean we need to be millionaires to be happy, but it does mean we need to be financially aligned.\"\nWhat do the stats say?\nMoney matters are a significant source of tension, according to the research, with 76% of all couples arguing about money regardless of their approach to managing their finances.\nThe worst culprits? The couples with one partner who is \"financially avoidant\" and the other whose money language is \"acts of finance\" - 97% of these partnerships argue about money.\nThis is followed by couples with one person who has a \"lifestyle enrichment\" style to money and the other in the \"money know how\" category, with 92% arguing over finances.\nThese clashes often play out in day-to-day arguments, including disagreements over non-essential spending (17%) and how much to save (15%).\nHow can you bring up money with your partner?\nIn a settled relationship, it can be tricky to speak to your partner about your financial goals, especially if they have changed while you've been together.\nDiscussing and agreeing on a shared goal, instead of the path you take to get there, could be a good place to start, Quinn said.\n\"If you peel a layer back and you get to the core truth, they both want similar goals, even if they want to get there differently,\" she said.\nShe explained there could be a trade-off depending on whether couples were thinking in short, medium or long-term goals.\nIf you're a \"saver\" with a \"spender\", it might be a case of educating your partner to feel a similar emotional connection to saving as they do with spending.\nQuinn gave the example of celebrating hitting a savings target as a way to get spenders more emotionally invested in storing cash.\nFor a \"spender\" encouraging a \"saver\", it might be important to make their partner feel secure in splashing the cash.\nOne way to do this is to sit down and work out their finances, setting aside a certain amount each month that can be spent on buying things or fun experiences.\nQuinn said this might make them feel more protected and positive when spending money.\nOlympic diver Tom Daley and his husband, film director Dustin Lance Black, recently appeared on Sky News to talk about how they handle their opposite approaches to money...\nWhat about a 'money date' for Valentine's Day?\nIf your relationship needs some financial fine-tuning, why not use Valentine's Day as a chance to have a \"money date\"?\nThe term has been coined for setting aside de"

Money doesn't create happiness but a lack of it or mismanagement of it can create stress,\" she said.\n\"That doesn't mean we need to be millionaires to be happy, but it does mean we need to be financially aligned.\"\nWhat do the stats say?\nMoney matters are a significant source of tension, according to the research, with 76% of all couples arguing about money regardless of their approach to managing their finances.\nThe worst culprits? The couples with one partner who is \"financially avoidant\" and the other whose money language is \"acts of finance\" - 97% of these partnerships argue about money.\nThis is followed by couples with one person who has a \"lifestyle enrichment\" style to money and the other in the \"money know how\" category, with 92% arguing over finances.\nThese clashes often play out in day-to-day arguments, including disagreements over non-essential spending (17%) and how much to save (15%).\nHow can you bring up money with your partner?\nIn a settled relationship, it can be tricky to speak to your partner about your financial goals, especially if they have changed while you've been together.\nDiscussing and agreeing on a shared goal, instead of the path you take to get there, could be a good place to start, Quinn said.\n\"If you peel a layer back and you get to the core truth, they both want similar goals, even if they want to get there differently,\" she said.\nShe explained there could be a trade-off depending on whether couples were thinking in short, medium or long-term goals.\nIf you're a \"saver\" with a \"spender\", it might be a case of educating your partner to feel a similar emotional connection to saving as they do with spending.\nQuinn gave the example of celebrating hitting a savings target as a way to get spenders more emotionally invested in storing cash.\nFor a \"spender\" encouraging a \"saver\", it might be important to make their partner feel secure in splashing the cash.\nOne way to do this is to sit down and work out their finances, setting aside a certain amount each month that can be spent on buying things or fun experiences.\nQuinn said this might make them feel more protected and positive when spending money.\nOlympic diver Tom Daley and his husband, film director Dustin Lance Black, recently appeared on Sky News to talk about how they handle their opposite approaches to money...\nWhat about a 'money date' for Valentine's Day?\nIf your relationship needs some financial fine-tuning, why not use Valentine's Day as a chance to have a \"money date\"?\nThe term has been coined for setting aside de"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in a tense, high-stakes phase \u2013 no blow-off rally, no full-blown crash, but a nervy, choppy environment where every macro headline and ECB whisper can flip the mood from cautious optimism to defensive risk-off in minutes. German bulls are trying to defend elevated levels after a powerful multi-month run, while bears are patiently waiting for cracks in earnings, growth data, and energy costs to finally matter again. It is not a sleepy market; it is a pressure cooker.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch in-depth YouTube breakdowns of the latest DAX 40 setups\n- Scroll Instagram reels to feel the new hype around German stocks\n- Dive into viral TikTok clips from active DAX traders\nThe Story: Right now, the DAX 40 is sitting at a crossroads where central bank policy, Germany\u2019s industrial backbone, and global risk appetite all intersect. To understand whether this is a hidden opportunity or a slow-motion risk trap, you have to zoom out from the one-minute chart and look at four forces: the ECB and the euro, the sector rotation inside the DAX, Germany\u2019s macro pulse, and global sentiment.\n1. ECB Policy & the Euro/USD: Why Every Candle on the DAX Speaks Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank, under Christine Lagarde, is effectively the invisible hand behind every major swing in the DAX. Even when the headlines look like they are about German autos or energy, the backdrop is still the same question: will the ECB stay tight to crush inflation, or pivot more aggressively to support a sluggish Eurozone economy?\nMarkets are locked into a tug-of-war narrative:\n- On one side, inflation has cooled from peak extremes, giving doves ammunition to argue for more cuts and looser conditions.\n- On the other side, growth indicators (especially in Germany) have been soft, with stagnation vibes and recession worries bubbling up whenever new data hits. That sounds like a clear reason for cuts \u2013 but persistent underlying inflation pressure and political risks keep the ECB cautious.\nFor DAX traders, the real kicker is the euro versus the US dollar:\n- A weaker euro tends to be DAX-friendly. It boosts export competitiveness for giants like Siemens, SAP\u2019s foreign revenues (translated back into euros), and industrial exporters across the index.\n- A stronger euro acts like a headwind. Dollar-based revenues convert into fewer euros, and the global risk crowd may rotate back into US assets when the greenback weakens.\nSo any shift in ECB tone \u2013 more hawkish or more dovish \u2013 instantly runs through EUR/USD and then into the DAX. If the ECB hints at being more aggressive on cuts, the euro often softens, and DAX bulls get a fresh tailwind. If Lagarde leans more hawkish to fight residual inflation, the euro can firm up and DAX buyers suddenly find themselves pushing against heavier resistance.\nBottom line: you cannot just stare at the DAX chart. You have to watch the ECB pressers, the forward guidance language, and how EUR/USD reacts. The DAX right now is less a pure German story and more a leveraged bet on the relative pace of policy between the ECB and the Fed.\n2. Sector Check: Autos Under Pressure vs. Tech and Industrials Holding the Line\nUnder the hood, the DAX 40 is not moving as one big monolith. There is a clear divergence story: traditional German heavyweights like the auto manufacturers are in a structural battle, while tech and high-quality industrials have been quietly carrying the index.\nGerman Autos: VW, BMW, Mercedes \u2013 Value or Value Trap?\nThe auto complex is fighting on multiple fronts:\n- "

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is locked in a tense, emotional zone right now \u2013 not a euphoric moonshot, not a panic meltdown, but a charged battlefield where every candle matters. Price action is showing classic tug-of-war behaviour: sharp rallies are met with quick profit taking, while every intraday dip attracts hungry buyers who still believe Europe is massively under-owned.

ECB Policy & the Euro: Why the DAX Lives and Dies by Christine Lagarde\nThe European Central Bank is the invisible hand under every DAX candle. Traders are obsessing over one question: will the ECB stay in restrictive mode too long and choke the real economy, or will it pivot just in time to let growth breathe?\nHere is the chain reaction smart money is watching:\nECB Rates ? Euro vs. USD ? Export Competitiveness ? DAX Earnings\nWhen the ECB sounds tough on inflation, rate expectations stay elevated. That often gives the euro a stabilising or strengthening bias against the dollar. A stronger euro can be double-edged for the DAX:\n- It signals confidence that inflation is under control and the economy is not collapsing.\n- But it also makes German exports more expensive in global markets, especially in dollar-priced sectors like autos, chemicals, and industrial machinery.\nChristine Lagarde\u2019s messaging has leaned cautious and data-dependent: no wild promises, no aggressive cuts locked in. That keeps volatility alive. Every ECB press conference becomes an event trade for DAX futures \u2013 algos reading each word, scalpers hunting the first breakout, and swing traders trying to ride the next multi-day move.\nIf incoming inflation data cools faster than expected, the market will start pricing earlier or sharper cuts. That scenario is generally DAX-positive: borrowing costs drop, valuations can expand, and cyclicals like industrials and construction tend to outperform. However, if the ECB fears a re-acceleration in prices or energy shocks, they may keep policy tight, which would keep a lid on risk sentiment and fuel talk of a growth slowdown.\nOn top of that, the euro/dollar dance adds another layer. A softer euro is often a quiet tailwind for DAX exporters: foreign revenues translate into more euros, and global demand feels stronger. A firmer euro, in contrast, forces investors to separate currency effects from real earnings power \u2013 not always friendly to headline-driven sentiment.\nBottom line: The DAX is currently priced for a cautious but not catastrophic ECB. Any surprise on the hawkish side can trigger sharp risk-off waves, while even a hint of a dovish shift can unleash powerful short-covering rallies and fresh inflows into European blue chips.\n2. Sector Check: Autos Under Pressure, Tech and Industrials Stealing the Show\nGermany\u2019s stock market identity crisis is on full display. The old narrative was simple: German = Cars + Machines. Today, the market is rotating toward software, automation, and industrial tech while the classic auto giants are fighting headwinds on all fronts.\nGerman Autos (VW, BMW, Mercedes): The Struggle is Real\nThe au"

ECB Policy & The Euro: Why Every Lagarde Quote Moves Your DAX Chart\nChristine Lagarde and the ECB have turned the DAX into a macro day-trading instrument. Every press conference, every hint on future rates, and every inflation projection is instantly priced into German blue chips.\nHere is the chain reaction in simple trader language:\nECB stance ? EUR/USD ? European financial conditions ? DAX 40 risk-on / risk-off.\nWhen the ECB sounds cautious and hints at staying restrictive for longer, bond yields in Europe stay elevated. That is a headwind for rate-sensitive sectors like real estate and growth tech, but it also supports the euro. A stronger euro can pressure German exporters, who suddenly earn relatively less once foreign sales are converted back into euros.\nOn the flip side, when markets price in future rate cuts or a softer ECB path, the euro tends to ease off. A slightly weaker euro is usually a hidden gift to DAX exporters \u2013 especially industrials, chemicals, and autos selling into the US and Asia. That is why you see the DAX often rally on days when the euro drifts lower and bond yields cool down: global investors are front-running easier financial conditions and better export margins.\nRight now the ECB is trying to walk a tightrope:\n- Inflation is off the peak but still uncomfortable.\n- Growth data out of Germany looks fragile, pointing to stagnation risk.\n- Markets are betting on gradual easing, but not an immediate policy U-turn.\nThat uncertainty keeps the DAX in a jittery sideways environment. Every data release \u2013 inflation, wages, growth \u2013 is seen through the lens of \u201cHow will Lagarde spin this?\u201d For traders, it means you cannot ignore the macro calendar. You are not just trading charts; you are trading central bank expectations.\n2. Sector Check: Old Economy Struggles vs. New Economy Resilience\nThe DAX is a weird mix: heavyweight old economy (autos, industrials, chemicals) plus a couple of modern champions like SAP and tech/automation names such as Siemens.\nGerman Auto Industry \u2013 From Hero To Headache\nThe autos \u2013 Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz \u2013 used to be the clear powerhouses of the DAX. Now they are the drama sector:\n- EV Transition Pain: Aggressive competition from Chinese EV makers is compressing margins and forcing huge investment in new platforms and software.\n- Regulation & Emissions: EU regulation is still tightening, pushing big capex while demand in some segments is cooling.\n- Global Demand Rotation: US consumer strength vs. European softness, plus uncertainty around China demand, keeps order books under scrutiny.\nThe result: autos regularly underperform when recession or China worries flare up. Pullbacks can be brutal, and every earnings season becomes a test: guidance downgrades trigger heavy institutional de-risking. For the DAX as an index, that means auto vo"

                "body": "Earnings Release: Here's Why Analysts Cut Their AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Price Target To US$670\nLast week, you might have seen that AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) released its annual result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 4.0% to US$391 in the past week. AppLovin missed revenue estimates by 4.7%, coming in atUS$5.5b, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.75 beat expectations, coming in 4.2% ahead of analyst estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from AppLovin's 23 analysts is for revenues of US$8.04b in 2026. This reflects a huge 47% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to shoot up 56% to US$15.80. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$7.83b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$14.64 in 2026. So there seems to have been a moderate uplift in sentiment following the latest results, given the upgrades to both revenue and earnings per share forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for AppLovin\nAs a result, it might be a surprise to see thatthe analysts have cut their price target 7.1% to US$670, which could suggest the forecast improvement in performance is not expected to last. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on AppLovin, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$860 and the most bearish at US$458 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await AppLovin shareholders.\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that AppLovin's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 47% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 22% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 15% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that AppLovin is expected to grow much faster than its industry."

                "body": "- United States\n- /\n- Interactive Media and Services\n- /\n- NasdaqGS:GOOGL\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Promising Earnings May Rest On Soft Foundations\nLast week's profit announcement from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was underwhelming for investors, despite headline numbers being robust. We think that the market might be paying attention to some underlying factors that they find to be concerning.\nExamining Cashflow Against Alphabet's Earnings\nIn high finance, the key ratio used to measure how well a company converts reported profits into free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio (from cashflow). The accrual ratio subtracts the FCF from the profit for a given period, and divides the result by the average operating assets of the company over that time. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\nAlphabet has an accrual ratio of 0.20 for the year to December 2025. Therefore, we know that it's free cashflow was significantly lower than its statutory profit, which is hardly a good thing. In fact, it had free cash flow of US$73b in the last year, which was a lot less than its statutory profit of US$132.2b. We should mention, here, that Alphabet free cashflow was as flat as a pancake over the last twelve months. However, that's not all there is to consider. The accrual ratio is reflecting the impact of unusual items on statutory profit, at least in part.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nHow Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?\nGiven the accrual ratio, it's not overly surprising that Alphabet's profit was boosted by unusual items worth US$25b in the last twelve months. While it's always nice to have higher profit, a large contribution from unusual items sometimes dampens our enthusiasm. When we crunched the numbers on thousands of publicly listed companies, we found that a boost from unusual items in a given year is often not repeated the next year. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. Assuming those unusual items don't show up again in the current year, we'd thus expect profit to be weaker next year (in the absence of business growth, that is).\nOur Take On Alphabet's Profit Performance\nSumming up, Alphabet received a nice boost to profit from unusual items, but could not match its paper profit with free cash flow. For the reasons mentioned above, we think that a perfunctory glance at Alphabet's statutory profits might make it look better than it really is on an underlying level. Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. While conducting our analysis, we found that Alphabet has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.\nIn this article we've looked at a number of factors that can impair the utility of profit numbers, and we've come away cautious. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

Reported EPS is $0.16, expectations were $0.14.\nOperator: Good morning. Welcome to The Wendy\u2019s Company Earnings Results Conference Call [Operator Instructions] Thank you. You may begin your conference.\nAaron Broholm: Good morning, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2025 fourth quarter earnings conference call. After this brief introduction, Ken Cook, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide a business update; and then Suzie Thuerk, Chief Accounting Officer and Global Head of FP&A, will review our fourth quarter results, share capital allocation priorities and our 2026 outlook. From there, we will open up the line for questions. Today\u2019s conference call and webcast includes a presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website, ir.wendys.com. Before we begin, please take note of the safe harbor statement that appears at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. This disclosure reminds investors that certain information we discuss today is forward-looking and reflects our current expectations about future plans and performance.\nVarious factors could affect our results and cause those results to differ materially from the projections set forth in our forward-looking statements. Also, some of today\u2019s comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Investors should refer to our reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure at the end of this presentation or in today\u2019s earnings release. If you have questions following today\u2019s conference call, please contact me. I will now hand the call over to Ken.\nKen Cook: Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by recognizing our franchisees, restaurant teams and company employees for their ongoing commitment to the Wendy\u2019s brand. Together as One Wendy\u2019s, we are strengthening the foundation to deliver long-term profitable growth for the company and our franchisees. This morning, I\u2019ll start by discussing our fourth quarter results and full year highlights, then provide an update on Project Fresh. And lastly, I\u2019ll share our 2026 outlook before passing it over to Suzie to talk through the financials in more detail. Starting with the fourth quarter. While results were in line with our expectations, we know that we have a lot of work to do to improve performance. With Project Fresh underway, we have the right plan in place to strengthen our U.S. business.\nAs we shared on our last earnings call, we expected fourth quarter system-wide sales to be down significantly, and they were. Global system-wide sales declined 8.3%, driven by our U.S. business, where marketing spend was down significantly as a result of front-end loaded ad spending in 2025 and sales trends throughout the year, in addition to a tough comp with our SpongeBob collaboration in the prior year and our decision to shift the launch of our new chicken sandwiches into 2026 to ensure excellent execution. A bright spot for the U.S. was the rollout of our chicken tenders and new sauce lineup, which delivered strong customer satisfaction scores, demonstrating the power of focused execution. Turning to our international business. Performance remained strong with system-wide sales up 6.2% in the fourth quarter, its 21st consecutive quarter of growth.\nInternational expansion remains a key priority, and we continued our momentum, opening 59 new locations in the fourth quarter. New restaurant openings came from key stronghold markets such as Canada and Mexico as well as new markets such as Armenia and Scotland, both of which delivered strong sales following their launch. From a profitability perspective, total company adjusted EBITDA was $113.3 million and adjusted EPS was $0.16. Turning to our full year performance. 2025 was a challenging year, but it was also an important year as we began laying the foun"

                "body": "There was no single, dominant theme in currency markets last week. Instead, price action reflected a mix of cross-asset divergences. Dollar ended as the worst performer, despite the fact that Fed expectations barely shifted following high-profile releases of non-farm payrolls and CPI. Meanwhile, US Equities experienced volatility, particularly around renewed AI disruption fears, yet there was no decisive breakout in either direction.\nThe most consequential development was the sharp dive in US yields. The 10-year yield\u2019s slide appeared disproportionate to changes in Fed pricing, hinting that capital flows and positioning dynamics may be playing a larger role than policy expectations. That yield compression likely weighed on the Dollar, even though the selloff has been restrained rather than disorderly. Dollar Index was under pressure but has not yet entered an accelerated downtrend.\nIn contrast, Yen emerged as the standout performer. Notably, its rally occurred alongside continued strength in Japanese equities, breaking from the traditional inverse correlation between the currency and risk sentiment. Yet momentum in Yen has already begun to stall near key resistance levels. Also the durability of its decoupling from risk appetite is uncertain.\nElsewhere, Sterling ranked as the second weakest currency, pressured by renewed political instability within the Labour government and soft GDP data. Swiss Franc, by contrast, was the second strongest, reinforcing the impression of underlying caution even if global equities did not fully reflect risk aversion.\nAussie also posted solid gains, supported by hawkish RBA commentary that kept the door open for further tightening. However, momentum there is fading as broader risk appetite softens. Euro, Loonie and Kiwi drifted in the middle, lacking clear directional conviction \u2014 like passersby in a market still searching for its next unifying theme.\nData Fails to Inspire; NASDAQ\u2019s Rejection Raises Caution\nUS equities experienced elevated volatility last week but ultimately failed to establish a decisive direction. Stronger-than-expected non-farm payrolls and a slightly softer CPI print provided headline movement, yet neither report altered the broader narrative in a meaningful way.\nMarkets quickly recognized that the data did little to shift Federal Reserve expectations. Pricing for a March hold moved from around 80% to roughly 90%. June cut odds dipped marginally from 72% to 69%. Those are incremental adjustments rather than regime changes.\nWith policy expectations stable, investor focus drifted back toward structural concerns \u2014 particularly renewed fears around AI-driven disruption. Technology and software shares remained sensitive, though selling pressure has so far lacked the intensity of a full risk-off unwind.\nImportantly, the broader indexes are still holding within familiar ranges. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ remain contained inside consolidation structures, while DOW even managed to print a fresh record before paring gains.\nTechnically, however, risk is tilting to the downside for NASDAQ. The index was rejected at its 55 D EMA (now at 23,204), a development that often signals near-term vulnerability. NASDAQ should have already entered the third leg of the corrective pattern from 24,020.00 high. Deeper decline toward 21,898 support, and possibly below, is likely in the near term.\nBut for now, it\u2019s seen as in correction to the up trend from 147,84.03 only, not a larger scale one. Hence, downside should be contained by 38.2% retracement of 14,784.03 to 24,020.00 at 20,491.85 to bring rebound.\n10-Year Yield Collapse, Dollar Index Softens\nIf there was one development that truly defined the week, it was the sharp decline in US Treasury yields. 10-year yield plunged to close near 4.056, a dramatic reversal from its January high at 4.311.\nAt first glance, some attributed the fall to expectations of faster Fed easing. However, interest rate pricing tells a different story. March remains firmly price"

                "body": "MUNICH (Reuters) -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio cast the United States as the \"child of Europe\" in a message of unity on Saturday, offering some reassurance as well as levelling more criticism at allies after a year of turmoil in transatlantic relations.\nRubio was addressing the annual Munich Security Conference, where Europe's leading powers have tried to project their own independence and strength while straining to keep an alliance with the U.S. under President Donald Trump alive.\nThe speech delivered a degree of reassurance to European countries who fear being left in the lurch on anything from the war in Ukraine to international trade ructions in a rapidly shifting global order.\nBut it was short on concrete commitments and made no mention of Russia, raising questions on whether Rubio's more emollient tone than that of Vice President JD Vance at the same event a year ago would change the underlying dynamics.\n\"In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe,\" Rubio said.\n\"For the United States and Europe, we belong together,\" he said in a speech that drew a standing ovation at the end.\nWhile European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was \"very much reassured\" by the speech and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called him a \"true partner\", others struck a more cautious tone.\n\"I am not sure that Europeans see the announced civilisational decline, supposedly caused mainly by migration and deindustrialisation, as a core uniting interest. For most Europeans, the common interest is security,\" said Gabrielius Landsbergis, former foreign minister of NATO member Lithuania.\n\"This was not a departure from the general position of the (Trump) administration. It was simply delivered in more polite terms,\" he said on X.\nOne particular area of anxiety is Ukraine, where allies have long worried about Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin trying to ram through a deal on Moscow's terms and force Kyiv to cede land to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.\nU.S.-brokered peace talks resume next week in Geneva after a sustained bombardment of Ukrainian cities during one of the coldest winters in years killed civilians and left hundreds of thousands of people without power and water.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed hope at the conference on Saturday, but worried that Ukraine was being asked \"too often\" to make concessions in the negotiations.\n\"We truly hope that the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all of us but honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things,\" Zelenskiy said in a speech.\nThe Ukrainian leader said he was feeling \"a little bit\" of pressure from Trump, who had said Zelenskiy should not miss the \"opportunity\" to make peace soon.\n\"The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,\" Zelenskiy said.\nAsked about Russia after his speech, Rubio said the United States would not ditch its commitment to working on a peace deal but that it was not clear whether Moscow was serious about achieving this.\nNATO boss Mark Rutte, who has fronted efforts to keep Trump onside, said the U.S. was on the same page on the peace talks, adding that Russia was sustaining \"crazy losses\" of around 65,000 soldiers in total over the last two months. Reuters has not independently verified such figures.\nThe Munich conference of top security leaders has been dominated this year by how countries are scrambling to adjust to a year of confrontations with Trump on issues from tariffs to his threat to wrest Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark.\nSpeaking directly after Rubio, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned against \"knee-jerk\" calls for the Uni"
