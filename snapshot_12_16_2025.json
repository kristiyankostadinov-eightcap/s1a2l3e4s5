                "body": "Gold Price News Today, Dec 16: Impact of US Dollar Fluctuations\nToday, understanding how fluctuations in the US Dollar affect gold prices is crucial for investors. On December 16, the gold price today is directly impacted by recent currency movements. The value of gold often responds inversely to changes in the US Dollar. This relationship allows investors to use gold as a hedge against currency volatility. In recent months, both geopolitical tensions and economic reports have influenced these commodities. Monitoring these factors helps those invested in precious metals comprehend market trends better.\nGold Price and US Dollar Relationship\nGold prices tend to have an inverse relationship with the US Dollar. When the Dollar strengthens, gold prices usually decrease, and vice versa. Today, shifts in the Dollar value highlighted this pattern. Investors often turn to gold during currency instability. This behavior was evident as the Dollar\u2019s recent fluctuation caused noticeable movement in the gold markets. Such fluctuations arise from various factors, including inflation rates and interest policies. Analyzing these trends helps investors align their strategies accordingly.\nCurrent Trends in the Gold Market\nToday\u2019s gold market reflects recent economic conditions and policy changes. As of now, the gold price stands at INR 50,500 per 10 grams. This price reflects a modest rise following the Dollar\u2019s depreciation. Analysts attribute this to factors such as US inflation data and interest rate expectations. For investors, these trends indicate possible future movements. Understanding these signals is essential for making informed decisions. Experts often suggest considering both currency movements and geopolitical events when evaluating gold investments.\nHow Currency Movements Influence Gold\nCurrency movements impact commodity prices significantly. When the US Dollar fluctuates, commodities like gold react quickly. This is because commodities are globally traded in USD, influencing their international prices. For India, where gold is priced in INR, these fluctuations also affect local prices. A weaker Dollar often leads investors to consider gold as a safe haven. This trend is observable in today\u2019s market shifts, encouraging diversification in portfolios focused on precious metals.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn conclusion, the connection between the US Dollar and gold prices underscores the importance of monitoring currency movements for investors. Today\u2019s gold price changes highlight how fluctuations in the Dollar can influence market trends. For Indian investors, keeping an eye on both global and local economic indicators is key to navigating these changes. Tools like Meyka provide valuable insights into real-time financial analytics. As always, informed decision-making remains crucial in maintaining resilient investment portfolios. Monitoring such dynamics ensures better preparedness in the ever-changing financial landscape.\nFAQs\nGold prices often move inversely to the US Dollar. A stronger Dollar tends to lower gold prices as gold becomes more expensive in other currencies. Conversely, a weaker Dollar can boost gold prices as it becomes cheaper internationally.\nAs of December 16, the gold price in India is INR 50,500 per 10 grams. This reflects a slight increase influenced by recent US Dollar weakening, driven by economic conditions and policy changes.\nCurrency movements affect commodity prices like gold. Understanding these fluctuations helps investors make informed decisions, especially for those using gold as a hedge against currency instability.\nDisclaimer:\nThe content shared by Meyka AI PTY LTD is solely for research and informational purposes.

                "body": "A decrease in oil supply drives up oil prices, which can raise unemployment and inflation. To counter adverse effects on inflation, a central bank may choose to increase its policy rate, potentially reducing economic activity further. Changing interest rates can thus shape how unexpected oil price changes affect the economy. In recent years, interest rates have become more sensitive to unexpected oil supply news. However, market-based long-term U.S. inflation expectations did not shift significantly in response to oil supply news, suggesting that the public\u2019s inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nSupply-side shocks, such as unexpected reductions in oil production or supply chain disruptions, create difficult economic conditions for policymakers to address. For example, an unexpected decline in the oil supply can raise oil prices, causing input costs to increase. Companies facing higher input costs may raise prices, which increases inflation and can lead consumers to reduce their demand for those goods, depressing economic activity and potentially raising unemployment. Central banks face a tradeoff between responding to the rise in inflation and to the rise in unemployment. In particular, the central bank may tighten monetary policy following a negative shock to the oil supply. While this would lean against rising inflation or increases in perceived future inflation, it could also further dampen economic activity.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to address such a situation depends in part on how markets expect it to respond to the oil supply shocks and how anchored market inflation expectations are to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. Analyzing financial market responses to past oil supply shocks thus provides important insights into both the transmission of supply shocks and the ability of the Fed to effectively address them.\nIn this Economic Letter, we study the sensitivity of the two-year Treasury yield and long-term inflation expectations to oil supply news. We allow the sensitivity of interest rates to vary over time to examine whether the responsiveness of interest rates has changed over different economic episodes. Our analysis suggests that interest rates were more sensitive to oil supply surprises in 2022\u201323 relative to the pre-2021 period, though the sensitivity decreased slightly in the last few months of 2024. Furthermore, we find that inflation expectations showed little change in recent years, suggesting that market expectations of future inflation are well anchored.\nMeasuring oil supply surprises\nTo assess how sensitive interest rates are to changes in the oil supply, we need a measure of oil price fluctuations that are driven by oil production shocks unrelated to broader global economic conditions. In practice, movements in oil prices reflect both supply and demand factors. For instance, weaker global demand can lead the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce oil production, which in turn raises oil prices.\nFor this analysis, we use the oil supply \u201csurprises\u201d series from Kanzig (2021). These surprises are defined as changes in daily oil futures prices around OPEC press conference announcements. Because oil futures are forward-looking, their prices incorporate publicly available information. Global economic conditions are likely already known and have been priced in by the market before an announcement, so the short-term change in prices following the announcement should isolate the effect of the news itself on oil prices. The series includes 151 surprises, spanning from July 1983 to December 2024, and captures both positive and negative shocks to oil prices.\nMeasuring interest rate sensitivity\nWe estimate the sensitivity of two-year Treasury yields to oil supply news by examining the daily changes in yields on OPEC announcement days using 36-month rolling samples starting in 1983.

                "body": "Middle East oil prices weaken as regional supply outpaces demand\n(Bloomberg) \u2013 The Middle Eastern oil market has weakened in recent weeks on concern that regional supplies will outstrip demand, adding to signs of a softening global picture that\u2019s weighed on benchmark crude futures.\nAmong widely watched metrics, the premium of Abu Dhabi\u2019s flagship Murban over Brent has declined to the narrowest since early October. The shift signals concern too much crude is being offered in the Middle East than can readily be bought by refiners in Asia at a time of higher, competing worldwide output.\nGlobal benchmark Brent is on pace for a third year of declines, as expectations that worldwide supplies will exceed consumption outweigh geopolitical concerns. Members of OPEC, including Mideast shippers such as Saudi Arabia, have added barrels just as rival drillers in the Americas also bolster output.\nReflecting the abundant availability of near-term supplies, state producer Saudi Aramco recently cut the price of its flagship crude grade for Asia to the lowest level in five years. In addition, the Paris-based International Energy Agency forecasts that there will be a record global crude glut next year.\n\u201cThe surplus in the oil market is set to grow in 2026, following OPEC+\u2019s decision to unwind supply cuts at a quicker-than-expected pace,\u201d said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV. \u201cNon-OPEC supply is also expected to grow at a healthy clip despite this year\u2019s price weakness.\u201d\nOther markers in the Middle East are also flashing weakness. Among them, the Dubai benchmark\u2019s discount to Brent, known as the Brent-Dubai EFS, was recently at its widest in about seven weeks.\nWithin the region, differentials between some spot crudes and the Dubai benchmark have softened, according to General Index. Upper Zakum and Oman had a 50- to 60-cent premium to Dubai at the end of last week, down from about 90 cents at the start of the month.\nOn a global basis, ING forecasts supply will rise 2.1 million barrels a day next year, while demand expands about 800,000 barrels. The IEA, meanwhile, projects output will exceed consumption by 3.8 million barrels a day in 2026.\n\u201cThe scale of the surplus and the expected build in inventory should put the forward curve under additional pressure,\u201d said Patterson, referring to the pricing of crude over the coming months."

                "body": "It has been an eventful year for U.S. shale oil and gas. Low prices\u2014at least in oil\u2014a double down on capital discipline, and drilling efficiency gains that pushed the U.S. total to a record high again were the hallmarks of 2025. The next frontier? Recovery rates.\nRecovery rates for shale oil wells are much lower than the rates for conventional wells. The average is around and below 10%, compared with 30% to 35% for conventional wells. Given the prominence of shale basins in the United States\u2019 total oil production, it was only a matter of time before recovery rates came into the spotlight. With the Trump administration\u2019s prioritization of energy, the time was right.\nWood Mackenzie recently reported on the administration\u2019s signals to the energy industry that it is time to start paying closer attention to recovery rates and ways of boosting them. The report cited the assistant secretary of energy, Kyle Haustveit, who was appointed head of the new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office at the Department of Energy, as saying the industry should strive to double recovery rates from shale wells.\n\u201cToday for oil reservoirs we recover roughly 10% of the oil in place,\u201d Haustveit said at a recent industry event. \u201cWe can repeat the shale revolution with the resource we\u2019ve already characterised, the wells we\u2019ve already drilled, through the infrastructure that\u2019s been built.\u201d\nLike Energy Secretary Chris Wright, assistant secretary Haustveit is an industry veteran. As Wood Mackenzie points out, Haustveit, formerly with Devon Energy, had been involved in developing drilling optimization techniques, which makes him a perfect choice for the effort to boost recovery rates\u2014an effort, which the industry is already making.\nRelated: Kazakhstan Battles Big Oil in $3.5 Billion Arbitration Case\nU.S. oil production topped 13.6 million barrels daily earlier this year. The continued growth came despite a decline in the number of active rigs and despite persistently low international oil prices. It also came despite the fact that, as Energy Intelligence noted in a recent industry report, drilling productivity is deteriorating.\nThe report cited KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts as reporting drilling productivity declines of between 8% in the Midland Basin to as much as 27% in the Eagle Ford. The analysts called the productivity decline \u201cpervasive\u201d and said it was a result of both field maturation, which is a natural process, and of what the report called efficiency tradeoffs. Specifically, the well productivity decline was attributed to the energy industry\u2019s newfound focus on capital discipline and cost cuts, which, per Energy Intelligence, \u201cmeans fewer opportunities to chase aggressive growth.\u201d\nThis is where recovery rate improvement comes in. According to the above report, the industry expects that it will be recovery rates that will drive shale oil production growth over the ten years, replacing faster drilling. Wood Mackenzie said that this year has seen a significant increase in interest in boosting recovery rates. The consultancy noted Exxon\u2019s CEO, who set a target for doubling recovery rates back in 2023.\nAt a recent presentation, the supermajor provided some details on how it was going on about it: with artificial intelligence used for development planning, extra-long laterals, and improved, lightweight proppants. The latter alone has contributed to Exxon\u2019s expectation of higher overall output this year. Chevron is also zeroing in on higher recovery rates, with Wood Mac citing CEO Mike Wirth as saying recently that \u201cthe biggest opportunity is to recover more of the molecules that are in the ground.\u201d\nAnalysts have been warning that U.S. shale production is about to suffer a reversal of fortunes because of its high costs, compared to conventional oil, as benchmark prices remain stuck in a lower-than-optimal range, pressured by a consistent flow of reports of a glut. Last month, Kpler warned that shale oil production in the United States could see a 70"

                "body": "EUR/USD Outlook: The Euro Approaches Yearly Highs Ahead of the ECB Decision\nThe EUR/USD pair has accumulated a streak of four consecutive bullish sessions, holding a gain above 1%, which shows that, for now, buying pressure has returned to the pair ahead of the year-end. This renewed upside momentum observed in recent sessions has been supported by the weakness of the U.S. dollar following last week\u2019s central bank comments and by expectations of a neutral stance from the European Central Bank in this week\u2019s decision. Both factors have driven a quick recovery in the euro in the short term, and as long as no surprises emerge from the ECB meeting, this buying pressure could continue influencing EUR/USD movements in the coming sessions.\nDollar Weakness Remains a Theme\nSeveral sessions have passed since the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decision, in which the rate was reduced from 4.00% to 3.75%. For now, this is expected to be the last cut in the short term, as the CME Group probability model shows a 73.4% chance that the rate will remain unchanged for the January 28, 2026 meeting.\nHowever, even without expectations of further immediate cuts, the market continues to respond to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, who indicated that no rate hikes are anticipated for 2026 and that additional cuts could be implemented if labor-market data continues to weaken. This suggests that next year may be characterized by a neutral or even lower rate environment, with very little probability of returning to the rate levels seen throughout 2025.\nThese comments have driven continued weakness in Treasury yields, especially the 10-year yield, which has fallen from recent highs near 4.2% to around 4.0%. The decline in yields reduces the attractiveness of these instruments, weakening demand from foreign investors who need dollars to buy bonds\u2014further weighing on the U.S. dollar as the market adopts a more bearish tone heading into 2026.\nViewing movements in the DXY index, which compares the dollar\u2019s strength against other currencies, it is clear that dollar weakness remains persistent: the index has quickly moved away from the psychological 100-point level and returned to the 98-point zone. This reflects growing loss of confidence in the U.S. currency and makes it difficult for the dollar to stabilize in the short term.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nIn this environment, as the Fed\u2019s lower-rate bias continues to weaken the dollar, other currencies\u2014such as the euro\u2014may keep recovering ground, as seen in recent sessions. Over time, if this trend continues, it could support consistent buying pressure on EUR/USD.\nWhat to Expect from the European Central Bank?\nThe ECB\u2019s rate decision will take place on December 18, and probability models continue to reflect a clear neutral stance, with an 85.8% likelihood that the deposit rate will remain at the current 2.00% level.\nSource: ECBWATCH\nThis neutral outlook, consistent with recent ECB meetings, is partly explained by the moderate economic growth in Europe and the lack of clear evidence that inflation has moved away from its target range. This has led the institution to maintain a cautious stance and end the year with a neutral bias.\nIt is also important to highlight the interest-rate differential between the United States and Europe: 3.75% vs. 2.00%. Although at times this differential favors demand for U.S. assets, it is currently narrowing, which could improve the perceived stability of euro-denominated investments. If the ECB confirms a neutral stance, the narrowing differential could continue supporting stable euro demand, helping the EUR/USD recovery in the short term.\nEUR/USD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Broad Lateral Range Holds: Since mid-June, EUR/USD has maintained a broad sideways range, with an upper boundary at 1.18202 and a lower boundary at 1.15104. Recent price movements have approached the upper end of this range, which coincides with the highest levels of the year. If buying pressure "

Consequently, and according to reliable trading platforms, the Euro/Dollar price recently rose to the 1.1762 resistance level, the pair's highest in two months, before settling around 1.1733 at the time of writing this analysis. This stability is in anticipation of the crucial reaction this week to the ECB's policy announcement and the US jobs figures, the latter of which has been long-awaited due to the longest government shutdown in US history.\nAs is well known, US jobs figures and inflation levels are key factors influencing the Federal Reserve's policy decisions at upcoming meetings.\nObviously, the technical indicators confirm an upward technical correction for the EUR/USD pair. As shown on the daily chart, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved towards the 67 resistance level after recent gains, with the nearest point to the overbought line being 70.\nTop Forex Brokers\nSimultaneously, the MACD lines are steadily trending upwards, confirming the bulls' readiness for further gains if the factors driving the currency's price increase continue. Breaking above the psychological resistance level of 1.1800 remains crucial to confirming the overall trend shift and simultaneously supports the potential for a move towards the psychological resistance level of 1.2000, which has been identified as a target for trading in 2026.\nA scenario for a EUR/USD decline on the same daily chart would require a return to the 1.1500 psychological support level. No major economic data releases are expected today, suggesting that the pair may trade within a narrow range around its current levels.\nTrading Tips:\nThe EUR/USD pair is expected to remain within its recent range. Therefore, avoid placing trades within narrow price movements and wait for the reaction to this week's key events to determine the most suitable buy or sell opportunities.\nEUR/USD Forecast Versus Central Bank Policies\nAccording to currency trading experts' forecasts, the Euro/Dollar exchange rate will remain supported in this regard. As the new year's trades approach, currency investors will continue to monitor this divergence. Currently, they are focused on reassessing the possibility that the ECB may become one of the few G10 central banks with serious indications of monetary policy tightening in 2026. This shift would carry positive, albeit limited, implications for the single European currency.\nCurrency analysts believe that signs of interest rate hikes are beginning to emerge in several G10 markets, supporting currencies like the Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, and Swedish Krona. They predict that, in the baseline scenario, the ECB will keep its monetary policy unchanged in 2026. However, if the market starts pricing in a more hawkish scenario, the Euro price will clearly benefit.\nExperts also indicate that financial markets quickly shifted from expecting rate cuts to tentatively pricing in rate hikes in 2026 for the Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, Canadian Dollar, and Swedish Krona\u2014dynamics that have already supported these currencies. As for the Euro, a rate cut has been almost entirely ruled out.\nReady to trade our Forex daily forecast? We\u2019ve shortlisted the best forex broker list for you to check out."

At the time of writing, the pair trades at 1.1739 unchanged.\nEuro steadies near multi-week highs as traders await Nonfarm Payrolls and assess mixed Fed rhetoric\nGreenback continues to edge lower down 0.10% according to the US Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY, which tracks the buck\u2019s performance against a basket of six currencies, registers the third daily loss in the last four, poised to reach the 98.00 figure if the jobs market continues to deteriorate.\nThe US docket featured a tranche of Fed officials. Fed Governor Stephen Mira was dovish while Boston Fed President Susan Collins justified her decision at the December meeting, striking neutral comments.\nContrarily, New York Fed President John Williams was modestly hawkish, saying that policy has moved \u201cfrom modestly restrictive\u201d to neutral.\nOn Tuesday, market participants would digest the November Nonfarm Payrolls, Retail Sales alongside further comments by Fed speakers.\nAcross the pond, a Reuters poll revealed that economists project the European Central Bank (ECB) will remain in hold throughout 2026 as they estimate inflation to remain subdued, but the economy is expected to stay resilient.\nAhead of the week, the ECB is expected to keep rates unchanged at the December 18 meeting.\nEuro Price This Month\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies this month. Euro was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other.

For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily market movers: EUR/USD unchanged despite Fed hawkish rhetoric\n- Last week, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for a third time in 2025, lowering the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75% in a split decision. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that policymakers could pause the easing cycle as the economy absorbs the cumulative 75 basis points of rate cuts delivered this year.\n- Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she sees inflation risks lower than before, backing the latest rate cut amid a shift in the balance of risks.\n- New York Fed President John Williams stressed that restoring inflation to the 2% target remains critical, noting that firms appear reluctant to both hire and fire. Williams expects the unemployment rate to hold near 4.5% by year-end and sees inflation reaching target in 2027. He projects GDP at 2.25% in 2026, above the expected pace for 2025.\n- Earlier, Fed Governor Stephen Miran maintained a distinctly dovish stance, arguing that a faster pace of rate cuts would move policy closer to neutral. He reiterated expectations for a faster decline in shelter inflation within the PCE index and downplayed the role of tariffs in driving goods inflation higher.\n- US November Nonfarm Payrolls are expected to show job gains of 40K, with the Unemployment Rate steady at 4.4%. October Retail Sales are forecast to rise 0.2% MoM, unchanged from September, while control-group sales\u2014used to calculate GDP\u2014are projected to rebound to 0.3% after a 0.1% contraction previously.\nTechnical outlook: EUR/USD remains upward bias despite remaining subdued\nEUR/USD\u2019s technical setup points to a neutral-to-bullish bias, which would be reinforced if the pai"

                "body": "Asia stocks extend losses as tech sees little respite; BOJ, econ data in focus\nGBP/USD is trading around $1.3380\u2013$1.3400, up roughly 0.25\u20130.30% on the day. The pair is holding firm even as markets price an almost fully discounted 25 bp cut from the BoE, which would take Bank Rate to 3.75%. The market also leans toward another cut around mid-2026. UK data justify that shift. October GDP printed at -0.1% month-on-month and the rolling three-month figure from August to October also contracted. That confirms a soft growth backdrop. Core CPI is running at about 3.4% year-on-year, the lowest since March but still close to twice the 2% target. That mix of weak growth and still-elevated inflation is classic late-cycle territory. It pushes the BoE to remove some restriction but prevents a panic easing cycle. Price action in GBP/USD reflects that nuance. Sterling is firmer, not collapsing, which tells you the coming cut is largely in the price. The risk is about guidance more than the decision itself.\nThe key risk for GBP/USD is not whether the BoE cuts. It is how far and how fast the central bank hints it might go in 2026. A 25 bp move with a narrow 5\u20134 vote split would signal a reluctant start to easing, not a rush. That would usually support the pound, because the curve would have to take out some of the most aggressive cut expectations. If Bailey signals \u201cone and wait\u201d, sterling can extend gains above $1.3438 and test the $1.3500\u2013$1.3527 band. If he leans into weaker growth, stresses downside risks, and plays down inflation stickiness, the market will start to price a faster path below 3.50%. In that case GBP/USD will struggle to hold above the 200-day area. The next UK data cluster is decisive. Wage growth, unemployment and PMIs will either validate the easing bias or push the BoE back toward a slower path. The pair is sitting exactly where you expect it when traders do not want to commit before that confirmation.\nOn the US side, the Fed has already delivered its third 25 bp cut of the year. The target range is now 3.50%\u20133.75%. Markets price at least two more cuts by the end of 2026, with probabilities above 60% for further easing. That is more dovish than the median Fed projections. The US Dollar Index has slipped toward the high-97 to low-98 area, reflecting that repricing. Sentiment around the dollar is fragile. Traders are waiting for Nonfarm Payrolls, Average Hourly Earnings, and retail sales to decide whether the Fed will validate or push back against those expectations. A strong NFP print with solid wages will re-price the path closer to \u201cfewer cuts\u201d. That would give the dollar a floor and could knock GBP/USD back to $1.3330 or even $1.3280. A soft jobs and wages mix would do the opposite. It would deepen the dollar decline and allow sterling to squeeze higher through $1.3438. The pair is trading in the mid-$1.33s while the dollar drifts lower against most majors, which is consistent with this \u201cdata-dependent\u201d limbo. (mitrade.com)\nRisk sentiment is not in full risk-on mode, but it is far from panic. The FTSE 100 has recovered from recent dips and is pressing into resistance near 9,740\u20139,790. That tells you UK equities are still drawing capital despite domestic growth risk. At the same time, gold trades around $4,300 and is eyeing its prior record near $4,381. That is classic behaviour when markets expect lower real yields and a more dovish Fed. A weaker dollar plus firm commodities often translate into moderate support for high-beta currencies, including GBP. For GBP/USD, this backdrop means dips are being absorbed rather than chased lower. The pair has not reacted as if the UK is the outlier weak link. Instead, traders are viewing both central banks as moving toward easing, with the Fed arguably further along the path.\nFrom a price-action perspective, GBP/USD has already completed a strong leg higher from late November lows into the mid-$1.34s. The pair tagged around $1.3438 at the recent high and has since moved sideways i"

Ethereum\u2019s price sees a decrease of 5% as Bitmine acquires 102,259 ETH. Meanwhile, Solana consolidates in value with spot ETF inflows nearing $1 billion.\nTraders Sentiment And Strategy\nWe are watching GBP/USD very closely as it trades around 1.3400 ahead of this week\u2019s Bank of England meeting. The market is strongly expecting a 25 basis point rate cut, a view that has solidified since the Office for National Statistics reported last month that UK CPI inflation fell to 4.1%. This anticipation is keeping traders on edge and limiting any significant moves until the decision is announced.\nThe US Dollar\u2019s recent weakness is what\u2019s providing a floor for the pound, following the Federal Reserve\u2019s clear signal last week that it may pause its own rate hikes. This narrative gained credibility after the last Non-Farm Payrolls report showed a softer-than-expected gain of only 155,000 jobs, suggesting the US economy is cooling. This policy divergence, with the BoE easing while the Fed holds, is the central conflict driving the market right now.\nFor derivative traders, this points to a rise in implied volatility for sterling options expiring in the next few weeks. The market is pricing in a significant move, so strategies that benefit from this expected price swing, such as straddles or strangles, could be effective. Looking back at the sharp market reactions to the policy pivots we saw in 2023, it is clear that the initial move after the announcement can be very powerful.\nA critical technical level to watch is the 200-day moving average around 1.3360. A decisive break below this support level after the BoE announcement would likely trigger further selling pressure. On the other hand, if the Bank of England surprises by holding rates steady, we could see a sharp rally as shorts are forced to cover their positions.\nThe broader market context also shows a weaker dollar, with USD/JPY slipping below 156.00 on bets that the Bank of Japan may tighten policy soon. We remember how the coordinated central bank hiking cycles of 2022-2023 created massive, sustained trends in the currency markets. The coming weeks will show if the Bank of England is about to lead the major central banks into a new, divergent cycle of rate cuts."

                "body": "AUD/USD remains depressed below mid-0.6600s; downside seems limited ahead of US NFP report\n- AUD/USD remains depressed for the fourth consecutive day amid a combination of negative factors.\n- Last week\u2019s mixed Aussie jobs data, China economic woes, and a softer risk tone weigh on the AUD.\n- The divergent RBA-Fed policy expectations limit losses as traders await the delayed US NFP report.\nThe AUD/USD pair attracts some sellers for the fourth straight day on Tuesday and trades around the 0.6630 region, down just over 0.10%, during the Asian session.\nAgainst the backdrop of last Thursday's mixed Australian employment details, disappointing Chinese macro data released on Monday revied concerns about the health of the world's second largest economy. This, along with a weaker tone around the global equity markets, is seen weighing on the perceived riskier Australian Dollar (AUD) and the AUD/USD pair.\nHowever, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish stance limits deeper AUD losses. In fact, RBA Governor Michele Bullock said last week that it looks like more rate cuts are not needed and added that the Board discussed what they might have to do if rates need to go up. This, along with sustained US Dollar (USD) selling, offers support to the AUD/USD pair.\nThe USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, languishes near its lowest level since October 7 amid rising bets for more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Furthermore, expectations for a dovish replacement of Fed Chair Jerome Powell keep the USD bulls on the defensive and could act as a tailwind for the AUD/USD pair.\nTraders also seem reluctant and might opt to wait for this week's important macro data, starting with the delayed US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for October, before placing aggressive directional bets. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that the AUD/USD pair's three-week-old uptrend has run out of steam.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goe"

                "body": "Diverging Rates Pushing Up Aussie Dollar\nAt last the long-anticipated diverging interest rate outlook between Australia and the US is a reality, and we can begin to see the effects it is already having.\nWith the US Fed\u2019s decision to shave a quarter of a per cent off their official interest rates \u2013 and Australia\u2019s decision to hold rates steady \u2013 the Australian dollar has been finding some strength, hitting the highest level in three months with many pundits tipping it will reach the US70c level quite soon.\nWith the Fed having now cut rates three times in a row and with current chair Jerome Powell heading for the exits next March and sure to be replaced by someone who shares President Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for lower rates, the US rate cuts look like they might keep coming.\nThe other political factor that must be remembered is that Trump is heading towards the mid-term elections in November 2026 and he will want to get the economy firing as best he can before then.\nAlready tax cuts will start flowing through in the form of higher tax returns which should stimulate consumer spending and falling rates will add to that stimulus.\nLocal Inflation Could Persist\nOf course, the one handbrake on all of this is that stubbornly high inflation rates could persist or even rise which will dampen the US economy and enthusiasm for rate cuts, although the Fed may be willing to look past high inflation given its dovish mood.\nWhen it announced its recent cut, many observers were surprised by the dovish remarks of Fed chair Jerome Powell, as well as the decision to cut when inflation remained high.\nTraders in the US have already priced in two more rate cuts in 2026, although this may be optimistic but at least one more cut looks to be on the cards.\nAussie Rates on Hold\nIt was a different situation here in Australia with the RBA governor Michele Bullock pouring plenty of cold water on hopes of another rate cut in Australia this cycle and even suggesting that the next move may well be higher, depending on the data.\nThat has left Australian financial markets expecting that the next rate move by the RBA will be higher after the central bank held the cash rate steady at 3.6%.\nWhat remains uncertain is the timing of such a rate rise, with a long period of sitting with rates steady is always a chance.\nThe rise in headline inflation to 3.8% in October was accompanied by a 3.3% rise in the core measure which the RBA concentrates on.\nThose numbers look high and sticky and are now well and truly outside the RBA\u2019s target inflation band of 2% to 3%.\nDollar Rising, Shares Not So Much\nThe divergence in the rate outlook between the Fed and the RBA has been positive for the Australian dollar as comparative bond yields move in Australia\u2019s favour.\nThere remains plenty of uncertainty around all of this as shown by the weakness in the latest Australian job figures which injected a note of caution into the local rate rise scenario but two trends are emerging that all investors will be wise to take into account.\nOne is that falling US rates will tend to support the Australian dollar over time and the second is that there may be plenty of stimulus pushed growth to come on the US share market.\nWhile a rising US market adds fuel to our own as a by-product, it is worth noting that the US market is setting fresh records while Australian shares still remain well shy of our October highs.\nThat makes some sense because as the Australian dollar appreciates, it is effectively raising the global value of share holdings even without a corresponding rise in the share price."

It initially rose to a high of 0.6685 after the decision and then pulled back to 0.6653. It remains much higher than the November low of 0.6420.\nFed and RBA to Move in Divergent Paths\nThe AUD/USD pair has been in an uptrend in the past few days as odds that the Fed and RBA will move in different directions rose.\nThe Fed slashed interest rates by 0.25% as was widely expected and predicted that it would deliver one cut in 2026. Still, a lot can change, especially now that Donald Trump will announce a new Fed Chair next year.\nIndeed, the CME Fed Futures tool and top prediction markets expect the bank to cut rates two or three times next year.\nTop Forex Brokers\nThe AUD/USD pair will next react to some key economic numbers later this week, including inflation and jobs. These numbers will provide more information about the economy and hints on what to expect in the next meetings.\nMeanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to maintain interest rates steady in the next meetings as the country\u2019s inflation has remained stubbornly high in the past few months.\nRecent data showed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped to 3.8% in October. With the inflation figure above the 2-3% target, officials, led by Michele Bullock, will likely maintain rates unchanged in the foreseeable future.\nThere will be some key economic numbers from Australia this week. For example, S&P Global will publish the latest manufacturing and services PMI report on Tuesday. Westpac will also announce the latest consumer confidence report on the same day.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily chart shows that the AUD/USD pair has been in a strong rally in the past few months. It has jumped from a low of 0.640 in November to 0.6653 today.\nThe Australian dollar has jumped above the Ichimoku cloud indicator and the 50-day moving average. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved close to the overbought level.\nTherefore, the pair will likely continue rising as bulls target the psychological point at 0.6800. This view will be confirmed when it crosses the year-to-date high of 0.6700. A drop below the support at 0.6600 will invalidate the bullish outlook.\nReady to trade our free Forex signals?

The Japanese Yen (JPY) edges higher against the US Dollar (USD) amid the expectation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will raise interest rates at the upcoming policy meeting on Friday. Traders will closely monitor key US economic data, including Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), Retail Sales, and Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which are due later on Tuesday.\nRising bets for an imminent rate hike by the BoJ provide some support to the JPY and create a headwind for the pair. Traders have been pricing in the chance that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will hike interest rates on Friday. Reuters reported that the Japanese central bank would likely maintain a pledge at the December policy meeting to keep raising interest rates, but noted that the pace of further hikes would depend on how the economy reacts to each increase.\nAccording to a December 2-9 Reuters poll, 90% of economists expected the BoJ to raise short-term interest rates to 0.75% from 0.50% at the December meeting. This is a significant increase over the last Reuters survey conducted last month, which only had 53%.\nA catalogue of US data delayed by the government shutdown is set to be released later in the day. The employment reports for October and November will be released on Tuesday, which could provide more clarity on the labor market's health and likely influence expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) January meeting. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will be published on Thursday. A strong set of employment figures could underpin the Greenback, while signs of a weakening US labor market could weaken it further.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

The all-industries business conditions index rose to 17, marking its highest point since Q3 2018.\nAnalysts project the Bank of Japan to increase the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%, a first since January. There is speculation that the USD/JPY could lower towards 140.00, in line with US-Japan two-year bond yield spreads.\nPotential Shift in USD/JPY\nThe USD/JPY is holding near 155, but strong domestic data from Japan suggests a potential shift. The latest Tankan survey showed business conditions at their best since the third quarter of 2018, signaling a resilient economy. This strength provides a solid foundation for the Bank of Japan to continue its policy normalization.\nAll eyes are on the Bank of Japan meeting this Friday, where a 25 basis point rate hike to 0.75% is widely expected. This would be the second rate increase in 2025, following the hike back in January. This confirms we are in a clear tightening cycle, a major change from the policies of previous years.\nGiven the hawkish BOJ stance and strong economy, we see a strong case for the yen to appreciate against the dollar. Traders could consider buying USD/JPY put options to position for a downward move. These options would become profitable if the pair falls below the chosen strike price before expiration.\nStrategies for Trading USD/JPY\nThe current US-Japan two-year bond yield spread, now around 375 basis points, has kept the pair elevated. However, a BOJ rate hike will narrow this gap, reducing the dollar\u2019s yield advantage. We believe this spread compression supports a move for USD/JPY towards the 140.00 level.\nFor those looking for a different approach, selling out-of-the-money call spreads on USD/JPY could be attractive. This strategy profits if the pair trades sideways or moves lower, capitalizing on the view that upside is now limited. It allows traders to collect premium while defining their risk."

The latest inflation figures offered reassurance rather than surprise, keeping the Loonie anchored as investors focus on broader risk and geopolitical developments.\nCanada\u2019s CPI remained steady at 2.2% close to BoC\u2019s 2% target. The absence of renewed price acceleration is welcome, strengthening the case that policy easing is essentially complete and that rates are appropriately calibrated.\nWhile core inflation measures remain elevated, their gradual cooling trend supports expectations that underlying pressures are easing. If tariff impacts continue to settle and inflation softens further, the environment could allow growth to firm modestly in early 2026 without forcing the BoC back into action.\nMeanwhile, Risk sentiment firmed slightly in Europe after Asian markets were rattled by weak China data. Markets reacted to a major diplomatic shift after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signaled willingness to abandon Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions in exchange for alternative security guarantees, a development that weighed heavily on European defense stocks.\nBeyond defense, however, equity markets proved resilient. European indexes are posting mild gains. US stocks also opened higher, led by recovery in technology shares. Still, with US non-farm payrolls due tomorrow, investors appear reluctant to extend positions aggressively.\nAcross FX, Yen continues to lead despite giving back part of its earlier rally, followed by Sterling and Euro.

Headline CPI was unchanged at 2.2% yoy, undershooting expectations for an uptick to 2.4% and suggesting inflation remains comfortably contained near target.\nThe moderation was led by services inflation, which slowed to 2.8% yoy from 3.2% in October. That deceleration more than offset firmer goods prices, where grocery inflation accelerated sharply to 4.7% from 3.4%, the strongest pace since December 2023.\nGasoline prices also fell at a slower annual pace, declining -7.8% yoy compared with a -9.4% drop previously. Stripping out gasoline, CPI rose 2.6% year over year for a third consecutive month, pointing to stability rather than renewed inflation momentum.\nCore measures reinforced that message. CPI Median slowed to 2.8% from 3.0%, while CPI Trim eased to 2.8% from 2.9%, both coming in below expectations. CPI Common edged up slightly to 2.8%, matching forecasts.\nEurozone industrial production rises 0.8% mom in October, beats expectations on broad-based gains\nEurozone industrial production delivered a modest upside surprise in October, rising 0.8% mom and beating expectations for a 0.7% increase.\nThe gains in the Eurozone were broad-based across sectors. Output of energy rose 1.1% mom, capital goods increased 0.5%, and intermediate goods edged up 0.3%. Consumer-related categories were firmer, with durable consumer goods jumping 2.0% and non-durable goods rising 1.2%, suggesting some resilience in downstream demand.\nAcross the wider EU, industrial production increased 0.3% mom, masking sharp country-level divergences. Ireland (4.0%), Luxembourg (3.6%), and Croatia (3.1%)posted the strongest gains, while Sweden (-6.5%), Belgium (-3.4%), and Denmark (-3.2%) recorded steep declines.\nSECO upgrades 2026 GDP forecast, downgrades inflation\nSwiss economic "

Markets expect the Bank of Canada to take a slower, more cautious approach to easing over the next year, with policy signaling and inflation trends set to do most of the steering.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks are stepping carefully.\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s data-driven stance on rate moves highlights a broader global trend: central bankers are more cautious and methodical as they respond to shifting inflation and economic risks. Canada\u2019s approach could become a blueprint for other advanced economies facing similar headwinds, from commodity swings to geopolitical uncertainty. By prioritizing steady, incremental rate decisions over sweeping changes, policymakers are aiming to keep inflation anchored\u2014and that signals a more stable outlook for borrowers, businesses, and global markets heading into next year.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "The Canadian dollar was broadly steady against most major currencies on Monday following the release of inflation data that showed price growth remained unchanged.\nInflation in Canada was flat last month, while core inflation measures recorded a general slowdown, as faster food and some goods prices were offset by slower growth in services prices.\nData from Statistics Canada released on Monday showed headline inflation rose 2.2% year on year in November, matching the pace seen in October and coming in below the $2.3% median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\nOn a monthly basis, the consumer price index increased 0.1%, in line with expectations.\nFollowing the data, government bonds rallied, pushing the benchmark two-year government bond yield down to 2.57% by 9:48 a.m. Ottawa time. At the same time, the Canadian dollar, or loonie, trimmed earlier gains against the US dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s preferred core inflation measures \u2014 known as the median and trim \u2014 slowed to an annual pace of 2.8%, down from 3.0% previously. On a three-month moving average basis, these measures eased to 2.3% from 2.6% in October.\nThe central bank has recently placed less emphasis on these specific indicators, noting that a broader range of measures suggests underlying inflation is hovering around 2.5%.\nVeronica Clark, an economist at Citi, told BNN Bloomberg Television that there are \u201csome encouraging signs that core inflation is slowing,\u201d while adding that rental costs are still showing \u201ca degree of stickiness.\u201d\nOverall, underlying price pressures eased or stabilized in November. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 2.4% year on year, down from 2.7% in October. Inflation excluding gasoline increased 2.6% for the third consecutive month, while the central bank\u2019s former core measure \u2014 CPI excluding eight volatile components and indirect taxes \u2014 remained steady at 2.9%.\nDespite this, inflation pressures broadened, with the share of goods and services posting annual inflation above 3% rising to around 42% of the CPI basket, up from 34% previously.\nOverall, the report shows headline inflation continuing to move toward the central bank\u2019s 2% target, even as some core measures remain closer to 3%. The Bank of Canada is unlikely to be alarmed by lingering core pressures, given its view that slack persists in the Canadian economy amid the impact of US tariffs on key sectors, weighing on business investment and consumer spending.\nThe central bank held its policy rate unchanged at 2.25% last week and reiterated that borrowing costs are \u201cat about the right level\u201d to support growth while keeping inflation under control. Governor Tiff Macklem set a high bar for any policy shift, saying the bank would act only in the event of a \u201cnew shock or an accumulation of evidence\u201d that would \u201cmaterially change the outlook.\u201d\nPolicymakers expect inflation to remain close to 2%, a level it has hovered around for more than a year.\nCharles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Servus Credit Union, said in an email that there are still \u201csome signs that core inflation remains sticky, with momentum in certain measures staying elevated and inflationary pressures broadening.\u201d He added that \u201cthere is nothing in today\u2019s report that would cause immediate concern for the Bank of Canada or affect near-term monetary policy.\u201d\nRoyce Mendes, managing director and head of macro strategy at Desjardins Securities, said in a note to investors that the data point to generally \u201cbenign price pressures.\u201d He added that policymakers can take comfort that a stagflationary environment is not emerging, and that downside risks to growth and inflation are likely to become more significant in the months ahead.\nMendes noted that ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the US\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement is expected to weigh on economic activity, while fiscal stimulus is unlikely to play a major role until later in the year.\nIn November, lower prices for travel and accommodation, along with slower rent i"

                "body": "During the European trading session on Monday, GBP/JPY weakened significantly, with the exchange rate falling by approximately 0.5% to near 207.30. This decline was mainly due to the broad-based strengthening of the yen, driven by Japan's latest Q4 Tankan business sentiment survey data.\nThe data showed that the large manufacturing confidence index in Japan rose to 15, reaching its highest level in nearly four years, up from a previous reading of 14. The sustained improvement in manufacturing confidence, coupled with inflation remaining above the central bank\u2019s target, further reinforced market expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) would raise interest rates at its policy meeting this Friday.\nThe market widely expects the BoJ to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda recently made it clear that the central bank is gradually approaching its inflation target, which is seen as an important signal of policy normalization.\nAgainst the backdrop of a stronger yen, the British pound performed relatively flat. Investors are awaiting the upcoming UK employment data. The market expects that the UK unemployment rate may rise to 5.1%, while average wage growth excluding bonuses could slow to 4.5%.\nIf the employment data confirms a cooling labor market, it will further reinforce market expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75% on Thursday. Overall, the divergence between the hawkish BoJ and the dovish BoE has become the core logic behind the current downward pressure on GBP/JPY.\nBefore the release of the policy meeting results, market sentiment leans more toward the yen, with GBP/JPY facing downside pressure in the short term.\nFrom a technical perspective, the exchange rate has retreated from its highs, entering a short-term adjustment phase with momentum clearly weakening; short-term moving averages have turned downward, and prices have broken below some short-term support levels, indicating bearish dominance. Support below is seen at the 207.00 level, with further support around 205.80.\nResistance above is observed at the 208.50 and 210.00 regions. The RSI has retreated from its highs but has not yet entered oversold territory, suggesting that downside potential has not been fully exhausted. A bearish crossover in the MACD at higher levels is beginning to emerge, enhancing bearish momentum. Technically, GBP/JPY shows a short-term bearish bias, and if the 207.00 level is breached, further downside may open up.\nEditor\u2019s View:\nAmid rising expectations for a Bank of Japan rate hike and almost certain anticipation of a Bank of England rate cut, the policy divergence is clearly bearish for GBP/JPY. In the short term, if the BoJ raises rates as expected and the BoE releases a more dovish signal, GBP/JPY could potentially fall further to the 206 or even the 205 region.\nClose attention should be paid to the volatility risks brought about by the outcomes of the two central bank meetings this week and the UK employment data."

                "body": "Why bitcoin ETFs look like they\u2019re falling short, even as their role grows: Asia Morning Briefing\nWhat looks like underperformance reflects a structural shift: ETF flows now smooth volatility rather than amplify crypto rallies.\nWhat to know:\n- Bitcoin ETFs are unlikely to surpass last year's inflow record, with traders assigning only a 2% chance of beating it in 2025.\n- Despite a gap in ETF inflows, they continue to play a stabilizing role in the market, absorbing risk rather than amplifying price swings.\n- Bitcoin has been consolidating around $87,000 to $88,000, performing better than the broader crypto market, while Ether has underperformed.\nGood Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets:\nWelcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\nWith just two weeks left in the year and many desks in Hong Kong operating with a skeleton staff after Friday\u2019s Asia session as the Christmas holidays begin, crypto markets are shifting from momentum to scorekeeping. One of the starkest year-end verdicts is coming from Polymarket, where traders now assign only a 2% chance that bitcoin ETFs will beat last year\u2019s inflow record in 2025.\nThe bet rests on a simple arithmetic problem. Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $33.6B in net inflows during 2024. This year\u2019s tally as of December 15 U.S. time stands closer to $22.5B, according to SoSoValue, leaving a gap of roughly $11B with only days of meaningful trading left.\nYet the last week has shown ETF inflows returning even as prices softened and altcoins lagged, suggesting that while the $33.6B target may be out of reach, the structural role of ETFs in absorbing risk is still strengthening as the year closes.\nGlassnode data shows that U.S. spot bitcoin ETF flows flipping back into positive territory even as prices pulled back from $94,000, where it was trading yesterday, and spot market conditions weakened, with net inflows rebounding to about $290 million on the week after prior outflows.\nAt the same time, Glassnode writes that ETF trading volumes declined, suggesting less speculative churn and more allocation-driven positioning. That pattern helps explain why bitcoin has held up better than the CoinDesk 20, a broad index, with ETFs increasingly acting as a stabilizing channel when risk comes from higher-beta assets rather than as a vehicle purely for chasing upside.\nThe $11B gap to last year\u2019s $33.6B record reflects how the ETF story has shifted, not that it has stalled.\nUnlike 2024\u2019s launch year, which was driven by pent-up demand and one-time allocations, 2025 has been shaped by rotation, fee migration, and volatility-driven rebalancing.\nThe arithmetic may already be settled, but beating a benchmark before the end of the year isn't as important. It's about the use case: ETFs no longer amplify crypto prices, as they did when they launched in 2024.\nInstead, they are increasingly acting as a stabilizing layer in the market, absorbing sell orders during pullbacks rather than amplifying price swings. That's the sign of mature market infrastructure.\nMarket Movement\nBTC: Bitcoin has spent the past week consolidating after failing near $94,000, drifting back toward the $87,000 to $88,000 range while holding up better than the broader crypto market.\nETH: Ether has underperformed over the past week, sliding toward the $2,950 to $3,000 range as selling pressure in higher beta assets intensified and rotation favored bitcoin.\nGold: Gold climbed above $4,300 after the New York Fed\u2019s Empire State Manufacturing Survey unexpectedly fell into contraction in December, boosting safe-haven demand as U.S. manufacturing volatility resurfaced.\nNikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Tuesday, tracking Wall Street\u2019s decline as investors rotated out of the U.S. AI trade, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 down 1.14% and the Topix slipping 1.05%.\nElsewhere in Crypto:\n"

                "body": "Early on Monday, the supply of new cryptocurrency tied to Bittensor\u2014a decentralized network of AI projects\u2014dropped by half. The halving was the first the currency has experienced and came about by design, reflecting how Bittensor shares the same anti-inflationary architecture as Bitcoin. The event also serves a milestone for one of the most novel and ambitious cryptocurrencies to launch in years.\nCurrently, Bittensor has a market capitalization of $2.7 billion, according to the crypto analytics site CoinGecko. That pales in comparison to Bitcoin but is number 50 on the list of most popular cryptocurrencies. It also enjoys the backing of influential crypto billionaire Barry Silbert. At a time when AI is dominating the economy and the political discourse, Bittensor offers the promise of a decentralized alternative to Big Tech\u2014provided it can keep picking up traction in the crypto world and beyond, and if its price holds up following the new drop in supply.\nHere\u2019s an overview of exactly what Bittensor is, who\u2019s betting on its success, and what some crypto prognosticators say will come next after its halving:\nWhat is Bittensor?\nFounded by Jacob Steeves, a former Google engineer, in 2019, Bittensor is designed to repurpose the mechanics of Bitcoin for AI. In the world of Bitcoin, owners of fleets of computer servers leverage their processing power to process and secure cryptocurrency transactions. This is called Bitcoin mining.\nSimilarly, Steeves devised a system where fleets of computers compete to process AI computations. In exchange for their processing power, these \u201cminers\u201d receive Bittensor\u2019s cryptocurrency, TAO. In aggregate, Bittensor is like a decentralized server farm for AI. \u201cHow did we create a supercomputer that is bigger than any government or corporation can create with a centralized entity?\u201d Steeves said to Fortune in 2024.\nWho\u2019s betting on Bittensor?\nBittensor isn\u2019t the most easily understood tech, but the protocol has had some serious backers. In 2024, the crypto venture capitalist Polychain held around $200 million of the cryptocurrency, another crypto VC Dao5 held $50 million, and the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group had around $100 million\nBarry Silbert, the billionaire founder of Digital Currency Group, is such a believer in Bittensor that he\u2019s founded his own startup called Yuma that\u2019s dedicated to the cryptocurrency. \u201cIt is the thing that I\u2019ve gotten most excited about since Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\nWhen did Bittensor halve and what will come next?\nOn Monday at 8:30 a.m. New York time, Bittensor reduced the amount of daily tokens it issues from 7,200 to 3,600. Like Bitcoin, the supply of Bittensor\u2019s cryptocurrency is capped at 21 million.\nIn a research note, analysts at Grayscale, a crypto ETF issuer and a subsidiary of Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group, said that the halving could be a \u201cpositive catalyst for price.\u201d Just a week before, the ETF issuer announced that trading in the U.S. had begun for a vehicle that gives investors exposure to Bittensor.\nSami Kassab, managing partner at Unsupervised Capital, a hedge fund dedicated to Bittensor, was similarly optimistic. \u201cHalvings aren\u2019t complicated. Historically, halvings have been bullish because there\u2019s simply less inventory hitting the market, \u201c he said. \u201cThe same logic applies to TAO.\u201d\nStill, over the past 24 hours, the price of Bittensor\u2019s cryptocurrency has dropped about 5.5% to $272. That doesn\u2019t mean the halving was a bust since the market often prices in such events ahead of time and, in the case Bitcoin, has often spurred subsequent booms. When Bitcoin last halved in April 2024, its price hovered around $65,000 shortly afterwards. But, by the end of the year, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency had rocketed to above $100,000.\nThis is Bittensor\u2019s first halving. Its next will follow in late 2029, according to current projections."

The pullback coincides with continued pressure on miner revenues, with hash price hovering near $37 per petahash per second, roughly a five year low.\nBitcoin mining difficulty is currently projected to decline by roughly 3%, offering temporary relief to miner revenues.

It introduced programmable money, anchored the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, and serves as the primary venue for the world\u2019s most secure smart contracts.\nBy legacy measures, its dominance is undisputed because it holds the deepest developer ecosystem, the largest pool of locked capital, and plays a central role in the settlement of regulated stablecoins.\nHowever, technological irrelevance rarely arrives as a sudden collapse. It creeps in quietly, masked by metrics that describe where the market has been rather than where it is going.\nThe phrase \u201cwe still have TVL\u201d (Total Value Locked) has become shorthand for this tension among Ethereum insiders. While TVL historically defined success, it increasingly measures assets that are parked as collateral rather than capital in motion.\nThe concern now emerging is that the ecosystem is leaning on these legacy metrics while the actual velocity of money shifts elsewhere. Whether that distinction matters by 2030 is now the industry's central question.\nThe data divergence\nThe \u201cflippening\u201d narrative has returned, but this time it is driven by activity rather than market cap. The data paints a stark picture of divergence.\nAccording to Nansen, Ethereum\u2019s annualized revenue has dropped roughly 76% year over year to about $604 million.\nThe decline follows the network\u2019s Dencun and Fusaka upgrade, which sharply reduced fees paid by Layer 2 networks.\nIn contrast, Solana generated approximately $657 million over the same period, while TRON captured nearly $601 million, driven almost entirely by stablecoin velocity in emerging markets.\nThe split is even sharper when viewed through the lens of Artemis data, which captures user behavior rather than just capital depth. In 2025, Solana processed roughly 98 million monthly active users and 34 billion transactions, exceeding Ethereum across almost every high-frequency category.\nAlex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen, notes that dismissing these metrics fosters dangerous complacency. He has warned that Ethereum \u201cneeds to be paranoid\u201d about unfavorable data even if TVL remains high.\nIn his view, the challenge is not just competition, but also the temptation to defend leadership by using indicators that become less relevant as crypto\u2019s primary use cases shift.\nHowever, a critical examination requires nuance. While the Artemis numbers show Solana winning the \u201cvolume war,\u201d Ethereum is fighting a different battle: the war for Economic Density.\nA significant portion of Solana\u2019s 34 billion transactions consists of arbitrage bots and consensus messages. This activity generates substantial volume but arguably delivers less economic value per byte than Ethereum\u2019s higher-stakes settlement flows.\nAs a result, the market is effectively bifurcating, with Solana becoming the \u201cNASDAQ\u201d of high-velocity execution, while Ethereum remains the \u201cFedWire\u201d of final settlement.\nThe crisis of urgency\nYet, explaining away the competition as \u201cspam\u201d risks missing the deeper cultural shift.

                "body": "Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF Stands Up To Crypto Crash\nCrypto markets had a day of reckoning to close out last week with Ethereum (Crypto:ETH), the decentralized powerhouse fueling DeFi and NFTs, endured a savage blow in the crypto market's worst 24 hours on record. Friday's $19 billion liquidation cascade\u2014nine times February's wipeout and 19 times the FTX collapse\u2014ignited by President Trump's tariff threats on Chinese imports, ravaged risk assets. ETH cratered over 10% from its peak, hitting a low of $3,750.\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:ETH), a low-cost (0.15% expense ratio) conduit for Ether exposure, echoed the turmoil: shares plunged to $36.72 and currently trading up slightly at $38.29. Year-to-date the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF is up 17.66%, making it a more stable play on ETH.\nThe Leverage Trap That Snared ETH\nLeverage fueled the frenzy with a 10% ETH drop on 10x longs, leaving those holding those positions with complete loses . Platforms saw 1.6 million margin calls in hours, 88% from 100x bets. ETH's DeFi edge amplified agony\u2014yield chasers in lending pools triggered smart contract liquidations of billions in wrapped assets at $3,500. Post-crash, flows shifted to Bitcoin for safety.\nAmid $428.52 million in ETH ETF outflows, flagship ETHE lost $20.99 million Monday\u2014yet the Mini Trust gained $11.75 million weekly, boosting assets to $1.53 billion. Grayscale's staking of 300,000+ ETH injected $150 million into proof-of-stake, unlocking 4%+ yields for holders sans node hassles. With 2025 spot inflows at $14.48 billion pre-dip, institutions eye this as a fear-buy opportunity.\nAdvertisement\nCould Crypto Winter Freeze Out ETH?\nTrading desks are in full defense mode right now. Traders are loading up on hedges\u2014bets to protect against more drops\u2014just like in 2022, when ETH plunged 80% in a grueling two-year bear market that tested everyone's nerves. But history shows a brighter side: ETH bounced back strong, thanks to major upgrades like the Merge (Ethereum's 2022 shift to energy-saving proof-of-stake) and Dencun (the 2024 fee-slashing scalability boost). These changes didn't just fix issues\u2014they drove massive adoption in DeFi and beyond. That's why the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF stands out: Its low 0.15% fees and 4%+ staking yields make it tough enough to survive any winter.\nWant Up To $1,000?

                "body": "DeFiLlama: Crypto Correlations Hit Record Highs as BTC-SOL Reaches 0.99\nAnalytics platform DefiLlama has reported an elevated degree of price synchronization among leading cryptocurrencies.\nOver the past week, several major trading pairs showed correlation coefficients above 0.9, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) moving almost perfectly in sync at 0.99, suggesting a market in unison, with broad sentiment overriding individual asset stories.\nCorrelation Spike Highlights Bitcoin\u2019s Grip on the Market\nDefiLlama described the correlations between the largest tokens as being \u201cunusually high\u201d over the past week, a period marked by weak momentum across the market and repeated failures by Bitcoin to reclaim the $90,000 level.\nData shared on X shows BTC posting strong alignment with Ethereum (ETH) at 0.89, XRP at 0.86, Cardano (ADA) at 0.86, and Dogecoin (DOGE) at 0.87, while its link with Solana stood out at 0.99, the highest reading in the set.\nThat BTC\u2013SOL figure suggests near-identical price movement, an uncommon pattern for an asset often treated as a high-beta trade relative to Bitcoin. Ethereum also showed broad alignment, with correlations of 0.95 against ADA, 0.93 against SOL, and 0.92 versus DOGE, making it the most consistently connected token across the group.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, BNB appeared the most detached from the rest of the market. Its correlation with Bitcoin was just 0.27, while links with XRP and SOL sat at 0.28 and 0.32, respectively. According to analysts, the data may suggest that BNB traders could be reacting more to chain-specific flows and exchange-related factors than to broader market moves.\nAgainst this backdrop, BTC was trading at just under $90,000 at the time of writing, down about 2% over seven days, according to CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, Ethereum was hovering near $3,100, up by a marginal 0.6% in the last 24 hours, but completely flat across seven days, while XRP slipped about 4%, and Solana lost close to 3% in the same period.\nYou may also like:\n- Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) Get a Big Boost as CME Group Rolls Out New Offerings\n- This Fractal Chart Pattern Could Send ETH Back to $2,500: Analyst\n- Bitcoin Hovers at \u2018Critical\u2019 Support Level as Analysts Debate Next Move\nWhat High Correlations Mean for Traders and Altcoins\nPeriods of elevated correlation often appear when uncertainty is high, and liquidity tightens. With Bitcoin dominance near 57% and total market value falling toward $3.15 trillion, traders appear more focused on macro signals and U.S. monetary policy than on token-specific stories.\nThat dynamic can mute the impact of otherwise bullish developments. XRP, for example, has seen large holders increase buying activity and taker demand turn buyer-heavy, according to a recent CryptoQuant report. Yet the token continues to trade near $2.00, tracking Bitcoin\u2019s hesitations rather than its own on-chain signals.\nEthereum is also showing a similar pattern, with analysts recently highlighting support holding near $3,000 and early signs of renewed ETF inflows. However, the asset is still struggling to break away from Bitcoin\u2019s range-bound trading, and until correlations ease, such setups may struggle to play out independently."

                "body": "London stocks head into the week of 15\u201319 December 2025 with one macro theme dominating everything else: the Bank of England\u2019s December decision. After a week defined by a US rate cut, a surprise dip in UK GDP, and a late-week wobble tied to \u201cAI bubble\u201d nerves on Wall Street, the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 now turn to a dense UK data run\u2014labour market, inflation, and retail sales\u2014plus a short but potentially market-moving corporate diary (including Currys, Bunzl, Hollywood Bowl, IntegraFin, and WH Smith). [1]\nWhat happened last week in UK equities (8\u201312 December) \u2014 and why it matters now\nThe tone for the \u201cweek ahead\u201d was set by how quickly sentiment swung between rates optimism and risk-off anxiety.\nMonday (8 Dec): Central banks and the consumer set the mood\nUK shares slipped as investors braced for the Federal Reserve and Bank of England decisions, with housebuildersamong the biggest laggards and Unilever weaker as the Magnum Ice Cream unit moved toward an Amsterdam listing as part of its separation. The same session also carried a reminder that the UK consumer remains under pressure\u2014Aldi\u2019s UK boss pointed to shoppers spreading the cost of Christmas by buying earlier and switching from meals out to dining in. [2]\nTuesday (9 Dec): Defence and metals up; consumer signals downbeat\nLondon\u2019s blue chips finished essentially flat, supported by precious metals miners and defence names. BAE Systems rose after a report suggested German lawmakers were set to approve record defence contracts, while Barclays\u2019 card spending data highlighted a weak consumer backdrop. [3]\nWednesday (10 Dec): Banks take the lead ahead of the Fed\nThe FTSE 100 edged up with banks outperforming, helped by broker upgrades to lenders including HSBC and Standard Chartered. Outside the banks, the session also delivered stock-specific moves in FirstGroup (linked to a London Overground contract) and Evoke (strategic options review). [4]\nThursday (11 Dec): Fed cut lands; UK stocks rise but \u201cAI angst\u201d flickers\nUK equities rose after the Fed cut rates by 25bp. Even with Wall Street wobbling on concerns about big-ticket AI investment, London saw strength in precious metal miners and selected UK names on upgrades and idiosyncratic news (including a notable drop in Ceres Power after a short position was disclosed). [5]\nFriday (12 Dec): UK GDP disappoints, miners jump\u2014then Wall Street spoils the party\nFriday encapsulated the current market tension: UK stocks were initially buoyed by a surge in precious metal miners as gold and silver rallied, but the FTSE 100 ultimately closed lower as a Wall Street selloff\u2014sparked by renewed worries about frothy AI expectations\u2014hit risk appetite. The same day, UK-focused headlines mattered: UK GDP data showed the economy unexpectedly shrunk in the three months to October, reinforcing expectations of a BoE cut, while Card Factory issued a warning tied to weaker-than-expected store sales and concerns over footfall. [6]\nThe big catalyst: Bank of England decision on 18 December\nWhat markets are expecting\nThe Bank of England\u2019s next Monetary Policy Committee decision is due Thursday, 18 December, with the policy summary and minutes scheduled for 12:00 noon UK time. [7]\nAcross the coverage from 8\u201313 December, the consensus hardened:\n- A 25bp cut to 3.75% is widely expected, according to a Reuters poll of economists. [8]\n- Market pricing during the week repeatedly clustered around high odds of a December cut (figures cited ranged from the mid\u201180s to around 90%, depending on the day and source). [9]\nThis expectation is anchored in three signals repeatedly cited by strategists and reporters:\n- Cooling activity (underscored by the weak GDP print), [10]\n- Signs of labour-market softening, [11]\n- Disinflation progress\u2014even if inflation remains above target. [12]\nWhy the BoE decision could still surprise markets\nEven when a cut is \u201cpriced,\u201d the vote split and guidance can be the real market mover.\n- The BoE\u2019s November decision was narrowly balanced (a tight v"

                "body": "FTSE 100 makes headway ahead of likely Bank of England rate cut\nThe FTSE 100 index closed up 102.28 points, 1.1%, at 9,751.31.\nThe FTSE 100 marched higher on Monday, ahead of a raft of key economic data and an expected interest rate cut by the Bank of England later this week.\nThe FTSE 100 index closed up 102.28 points, 1.1%, at 9,751.31. The FTSE 250 ended 172.61 points higher, 0.8%, at 22,049.16, but the AIM All-Share ended down 2.13 points, 0.3%, at 749.23.\nIn Europe, the Cac 40 in Paris closed up 0.7%, while the Dax 40 in Frankfurt ended 0.2% higher.\nThis week\u2019s schedule includes central bank decisions in the UK, Europe and Japan \u2013 plus inflation and retail sales prints in the US and the UK.\nIn addition, Tuesday brings US non-farm payrolls data for October and November.\nJoshua Mahony, at Scope Markets, said: \u201cDespite the fact that we have such an incredibly busy week up ahead, traders are taking a largely positive tone, with the Fed\u2019s rate cut meaning that the jobs report and inflation data will have less of an immediate impact on monetary policy.\n\u201cMeanwhile, the elevated levels of market confidence around both the Bank of England\u2019s rate cut and the Bank of Japan\u2019s hike, does alleviate much of the risk that we see any major unexpected hurdles for traders to navigate.\u201d\nThe pound was quoted higher at 1.3390 dollars at the time of the London equities close on Monday, compared to 1.3356 on Friday.\nLooking ahead to the BoE rate call, Tom Stevenson, of Fidelity International, said: \u201cThe conventional wisdom is that rates will fall by a quarter percentage point on Thursday to 3.75%, with swaps markets pricing in a 90% chance of a cut.\n\u201cIt would be the sixth rate cut since the Bank started cutting in the summer of 2024.\n\u201cBut the decision remains a close call, and it is possible that Bank governor Andrew Bailey will be forced to use his casting vote this week.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cInterest rates are thought to be approaching the so-called \u2018neutral rate\u2019 at which they neither stimulate nor constrain the economy and that has caused a roughly even split on the monetary policy committee between members who think rates should fall further to boost growth and those who think caution should be the watchword until it is clear that inflation is under control.\u201d\nStocks in New York were little changed at the time of the London equity close on Monday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1%, as was the Nasdaq Composite, while the S&P 500 index was 0.1% higher.\nThe yield on the US 10-year Treasury was quoted at 4.17%, trimmed from 4.19% on Friday. The yield on the US 30-year Treasury was at 4.83%, narrowed from 4.86%.\nMorgan Stanley said this week\u2019s US jobs data could be more important for equities\u2019 perception of interest rate policy going forward than last week\u2019s FOMC meeting.\n\u201cWith the equity return/interest rate correlation falling deeper into negative territory last week, we are now firmly back in a good is bad/bad is good regime. This implies that moderate labour market weakness is likely to be viewed in a bullish context by equity markets,\u201d the bank commented.\nMeanwhile, New York Federal Reserve president John Williams said the US economy appears to be \u201cturning the corner\u201d after a year dominated by uncertainty, with solid growth expected in 2026.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s striking is that despite all the uncertainty, the US economy has shown considerable resilience and looks poised to pick up steam next year,\u201d Mr Williams added.\nOn the FTSE 100, gains were led by financials, with Prudential up 3.2%, Hiscox up 3.0%, Barclays up 2.2% and NatWest up 3.0%.\nHaleon gained 2.9% as Morgan Stanley named it \u201ctop pick\u201d in the Home & Personal Care sector.\nHaving lagged in 2025, Haleon looks set to accelerate organic sales growth in 2026 as it laps US destocking, in the broker\u2019s view.\nMarks & Spencer, up 2.0%, was named as Jefferies\u2019 favoured UK retailer.\nThe broker is cautious on consumer sentiment generally, with M&S its only \u201cbuy\u201d rating in the retail sector.\nReflecting "

                "body": "London\u2019s stock market begins the new week with a familiar late\u20112025 mix: a tentative bounce in futures, heavy macro catalysts on the calendar, and a global risk backdrop still unsettled by tech volatility and China demand worries.\nEarly indications suggest the FTSE 100 will try to recover some lost ground after finishing last week lower, but investors are unlikely to place big bets ahead of a potential Bank of England (BoE) rate cut and a packed run of UK data releases that could reshape expectations for 2026. [1]\nUK stock market snapshot: What the FTSE 100 is signalling this morning\nThe FTSE 100 ended Friday at 9,649.03, and early trading signals point to a firmer open: futures implied a gain of roughly 0.4% (about 33\u201334 points) to around 9,683. Sterling was also slightly higher early Monday, quoted near $1.3368. [2]\nThat opening bid matters because it speaks to how investors are positioning for a week dominated by central\u2011bank decisions\u2014especially the BoE\u2014after a shaky finish to last week across global equities, led by weakness in US tech. [3]\nThe main driver: Bank of England decision risk is dominating UK market positioning\nThe biggest story hanging over UK equities today is Thursday\u2019s Bank of England decision, where markets and many economists expect a 25 basis\u2011point cut that would bring Bank Rate down from 4.0% to 3.75%. Crucially, Reuters reports the decision could be extremely close\u2014potentially a 5\u20134 vote\u2014with Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s stance seen as pivotal. [4]\nWhy it matters for the UK stock market today:\n- Rate-sensitive sectors (housebuilders, retailers, some industrials) often respond positively to lower rate expectations.\n- UK banks can react in both directions: lower rates can support loan demand and reduce impairment risk, but can also compress net interest margins.\n- For global earners that dominate the FTSE 100, the rate outlook matters via sterling\u2014a weaker pound typically flatters overseas earnings when translated back into GBP.\nMarket pricing reflected growing confidence in a cut: investors were assigning around a 90% probability to a December move, according to Reuters reporting on expectations ahead of the meeting. [5]\nThe UK macro backdrop: Weak growth data keeps \u201csoft landing\u201d hopes under pressure\nThe \u201cwhy now?\u201d for a potential BoE cut is increasingly tied to the growth picture.\nRecent UK activity data has been fragile, and market commentary on Monday continued to underline the risk that the economy is losing momentum into year\u2011end. City AM highlighted that the UK economy contracted by 0.1% in October, with weakness across production and construction and flat services output\u2014evidence that the recovery remains uneven.\nThis matters for equities because it shifts the centre of gravity from \u201chigher for longer\u201d rate fears toward a more complicated debate: is slower growth good (rates fall) or bad (profits fall)? The answer often varies by index:\n- The FTSE 100 is more international and commodity\u2011heavy, so it can sometimes prove resilient even when domestic UK data deteriorates.\n- The FTSE 250 tends to be more UK\u2011exposed and can be more sensitive to the outlook for consumer spending, housing activity, and business investment.\nGlobal risk tone: US tech jitters and Asia weakness are still in the frame\nEven if the UK\u2019s domestic story is driving the week\u2019s main catalyst, London can\u2019t ignore the global mood.\nOvernight and into Monday morning, investors were still reacting to sharp moves in the US at the end of last week, when the Nasdaq fell around 1.7% and broader US indices also slipped. Asian equities opened the week weaker, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei down about 1.3% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng down around 1.2%\u20131.5% in early trading, according to market updates. [6]\nFor UK investors, this matters in two practical ways:\n- Risk-off sessions tend to hit cyclicals and high\u2011beta shares harder, even in London.\n- Weakness tied to China demand concerns can filter quickly into FTSE miners and other commodity-linked names.\nCommod"

Most analysts, including Bank of America Global Research, expect policymakers to hold rates steady and emphasize cautious optimism about the region\u2019s economic progress. Recent data backs up that resilience: Eurostat recorded eurozone industrial production up 0.8% in October from the prior month and 2% over the year, with gains across sectors. In Germany, wholesale selling prices rose 1.5% over the past year, fueled by stronger prices in food, metals, and industrial goods. And while some companies, like TKMS, drew upbeat outlooks from analysts, their shares\u2014and those of Continental\u2014still finished lower, showing investors are weighing upbeat forecasts against broader economic concerns.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Central bank signals steer the mood.\nWith the ECB poised to keep rates unchanged, investors are staying on the sidelines. The DAX's small gain signals a wait-and-see approach, as traders look for hints from ECB officials about future rate moves. Manufacturing and price data hint at stability for now, but sector-specific drops\u2014like TKMS and Continental\u2014suggest caution isn\u2019t going away just yet.\nThe bigger picture: A cautious path forward for Europe.\nEurope\u2019s uptick in industrial output and steady pricing are encouraging signs for a slowly recovering economy. Still, the ECB\u2019s decisions will help define the business and policy outlook into 2025. Unsettled inflation and ongoing global risks mean policymakers will play a key role in shaping how durable Europe\u2019s rebound\u2014and its financial markets\u2014really are.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "LPL Financial Holdings (NASDAQ:LPLA) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last five years\nThe most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) stock is up an impressive 269% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 13% in about a quarter.\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring five years of share price growth, LPL Financial Holdings achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 30% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on LPL Financial Holdings' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\nWhat About Dividends?\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for LPL Financial Holdings the TSR over the last 5 years was 279%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"

                "source": "Markets Financial Content",
                "url": "https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-12-15-nasdaq-surges-on-ai-enthusiasm-and-dovish-fed-signals-propelling-tech-sector-to-new-heights",
                "body": "The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQ) has recently experienced a period of remarkable upward momentum, finding powerful catalysts in the burgeoning Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution and a supportive shift in Federal Reserve monetary policy. This decisive move has propelled the broader tech sector to unprecedented valuations, signaling a new era of growth driven by technological innovation and easing financial conditions. While recent volatility has introduced a degree of caution, the underlying drivers have laid a strong foundation for a sustained bullish outlook for many technology companies, reshaping market expectations and investment strategies.\nThe Dual Engines of Growth: AI Boom and Accommodative Fed Policy\nThe recent surge in the Nasdaq Composite can be primarily attributed to a powerful confluence of two major factors: the insatiable demand and transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence, and the Federal Reserve's pivot towards more accommodative monetary policy. Throughout 2024 and much of 2025, the anticipation of widespread AI adoption across industries has firmly cemented its position as the preeminent growth driver. Major technology players have significantly ramped up capital expenditure on generative AI infrastructure, with estimates suggesting approximately $200 billion in 2025, including over $90 billion in incremental spending dedicated to expanding generative AI capabilities in 2024-2025. This massive investment has, in turn, fueled an unprecedented demand for high-performance semiconductors, benefiting chipmakers immensely.\nThe impact of AI was particularly evident in the Nasdaq's performance. The index recorded its best quarter between 2021 and 2025 in Q2 2025, returning a robust 18.3%, followed by an 11.24% performance in Q3 2025. This remarkable growth was largely spearheaded by the \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2013 a select group of large technology stocks heavily invested in AI, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). These companies significantly outpaced broader market performance, with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surging by 36.39%, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) by 24.97%, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) by 21.22% year-to-date as of November 18, 2025, all on the back of continuous AI innovations and strong earnings.\nComplementing the AI boom, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions provided crucial tailwinds. Expectations and actual implementations of rate cuts have consistently offered upward momentum for the Nasdaq, as lower borrowing costs typically favor growth-oriented technology companies. The Fed initiated its rate-cutting cycle in September 2024, continuing with cuts in November and December 2024, totaling 0.50% in Q4 2024. More recently, on December 10, 2025, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, a move largely anticipated by financial markets. This decision, coupled with an upgraded economic outlook and a neutral stance for 2026, further bolstered investor confidence. The week of November 24-28, 2025, saw the Nasdaq Composite surge 4.91% due to escalating expectations of a December Fed easing, combined with favorable quarterly earnings reports. Following the December 10th rate cut, the Nasdaq closed up 0.3%, maintaining its long-term bullish trend and edging closer to historical peaks.\nCompanies Riding the AI Wave and Those Facing Headwinds\nThe AI-driven rally has created clear winners and losers within the technology landscape. Companies at the forefront of AI development and infrastructure are experiencing unprecedented growth. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the dominant player in AI chips, continues to be a primary beneficiary, with its GPUs being essential for training and deploying large language models. Other semiconductor giants like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ: "

                "body": "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Melvin Council Jr. hadn't hit much of anything from behind the arc this season for No. 19 Kansas. So NC State was more than willing to let him keep trying Saturday.\nOnly, Council responded with a performance that his Hall of Fame coach could only describe as \"unbelievable.\"\nThe 6-foot-4 senior had career highs of 36 points and nine 3-pointers, and the Jayhawks needed every bit of it to hold off the Wolfpack 77-76 in overtime - particularly with freshman star Darryn Peterson exiting late in regulation with lingering hamstring trouble.\n\"We had one guy that was probably the best performer that I think that I've had on the road in my 23 years at Kansas,\" coach Bill Self said. \"He was unbelievable. Made hard shots. They dared him to shoot, and then when he made a couple, he started looking at a big basket.\n\"I'm happy for our team, but especially happy for him because he put us on his back tonight.\"\nBut beyond the scoring, the stunning part of Saturday's performance was how he did it - by time and time again hitting from 3-point range.\nCouncil had made just 27.3% of his 3-pointers in Division I since leaving the junior-college ranks before the 2023-24 season. That included missing his first 10 3s of the season for Kansas and sitting at 5 of 27 (18.5%) entering Saturday.\nThe Wolfpack knew that, with first-year coach Will Wade and his staff being heavy into analytics and opting to flat-out leave Council largely unguarded on the wings to start this game. And it was nothing new to Council, who said he had even gotten a pep talk from former KU star Mario Chalmers - who hit the unforgettable 3-pointer to force overtime in the Jayhawks' 2008 NCAA championship win against Memphis - in recent weeks.\n\"You know, my scout team will do that to me in practice,\" Council said. \"My guys and coaches are just telling me just to be confident in your shot and just take it. ... (Chalmers) was telling me: 'Be aggressive, shoot the ball.'\"\nHe made his first 3 just 2 1/2 minutes into the game, made another about three minutes later and had four made 3s in the first 15 minutes, matching his career high for any game in the Division I ranks.\nWade said the Wolfpack adjusted their approach to defend him more aggressively. But the damage was done, with Council building confidence on the way to having a game that Wade said would have Council \"telling his grandkids about that one.\"\n\"We adjusted after he hit the third 3, but he was in rhythm and got going,\" Wade said, adding later: \"You look at everything when somebody scores 36 on you.\"\nCouncil scored the last 13 points of regulation for Kansas, including three 3s. That proved vital considering Peterson checked out abruptly with 2:15 left in regulation; the top-flight NBA prospect had recently returned from missing seven straight games due to a hamstring strain and Self said afterward Peterson was dealing with tightness.\nCouncil later exploited a soft switch early in overtime to launch a 3 off the dribble - N.C. State's Tre Holloman had gone under the screen and teammate Darrion Williams tried to recover from near the elbow as Council made the gather - to bury a 3 and push Kansas to a 69-68 lead.\nHe eventually fed big man Flory Bidunga's dunk with 51.9 seconds left in OT to put the Jayhawks ahead for good.\nCouncil made 13 of 27 shots for the game, including 9 of 15 3-pointers, to go with seven rebounds and four assists in 43 minutes. He became only the fourth KU player since 1996-97 with at least 36 points in a road game, the last being Jalen Wilson (38 points) at Kansas State in January 2023. And his nine 3s were second-most in program history, trailing only Terry Brown's 11 - also against N.C. State - in January 1991.\n\"Man, we have a dog right here with us,\" Bidunga said, adding: \"That's a bad man right here, I'm really impressed.\""

                "body": "Future control of Washington D.C.\u2019s three municipal golf courses is in limbo amid the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to make its mark on the city\u2019s public spaces.\nSince 2020, East Potomac, Rock Creek and Langston golf courses have been operated by National Links Trust, a nonprofit seeking to renovate the courses and provide affordable, accessible public golf in the city. The organization holds a 50-year lease with the National Park Service to rehabilitate land that has long needed attention.\nAdvertisement\nThat lease is now in question.\nThe Trump administration, via the Interior Department, has issued a formal notice of default, claiming the nonprofit is in violation of the deal and openly threatening to seize control of the properties.\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Friday, President Donald Trump said National Links Trust has until the end of the month to address alleged violations of the lease, or the courses will come under the administration\u2019s control. Trump told the Journal he is uninterested in working with the group.\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re looking to do is just build something di\ufb00erent,\u201d Trump told the Journal, \u201cand build them in government.\u201d\nThe administration told the Wall Street Journal that National Links Trust isn\u2019t following a fast enough timeline for its renovation projects, and is therefore in breach of its lease agreement. But the lease\u2019s \u201cInitial Improvements\u201d section, obtained by The Athletic, states that National Links Trust\u2019s timelines are \u201cgeneral and subject to change due to compliance timeframes or other circumstances.\u201d\nWork to date has involved fundraising as well as preparing the sites, including removing invasive vegetation and some tree removal. A miniature golf course has been completed at East Potomac.\nIn a statement Friday night, National Links Trust disagreed with the assertion that it is not upholding the lease and said it\u2019s hoping to work with the administration on the projects.\n\u201cNational Links Trust appreciates the President\u2019s interest in the DC golf course and looks forward to the opportunity to partner with the administration to improve these historically significant facilities,\u201d the NLT statement said. \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the characterization that we are in default of our lease.\u201d\nAccording to a source with knowledge of communication between National Links Trust and the administration, granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, the nonprofit has presented \u201cnumerous proposals\u201d to partner with the administration in the redevelopment projects but received a \u201ctotal lack of response to that outreach.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe National Park Service and the Department of the Interior did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A message left with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was not returned.\nThe National Links Trust declined to comment beyond its statement.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s interest in Washington\u2019s public golf courses is part of a larger plan to revamp the capital\u2019s footprint, including the controversial construction of a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the now-demolished site of the East Wing.\nIn late October, following the demolition of the East Wing, truckloads of dirt and debris from the worksite were hauled to East Potomac and dumped on the course, the first sign of the administration\u2019s inroads onto the property.\nEast Potomac is believed to be at the center of Trump\u2019s attention. The 36-hole facility is the closest golf course to the White House and Capitol Hill, and sits between the Potomac River and the Washington Channel. At the heart of the property is the Blue Course, a reversible Walter Travis design dating to 1918. The course, with its history, location and clear views of the Washington Monument, has limitless potential. It is also rife with issues, including significant drainage problems and a seawall needing extensive repairs.\nSuch issues, and the exhaustive work and fundraising they require, were primary factors in t"

                "body": "Nikkei consolidates after October fireworks: Bank of Japan rate hike looms\nFollowing October\u2019s historic rally, the Nikkei 225 trades sideways ahead of the BoJ\u2019s December meeting, as markets price in a 25 bp hike and await signals on future policy direction.\nNikkei stalls after historic October rally\nThe Nikkei225 has traded largely sideways during the first half of December after snapping its seven-month winning streak in November with a decline of around 4.1%. This followed a blistering 16.64% rally in October, marking its strongest monthly performance in decades.\nOctober\u2019s rally was turbocharged by expectations of new Prime Minister (PM) Sanae Takaichi\u2019s aggressive push for expansionary and reflationary policies. Takaichi\u2019s administration wasted little time, approving a landmark stimulus package on 21 November valued at approximately \u00a521.3 trillion (around US$135 - 136 billion).\nWhile the announcement provided a temporary lift, the market had largely rallied in anticipation of the package. Upside momentum was further stalled following a hawkish speech by Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda on 1 December.\nBoJ policy signals take centre stage\nUeda struck an optimistic tone on key prerequisites for policy normalisation, making several critical points:\n- Downside risks to the United States (US) economy, one of the BoJ\u2019s focal concerns, have eased somewhat since earlier assessments\n- Momentum is improving for next year\u2019s shunto negotiations, driven by persistent labour shortages, aggressive demands from unions, and proactive wage policies from business groups like Keidanren\n- The BoJ board will weigh the \u2018pros and cons\u2019 of a hike at the upcoming December Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM), underscoring a data-dependent but increasingly proactive stance.\nThis optimistic tone was amplified by subsequent reports indicating that Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s government would not oppose a December interest rate increase, respecting the central bank\u2019s independence.\nMarkets responded swiftly: the probability of a 25 basis point (bp) hike to 0.75% now exceeds 90%, up from around 30% before Ueda\u2019s speech. With the move all but locked in, attention has shifted to the BoJ\u2019s forward guidance on the pace of future hikes and the eventual terminal rate, details that could either extend the Nikkei\u2019s bull run or introduce fresh volatility.\nWhat to watch in the BoJ\u2019s playbook\nInvestors will closely monitor Ueda\u2019s post-meeting press conference for clarity regarding the three main points below, particularly after his 1 December remarks teasing a \u2018clearer indication\u2019 of the policy rate\u2019s distance from Japan\u2019s neutral interest rate following any hike.\n- Unchanged neutral range: the BoJ is unlikely to narrow its longstanding estimate of the neutral rate (1% - 2.5%), given the wide variance across economic models, maintaining flexibility amid uncertainty.\n- Still accommodative post-hike: Ueda could affirm that even at 0.75%, the policy rate remains below the neutral band, ensuring monetary conditions stay supportive with ample room for additional tightening if needed.\n- Heightened caution ahead: as rates inch closer to neutral territory, the board will scrutinise their economic and inflationary impacts more rigorously, potentially signalling a measured, non-aggressive normalisation path to avoid derailing growth.\nA dovish-leaning script, emphasising gradualism, could reignite risk appetite and weigh on the Japanese yen, benefiting exporters and the Nikkei. Hawkish surprises, however, might strengthen the yen, squeeze corporate margins and prompt a deeper-than-expected pullback in the Nikkei.\nNikkei cash technical analysis\nThe Nikkei 225 staged an impressive rally of over 70% from its \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 low at 30792 to the early November record high of 52,636. Over the past six weeks, however, the index has entered a consolidation and corrective phase, digesting those substantial gains ahead of this week\u2019s BoJ interest rate meeting.\nIf the Nikkei were to see a "
