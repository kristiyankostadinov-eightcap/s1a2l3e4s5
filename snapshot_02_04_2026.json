                "body": "What's going on with the price of gold?\nIt's been a wild ride for the price of gold over the past few days.\nLast week, the yellow metal touched a record high above $5,500 an ounce, following a year in which its value has soared.\nBut on Friday, the gold price plummeted more than 9%, its sharpest one-day drop since 1983, before a further decline on Monday.\nA slight recovery on Tuesday saw it rise more than 5%. And, despite the recent falls, its price is still about 75% higher than it was at the same point last year.\nSo, what is going on?\nWhat triggered the recent falls?\nFinancial markets can move for a variety of reasons, but analysts seem to agree that the decision by US President Donald Trump to nominate Kevin Warsh as the head of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, was key in this case.\nWarsh is viewed by the markets as a \"very acceptable\" choice, April Larusse from Insight Investment told the BBC, amid recent worries over the independence of the Fed.\nThis boosted the value of the dollar and helped to calm investors' nerves. However, this easing of concerns was not so good for the gold price, which is seen as a safer investment in times of uncertainty.\nAnother reason cited for the slump in prices was changes to trading requirements on a major exchange, which made it more expensive for speculators to trade.\nPrices of gold and silver have soared since the start of the year, and some analysts had begun to feel the rises were overdone.\nMark Matthews, head of research for Asia at Bank Julius Baer, told Reuters that one explanation for the collapse in prices is \"simply because they had already gone parabolic in the previous week\".\n\"Once profit-taking started, it just snowballed.\"\nHowever, some believed the falls were just a blip in gold's onward march upwards. Michael Hsueh, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said \"conditions do not appear primed for a sustained reversal in gold prices\" and reiterated the bank expects the metal to reach $6,000 an ounce.\nWhy had gold been rising?\nThe price of gold has been rising slowly for the past few years but it really took off last year when it posted its biggest annual gain since 1979.\nThe precious metal is seen as the ultimate \"safe haven\" investment - providing a more secure asset in times of uncertainty.\n\"When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance,\" Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery, told the BBC.\n\"It's a really good diversifier in a very uncertain world.\"\nLast year, the key worry for investors was the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration. The \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announced by Trump in April led to months of uncertainty as negotiations continued over what level the tariffs would be set at.\nIn January, Trump's threat to impose fresh tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland, which has since been reversed, sent gold and silver to fresh record highs.\nHis trade policies continue to worry investors, helping to support the gold price, says Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nGeopolitical tensions have also added to the appeal of gold as a safer investment, and the US seizure of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in early January helped to push the gold price higher.\n\"Gold is doing what it does best when the world feels messy, jumping amid rising trade tensions, geopolitical flare-ups, political uncertainty in the US,\" Wall says.\n\"Fresh friction between the US, Canada and China, unease around Europe and the Middle East, and even shutdown risks in Washington have all added to gold's appeal.\"\nCentral bank buying\nOne factor which started to push up the price of gold before last year's surge was central banks increasing their purchases of bullion.\nThis has been a trend over the past few years, after the reserves of the Russian Central Bank wer"

Silver surged 11.96 per cent from a low of Rs 2,45,711 per kg to Rs 2,70,398. In the Delhi spot market, gold gained Rs 5000 to move up to Rs 1,57,700 per 10 gm and silver rose by Rs 24,000 to Rs 2,84,000 per kg.\nIn the international market, spot gold surged 6.8 per cent from $4633 per ounce to $4949. Silver gained 11.1 per cent from $79.13 an ounce to $87.94.\n\u201cGold prices surged, heading for their biggest daily gain since November 2008, as investors rushed to buy after one of the sharpest two-day selloffs in decades. While markets continue to assess Kevin Warsh\u2019s nomination as the next Federal Reserve chair, expectations that the Fed could still cut interest rates in 2025 have limited the US dollar\u2019s rebound from a four-year low, supporting bullion,\u201d said Kedia Commodities.\nThe dollar faces further weakness in 2026 as the Federal Reserve looks set to cut interest rates again under Fed Chair nominee Kevin Warsh, MUFG Bank\u2019s Lee Hardman was quoted by Wall Street Journal. Warsh is well respected by market participants and central bankers, which has dampened fears over threats to the Fed\u2019s independence. The Fed is still likely to cut rates. Warsh has previously criticised the Fed for not lowering rates and is likely to emphasize that higher productivity growth allows the US economy to grow more without creating inflation pressures.\nHowever, easing US-Iran tensions and the US-India trade deal have improved risk sentiment, potentially capping safe-haven demand. Adding to caution, CME Group\u2019s decision to raise margin requirements on precious metals futures could trigger fresh volatility and weigh on gold in the near term. end"

                "body": "Silver plummets after Trump taps Kevin Warsh to chair Federal Reserve\nThe price of silver plummeted Friday, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he will nominate economist Kevin Warsh to chair the Federal Reserve.\nSpot silver prices had dropped by more than 37% just before 5 p.m. ET, to around $84.63 a troy ounce. Precious metals trade nearly 24 hours a day.\nFriday\u2019s plunge put an abrupt halt to silver\u2019s red-hot run over the last 12 months. Analysts attributed the drop to investors selling their silver for high returns at what could be the end of its juggernaut.\nBut even accounting for Friday\u2019s losses, silver is still up more than 150% since this time last year.\nSpot gold prices also fell in Friday trading, although not nearly as steeply as silver. The price of gold was down around 11% shortly before 5 p.m. ET, to around $4,864 a troy ounce.\nAdvertisement\nLike silver, gold has made remarkable gains over the past year, as investors flocked to \u201csafe haven\u201d assets like precious metals as a hedge against uncertainty in financial markets and the global economy. After Friday\u2019s hit, gold was still up more than 70% over the past year.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar traded higher Friday, reversing a downward trend that gained steam on Tuesday, when the U.S. currency had its worst day since April 2025.\nThe twin dynamics on Wall Street of investors selling their safe haven metals, while pushing up the dollar, signals an increase in confidence. This is likely due in part to the popular view that Warsh would be an experienced hand at the wheel of the Fed.\nWarsh is also a longtime monetary \u201chawk\u201d who, during his time on the Fed board, generally opposed lowering interest rates as a way to turbo charge economic growth.\nWarsh has pivoted somewhat over the past year, as he carefully positioned himself in Trump\u2019s camp, criticizing the current Fed and sounding open to lowering rates.\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed slightly down Friday, investors weighed other factors, such as Friday\u2019s unexpectedly sharp rise in the Producer Price Index."

                "body": "The precious metals market experienced a seismic shock in recent weeks as silver prices plummeted dramatically, exposing deep vulnerabilities in a sector that had appeared resilient throughout years of economic uncertainty. The catalyst for this downturn traces directly to shifting expectations around Federal Reserve policy, particularly following speculation about potential leadership changes and their implications for interest rate trajectories. What began as routine market fluctuations has evolved into a full-scale reassessment of precious metals valuations, with silver bearing the brunt of investor repositioning.\nAccording to Business Insider, the silver market\u2019s recent turbulence centers on mounting concerns about Federal Reserve policy direction, with analyst George Noble highlighting how speculation surrounding potential Fed Chair nominee Kevin Warsh has triggered significant market volatility. The prospect of Warsh\u2019s appointment has raised expectations for a more hawkish monetary policy stance, fundamentally altering the calculus for precious metals investors who had positioned themselves for continued accommodative policy.\nThe divergence between silver and gold performance has become particularly pronounced, with silver experiencing outsized losses compared to its more stable precious metals counterpart. This differential reflects silver\u2019s unique position straddling both industrial and investment demand, making it more susceptible to shifts in economic growth expectations and interest rate projections. While gold has traditionally served as a pure monetary hedge, silver\u2019s industrial applications in electronics, solar panels, and other manufacturing sectors expose it to cyclical economic forces that amplify volatility during periods of policy uncertainty.\nThe Warsh Factor: Monetary Policy Expectations Reshape Market Dynamics\nKevin Warsh\u2019s potential nomination to lead the Federal Reserve has emerged as a pivotal factor driving precious metals market sentiment. Warsh, who previously served on the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, is widely regarded as favoring tighter monetary policy and expressing skepticism toward extended periods of ultra-low interest rates. His intellectual framework emphasizes price stability and financial system resilience over employment maximization, a philosophical orientation that stands in stark contrast to the accommodative policies that have characterized much of the post-financial crisis era.\nMarket participants have quickly recalibrated their expectations based on Warsh\u2019s historical policy positions and public statements. The anticipation of higher interest rates for longer periods directly undermines the investment case for non-yielding assets like silver and gold. When real interest rates rise, the opportunity cost of holding precious metals increases substantially, as investors can achieve positive returns through Treasury securities and other fixed-income instruments without assuming the storage costs and price volatility inherent in physical commodities.\nThe speed and magnitude of silver\u2019s decline underscore how heavily positioned investors had become on the assumption of continued monetary accommodation. Years of quantitative easing and near-zero interest rates had created an environment where precious metals appeared to offer both inflation protection and potential appreciation. The sudden shift in policy expectations has forced a rapid unwinding of these positions, with leveraged traders particularly vulnerable to margin calls and forced liquidations that have accelerated the downward price spiral.\nIndustrial Demand Concerns Compound Investment Headwinds\nBeyond monetary policy considerations, silver faces additional pressure from weakening industrial demand projections. The metal\u2019s extensive use in manufacturing means its price trajectory remains intimately connected to global economic growth forecasts. Recent data suggesting softening in key industrial sectors, particula"

Expectations are also high that the topic will be discussed at the G-20 energy meeting scheduled for April 10.\nSome outlets are reporting that oil prices increased as much as 12% Thursday after reports on the Saudi Arabia/ Russia deal hit the news wires. As of this writing, it was not clear if the newly brokered deal was dependent on U.S. participation.\nDiesel and gasoline prices have fallen along with oil prices, as the COVID-19 outbreak has slashed demand worldwide, while for the past month, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been embroiled in a price war centered on crude oil, refusing to cut production.\nCurrently, diesel prices are their lowest since 2017. The Energy Information Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Energy, reported earlier this week that the national average retail price of a gallon of diesel was $2.548. That's the lowest since it dropped to $2.472 per gallon in July 2017. The price of crude oil makes up about half of the price of a gallon of diesel, according to the EIA.\nU.S. total oil consumption has dropped to a 30-year low. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s Short-Term Energy Outlook for April 2020, global petroleum and liquid fuels consumption averaged 94.4 million barrels per day (BPD) in the first quarter of 2020, a drop of 5.6 million BPD from the same period in 2019. The report went on to predict that global petroleum and liquid fuels demand to decrease by 5.2 million BPD in 2020, before increasing by 6.4 million BPD in 2021.\nThe report also estimates that the COVID-19 travel restrictions and the ongoing disruptions to businesses and the overall economic will only make matters worse in the second quarter. U.S. motor gasoline consumption could fall by 1.7 million BPD from the first quarter of 2020 to an average of 7.1 million BPD in the second quarter, before gradually increasing to 8.9 million BPD in the second half of the year."

For now, though, the latest escalation isn\u2019t derailing planned talks\nEnergy \u2013 Middle East tensions linger\nOil prices are trading firmer this morning, after settling 1.55% higher yesterday. Tensions between the US and Iran have re-emerged after the US shot down an Iranian drone flying near a US aircraft carrier. In addition, Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps threatened to seize a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz. Despite these incidents, President Trump said negotiations are ongoing. The White House also said US-Iran talks are still scheduled for Friday. Uncertainty about how these talks will play out means the market will likely continue to price in some risk premium.\nIt is also worth monitoring developments in Iraq amid growing disagreement between the White House and the Iraqi government. Politicians in Iraq want to appoint Nouri Al-Malaki as the next prime minister. The US administration feels Al-Malaki is too closely aligned with Iran, which has Trump threatening diplomatic and economic consequences. Iraq is the second-largest OPEC producer, pumping a little over 4.1m b/d in December.\nThe oil market got another boost from a bullish inventory report from the American Petroleum Institute (API). The numbers show that US crude oil inventories fell by 11.1m barrels over the last week, significantly larger than the roughly 640k barrel draw the market was expecting. For refined products, gasoline inventories increased by 4.7m barrels, while distillate fuel oil stocks fell by 4.8m barrels. This reflects the impact of a recent winter storm hitting large parts of the US. It affected energy infrastructure and boosted heating demand. The more widely followed Energy Information Administration (EIA) report will be released later today. If EIA numbers show a similar drop in crude oil inventories, it would be the largest decline since June 2025.\nEU gas storage has now fallen just below 40% full, well below the 5-year average of 56%, leaving storage on track to finish the 2025/26 heating season below 2022 levels. Despite the continued tightening in storage, forecasts for milder weather have weighed on prices. The TTF settled 3.2% lower yesterday.\nMetals - Rebound across the complex\nBase metals rebounded on Tuesday, with copper leading gains after last week\u2019s sharp swings. The sell-off in gold and silver also eased, as broader market conditions stabilised and the US dollar softened.\nAfter plunging from record highs amid elevated volatility, precious metals attracted renewed buying interest. As market stress receded, both gold and silver retraced part of their earlier losses. Spot gold rose more than 6%, while silver gained around 8%.\nFor gold, the recent correction does not point to a shift in the underlying macro narrative. Safe\u2011haven demand, ongoing central\u2011bank buying, and the outlook for real rates remain supportive over the medium term. Although shorter-term dynamics triggered the latest rally, the foundation of gold\u2019s multiyear uptrend continues to rest on steady official\u2011sector accumulation. This trend began in 2022 following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Although central bank purchases moderated slightly last year, institutions remain significant net buyers.\nCopper prices gained after a state-backed industry group called for China to increase its strategic copper reserves. LME copper rebounded strongly, rising almost 5%, after an 11% plunge from last Thursday\u2019s record high to Monday\u2019s close. The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association urged authorities to expand reserve capacity and coordinate with major state-owned producers to bolster commercial stockpiles.\nThe latest Commitment of Traders report shows the net long in LME copper fell by 11,323 lots to 35,980 lots for the week ending 30 January -- the lowest since 27 October 2023.

The analysis includes country-level breakdowns for consumption, production, imports, exports, and price trends from 2013 to 2024.\nKey Findings\n- Market forecast to grow at +1.7% CAGR in volume to 4.7M tons by 2035, and +3.8% CAGR in value to $8.2B\n- Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia are the top three consuming countries, accounting for 62% of total volume in 2024\n- Turkey is the dominant producer and exporter, responsible for 43% of regional production and 94% of exports\n- Import prices fell significantly to $1,238 per ton in 2024, a decrease of 18.8% from the previous year\n- Jordan recorded the highest consumption growth rate among major markets with a CAGR of +4.8% from 2013 to 2024\nMarket Forecast\nDriven by increasing demand for refined sunflower-seed or safflower oil in the Middle East, the market is expected to continue an upward consumption trend over the next decade. Market performance is forecast to retain its current trend pattern, expanding with an anticipated CAGR of +1.7% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market volume to 4.7M tons by the end of 2035.\nIn value terms, the market is forecast to increase with an anticipated CAGR of +3.8% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market value to $8.2B (in nominal wholesale prices) by the end of 2035.\nConsumption\nMiddle East's Consumption of Refined Sunflower-Seed Or Safflower Oil\nIn 2024, the amount of refined sunflower-seed or safflower oil consumed in the Middle East amounted to 3.9M tons, approximately reflecting 2023. The total consumption volume increased at an average annual rate of +2.0% from 2013 to 2024; the trend pattern remained consistent, with somewhat noticeable fluctuations being observed throughout the analyzed period. The growth pace was the most rapid in 2019 when the consumption volume increased by 7.7% against the previous year. Over the period under review, consumption hit record highs at 4M tons in 2022; however, from 2023 to 2024, consumption stood at a somewhat lower figure.\nThe revenue of the market for refined sunflower-seed or safflower oil in the Middle East fell to $5.5B in 2024, shrinking by -2.7% against the previous year. This figure reflects the total revenues of producers and importers (excluding logistics costs, retail marketing costs, and retailers' margins, which will be included in the final consumer price). In general, consumption continues to indicate a slight expansion. As a result, consumption reached the peak level of $17.6B. From 2021 to 2024, the growth of the market remained at a somewhat lower figure.\nConsumption By Country\nThe countries with the highest volumes of consumption in 2024 were Turkey (1M tons), Iran (779K tons) and Saudi Arabia (651K tons), with a combined 62% share of total consumption. Iraq, Yemen, Syrian Arab Republic, Israel and Jordan lagged somewhat behind, together comprising a further 27%.\nFrom 2013 to 2024, the most notable rate of growth in terms of consumption, amongst the main consuming coun"

Expectations are also high that the topic will be discussed at the G-20 energy meeting scheduled for April 10.\nSome outlets are reporting that oil prices increased as much as 12% Thursday after reports on the Saudi Arabia/ Russia deal hit the news wires. As of this writing, it was not clear if the newly brokered deal was dependent on U.S. participation.\nDiesel and gasoline prices have fallen along with oil prices, as the COVID-19 outbreak has slashed demand worldwide, while for the past month, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been embroiled in a price war centered on crude oil, refusing to cut production.\nCurrently, diesel prices are their lowest since 2017. The Energy Information Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Energy, reported earlier this week that the national average retail price of a gallon of diesel was $2.548. That's the lowest since it dropped to $2.472 per gallon in July 2017. The price of crude oil makes up about half of the price of a gallon of diesel, according to the EIA.\nU.S. total oil consumption has dropped to a 30-year low. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s Short-Term Energy Outlook for April 2020, global petroleum and liquid fuels consumption averaged 94.4 million barrels per day (BPD) in the first quarter of 2020, a drop of 5.6 million BPD from the same period in 2019. The report went on to predict that global petroleum and liquid fuels demand to decrease by 5.2 million BPD in 2020, before increasing by 6.4 million BPD in 2021.\nThe report also estimates that the COVID-19 travel restrictions and the ongoing disruptions to businesses and the overall economic will only make matters worse in the second quarter. U.S. motor gasoline consumption could fall by 1.7 million BPD from the first quarter of 2020 to an average of 7.1 million BPD in the second quarter, before gradually increasing to 8.9 million BPD in the second half of the year."

Spot prices currently trade around the 1.1815 zone, nearly unchanged for the day, as traders keenly await the release of the flash Eurozone consumer inflation figures.\nThe preliminary estimate is expected to show that the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) fell to the 1.7% YoY rate in January from 1.9% in the previous month, while the core gauge is seen holding steady at 2.3% YoY. The European Central Bank (ECB) views this as a temporary deviation, suggesting no immediate adjustments to monetary policy. Nevertheless, the data could influence the shared currency and provide some impetus to the EUR/USD pair.\nLater during the North American session, traders will take cues from the US ADP report on private-sector employment and the US ISM Services PMI, which might further contribute to producing short-term opportunities. The immediate market reaction to the releases, however, is more likely to be limited as the focus will remain glued to the highly anticipated ECB policy meeting on Thursday. The outcome will play a key role in driving the EUR/USD pair in the near term.\nIn the meantime, a slight deterioration in the global risk sentiment offers some support to the safe-haven US Dollar (USD) and acts as a headwind for the currency pair. That said, the growing acceptance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut rates two more times in 2026 could cap the USD and support the EUR/USD pair. This warrants caution before positioning for an extension of the EUR/USD pair's pullback from the highest level since June 2021, touched last week.\nEconomic Indicator\nHarmonized Index of Consumer Prices (YoY)\nThe Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) measures changes in the prices of a representative basket of goods and services in the European Monetary Union. The HICP, released by Eurostat on a monthly basis, is harmonized because the same methodology is used across all member states and their contribution is weighted. The YoY reading compares prices in the reference month to a year earlier. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the Euro (EUR), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Wed Feb 04, 2026 10:00 (Prel)\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 1.7%\nPrevious: 1.9%\nSource: Eurostat\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

With that there is some doubt as to how many Federal Reserve rate cuts there are going to be and with that I think we have to look at this as a market so that if it breaks down below the 1.18 level we could be re-entering consolidation. This would be typical euro/dollar behavior to be honest.\nIf we turn around and take out the 1.1875 level above, then I think you have a real shot at this market rallying perhaps to the 1.20 level followed by the 1.23 level which is what the implied move from the consolidation range suggests.\nLots of things are going on and then on top of that we have the employment figures later this week.\nReady to trade our EUR/USD analysis and predictions?

The pair is hovering around its 50-day moving average (1.1724) and could test the 100-day (1.1678) or 200-day (1.1615) if the pullback extends. A softer euro can do some of the ECB\u2019s inflation-fighting work by making imports costlier, so policymakers may feel less pressure to address currency strength at Thursday\u2019s mee..\nting. Elsewhere, France offered a small calming signal after parliament approved the 2026 budget and the France\u2013Germany 10-year spread narrowed below 60 basis points. But ING flags bigger near-term risk in Central and Eastern Europe: with the dollar firmer and local rate paths in focus, Czech and Polish central bank decisions (Wednesday and Thursday) could keep EUR/czk and EUR/pln biased higher.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Yield gaps are back in the driver\u2019s seat.\nWhen short-term rate spreads move toward the US, the dollar tends to benefit \u2013 and that can reset expectations for European stocks and credit via earnings translation, commodity pricing, and FX hedging costs. The chart levels matter too: if EUR/USD can\u2019t hold near the 50-day, the next stops investors will watch are the 100-day and 200-day averages.\nThe bigger picture: Europe looks steadier in the core than on the edges.\nFrance\u2019s tighter bond spread suggests political risk is less of an immediate FX story. But pressure in Central and Eastern Europe can still spill over: if local central banks lean dovish while the US stays relatively tight, regional currencies may weaken first, and broader sentiment toward Europe can follow.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

GBP/USD opened the session at 1.3665 and touched an intraday high near 1.3707, with the pair consolidating below the multi-year high of 1.3869 posted in late January.\nThe BoE is widely expected to leave its Bank Rate unchanged at 3.75% when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) delivers its verdict on Thursday. Market pricing shows only a 4% probability of a rate cut at this meeting, with the next reduction now penciled in for April at the earliest. December's decision to cut rates was narrowly split at 5-4, and Governor Andrew Bailey has cautioned that future cuts will become \"a closer call\" as rates approach neutral levels.\nUK manufacturing data supports cautious optimism\nUK economic data has provided some support for Sterling, with the S&P; Global Manufacturing PMI rising to 51.8 in January from 50.6 in December, marking a 17-month high. The reading exceeded expectations and showed the fourth consecutive month of expansion, with new export orders rising for the first time in four years. Business confidence rebounded to its highest level since before the 2024 Autumn Budget, offering a tentative positive signal for the UK economy.\nHowever, UK inflation remains a concern, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for December showing a rise to 3.4% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in November. This sticky inflation picture has limited the BoE's room for maneuver on rate cuts, even as the labor market shows signs of cooling with unemployment at 5.1%.\nUS Dollar steadies after volatile week\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) traded around 97.5 on Tuesday, easing slightly after a sharp two-day rebound earlier in the session. The Greenback found support following President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair when Powell's term expires in May. Markets have interpreted the Warsh pick as relatively hawkish, though uncertainty around Fed policy direction persists.\nThe partial US government shutdown, which began Saturday, came to an end on Tuesday after the House passed a funding package by a narrow 217-214 vote. President Trump signed the legislation into law, providing full-year funding for most federal agencies while extending Department of Homeland Security funding for just two weeks. The January Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, originally due Friday, will be delayed due to the shutdown's impact on Bureau of Labor Statistics operations.\nBoE policy outlook in focus\nWhile the BoE is expected to stand pat this week, the policy outlook beyond February remains divided. Some economists see as many as four rate cuts in 2026, while markets are pricing in only one or two reductions. BoE policymaker Megan Greene recently noted that rate cuts may be more limited than expected due to strong UK wage growth and the potential impact of Fed policy decisions on UK inflation. The MPC's guidance on Thursday will be closely scrutinized for signals on the pace of future easing.\nPound Sterling price forecast\nGBP/USD continues to trade within a bullish tilt on the daily chart, with price action holding near 1.3700 after pulling back from the January 27 high of 1.3869. The pair remains well above both the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.3485 and the 200-day EMA at 1.3338, maintaining a clear bullish bias in the medium term.\nThe recent pullback from multi-year highs has found support near the 1.3650 area, with buyers stepping in on "

Confirmation that activity expanded to a fresh 21-month high at the start of the year may offer the Pound some modest support, although markets are likely to remain sensitive to broader risk sentiment and US political developments.\nLike this piece?

                "body": "The Pound Sterling (GBP) dives some 0.17% on Monday as the US Dollar (USD) extends its gains to two straight days, following the precious metals rout that pushed Gold prices down by over $1,000 after reaching a record high near $5,600. GBP/USD trades at 1.3662 after reaching a daily high of 1.3715.\nSterling weakens ahead of the BoE meeting as markets reprice a less-dovish Fed and US data beats expectations\nLast Friday, US President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to be the new Fed Chair since June 2026. After the announcement, markets priced in a less \u2018dovish\u2019 US central bank as Warsh, a former governor at the Fed, was usually hawkish in his previous stint.\nData-wise, the US economic docket featured S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for January, showing an expansion in the sector. The ISM Manufacturing PMI crushed forecasts of a 48.5 reading and expanded by 52.6 in January, up from December\u2019s 47.9 contraction.\nIn the UK, traders\u2019 focus is on the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) monetary policy decision, in which the central bank is expected to hold the Bank Rate steady at 3.75% on Thursday. Market participants\u2019 attention will be on the vote split, as members have been divided during the last couple of meetings.\nWorth noting that although the UK jobs market had shown signs of weakness, inflation remains the highest among the G7 industrialized countries. Therefore, the BoE could refrain from supporting the labor market.\nS&P Global reported that manufacturing activity in January in the country improved the most since August 2024, indicating the economy is picking up. The Purchasers Managers Index (PMI) rose from 51.6 to 51.8, exceeding estimates.\nAhead in the week, the UK docket will feature the BoE\u2019s monetary policy and speeches by BoE members. Across the pond, Fed officials will grab the headlines, along with Services PMI data by S&P Global and the ISM, jobless claims and January\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report.\nGBP/USD Price Forecast: Technical outlook\nAfter clearing 1.3700 support, GBP/USD is poised to consolidate within the 1.3600-1.3700 area. Bullish momentum is fading as depicted by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) aiming towards its neutral level.\nFor a bullish continuation, buyers must clear 1.3700 and challenge 1.3750. On further strength, 1.3800 lies overhead. Conversely, if GBP/USD tumbles below 1.3650, it could exacerbate the drop to 1.3600. A breach of the latter will expose the 20-day SMA at 1.3538.\nGBP/USD Daily ChartPound Sterling Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies this week. British Pound was the strongest against the Swiss Franc.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

Traders responded by dialing back near-term tightening bets, with futures not fully pricing a 25-basis-point hike until around September. That\u2019s why the kiwi fell, even if a strong dairy auction \u2013 important for export income \u2013 helpe..\nd limit the damage. Australia\u2019s story looks firmer. The RBA recently tightened policy and warned inflation may not return to the midpoint of its 2%\u20133% target until mid-2028. Markets are now pricing about 40 basis points of additional tightening this year, including a high chance of a May move, which boosts the aussie by widening yield gaps versus low-rate currencies like the yen.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate differentials are doing the heavy lifting.\nWhen two similar economies head in opposite policy directions, currencies tend to follow. A more hawkish RBA lifts Australian yields and can support AUD not just against the kiwi, but also versus low-yielders. If New Zealand\u2019s labor market keeps loosening, that \u201cRBNZ on hold\u201d narrative strengthens \u2013 and AUD/NZD could stay jumpy around every inflation and jobs release.\nThe bigger picture: Beating inflation can take longer than the hiking cycle.\nThe RBA\u2019s mid-2028 timeline is a reminder that inflation progress often slows in the \u201clast mile\u201d, even after aggressive rate moves. Central banks that signal patience can keep financial conditions tight through expectations alone, which feeds straight into currencies. And New Zealand\u2019s mixed jobs print shows how growth can cool unevenly, forcing policymakers to balance inflation risks against rising slack.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

As a result, the policymakers consider that inflation is likely to remain above the 2-3% target for some time.\nThe central bank also noted that, while part of the recent pick-up in inflation reflects temporary factors, private demand is growing faster than expected, capacity pressures are higher than previously assessed, and labour market conditions remain slightly tight.\nMeanwhile, Governor Michele Bullock said the Board will not provide forward guidance and will remain firmly focused on incoming data, stressing that policymakers do not yet know whether this move marks the start of a tightening cycle.\nShe added that the Bank \u201ccannot allow inflation to get away from us\u201d, noting that while the economy is in a good position, it remains constrained on the supply side.\nAccording to a BHH report, the swaps market is now pricing in an around 80% probability of another 25 bps rate hike in May, and about 60 bps of total tightening over the next twelve months.\nLooking ahead, monetary policy divergence between the RBA and the Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely to keep AUD/USD tilted to the upside, with markets pricing in around 50 basis points of Fed rate cuts by the end of the year.\nAttention now turns to Australian employment data and the Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), both due on Wednesday, which could provide the next near-term catalyst for the Aussie.\nIn the United States, the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been delayed due to the ongoing partial government shutdown, leaving investors to rely more heavily on private labour indicators, including ADP Employment Change. The US economic calendar will also feature the Services PMI on Wednesday.\nRBA FAQs\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for Australia. Decisions are made by a board of governors at 11 meetings a year and ad hoc emergency meetings as required. The RBA\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means an inflation rate of 2-3%, but also \u201c..to contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people.\u201d Its main tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will strengthen the Australian Dollar (AUD) and vice versa. Other RBA tools include quantitative easing and tightening.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for currencies since it lowers the value of money in general, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Moderately higher inflation now tends to lead central banks to put up their interest rates, which in turn has the effect of attracting more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases "

It did not prove to be a barrier to the RBA raising interest rates at its February meeting \u2013 and nor should it have been.\nThe main reason for this is simple. The level of the exchange rate, even after the recent rally, remains undervalued and therefore stimulatory for the Australian economy at large. Add to that substantial deficit spending at the federal and state government level, and two of the three main parameters of the aggregate policy stance in Australia are sponsoring excess demand."

                "body": "USD/JPY volatility has intensified in recent sessions as economic indicators, central bank rhetoric, and politics collide.\nOn Wednesday, February 4, service sector PMI numbers for Japan and the US will influence BoJ rate hike and Fed rate cut bets.\nMarkets currently expect a BoJ rate hike and a Fed rate cut by June 2026. Strong Japanese and weaker US services PMIs would support further monetary policy divergence. A narrowing rate differential favoring the yen would affirm the bearish short- to medium-term price outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nOn February 4, Japanese services sector PMI data will fuel speculation about a BoJ rate hike. According to the preliminary survey, the S&P Global Japan Services PMI increased from 51.6 in December to 53.4 in January.\nA higher PMI reading would signal a sharper pickup in economic momentum, given that services account for roughly 70% of Japan\u2019s GDP. However, beyond the headline PMI, traders should consider any adjustments to the employment and prices sub-components, which are key focal points for the BoJ.\nThe preliminary survey showed that employment rose at the fastest pace since April 2019. Furthermore, service providers raised selling prices despite softer input cost inflation, signaling widening profit margins. Wider margins would enable service providers to increase employment and hike wages. Crucially, higher wages would increase households\u2019 purchasing power, potentially fueling consumer spending and demand-driven inflation.\nA higher inflation outlook would align with the BoJ\u2019s quarterly inflation projections, suggesting a more hawkish BoJ rate path. Rising bets on an H1 2026 BoJ rate hike would strengthen the yen, sending USD/JPY lower.\nFor context, the BoJ revised its 2026 GDP and CPI projections upwards and signaled a near-term rate hike on January 23. The BoJ\u2019s quarterly projections and forward guidance coincided with the preliminary services PMI data. USD/JPY tumbled 1.64% to close at 155.741 in response to the BoJ\u2019s hawkish projections and the upbeat data.\nWhile Japanese data will influence demand for the yen, US economic indicators will affect buying interest in the US dollar.\nEconomists expect the ISM Services PMI to fall from 54.4 in December to 53.5 in January. A lower PMI print would signal a loss of economic momentum, given that services contribute around 80% to US GDP. Beyond the headline PMI, the employment and prices sub-components will require consideration, given the Fed\u2019s dual mandate.\nEconomists forecast the Employment PMI to remain at 52, while expecting the Prices PMI to slip from 64.3 to 64.0 in January.\nWeaker prices and falling employment would fuel speculation about an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, weighing on the US dollar.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a March Fed rate cut dropped from 17.3% on January 27 to 8.4% on February 3, following stronger-than-expected US data. Meanwhile, the probability of a June cut fell from 65.4% to 56.1%. Waning bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut lifted USD/JPY from last week\u2019s low of 152.092 to 155 levels, underscoring price sensitivity to incoming US data.\nImportantly, an H1 2026 Fed cut would support expectations of multiple rate cuts in 2026. Multiple Fed rate cuts would coincide with the BoJ\u2019s hawkish policy outlook, signaling a narrower US-Japan rate differential. Moreover, narrowing rate differentials, favoring the yen, would weigh on USD/JPY.\nCrucially, a more dovish Fed rate path and a more hawkish BoJ policy stance would affirm the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, traders should consider technical, incoming economic data, central bank chatter, and geopolitical developments.\nOn the daily chart, USD/JPY trades above its 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). The EMA positions indicated a bullish bias. However, positive yen fundamentals continue to"

Investors remain concerned about Japan's fiscal health under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's expansionary spending policy. Apart from this, domestic political uncertainty ahead of the snap election on February 8 turns out to be another factor undermining the JPY, pushing the USD/JPY pair further beyond the 156.00 mark.\nMeanwhile, traders remain on high alert amid the possibility of a coordinated Japan-US intervention to stem the JPY's decline. Moreover, the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) gradual policy tightening narrative might hold back the JPY bears from placing aggressive bets. Apart from this, bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates two more times fail to assist the US Dollar (USD) in attracting any meaningful buyers and might contribute to capping the USD/JPY pair ahead of the US macro data, due later today.\nJapanese Yen bears retain control amid fiscal woes and political uncertainty\n- Japan\u2019s services sector growth accelerated at the start of 2026, with business activity expanding for the tenth consecutive month and at its fastest pace in almost a year. In fact, the Jibun Bank Services PMI climbed to 53.7 compared to 51.6 in December and consensus estimates for a reading of 53.4.\n- The data signaled a more durable recovery in the services sector, which accounts for roughly 70% of Japan\u2019s GDP. The market reaction, however, turns out to be muted amid nervousness over Japan\u2019s fiscal outlook, fueled by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s aggressive spending and tax cut plans.\n- In fact, Takaichi has pledged to suspend the 8% consumption tax on food for two years as part of her campaign ahead of a snap lower house election on February 8. This puts the spotlight back on Japan's already strained public finances, which continue to undermine the Japanese Yen on Wednesday.\n- The unusual rate check by the New York Federal Reserve recently was seen as the strongest signal to date that Japanese and US authorities were working together to stem the JPY's decline. This lowers the threshold for intervention and could limit JPY losses amid hawkish Bank of Japan bets.\n- The Summary of Opinions from the BoJ's January meeting, released on Monday, showed that policymakers debated mounting price pressures from a weak JPY. Moreover, board members judged that further rate increases were appropriate over time, which could lend support to the JPY.\n- The US Dollar, on the other hand, struggles to build on last week's recovery from a four-year low, bolstered by the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair. Even the passage of the government funding package to end a partial shutdown does little to provide any impetus to the USD.\n- Traders now look forward to the release of the US ADP report on private-sector employment and the US ISM Services PMI. Apart from this, comments from influential FOMC members might influence the USD demand amid bets for two more rate cuts in 2026 and drive the USD/JPY pair.\nUSD/JPY needs to surpass 156.50 confluence hurdle to back case for further gains\nWednesday's move beyond the 156.00 mark comes on top of the overnight breakout through the 50% retracement level of the 159.13-152.06 downfall and favors the USD/JPY bulls. The Relative Strength Index (14) sits at 66.9, below overbought, aligning with a firm but maturing advance.\nHowever, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram remains positive but is contracting, sugge"

Elsewhere, moves across major currency pairs were relatively subdued. NZD/USD edged slightly lower following the release of New Zealand\u2019s Q4 2025 employment report, which showed the unemployment rate rising to 5.4%, its highest level in a decade. Despite the headline increase, the details of the report were viewed more constructively, limiting downside pressure on the kiwi.\nOn the corporate front, Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter earnings after the US close. While the chipmaker beat expectations on both revenue and profit, its forward guidance fell short of more optimistic forecasts, triggering a sharp sell-off in extended trading.\nIn US politics, Donald Trump signed legislation to reopen most of the federal government, formally ending a partial shutdown that began over the weekend. The bill narrowly cleared the House after passing the Senate last week. Trump later said negotiations with Iran remain ongoing.\nMacro data flow was busy across the region. Australia\u2019s services PMI surged to a near four-year high in January, pointing to strong demand momentum and supporting the Australian dollar. Easing price pressures in the survey may temper near-term inflation concerns for policymakers.\nJapan\u2019s services PMI rose to an 11-month high, driven by stronger new orders, exports and hiring. Input cost inflation eased to its softest pace in nearly two years, though selling prices accelerated and business confidence softened. China\u2019s services PMI also improved, rising to a three-month high as domestic and export demand strengthened. Employment expanded for the first time in six months, while cost pressures eased and output prices stabilised, although sentiment edged lower.\nSeparately, Stephen Miran resigned on Tuesday from his role as chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, a White House spokesperson said.

The pair inches higher as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) struggles amid lower Oil prices, reflecting Canada\u2019s role as the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price trades lower near $63.50 per barrel at the time of writing. However, Oil prices may build on previous gains as geopolitical tensions resurfaced after the US downed an Iranian drone near a US aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. However, President Trump said diplomatic channels remain open, with the White House confirming US-Iran talks are still scheduled for Friday.\nMarkets will focus later in the day on the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which is expected to ease to 53.5 in January from 54.4 in December.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will not publish the January employment report on Friday as scheduled because of the partial government shutdown that began last weekend. The shutdown ended late Tuesday after US President Donald Trump signed a funding deal negotiated with Senate Democrats, despite ongoing tensions over his immigration crackdown.\nThe US Dollar (USD) could gain support as expectations shift around Federal Reserve (Fed) leadership following Trump\u2019s nomination of former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair. Markets anticipate a slower pace of rate cuts and greater emphasis on balance sheet reduction under Warsh.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar"

                "body": "TORONTO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday as oil prices rose and the greenback posted broad-based declines, but the loonie's move was limited ahead of jobs data due later this week.\nThe loonie was trading 0.3% higher at 1.3642 per U.S. dollar, or 73.30 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.3637 to 1.3685. On Friday, the currency touched its strongest intraday level since October 2024 at 1.3479.\n\"The reality is that USD-CAD has depreciated a lot at the end of January for many reasons unrelated to Canada and that the market should see some consolidation at these levels,\" said Sarah Ying, head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.\n\"With the Bank of Canada firmly on hold, we are not convinced that this Friday\u2019s LFS (Labour Force Survey) data will have much market impact,\" Ying said. \"We think USD-CAD retests the 1.3800 handle before trading lower long-term. Our year-end target for USD-CAD remains at 1.34.\"\nCanada's employment report for January, due on Friday, is expected to show the economy adding 7,000 jobs. Last week, the Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.25% and Governor Tiff Macklem said a high level of trade uncertainty made it difficult to predict when and how rates might next change.\nThe U.S. dollar (.DXY), weakened against a basket of major currencies, giving back some of its gains over the previous two days. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, was 1.5% higher at $63.06 a barrel on worries over supply.\nCanadian bond yields moved higher across the curve as traders evaluated possible shifts in U.S. Federal Reserve policy under Kevin Warsh. The 10-year was up 2.1 basis points at 3.458%, after earlier touching its highest level since January 5 at 3.465%.\nReporting by Fergal Smith in Toronto Editing by Matthew Lewis"

CIBC says the late-January drop in USD/CAD was driven mostly by global forces, so it expects consolidation, a near-term retest of 1.3800, and then a gradual move lower later in the year. That makes Friday\u2019s Labour Force Survey more of a \u201csanity check\u201d than a game-changer: forecasts call for a modest 7,000 job gain, and CIBC thinks it may not shift sentimen..\nt much while the Bank of Canada sits tight at 2.25%. Governor Tiff Macklem also flagged \u201chigh trade uncertainty,\u201d making it harder to map when \u2013 or whether \u2013 rates change. Meanwhile, firmer oil and slightly higher Canadian yields are supporting the loonie, but not enough to break the broader range.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Global drivers are steering the loonie.\nCanada\u2019s currency often follows two big inputs \u2013 the US dollar and crude oil \u2013 and this week looked like a textbook case. If oil holds up and the greenback stays softer, USD/CAD may struggle to climb. But a possible retest of 1.3800 is a reminder that currency moves often come in waves.\nZooming out: Trade uncertainty is now part of the rate outlook.\nThe BoC usually keys off inflation and jobs, but it\u2019s openly treating trade uncertainty as a swing factor. That can extend a \u201cwait and see\u201d period, even if the data stay decent. For investors, it means North American rates and currencies could stay headline-sensitive well beyond any single release.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is trading near 213.26, rising for a third straight day.\nInvestor focus is squarely on Japan\u2019s snap election on February 8, after PM Takaichi dissolved the lower house last month. A decisive majority for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) would be seen as strengthening Takaichi\u2019s mandate to push ahead with a more expansionary fiscal agenda, reviving concerns that higher government spending could add to Japan\u2019s already heavy public debt burden.\nMeanwhile, the Yen\u2019s excessive weakness remains a key concern among Japanese authorities. Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said on Tuesday that she would not comment on whether any foreign exchange intervention had been conducted, following market reports of a so-called \u201crate check\u201d that briefly triggered a short-lived correction in the Yen.\nKatayama added that Japan will continue to closely coordinate with US authorities, based on the joint Japan-United States statement issued in September last year, and will respond appropriately, keeping intervention risks in focus.\nOn the data front, the Japanese economic calendar is relatively light this week, leaving the spotlight on the UK, where the Bank of England (BoE) is set to announce its interest rate decision on Thursday.\nMarkets widely expect the BoE to keep interest rates unchanged at 3.75% on Thursday. The decision comes as inflation pressure remains elevated, with the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerating to 3.4% YoY in December from 3.2% in November.\nHowever, investors still see room for rate cuts later this year after policymakers said at their previous meeting that the scale and timing of further easing would depend on how the inflation outlook evolves, noting that policy is likely to follow a gradual downward path.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoE Interest Rate Decision\nThe Bank of England (BoE) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the BoE is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is usually bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP). Likewise, if the BoE adopts a dovish view on the UK economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is seen as bearish for GBP.\nRead more.Next release: Thu Feb 05, 2026 12:00\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 3.75%\nPrevious: 3.75%\nSource: Bank of England\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and commodities market.

This shift is significant for Strategy since traders frequently use the stock as a stand-in for the token, and that connection can overshadow the software side of the business.\nA Monday SEC filing revealed Strategy sold 673,527 shares through its at-the-market (ATM) program, generating $106.1 million in net proceeds. Using that, the company purchased 855 bitcoin for $75.3 million during the week ending Feb. 1, pushing total bitcoin holdings to 713,502. It also raised the dividend rate on its variable-rate preferred (STRC) to 11.25% and declared a cash dividend set for Feb. 28. (Securities and Exchange Commission)\nThe next hurdle arrives fast.

Coinbase Global dropped 4.3%, Robinhood Markets slid 3.1% in late trading, and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF dipped roughly 2.1%.\nStrategy, which was known as MicroStrategy until last year, updated its legal name but retained the MSTR ticker on Nasdaq. It also still trades several preferred stock listings. (Strategy)\nInvestors keep coming back to one thing: the machine. Bitcoin\u2019s price swings move the stock, and the company fuels further purchases by selling securities. When the share price drops, they need to issue even more shares to raise the same amount of money, which dilutes current shareholders.\nThat flywheel risks wobbling if bitcoin continues to slide or if interest in Strategy\u2019s products fades. Falling token prices translate into larger paper losses on their holdings, and a weaker stock makes raising new capital costlier and less certain.\nThursday\u2019s results and call stand as the market\u2019s next major event. Traders will zero in on any changes in the pace of bitcoin purchases, the remaining capacity under the ATM program, and how management positions its dividend and liquidity plans for the week ahead."

                "body": "- While they finalise the forthcoming Glamsterdam upgrade, Ethereum developers have begun debating the one after that \u2014 Hegota.\n- There is a growing consensus over Hegota's key feature.\n- Developers have begun pitching complementary features, one of which has earned the support of Vitalik Buterin.,\nIt\u2019s a busy time for Ethereum developers.\nEven as they work to finalise the dozen-plus improvements that will be included in the blockchain\u2019s next upgrade, Glamsterdam, they\u2019ve begun debating so-called headliners for the one after that, codenamed Hegota.\nHeadliners are crucial. Those are the improvements that excite the general public (to the extent the general public cares about Ethereum upgrades).\nThey are usually so significant that they can be felt by the average user, and they are easy to explain, offering developers a simple way of saying, \u201chere\u2019s how Ethereum got better this year.\u201d\nDespite a heated debate over the wisdom of implementing fork-choice inclusion lists, or FOCIL, there seems to be a growing consensus that it will be one of the headliners in Hegota.\nFOCIL would eliminate block builders\u2019 ability to censor transactions, by forcing inclusion of every valid transaction in an upcoming block. It\u2019s being pitched as the next step in bolstering Ethereum\u2019s claim to cypherpunk preeminence.\nBut what might join FOCIL in Hegota? Last Thursday, Ethereum developers heard pitches for other proposed headliners.\nDeveloper Jannik Luhn proposed something called the universal enshrined encrypted mempool, which would allow for encrypted transactions on Ethereum, preventing front-running and sandwich attacks.\n\u201cMany users already protect themselves by using private RPCs and trusted builders, which I think proves that there\u2019s user demand,\u201d Luhn said.\n\u201cBut the way this happens, we think, is problematic because it relies on trusted parties, which is bad for decentralisation and censorship resistance.\u201d\nAnd it would make a nice partner to FOCIL.\n\u201cWe think this fits very well into a theme of improving credibility, neutrality, and censorship resistance of Ethereum,\u201d Luhn added.\nEthereum Foundation developer Felix Lange proposed something called frame transactions \u2014 a new type of transaction that would prepare the blockchain for a post-quantum world and offer a more robust version of account abstraction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also for us the most important one, because of the readiness for the post-quantum world,\u201d Lange said.\n\u201cWe feel like we have to get started with the off-ramp from ECDSA, and in order to do that, we need a comprehensive system that can deal with whatever signature algorithms we want to use.\u201d\nECDSA is the acronym for the quantum-vulnerable cryptography that undergirds Ethereum currently.\nOne sceptic pointed out that earlier upgrades to enable a form of account abstraction are little-used. But Lange said those had been half-measures that \u201care not adequate to capture what users really want to do.\u201d\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik joined to throw his support behind the proposal, a somewhat rare occurrence that could sway the outcome of these discussions.\n\u201cFrom a use cases perspective, this does basically satisfy everything that, at least I\u2019ve been pushing for \u2014 the entire list of goals of account abstraction,\u201d Buterin said.\nThough it too would be a nice complement to FOCIL, quantum resistance was the most important aspect of the proposal, he added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reason why account abstraction of some form is ultimately indispensable,\u201d Buterin said.\nTop DeFi stories of the week\nThis week in DeFi governance\nVote: Frax votes one \u201c1 Token, 1 Mission, 1 Vision\u201d proposal to fix FRAX supply and clarify IP ownership\nVOTE: GMX DAO votes to use $3.5 million on marketing and incentives targeted at traders\nVOTE: Goldfinch votes to add additional $150,000 to legal reserve to resolve legacy loans\nPost of the week\nSilver\u2019s been trading like a low-mcap cryptocurrency in recent days.\nthe silver team needs to focus on UTILITY and address the community concerns\n\u2014 Aporia (@0x"

                "body": "Vitalik Says Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 Vision \u2018No Longer Makes Sense\u2019\nAfter years of Layer 2 (L2) networks popping up in an attempt to scale Ethereum and claim market share, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin says that the L2 model for scalability no longer makes sense due to the Layer 1\u2019s (L1) scaling efforts.\n\u201cThe original vision of L2s and their role in Ethereum no longer makes sense, and we need a new path,\u201d Buterin wrote on X, citing issues such as slow progress towards decentralization, while noting that the Ethereum mainnet is scaling and consistently maintaining low gas costs.\nGas costs, in particular, were a major obstacle for decentralized finance (DeFi) power users in 2021 and 2022, when network activity surged amid the popularity of DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). During high-demand periods, such as a hyped NFT mint or a capped DeFi vault deposit, gas fees could skyrocket to thousands of dollars just to attempt a transaction, with no guarantee of its success.\nThe infamous Otherside NFT mint from the Bored Ape Yacht Club led to more than 55,000 ETH, worth $193 million at the time, being burned. While ETH holders who didn\u2019t participate in the mint likely celebrated the supply burn, many users attempted to mint Otherside NFTs but failed, incinerating thousands of dollars in the process.\nWhat Should Layer 2s Do Now?\nButerin went on to say that L2s can and should add value other than just scaling Ethereum. He cited features such as privacy, application-specific specialization, non-financial application-focused chains, various iterations of high-speed scaling, and lastly, built-in oracles or dispute resolution for applications like Polymarket.\nLayer 2 tokens in particular have been a minefield for investors, with tokens of leading L2s such as ARB and OP falling more than 90% from their respective all-time highs, while other highly anticipated Layer 2 ecosystems, such as Blast, Scroll, and Linea, were unable to retain activity after their initial launch phases.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

                "body": "ParaFi Capital just put $35 million into Jupiter, a Solana-based trading protocol, marking the first time Jupiter has taken outside funding. The deal arrived while Solana DeFi usage stayed strong, with users pushing large trading volumes through on-chain apps. When serious capital backs tools people already use every day, it shows this part of crypto has grown beyond side projects.\nSolana platforms continue to attract users because fees stay low and transactions move quickly, which helps explain why venture firms keep paying attention. For everyday users, this points to durability rather than a short-lived surge.\nWhat Exactly Did ParaFi Buy And Why Is That Unusual?\nJupiter runs a DEX aggregator, which means it checks multiple decentralized exchanges and finds the best swap price for you in a single step. You can think of it like a travel site that compares flights across airlines so you don\u2019t have to open ten tabs.\nBREAKING:\nJupiter secures a $35M strategic investment into $JUP from ParaFi Capital to accelerate onchain financial infrastructure.\nThis deal \u2013 which will be settled entirely in $JupUSD \u2013 was closed at spot price with ParaFi committing to an extended token lockup. pic.twitter.com/7moUP2nQjK\n\u2014 Jupiter (@JupiterExchange) February 2, 2026\nParaFi bought Jupiter tokens at the current market price. There was no discount and no early access. Those tokens also come with long lockups, which means ParaFi cannot sell them quickly. That setup keeps incentives aligned with regular users who want steady growth instead of fast exits.\nDISCOVER: 9+ Best High-Risk, High-Reward Crypto to Buy in February2026\nJupiter Sets A New Tone For Solana DeFi Funding\nJupiter processed more than $1 trillion in trading volume over the past year. That figure reflects real activity, not just excitement on social media. It shows that traders already trust the platform with large amounts of money.\nThis investment also fits a broader pattern on Solana, where large funds back core infrastructure rather than novelty tokens. For beginners, this reduces the risk of empty projects, though it never eliminates risk entirely.\nHow This Affects Everyday Users\nExtra funding gives Jupiter room to improve products like perpetual trading, lending features, and its JupUSD stablecoin. A stablecoin aims to stay close to one US dollar, which makes it useful for moving funds without returning to a bank.\nBetter tools can mean fewer app switches and fewer chances to make mistakes. Anyone who has paid surprise fees or worried about sending funds to the wrong place understands why a smoother design helps.\nDISCOVER: Best New Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2026\nThe Risk Check You Should Not Skip\nEven with long lockups, token prices can move quickly when market mood changes. DeFi apps also rely on code, and bugs can lead to real losses.\nVenture backing does not equal safety. Start with small amounts, learn how the platform works, and practice using money you can afford to lose.\nDeals like this show DeFi growing into businesses with real usage and revenue. If that continues, users get better products, while patience and caution remain just as important.\nDISCOVER: 20+ Next Crypto to Explode in 2025\nFollow 99Bitcoins on X for the Latest Market Updates and Subscribe on YouTube for Daily Expert Market Analysis\nWhy you can trust 99Bitcoins\nEstablished in 2013, 99Bitcoin\u2019s team members have been crypto experts since Bitcoin\u2019s Early days.\nWeekly Research\n100k+Monthly readers\nExpert contributors\n2000+Crypto Projects Reviewed"

The token is still up over 120% on the weekly timeframe.\nIn an X post on Monday, Feb. 2, announcing the expansion to Solana, Bankr said the system carries a 0.5% pre-migration creator fee and a post-migration split that sends 50% of swap fees to the creator, 40% to Bankr and burns 10%.\nThe expansion comes as Bankr\u2019s annualized revenue surged past $580,000, with 30-day fees around $47,600 and 24-hour fees near $2,000, according to DefiLlama data. Prior to the latest rollout, Bankr already supported Ethereum, Base and Polygon.\nStill, on-chain trading data suggest that most tokens launched via Bankr have seen limited follow-through after deployment.\nOf the roughly 25 Bankr-linked tokens with reported trading data, BNKR, the project\u2019s own token, accounted for the largest share of activity, with about $41,800 in all-time volume, according to Dune data.\nBut when excluding BNKR, about 88% of third-party tokens launched via Bankr recorded less than $10,000 in cumulative volume and showed no trading activity over the past day, week or month, pointing to thin liquidity after launch.\nThis article was generated with the assistance of AI workflows.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

                "body": "US stock futures edged higher during the Asian market session on Wednesday, February 4, steadying after the previous day\u2019s sell-off. Market jitters about the AI space resurfaced, coinciding with fading bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, weighing on demand for risk assets.\nMeanwhile, stronger-than-expected Japanese economic data signaled a more hawkish BoJ policy stance, weighing on Japanese stocks. The Nikkei dropped 0.74% in morning trading. However, the data failed to strengthen the yen, bolstering buying interest in US index futures. Notably, USD/JPY climbed 0.27% to 156.125 in morning trading.\nA choppy start to the week reflected market tension as upbeat US economic indicators signaled a more hawkish Fed rate path. Nevertheless, robust US corporate earnings, a strong US economy, and expectations of multiple 2026 Fed rate cuts support a cautiously bullish outlook for the US index futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.\nJapanese economic indicators aligned with the Bank of Japan\u2019s upward revision to its 2026 GDP forecast. The S&P Global Japan Services PMI increased from 51.6 in December to 53.7 in January, up from a preliminary 53.4. According to the PMI survey, new business increased at a sharper pace, with service providers increasing employment. Despite input price inflation cooling, selling price inflation rose to a seven-month high, signaling wider profit margins.\nTypically, wider margins and increasing new business enable firms to increase employment and raise wages. Higher wages would boost consumer spending and fuel demand-driven inflation, supporting a more hawkish BoJ rate path. Rising bets on an H1 2026 BoJ rate hike would narrow the US-Japan rate differential, curbing demand for US risk assets. These dynamics expose US stock futures to a choppy session ahead of the US market opening bell.\nUS futures trended higher during the Asian session on February 4. The Dow Jones E-mini climbed 38 points, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini gained 2 points and 3 points, respectively.\nLater on Wednesday, the US ISM Services PMI will influence market bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. Economists expect the ISM Services PMI to drop from 54.4 in December to 53.5 in January. A lower-than-expected PMI reading would signal a loss of economic momentum, given that services contribute around 80% to US GDP.\nHowever, traders should consider the ISM Prices PMI, given the Fed\u2019s concerns about elevated inflation. Economists forecast the ISM Prices PMI will fall from 64.3 in December to 64.0 in January. Softer prices would signal cooling inflationary pressures, supporting a more dovish Fed rate path. Rising bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut would lift sentiment.\nBeyond the data, traders should closely track FOMC members\u2019 speeches. Views on the labor market, inflation, and monetary policy would also influence sentiment.\nHowever, corporate earnings results will continue to dictate near-term market trends, with Amazon.com\u2019s earnings results looming.\nDespite ongoing concerns about AI-linked stocks and returns on investment, robust earnings and slower service sector activity would support a cautiously bullish short-term and positive medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nTuesday\u2019s pullback left the Nasdaq 100 E-mini trading below its 50-day EMA, while holding above the 200-day EMA. The EMA positions signaled a bearish near-term, but bullish longer-term outlook. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini held above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs, indicating a bullish bias, aligning with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on geopolitical risks, earnings, US economic indicators, and central bank rhetoric. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook remains cautiously bullish. Expectations of an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and positive sentiment toward Q4 earnings affirm the b"

The S&P 500 fell 0.8% as investors dumped technology stocks, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.4%. Despite strength in defensive sectors and select earnings winners, a deepening selloff in enterprise software stocks and a sharp decline in PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) weighed heavily on sentiment. Markets shrugged off political uncertainty as Congress moved to end the partial government shutdown.\nHouse passes $1 trillion spending package, ends shutdown\nThe House voted 217-214 on Tuesday to approve a more than $1 trillion spending package, bringing an end to the partial government shutdown that began after midnight on Saturday. Twenty-one Democrats joined Republicans in support of the measure, which funds the Pentagon, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation, the Education Department, and Housing and Urban Development through the end of the fiscal year in September.\nThe legislation separated funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which will receive only a two-week extension through February 13 as lawmakers negotiate Democratic demands for reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. President Trump endorsed the plan and is expected to sign the bill into law. Markets largely brushed off the shutdown's end, having already priced in a swift resolution.\nSoftware stocks extend brutal selloff on AI disruption fears\nEnterprise software stocks extended a punishing decline on Tuesday as investors continued to reassess the sector's long-term growth prospects amid rising concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt traditional business models. International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) sank 9%, dragging the Dow lower as a price-weighted index, while Salesforce Inc. (CRM) and ServiceNow Inc. (NOW) each fell around 7%.\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF dropped 5%, pushing the software industry deeper into bear-market territory with a decline of more than 22% from recent highs. The selloff accelerated after Anthropic's automation tools heightened concerns that AI could eat into software companies' core businesses, prompting investors to slash exposure to names once considered defensive growth plays.\nWalmart becomes first traditional retailer to reach $1 trillion\nWalmart Inc. (WMT) rose as much as 1.6% to hit an intraday record of $126 per share, pushing its market capitalization past $1 trillion for the first time. The Arkansas-based retail giant became only the tenth US company to reach this milestone, joining an exclusive club previously dominated by technology firms including Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), and Apple Inc. (AAPL).\nThe achievement caps a remarkable two-year rally in which Walmart shares have more than doubled, fueled by robust e-commerce growth, expansion of its Walmart+ membership program to 28.4 million members, and market-share gains as budget-conscious consumers continue to seek value. The milestone arrived during the first week under new CEO John Furner, who succeeded Doug McMillon after more than a decade at the helm.\nPayPal plunges on CEO exit and disappointing outlook\nP"

That showed up when AstraZeneca fell after the FDA rejected its filing for a more convenient version of its lupus drug Saphnelo, pushing any decision into 2026 and weighing on healthcare. Energy stocks also slipped as oil fell for a second session on hopes tensions between the US and Iran could cool, dragging on Shell and BP...\nMiners offered some support as gold jumped and copper rose on supply worries and improving demand expectations. Even so, the more UK-focused FTSE 250 edged up, hinting that domestic sentiment can look steadier even when commodity-heavy blue chips wobble.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: The FTSE 100 is a global proxy in disguise.\nBig swings in oil, metals, and even US drug regulators can move the index more than local UK data. That can create sudden gaps between the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250, which has more homegrown companies and is often a cleaner read on how investors feel about the UK economy.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks want clearer inflation proof.\nCooling prices help rate-setters justify waiting, but they need a trend, not a one-off. With the Bank of England widely expected to hold rates this week, globally driven moves in energy and metals can still jolt UK markets even if domestic inflation pressure is slowly easing.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

It has jumped by 35% from its lowest level in April last year. This article looks at some of the key catalysts or news that will move German stocks.\nDAX Index to react to ECB interest rate decision\nA key catalyst for the DAX Index is the upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate decision, which will come out on Thursday this week.\nThis decision will come a day after Eurostat releases the latest consumer inflation report. Economists polled by Reuters expect the upcoming report to show that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped to 1.7% in January, much lower than the ECB target of 2.0%.\nThe ECB has now achieved its goal of bringing inflation to 2% while the economy is doing well. This growth has been helped by the robust spending by European economies.\nTherefore, most economists believe that the ECB will leave interest rates unchanged at 2% this year and then start hiking in the coming year. This explains why the euro and German bond yields have continued rising.\nKey German earnings\nThe DAX Index has done well in the past few weeks as some key German companies published strong financial results. The most notable of them was Deutsche Bank, which benefited from the strong economy and investment banking.\nInfineon, a major company with a market capitalization of over $67 billion will publish its numbers on Wednesday. It will be followed by Linde and Siemens Healthineers, which are valued at over $218 billion and $56 billion, respectively.\nThe other key companies to watch will be those that will publish their financial results next week are Siemens Energy, Commerzbank, Siemens, Mercedes-Benz, and Deutsche Boerse.\nCommerzbank will be in focus as it releases its financial results, which are expected to be strong as other European banks have done.\nAdditionally, the DAX Index will react to this week\u2019s US earnings dump by companies like Amazon and Google. Some of the other top companies that will publish their numbers this week are AMD, Merck, Eli Lilly, AbbVie, and Qualcomm.\nUS and Iran talks\nThe other major catalyst for the DAX Index will be on geopolitics. Indeed, the index has done well this week because tensions between the United States and Iran have eased.\nThe two sides have started talking, which has reduced tensions between the two countries. This explains why the price of crude oil has crashed this week.\nStill, a lot can change as we saw last year when Israel attacked Iran as it was talking with the United States. Therefore, deteriorating talks between the two countries will lead to elevated tensions, which will knock the DAX and other indices.\nThe other major catalyst for the index will be a potential interview of Kevin Warsh, who was named the Federal Reserve Chairman nominee.\nThe post Top catalysts for the DAX Index: ECB decision, earnings, Iran tensions appeared first on Invezz\nRead More\nTop catalysts for the DAX Index: ECB decision, earnings, Iran tensions\nShare:\nThe German DAX Index rebounded on Tuesday, rising by 1.10%, and nearing its all-time high of \u20ac25,500.

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic late?cycle drama mode: German blue chips are swinging between confident rallies and sudden risk?off waves. Instead of clean trends, we\u2019re seeing sharp squeezes followed by quick profit?taking, a textbook mix of fear and FOMO. Price action has been hovering around important zones, with the index repeatedly testing upper ranges and then snapping back whenever macro headlines spook investors. Think choppy grind, not smooth moonshot.\nVolatility is not extreme, but it is clearly elevated compared to the calm, low?vol days we had when central banks were firmly in control. For intraday traders, this is prime hunting ground: fast moves, big intraday reversals, and tons of fake breakouts. Swing traders, on the other hand, are forced to respect wider stops and be brutally honest about risk, because the market is punishing anyone who gets stubborn on direction.\nThe Story: To understand the current DAX mood, you have to zoom out and look at the full Eurozone macro picture, not just one index chart.\n1. ECB, Rates, and the Euro Trap\nThe European Central Bank is walking a tightrope. Inflation has cooled compared to the peak, but it is not \u201cdead and buried,\u201d and the growth picture in Europe is fragile. Markets are constantly repricing expectations: will the ECB cut aggressively to support growth, or stay cautious to avoid reigniting inflation?\nThis tug?of?war hits the DAX in two ways:\n\u2022 Via the Euro: A stronger euro weighs on German exporters because it makes their products more expensive overseas. A weaker euro, on the other hand, boosts export competitiveness but can revive inflation through higher import costs, especially energy.\n\u2022 Via Valuations: Lower rate expectations support higher equity valuations, especially for quality blue chips and growth names. But every time ECB speakers hint at being more hawkish than hoped, you see sellers step in across European indices.\nRight now, the market is stuck in a phase where cuts are on the horizon but not fully trusted. That leaves the DAX trading more like a barometer of shifting expectations than a clean growth story.\n2. German Industry: Still the Sick Man of Europe?\nGermany\u2019s industrial data has been a recurring headache. Manufacturing orders have been inconsistent, confidence surveys remain fragile, and the once-unshakeable export machine is under structural pressure from:\n- Global competition in autos and machinery\n- The energy shock fallout after the gas crisis\n- Slower Chinese demand and supply-chain re?wiring\nYet, the market is forward?looking. DAX heavyweights in autos, chemicals, and industrials are getting bid whenever there\u2019s even a hint that the downturn is stabilizing. Traders are not buying old earnings, they\u2019re buying the idea of a cyclical bottom. That makes this phase high risk: if macro data confirms stabilization, the bulls can run; but if numbers roll over again, the downside surprise could be brutal.\n3. Sector Rotation Inside the DAX\nUnder the hood, the DAX is not moving in a straight line. There\u2019s a constant tug?of?war between:\n- Defensives: Healthcare, utilities, consumer staples \u2013 the classic safety plays that catch flows every time recession fear headlines hit.\n- Export Cyclicals: Autos, industrials, and chemicals \u2013 loved when the global cycle looks better, dumped when PMIs disappoint.\n- Rate?Sensitive Names: Financials and growth stocks that run on shifts in yield curves and rate expectations.\nThis rotation creates confusing intraday behavior: the index might look calm, but under the surface, some components are in full-on mini bu"

Price action is hovering in an important zone near recent highs, with intraday spikes followed by quick profit-taking. That is classic late-cycle behavior: buyers are still showing up, but nobody wants to be the last one in before a possible correction. Volatility is not exploding, but it is picking up compared with the ultra-quiet phases we saw earlier, signaling that big money is repositioning rather than blindly buying the dip.\nInstead of a clean trend, we are seeing a choppy, stair-step structure: strong green sessions when macro headlines help risk sentiment, followed by sudden pullbacks when data reminds traders that Germany\u2019s economy is still fragile. Think of it as a tug of war: European optimism vs. German reality. The index keeps testing resistance zones above, but each attempt higher runs into sellers, while downside dips are still getting defended by institutional bids.\nThe Story: To understand the DAX right now, you have to zoom out and look at the European macro cocktail that is driving every candle on the chart.\n1. ECB & Rate Expectations:\nThe European Central Bank is the big puppet master. Recent commentary from Frankfurt has stayed cautious: inflation is slower than in 2022\u20132023 but still not fully tamed, especially in services. Markets are now pricing in rate cuts, but not in a straight line. Every new inflation print or hawkish comment triggers a mini risk-off move across European equities.\nDAX traders are basically gaming one question: will the ECB cut early enough to save growth, but not so fast that it screams panic? If the market believes in a smooth \u201csoft landing\u201d, blue chips in the index \u2013 especially industrials, autos, and financials \u2013 can push higher. If the narrative flips to \u201clate and too little\u201d or \u201ccutting into a real downturn\u201d, the same names can get hit hard as earnings revisions roll in.\n2. German Data \u2013 The Growth Headache:\nGerman macro numbers have been sending mixed signals:\n- Manufacturing & PMI: Factory activity has been flirting with contraction territory for a long stretch. Weak global demand, especially from China, is hurting German exporters. Every slightly better PMI reading sparks talk of a bottoming process, but the overall trend is still sluggish rather than booming.\n- Industrial Output: Output figures have been unstable, swinging between mild improvement and renewed weakness. That keeps investors nervous: nobody wants to price in a full recovery while the hard data remains fragile.\n- Recession Fears: Germany has been dancing on the edge of technical recession, with periods of stagnation and shallow declines in GDP. That macro overhang is the cloud above the DAX, limiting how euphoric any rally can get.\n3. Sector Stories \u2013 Autos, Industrials, Financials:\nThe DAX is not just a number \u2013 it is a cluster of global heavyweights.\n- Autos (VW, BMW, Mercedes): Sentiment is torn between electrification hype and margin fears. Competition from Chinese EV makers, regulatory pressure, and slowing global demand are squeezing the narrative. When we get positive headlines on Chinese stimulus or stronger US consumer data, autos get a relief pop. When new tariffs, regulatory issues, or demand downgrades hit, the same names pull the index lower in a hurry.\n- Industrials & Exporters: These names live and die by the global cycle. Any sign of stabilization in Europe and the US, or better-than-feared data from Asia, brings buyers back. But the bid is tactical, not blindly bullish; traders are quick to lig"

                "body": "Small changes are often the key to achieving greatness. The 2024 Los Angeles Dodgers already had a powerhouse lineup when they traded for Tommy Edman, known for his stellar glovework, to bolster their defense. Then Edman became a hitting machine in the playoffs, leading the team to a decisive series victory over the Mets en route to their World Series triumph.\nAston Martin took a similar approach with the new 2026 Vantage S, implementing subtle upgrades to elevate the already enthralling Vantage to a new level of driver engagement. The Vantage S isn't concerned with a stratospheric power output or setting blistering lap records, with Aston Martin's attention instead centered on precise changes to the chassis components to improve handling and provide more feedback. The winding mountain roads outside Los Angeles where we drove the Vantage S revealed a car that carves up corners with unwavering confidence and unbounded bravado.\nFor Sale Near You\nSee all results for new 2026 Aston Martin Vantage for sale near 94112\nAlthough Aston's focus was on handling improvements, the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 also got some attention. With a healthy 670 horsepower, the S variant produces 14 more ponies than the standard Vantage. The AMG-sourced engine's torque rating remains 590 pound-feet, all directed to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. Aston Martin says the added muscle and adjustments to the launch control result in a 3.3-second sprint to 60 mph, a tenth better than before. But it should go even quicker, since a standard Vantage only needed 3.2 seconds to reach 60 mph in Car and Driver testing.\nBehind the wheel, the thumping eight-cylinder heart feels ferocious, ready to catapult the Vantage toward the next corner. Despite the presence of forced induction, the throttle response is immediate, and the power delivery feels surprisingly linear. The only thing better than the g-forces thrusting you back into the scalloped bucket seat is the thunderous engine note, an instant shot of auditory adrenaline.\nWhile the engine's plentiful power and fierce soundtrack are intoxicating, the engineers in Gaydon directed most of their attention to the chassis. The revised setup features new camber, toe, and caster settings, and the Bilstein adaptive dampers are retuned as well. Aston Martin also mounted the rear subframe directly to the body, replacing two rubber bushings found in the standard Vantage, for a stiffer overall structure. Still, Aston wanted balance, so it softened the transmission mounts by 10 percent to better manage powertrain movement by lessening the abruptness of vertical motions and reduced the rear spring rate for better low-speed ride quality.\nThe changes don't drastically alter the Vantage's personality, but they help this car feel incredibly responsive and agile. The steering is dialed in, with weight building progressively, clearly communicating how well the front end is gripping the pavement. The suspension glides over most bumps while minimizing body roll. As you throttle out of a corner, the rear end squats and loads up before rocketing forward, like Shohei Ohtani anticipating when to unleash his potent home-run swing.\nThe Vantage S flows through twisty sections with ease, but instead of dissecting the corners with clinical precision, it plays in them, romping around with boisterous delight. The Vantage seems to revel when you drive it hard, inviting you to carry more speed through the corner and get more aggressive with the accelerator as you exit. And while the Vantage is capable of heart-racing speeds, the carbon-ceramic brakes slow it down with authority and immediacy.\nThe visual changes are minimal but impactful. New carbon-fiber blades protrude from the hood vents, and not only do they look mean, but they also improve heat extraction from the engine bay. Aston Martin also fitted a decklid spoiler, and while it may look inconsequential, the automaker says it adds 97 pounds of downforce at"
