                "body": "Analysts: Fed\u2019s December Rate Decision Becomes Key Catalyst for Gold\u2019s Next Move\nAs of the end of November 2025, the gold market is exhibiting complex dynamics under the influence of multiple key factors. Although it may maintain a volatile pattern in the short term due to uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy path, many institutional analysts believe its long-term structural bull market foundation remains solid. The key drivers determining the next price direction are primarily focused on monetary policy, the US dollar, asset allocation rotation, and underlying geopolitical logic.\nThe direction of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, especially the interest rate path, is the most critical variable for the current gold market. Sameer Samana of Wells Fargo Investment Institute pointed out that the Fed\u2019s policy focus has clearly shifted from curbing inflation to concerns about the labor market. Even with inflation still hovering above 3%, market expectations for rate cuts have become very strong, creating an extremely favorable environment for gold.\nThe warming expectations for rate cuts directly lower real interest rates. For non-yielding assets like gold, the opportunity cost of holding it decreases accordingly. Samana emphasized that as rates come down, especially real interest rates, that will put a bid under gold. Roukaya Ibrahim of BCA Research also shares this view, believing that even if the Fed holds steady in December, its baseline scenario of continuing rate cuts next year will lead to lower real rates, which is positive for gold.\nMeanwhile, the long-term outlook for the US dollar is another pillar supporting gold. Samana analyzed that the US dollar index previously plummeted nearly 15% from a high of 110 down to 96, and the subsequent rebound was weak at only 3%-4%, which is a negative signal. He expects that over the next 12 to 15 months, the dollar will at best move sideways, unlikely to regain strength. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated gold cheaper for overseas buyers, thereby boosting demand.\nBehind the dollar\u2019s weakness lies the deeper global trend of \u201cde-dollarization.\u201d Samana noted that since the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions in 2022, central banks worldwide have been rethinking the allocation of US dollar assets in their foreign exchange reserves. This trend continues under the new administration\u2019s differentiated policies. The ongoing gold purchases by central banks to diversify risks provide a solid and lasting \u201cstructural underpinning\u201d for the gold market.\nBesides interest rates and the dollar, bonds struggle to serve as traditional safe havens in a high-inflation environment, and the attractiveness of former alternatives like cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) has declined in the past 6-12 months, which also benefits gold.\nWhile the boom in AI-related tech stocks previously attracted global capital into US dollar assets, Samana believes \u201cAI now is a global play.\u201d Funds are no longer concentrated in the US but are flowing into related equities in other regions like Taiwan and South Korea. This reduces the relative attractiveness of the US market and increases uncertainty for global investors. In this context, gold, having \u201cstood the test of time,\u201d becomes the preferred asset to fill the diversification gap.\nHowever, precious metals still face short-term challenges, particularly concerns that economic slowdown could suppress silver more than gold, as silver has significant industrial demand components.\nIn summary, as of the end of 2025, signals from Fed policy will be the direct catalyst for a price breakout, while the long-term bullish narrative is built on a solid foundation of a commencing rate-cutting cycle, a trend of US dollar weakness, global geopolitical uncertainty, and sustained diversification by central banks and investors. Samana pointed out that gold\u2019s outperformance trend relative to stocks has lasted nearly four years. This quiet shift may well signal go"

According to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool, futures now put the odds of a Fed rate cut in December at about 87%, up from 85% just a day earlier \u2013 a small move that still shows conviction building around monetary easing. Recent comments from San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly and Fed governor Christopher Waller have fed that narrative, even as some regional Fed officials argue for holding rates higher for longer until inflation looks closer to the 2% target. Because gold doesn\u2019t pay interest, it tends to look more attractive when bond yields fall and the dollar weakens \u2013 and the greenback is on track for its steepest weekly drop in four months as traders lean into the easing story, even in a holiday-thinned week with US markets shut for Thanksgiving.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Metals are reading the rate cut playbook.\nGold\u2019s rally isn\u2019t happening in isolation: silver and platinum are both on course for chunky weekly gains too, and even palladium is set to finish the week higher despite a small daily dip. That cross-metal strength suggests traders see a broader shift in macro conditions, with lower real yields and a softer dollar propping up hard assets. If upcoming data keeps nudging central banks \u2013 especially the Fed \u2013 toward easier policy, that could funnel more money into commodities while taking some shine off financials and other rate-sensitive sectors that had benefited from higher yields.\nThe bigger picture: Policy signals are steering global assets.\nThe tug-of-war over interest rates is increasingly about signaling as much as economics, with every Fed comment helping set the tone for global markets. At the same time, Europe\u2019s latest readings on growth, inflation, and jobs will shape expectations for the European Central Bank\u2019s next moves, and softer data would only add to the sense that major economies are edging toward looser policy. A world of easing or even just less-tight policy tends to mean weaker currencies and firmer real assets, affecting everything from government borrowing costs to corporate investment plans. Investors are watching how those policy signals ripple through currencies, bonds, and commodities \u2013 and metals like gold are often among the first to react.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 1 hour ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "OPEC+ members are expected to stick with their decision to pause oil production increases when the group meets online this Sunday, signaling a cautious approach amid growing signs of oversupply and persistent weakness in prices.\nDelegates told reporters the meeting is likely to be \u201cstraightforward,\u201d with ministers simply reaffirming the policy agreed earlier this month to suspend output hikes during the first quarter of 2026. The pause, driven largely by Saudi Arabia and its partners, reflects concern that global inventories are rising faster than demand as Brent crude continues to hover near $63 a barrel.\nThe meeting comes at a delicate moment for energy markets. U.S. President Donald Trump is pressing for a Ukraine peace deal that could eventually free up more Russian oil supply, while production elsewhere continues to surge. Analysts say the combination of easing geopolitical risk and resilient non-OPEC output is weighing heavily on market sentiment.\nOPEC\u2019s own analysis points to faster growth from the United States, Brazil, and Guyana, with non-OPEC liquids expected to rise by about 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) next year. Global demand, meanwhile, is forecast to increase by 1.6 million bpd to 106.2 million bpd \u2014 strong, but no longer enough to tighten balances. The result is a market shifting from deficit to balance, and potentially toward surplus, if demand softens further.\nThe International Energy Agency projects an even looser picture, warning that inventories could swell by as much as 5 million bpd in the first quarter of 2026 \u2014 a record glut that would further pressure prices.\nStill, OPEC Secretary-General Haitham al Ghais pushed back against talk of oversupply, accusing some media of misinterpreting the group\u2019s latest Monthly Oil Market Report. \u201cThere was a misrepresentation by some media... about the market being in a surplus next year,\u201d al Ghais told CNBC, insisting that OPEC expects a balanced market in 2026.\nFor now, OPEC+ plans to maintain voluntary output cuts by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and others through early 2026. But several members have begun reviewing long-term production capacity, suggesting that if prices stabilize, incremental increases could resume later in the year.\nMarket watchers expect Sunday\u2019s meeting to confirm the pause and underscore a wait-and-see strategy \u2014 one designed to preserve unity and flexibility as the world\u2019s largest oil alliance navigates slowing demand growth, rising supply, and an uncertain geopolitical outlook.\nBy Tom Kool for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n- Rocket Attack Forces Shutdown of Gas Field in Kurdistan\n- Indian Banks Eye Return to Russian Oil Trade\n- Sanctions Snarl Lukoil\u2014Baghdad Pays Up to Protect 480,000 bpd of Oil Production"

OPEC liquids fuel output increases by 0.1 Mb/d in 2025 and 2026 compared to last month.

Natural gas output was also revised higher in 2025 and 2026 by 1 BCF/d compared to last month\u2019s STEO.\nNatural gas prices for residential consumers are expected to rise only by 2% this winter to $13.80/MCF.\nA warmer winter is expected in 2025/2026 leading to lower consumption of natural gas compared to last winter.\nGrowth in electric power consumption is concentrated in the West South Central Region (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas) with 34% of all US growth coming from this region in 2025 and 66% in 2026. For the US as a whole electricity sales increase by 2.4% in 2025 and by 2.6% in 2026.\nOECD stocks rise to the early 2021 level by the end of 2026.\nUS natural gas output jumps by 5.1 BCF/d in 2025 (4.4%).\nConsumption of natural gas rises by 1.3% in 2025 and is roughly flat in 2026.\nMost of the increased natural gas output is exported with exports increasing by 4.5 BCF/d from 2024 to 2026, an increase of 36% over 2 years (a 26.4% increase in 2025 and a 7.6% increase in 2026 natural gas exports).\nFor the past 12 months tight oil output has been pretty flat.\nIn the Permian scenarios above I try to match the AEO 2025 reference case for the Southwest region with non-Permian C+C and Permian conventional oil deducted (about 800 kb/d for 2024 to 2050). The Permian Garzon case uses analysis by Jorge Garzon from Novi Labs on Tier 1 and Tier 2 remaining locations in the Permian Basin to arrive at a total of 107 thousand wells. For that scenario low oil prices are assumed (under $70/b in 2025 $) so that lower tier locations are not profitable to drill and complete. The medium scenario assumes higher oil prices up to $85/b in 2025$ so that some tier 3 and lower wells are completed (about 33 thousand of them). The high scenario assumes even higher prices (perhaps up to $120/b in 2025$) with another 42 thousand wells more than the medium scenario completed. Note that about 55 thousand wells had been completed by June 30, 2025.\nIn the grand scheme there are about 1500 Gb of remaining C+C global resources so the difference of 21 Gb between the low and high Permian scenarios is small, less than 1.5% of remaining crude oil resources. Note that from 2012 to 2024 about 95% of the increase in World C+C came from Permian Basin tight oil (5080 of 5341 kb/d of the World C+C increase from 2012 to 2024). Chart below shows World C+C minus Permian tight oil from 2012 to 2024, which increased by 261 kb/d over that period or an annual average rate of 22 kb/d."

                "body": "EUR/USD Analysis: The euro attempts to recover the 1.16000 level\nOver the past five trading sessions, the EUR/USD pair has begun to show a steady upward movement, reflected in a recovery of more than 0.7%. For now, the buying pressure supporting the euro comes partly from the recent weakness in the U.S. dollar, along with a neutral stance from the European Central Bank (ECB)\u2014factors that have allowed the European currency to regain ground consistently. As long as these elements remain relevant catalysts, buying pressure may continue dominating short-term movements in EUR/USD.\nThe European Central Bank takes the lead\nWith the final month of the year approaching, markets are focused on the policy decisions that will shape the outlook for both the euro and the dollar in December. On one hand, the ECB maintains a clearer perspective regarding its year-end strategy, in contrast to the Federal Reserve, whose economic data releases were disrupted weeks ago by the U.S. government shutdown, causing delays and gaps in key indicators.\nAt the moment, the ECB has not signaled any meaningful changes for December and continues leaning toward maintaining interest rates stable at 2.00% in its deposit facility. This outlook is supported by the ECBWATCH probability model, which assigns a 96.7% chance of no rate changes at the upcoming December 16 meeting.\nSource: ECBWATCH\nIn contrast, the Federal Reserve\u2019s direction remains unclear. The central bank has faced weeks of shifting expectations and indecision, complicating market interpretation ahead of the December 11 meeting. Currently, market consensus points to a 0.25% rate cut from the existing 4.00% benchmark. What is noteworthy is that demand for fixed-income assets in the U.S. had increased in recent weeks since Treasury yields remain higher than those in the eurozone. This has made dollar-denominated investments more attractive, but if a rate cut reduces this differential, the dollar could lose appeal, encouraging a shift toward euro-denominated investments\u2014seen as stable and with no major changes expected in the short term.\nAdditionally, the more flexible monetary policy anticipated from the Federal Reserve has begun to reduce structural demand for the U.S. dollar. Lower rates diminish the appeal of fixed-income assets and, consequently, the demand for dollars needed to purchase them. This is reflected in the recent behavior of the DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength and which has now fallen below the 100-point mark, indicating a dominant weakening in dollar performance.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nOverall, it can be said that the European Central Bank has begun to take the lead. Its stable and neutral stance has provided greater confidence in euro-denominated investments, while the Federal Reserve remains in a state of uncertainty that points toward lower rates\u2014making it more difficult for the dollar to maintain its attractiveness. If this dynamic persists, the euro may continue gaining ground, supporting consistent buying pressure on EUR/USD in the coming sessions.\nEUR/USD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Downtrend may be at risk: Since mid-September, bearish movements have maintained a descending trendline, pushing EUR/USD to levels last seen in April. However, the recent return of buying strength is now testing this trendline, and if bullish pressure continues, the short-term bearish structure may be at risk. This could open the door to a relevant bullish bias, potentially ending the downtrend in place since September. Therefore, price action in the coming sessions will be crucial in determining whether the trendline fails, giving way to a lateral formation or even a more stable bullish structure.\n- RSI: The RSI indicator continues to oscillate around the 50 level, suggesting that neutrality remains dominant in the balance between buying and selling impulses. If this pattern persists, it may lead to a period of short-term indecision.\n- MACD: The MACD shows a simi"

The pair loses ground as the US Dollar (USD) holds ground after three days of losses. However, the Greenback may face challenges amid growing expectations of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in December.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are now pricing in over an 87% chance of a 25 bps cut at the upcoming December meeting, a sharp rise from the 39% probability seen just a week earlier. Traders are also anticipating three additional rate cuts by the end of 2026.\nThese expectations for additional rate cuts firmed after reports indicated that White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the leading candidate for the next Fed chair. Traders see Hassett as aligned with US President Donald Trump\u2019s preference for lower interest rates.\nThe EUR/USD pair may find support after European Central Bank (ECB) Minutes showed policymakers favored keeping rates unchanged amid ongoing uncertainty, with some suggesting no further easing may be needed. The Governing Council viewed policy as \u201cin a good place,\u201d backed by resilient growth and inflation nearing target.\nSeveral policymakers argued the rate-cut cycle may already be over, given that the economic and inflation outlook broadly aligns with the ECB\u2019s September projections and current favorable conditions persist.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are esp"

                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/amid-low-trading-volumes-eur-usd-remains-stable-at-1-1596-with-the-dollar-under-pressure/",
                "body": "The EUR/USD remains steady as US markets close for Thanksgiving, with expectations of a potential Federal Reserve rate reduction weighing on the US dollar. Trading at 1.1596, the Euro seems set to end the week with gains. The CME FedWatch Tool indicates an 85% probability of a 25-basis point rate cut.\nUS inflation reports, weak retail sales, and falling consumer confidence create pressure on the Fed, despite lower-than-expected jobless claims. Meanwhile, the Eurozone shows a slight improvement in consumer confidence, with no current plans from the ECB to cut rates.\nEurozone Consumer Confidence\nThe Eurozone\u2019s Consumer Confidence remains steady at a November eight-month high of -14.2. Economic data reveals increased confidence in services, retail trade, and construction, though industry shows some weakness.\nThe EUR/USD shows mild bullish momentum, hovering below the 1.1600 mark. A breakout could lead to testing new highs, while a dip might target earlier lows. The DXY stands flat at 99.57 amid dovish Fed remarks and consistent US data flow.\nThe Eurozone inflation data, managed by the ECB, is essential for the Euro\u2019s value, and economic strength influences interest rate decisions. Economic indicators and trade balances affect the Euro\u2019s performance, especially from the largest economies in the Eurozone.\nWe are seeing a familiar pattern emerge as the US heads into its Thanksgiving holiday, reminiscent of a similar period a few years back when thin liquidity and dovish central bank talk dominated markets. Today, with the EUR/USD trading near 1.0950, the key dynamic remains the market\u2019s expectation of future interest rate moves from the Federal Reserve. This quiet period offers a moment to position for what comes next.\nFederal Reserve and ECB Policies\nThe Fed\u2019s stance is creating tension, as recent US inflation data for October 2025 came in at 2.8%, still stubbornly above their target. Despite this, a cooling labor market, with the latest JOLTS report showing a decline in job openings to 8.5 million, has traders pricing in future cuts. The CME FedWatch Tool now indicates a nearly 60% probability of a rate cut by the end of the first quarter of 2026.\nAcross the Atlantic, the European Central Bank is in a similar holding pattern, as the latest Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices for the Eurozone registered 2.5%. While this is a significant drop from the highs seen in previous years, officials remain cautious about declaring victory over inflation and are signaling no immediate cuts. This creates a subtle policy divergence that we must watch closely in the coming weeks.\nFor derivative traders, this uncertainty suggests that options strategies could be particularly useful. Buying straddles or strangles on EUR/USD ahead of the next major US inflation or jobs report could be a way to profit from a significant price move in either direction. Implied volatility remains moderate, making such positions relatively cheap to enter right now.\nLooking at the charts, the pair is currently struggling to overcome resistance at the psychological 1.1000 level. We see significant support forming around the 1.0880 mark, which has held up on previous tests this month. A decisive break of this range will likely depend on the next major data catalyst.\nThe most recent Non-Farm Payrolls report, which showed the US economy added 160,000 jobs, reinforces the narrative of a slowly decelerating economy. This supports the case for eventual Fed easing but does little to force their hand in the immediate term. Therefore, we can expect the current sideways, data-dependent trading environment to persist through the start of December."

Despite concerns over backloaded fiscal tightening, the broader signal of improving public finances helped stabilize the currency.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers "

This was sufficient to please the bond market at least for now, sending yields across the curve lower.\nHowever, this was pretty much where the good news ended. The OBR downgraded UK growth in 2026 to 1.4% down from 1.9%, and it also upwardly revised inflation. Welfare spending is soaring, living standards are expected to rise more slowly, and the tax burden will reach a record high of 38% of GDP.\nWhile the markets liked the larger fiscal margin, there is still reason to be cautious given increased spending in the near term, whilst the tax hikes will take effect later. This means that if economic growth falls short of expectations, tax revenues could be lower and spending higher, eroding the headroom once again. With the tax hikes back-loaded, the plan's credibility won't be known for some time.\nThe Bank of England is still expected to cut interest rates at the December meeting, which limits sterling's upside.\nThe USD is rising today but is lower for the week amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its December meeting. U.S. markets are closed for Thanksgiving today, so volumes could be thin.\nGBP/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nGBP/USD has recovered from its 1.3040 November low, rising above 1.32 and the falling trendline, which, combined with the RSI above 50, keeps buyers hopeful of further gains.\nBuyers will look to extend the recovery above the 200 SMA at 1.33. A rise above 1.3350 puts the pair on a more stable footing.\nOn the downside, support is seen at 1.32, and below, here, 1.31 support comes into focus. A break below 1.30 could spur a deeper sell-off towards 1.27.\nEUR/USD hovers below 1.16 ahead of EZ consumer confidence & ECB meeting minutes\n- ECB is expected to leave rates unchanged across 2026\n- Expectations of a December Fed rate cut have risen to 85%\n- EUR/USD needs to rise above the 50 SMA to extend its recovery\nEUR/USD is holding steady, just below 116, and its highest level since mid-November, as investors look towards a busy economic calendar at the end of this month, including inflation data from Germany, the eurozone's largest economy, on Friday.\nToday, German consumer confidence showed a slight improvement heading into December as households showed more willingness to spend ahead of the holiday season. This was a bright point in data after figures earlier in the week showed that German GDP stagnated and Ifo business sentiment deteriorated.\nLooking ahead, eurozone consumer confidence is due later today, along with the minutes from the meeting at which the central bank left interest rates unchanged.\nOn the policy front, the ECB is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged through 2026, supported by resilient economic growth and inflation near the 2% target.\nMeanwhile, the US donor is on track for its worst weekly performance in four months amid thin volumes due to the US Thanksgiving holiday.\nThe US dollar has come under pressure amid rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the December meeting. Softer-than-expected U.S. economic data and dovish comments from several Fed officials now have the market pricing in an 85% probability of a rate cut next month, up from 30% last week.\nThe ECB-Fed rate path diversion could support EUR/USD higher.\nEU"

The pair earlier touched 1.3273, its highest level in over four weeks, before consolidating amid thin liquidity conditions due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Despite momentum fatigue, the broader setup remains constructive, with the pound supported by expectations of a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut in December and the market\u2019s increasing conviction that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will follow suit.\nU.K. Fiscal Outlook: Reeves\u2019s Tax-Heavy Budget Reshapes Market Expectations\nChancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s Autumn Budget provided a short-term boost to sterling confidence. Her fiscal framework doubled the U.K.\u2019s fiscal headroom to \u00a322 billion, well above the \u00a315 billion forecast. While this initially calmed gilt markets and sent 10-year yields down toward 4.01%, the underlying budget composition revealed longer-term challenges. Growth forecasts were downgraded to 1.4% for 2026 from 1.9%, while the tax burden is projected to hit 38% of GDP, the highest in modern history.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also raised its inflation outlook, noting that welfare spending is expanding at a pace inconsistent with real wage growth. Markets interpreted this as a fiscal trade-off \u2014 higher near-term spending offset by delayed tax hikes, leaving limited room for policy mistakes if growth undershoots projections. While this strengthened the pound short-term, the risk of fiscal slippage and back-loaded revenue increases limits medium-term optimism.\nBank of England Signals Policy Shift Ahead of December Decision\nTraders are now pricing in a 70% probability of a BoE rate cut at the December 19 meeting, with overnight index swaps implying an end-2025 policy rate near 4.25%, down from 5.25% today. Governor Andrew Bailey noted in recent remarks that the disinflation trend is \u201cbroadly in line with expectations,\u201d hinting at potential flexibility. The central bank faces slowing wage growth \u2014 average weekly earnings dropped to 5.1% YoY, the weakest since early 2024 \u2014 alongside deteriorating retail sales, which fell 0.4% month-over-month in October.\nWhile a rate cut might relieve mortgage stress and household debt burdens, it could also amplify capital outflows if the Fed delays its easing cycle. For now, sterling\u2019s resilience reflects expectations of synchronized U.K.-U.S. rate adjustments rather than standalone domestic strength.\nDollar Weakness Underpins GBP/USD Strength\nOn the other side of the pair, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has retreated to 99.48, its lowest in over four months. A combination of weaker macro prints and dovish commentary from senior Fed officials has pressured the dollar further. Durable goods orders rose just 0.5%, Chicago PMI fell sharply to 36.3, and jobless claims hovered at 216,000, signaling weakening business sentiment and moderating labor strength.\nFed policymakers, including John Williams and Christopher Waller, reinforced the case for a December rate cut, while forward rate swaps now price in an 85% probability of policy easing at the upcoming FOMC meeting. As yields on 10-year Treasuries fell to 4.17%, the greenback\u2019s yield advantage eroded, boosting cyclical currencies like the pound.\nTechnical Structure: Bulls Eye 1.3350 as Momentum Builds\nTechnically, GBP/USD (symbol: GBPUSD) has maintained a strong recovery structure since bouncing from its 1.3040 November low. The pair cleared a descending trendline and is now testing resistance at 1.3280, near the 200-day EMA. A sustained break above 1.3295\u20131.33"

This level is a major test, where the 50-day and 100-day moving averages have consistently stopped rallies throughout November 2025. A decisive break here could signal a real shift in the market\u2019s direction.\nExpecting A Breakout\nDriving this strength is the belief that the Reserve Bank of Australia will hold its cash rate firm at 3.60% in the upcoming December meeting. This view was reinforced after Australia\u2019s Q3 2025 inflation report came in hotter than expected at 5.6%, and the October jobs report showed unemployment holding steady near 3.7%. This persistent inflation makes it difficult for the RBA to consider easing policy.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar is weakening because we are growing more certain the Federal Reserve will cut rates in December 2025. Recent data supports this, with the latest US Consumer Price Index for October 2025 cooling to 3.1% and retail sales figures showing a slight contraction. This divergence in central bank policy is the primary force lifting the AUD/USD pair.\nFor traders expecting a breakout above the current resistance, buying call options with a strike price around 0.6600 could capture the potential upside. A bull call spread could also be used to lower the cost of entry while still profiting from a move above the moving average cluster. Momentum indicators like the MACD turning positive give us some confidence in this upward push.\nHowever, since this technical barrier has held strong before, we must consider the possibility of another rejection. Traders who are skeptical of a breakout could look at buying puts or establishing bear put spreads if the price fails at these moving averages. A move back toward the 21-day average near 0.6506 would be the first sign of this failure."

                "body": "Australian Dollar rises as inflation fuels RBA rate hike prospects\n- The Australian Dollar strengthens as hotter-than-expected inflation reduces expectations of the RBA easing and rekindles the risk of another rate hike.\n- Australia\u2019s Private Sector Credit rose 0.7% MoM in October, beating expectations of a 0.6% increase.\n- Traders expect three more rate cuts by 2026 as Kevin Hassett\u2019s Fed chair prospects reinforce expectations for Trump-favored lower rates.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) advances against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, extending its gains for the sixth consecutive day. The AUD strengthens against major peers as hotter-than-expected inflation tempers expectations of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) easing and revives the risk of another rate hike. Wednesday\u2019s data showed consumer prices rising for a fourth consecutive month in October, moving further above the RBA\u2019s 2%\u20133% target band.\nThe RBA is expected to maintain the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 3.6% in December as inflation remains above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target range. RBA officials noted that the unemployment rate has risen slightly, but the job market remains healthy and is expected to continue doing so. The ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures showed, as of November 27, the December 2025 contract trading at 96.41, implying a 6% chance that the RBA will cut the cash rate to 3.35% from 3.60% at its upcoming Board meeting.\nReserve Bank of Australia reported on Friday that Private Sector Credit rose 0.7% MoM in October, beating both the prior reading and expectations of a 0.6% increase. Annual growth edged up to 7.3% from a revised 7.2%.\nThe AUD/USD pair also draws support as the US Dollar (USD) struggles amid rising odds of Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut bets in December. Traders are also anticipating three additional rate cuts by the end of 2026 after reports indicated that White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the leading candidate for the next Fed chair. Traders see Hassett as aligned with US President Donald Trump\u2019s preference for lower interest rates.\nUS Dollar struggles amid rising Fed rate cut bets\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is facing challenges and trading around 99.50 at the time of writing.\n- The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in a more than 87% chance that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, up from the 39% probability that markets priced a week ago.\n- The US Department of Labor (DOL) reported on Wednesday that Initial Jobless Claims fell to 216,000 for the week ending November 22, down 6,000 from the previous week\u2019s revised figure. The result was stronger than the market expectation of 225,000. Meanwhile, the 4-week moving average eased by 1,000 to 223,750.\n- The US Producer Price Index (PPI) remained steady at 2.7% year-over-year in September, matching expectations and August\u2019s reading and suggesting that inflationary pressures have stabilized. Core PPI eased to 2.6% from 2.9%, undershooting the forecast of 2.7%.\n- The US Retail Sales rose by 0.2% month-over-month (MoM) in September, slowing from the 0.6% increase seen in August, indicating more cautious consumer spending. Separately, the Conference Board reported a sharp deterioration in household sentiment, with Consumer Confidence sliding 6.8 points to 88.7 in November from 95.5 in October.\n- Fed Governor Christopher Waller told Fox Business on Monday that his primary concern is the weakening labour market, adding that inflation is \u201cnot a big problem\u201d given the recent softness in employment. He also said the September payrolls figure will likely be revised lower and warned that concentrated hiring is \u201cnot a good sign,\u201d indicating his support for a near-term rate cut.\n- The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released Private Capital Expenditure on Thursday, which rose by 6.4% quarter-over-quarter in "

The pair is currently trading in the 0.6520\u20130.6540 USD range per Australian dollar. Persistently high inflation in Australia strengthens expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia will not rush to cut interest rates, which supports the value of the Australian currency. At the same time, the US dollar is weakening, as investors increasingly assume that the Federal Reserve may soon shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy stance. The combination of these factors helps sustain the upward trend in the AUD/USD pair.\nSource: xStation5\nWhat is driving the AUD/USD today?\nHigh inflation in Australia and RBA policy\nThe latest inflation readings from Australia have once again surprised markets with their strength, showing that price pressures remain significantly higher than previously expected. Core inflation also remains above the central bank\u2019s target, reinforcing the belief among investors that the RBA is unlikely to ease monetary policy in the near term. Keeping interest rates unchanged creates favorable conditions for further strengthening of the AUD. Inflation data have also improved the technical picture, increasing investor demand for the Australian currency.\nRising expectations for Fed rate cuts and a weaker US dollar\nIn the US macroeconomic environment, expectations are growing that the Federal Reserve may soon take a more dovish stance. The increasing likelihood of a rate cut reduces the attractiveness of the US dollar, which in turn supports developed-market currencies such as the AUD. This divergence in the outlook for monetary policy between the two central banks currently works in Australia\u2019s favor.

                "body": "- Tokyo inflation tops forecasts\n- BOJ hike odds sit at 56% for December\n- USD/JPY breaks mid-October uptrend\n- Momentum signals show fading bullish strength\nSummary\nTokyo\u2019s hotter-than-expected inflation has traders bracing for a BOJ rate hike as early as December, with odds climbing sharply for further tightening in 2026. While USD/JPY has held firm for weeks, the break of its recent uptrend and fading momentum suggest the bullish run may be losing steam. With Governor Ueda\u2019s speech looming and carry trade dynamics in play, the next move could redefine the yen\u2019s outlook.\nTokyo Inflation Remains Hot\nInflationary pressures in Japan\u2019s capital, Tokyo, remained elevated in November, pointing to the risk of similar trends nationwide and keeping the prospects of a Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate hike next month very much alive.\nHeadline consumer prices rose 0.3% in November, leaving the annual pace fractionally lower at 2.7%. Stripping out fresh food prices, core inflation rose 2.8% from a year earlier\u2014one-tenth above expectations and well above the BOJ\u2019s 2% target. Excluding fresh food and energy, inflation also topped forecasts, rising 2.8% over the year versus the 2.7% pace expected.\nSource: TradingView\nAs shown in the graphic tracking all three series, inflation has not only exceeded the BOJ\u2019s 2% target for an extended period, but the rolling three-year monthly correlation with subsequent national readings points to similar trends when that data is released in three weeks.\nBOJ December Hike Favoured\nFollowing the Tokyo inflation data, swaps pricing puts the implied probability of a 25-basis-point BOJ rate hike next month at 56%, rising to 84% by the bank\u2019s first meeting of 2026 in late January. With early signals from annual wage negotiations pointing to strong union demands for similar large increases to those seen in the past two years, it\u2019s no surprise traders are now pricing in the risk of two full 25-point hikes by October next year.\nSource: Bloomberg\nAttention now turns to a speech by BOJ Governor Ueda next Monday, with the strength of the latest inflation data making this a key event should he choose to prime markets for a move on December 19.\nYield Compression Risks Carry Trade Unwind\nSource: TradingView\nWhile USD/JPY has not shown a particularly strong relationship with yield differentials between the United States and Japan in recent weeks\u2014with U.S. yields pressured by mounting expectations for up to 100 basis points of Fed rate cuts next year while Japanese yields remain elevated\u2014directional risks for USD/JPY appear skewed lower, especially if carry trades come under pressure from higher borrowing costs and/or weaker asset prices.\nUSD/JPY Trend Change?\nSource: TradingView\nOn the daily chart, USD/JPY is now trading through the uptrend in place since mid-October, pointing to the risk the pair may be embarking on a new trend. For now, price continues to attract bids on moves toward 155.73 support, suggesting that if we see a sustained break of the uptrend, the near-term path may be sideways. Beneath 155.73, minor support sits at 155.00 and again at 153.68, where price bounced twice earlier this month, with 153.00 a more pronounced support zone below.\nIf the uptrend is reclaimed, resistance may emerge around 157.00, with the November swing high of 157.90 the next topside level of note.\nMomentum signals point to diminishing bullish strength. RSI (14) is trending lower but remains above the neutral 50 level, offering at least a cautionary message to dip buyers. MACD reinforces that caution, crossing the signal line from above while holding in positive territory. It\u2019s not an outright bearish message from the oscillators, but the strength of the bullish thrust seen in recent months is clearly waning."

                "body": "USD/JPY has recently decreased in value, influenced by changes in the BOJ\u2019s stance. This coincides with a meeting between Takaichi and Ueda last week. The currency pair was recently seen at 156.30, as noted by OCBC\u2019s analysts Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong.\nHawkish Turn Of BOJ\nThe BOJ\u2019s rhetoric has turned more hawkish, with officials expressing the possibility of rate hikes. Ueda mentioned in parliament that the BOJ would discuss the feasibility and timing of these rate hikes in upcoming meetings. Factors such as wage growth, broadening services inflation, and positive economic activities support this shift in policy stance. Analysts now see over a 50% likelihood of a December rate hike, up from 16% a week ago.\nTechnical indicators show that mild bullish momentum is waning, and the RSI has decreased. There is potential for a corrective pullback with support identified at 155.05, 154.40, and 151.60 levels. Resistance is noted at 157.90 and 158.87, which are previous highs. The analysis is part of the market insights curated by the FXStreet Insights Team, comprising observations from commercial notes and expert analysts.\nWe are seeing USD/JPY ease from its highs, currently trading around 156.30, as the Bank of Japan\u2019s messaging becomes more aggressive. This change in tone seems to have started after last week\u2019s meeting between key officials. The market is now pricing in a greater than 50% chance of a BOJ rate hike in December, a significant jump from just 16% a week ago.\nThis shift is underpinned by strong domestic data. Recent figures showed nominal cash earnings in Japan rose 2.5% year-over-year, the fastest pace in years, while the latest Tokyo Core CPI hit 2.8%. These numbers give the BOJ the justification it needs to begin policy normalization after its extended pause.\nImpact On The US Dollar\nOn the other side of the pair, the US dollar is facing headwinds. The latest US PCE inflation data for October 2025 came in at a softer-than-expected 2.9%, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve may be done with its own tightening cycle. This growing policy divergence, with the BOJ turning hawkish as the Fed turns neutral, adds significant downward pressure on the currency pair.\nGiven the potential for a corrective pullback, derivative traders should consider strategies that profit from a falling USD/JPY. Buying put options offers a clear way to gain from downside movement while capping risk to the premium paid. This strategy aligns well with the fading bullish momentum we are seeing on the daily charts.\nThe expected policy shift will likely increase price swings, making volatility itself a tradable asset. Implied volatility for USD/JPY options is on the rise ahead of the December BOJ meeting. Traders could look at long volatility plays, such as straddles, to capitalize on a large price move in either direction, which is common during major policy pivots.\nWe must watch key technical levels for risk management. The support at the 21-day moving average of 155.05 is the first critical test for the pair\u2019s decline. A break below this level would open the door to further drops towards 154.40 and even 151.60, levels not seen since the sharp run-up earlier in 2025."

Japan\u2019s yen continues to struggle to sustain any recovery as traders weigh the government\u2019s new \u00a521.3 trillion fiscal stimulus, the largest since the pandemic. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s spending plan reignited debt-sustainability fears, steepening Japan\u2019s yield curve and undermining the yen\u2019s safe-haven appeal. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama issued the strongest intervention warning yet, stressing that Tokyo \u201cwill act decisively against excessive volatility.\u201d Markets remain wary but unconvinced, as intervention threats historically carry limited durability when yield differentials remain wide.\nBank of Japan Tightrope: Inflation Rises but Policy Clarity Lags\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) continues to send mixed signals. Board member Asahi Noguchi reaffirmed that policy normalization will remain gradual, but persistent inflationary pressures\u2014illustrated by a 2.7% YoY rise in Japan\u2019s October Services Producer Price Index\u2014suggest a move closer to tightening. Internal discussions between Governor Kazuo Ueda and PM Takaichi reportedly removed political resistance to rate hikes, giving markets confidence that a December increase in short-term rates remains possible. BoJ\u2019s rhetoric has shifted sharply toward addressing the inflationary impact of a weak yen, but investors doubt the bank\u2019s willingness to exit its ultra-loose stance decisively. The Tokyo CPI reading due Friday could define the timing: a core inflation print above 2.5% would likely confirm a December move, while a miss could postpone action to Q1 2026.\nFederal Reserve Outlook Tilts Dovish as U.S. Data Softens\nAcross the Pacific, the Federal Reserve\u2019s pivot toward rate cuts is intensifying downward pressure on the dollar\u2019s yield advantage. The CME FedWatch Tool shows an 85% probability of a 25 bps cut at the December 9\u201310 meeting, supported by slowing retail sales and weakening jobless trends. Still, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield remains anchored near 4.28%, sustaining the yield spread over Japan\u2019s 10-year JGB at nearly 420 basis points, a level historically associated with yen depreciation. Dovish Fed signals limit upside momentum for USD/JPY, but absent aggressive BoJ action, the pair remains biased toward further appreciation.\nTechnical Setup: Bullish Channel Intact but Signs of Fatigue Emerge\nTechnically, USD/JPY remains in an ascending channel, forming consistent higher highs and higher lows since early October. Immediate support aligns near 155.00, coinciding with the 21-day SMA and the lower channel boundary. A decisive break below 155 could trigger a retracement toward the 50-day SMA at 152.38, but momentum remains tilted upward. The MACD histogram has turned slightly negative, reflecting waning momentum, while the RSI eased to 62 after briefly touching overbought territory at 72, suggesting mild exhaustion. The next resistance zone lies between 157.00\u2013157.50, with a breakout above 157.19 potentially unlocking a retest of 158.88, the yearly high. A consolidation between 155.80 and 157.20 remains the most probable short-term pattern heading into December\u2019s policy meetings.\nHoliday Liquidity and Market Seasonality Shape Short-Term Behavior\nWith U.S. markets closed for Thanksgiving, volatility is at seasonal lows. Historical data since 1992 shows average Thanksgiving Day movement in USD/JPY at just 0.55%, with Friday sessions producing a median 0.18% gain and a 66.7% win rate for dollar bulls. This suggests a higher probability of upside follow-through once U.S. traders return, especially if Treasury yields remain firm. Thin liquidity, however, can exaggerate intraday fluctuations; therefore, risk parameters should remain tight around the 155.65\u2013157.20 corridor.\nNikkei 225 Correlation and Equity Flows Reinforce Yen Weakness\nThe Nikkei 225 continues to rally, closing in on the 50,000-point "

The potential upside for the Greenback might be limited as traders ramped up bets for further monetary easing from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) next month. Traders brace for the release of Canada\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the third quarter (Q3), which is due later on Friday.\nDovish remarks from Fed officials have bolstered expectations for a rate reduction. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said earlier this week that she supports a December interest rate cut, citing labor market weakness. Fed Governor Christopher Waller noted that the job market is weak enough to warrant another quarter-point rate cut in December, though the decision depends on an upcoming flood of data delayed by the US government shutdown.\nUS Fed funds futures are pricing an implied 87% chance of a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut at the Federal Reserve's (Fed) December policy meeting, compared to a 39% odds a week earlier, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nOn the other hand, crude oil prices fall amid renewed optimism surrounding a potential ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. This, in turn, could weigh on the commodity-linked Loonie and act as a tailwind for the pair. It\u2019s worth noting that Canada is the largest oil exporter to the US, and lower crude oil prices tend to have a negative impact on the CAD value.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direc"

Under the surface, investors have grown more confident that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in December, and Friday\u2019s Canadian GDP report is now seen as crucial for whether the Bank of Canada follows with more easing. Economists expect Canada\u2019s economy to have grown at about a 0.5% annualized pace in the third quarter \u2013 just enough to dodge a technical recession after a weak first half of the year. The sharply narrower current account deficit \u2013 far better than the C$16.5 billion gap analysts had penciled in \u2013 points to an improved external balance helped by firmer exports and slightly higher oil prices, with crude up 0.3% at $58.82 a barrel. Still, BMO\u2019s senior economists caution that Canada\u2019s trade position remains fragile, especially with Canada\u2013US trade talks paused and, as Mark Carney highlighted, sector-specific negotiations yet to restart, keeping policy and business planning under a cloud.\nWhy should I care?\nMarkets: Rates and currencies are pulling in opposite directions.\nCanadian bond yields eased across the curve, with the ten-year slipping to around 3.13% and briefly touching 3.124%, its lowest level since November 7. That slide mirrors a global move: as traders price in Fed rate cuts and a possible Bank of Canada follow-through, borrowing costs for governments and companies head lower. A firmer loonie \u2013 now worth about 71.3 US cents \u2013 reflects both slightly better domestic data and shifting rate expectations between Canada and the US. If Canadian GDP proves resilient while US policy starts easing, the relative appeal of Canadian assets could improve, tightening spreads and lending the currency more support. But lingering trade frictions and paused Canada\u2013US negotiations mean equity and currency markets will be hypersensitive to any policy headlines that could reshape export prospects.\nThe bigger picture: Trade uncertainty hangs over a cautious recovery.\nCanada\u2019s sharply improved current account \u2013 cutting the deficit by more than half in a single quarter \u2013 suggests the country is entering the potential rate-cut phase from a stronger external starting point. That may give policymakers a bit more leeway to ease without stoking immediate worries about external imbalances, especially with oil \u2013 a key export \u2013 holding near $59 a barrel despite geopolitical tensions and sanctions affecting Russian supply. Still, with Canada\u2013US trade negotiations on ice, as Mark Carney underscored, the medium-term outlook for cross-border flows remains murky. For governments and businesses, that keeps investment plans and supply chain choices tricky, even as monetary policy edges toward a friendlier stance. Put together, the data and policy signals point to a slow, fragile expansion where trade decisions, not just interest rates, could steer Canada\u2019s next growth chapter.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 1 hour ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "USD/CAD trims some losses and returns to the 1.4050 area\n|- The US Dollar bounces from weekly lows against the Loonie and reaches the 1.14050 area.\n- Market expectations of further Fed easing are weighing on the US Dollar.\n- Canada's GDP is expected to show that the economy bounced up in Q3.\nThe US Dollar is retracing losses against the Canadian Dollar on Thursday, following a sharp reversal in the previous two days. The pair is trading at 1.4048 at the time of writing, after bouncing at 1.4030, but maintains its immediate bearish tone intact and is 0.3% lower on the week so far.\nits\nOn Wednesday, US Durable Goods Orders beat expectations, and weekly Jobless Claims declined unexpectedly to the lowest levels in the last seven months. These figures, however, failed to alter the view that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its December 10 meeting.\nThe Fed is expected to accelerate its easing cycle\nBeyond that, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has emerged as the best-positioned to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair after his term ends in May. Hasset is an open dove, and his nomination would boost expectations of further monetary easing in 2026.\nThe CME Fedwatch tool shows an 85% chance of a quarter-point rate cut in December, up from about 40% last week, and points to two or three more rate cuts in 2026.\nTrading volumes are likely to remain subdued on Thursday, with US markets closed for the Thanksgiving bank holiday. A mild recovery in Crude prices is providing some support to the Loonie, although the highlight of the week is Canada\u2019s Q3 GDP, which is expected to show a moderate economic recovery after two consecutive quarters of contraction.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "The GBP/JPY exchange rate recently reached a new year-to-date high, holding firm around 207.00. The technical outlook is favourable, with the price comfortably above key moving averages and immediate support at the 205.00 psychological level.\nMomentum indicators such as MACD and RSI are aligned with the bullish sentiment, showing no signs of exhaustion. The MACD line remains above the Signal line, and the RSI hovers around 66, indicating strong positive sentiment but not reaching the overbought territory.\nShort Term Trend Outlook\nIn the short term, the GBP/JPY trend stays strong as long as it maintains above the 21-day SMA. Potential support levels are at 203.70 for a shallow pullback and at 200.66 for deeper support, with a move above 207.00 opening a path to the 207.50-208.00 zone.\nThe Japanese Yen faces continued pressure due to Japan\u2019s fiscal concerns and uncertainty regarding the Bank of Japan\u2019s next rate hike. Factors driving the Yen include the Bank\u2019s policy, Japanese vs US bond yield differentials, and broader risk sentiment. The Yen is considered safe-haven, often strengthening during market stress due to its perceived stability.\nThe strong upward momentum in GBP/JPY signals that further gains are likely in the near term. We are holding near the 207.00 level after hitting a new high for the year, which shows buyers remain firmly in control. This bullish outlook is supported by the fact that the pair is trading comfortably above all its key moving averages.\nBritish Pound Strength And Japanese Yen Weakness\nThe British Pound is drawing strength from the recent Autumn Budget, with the Office for Budget Responsibility upgrading its 2026 GDP growth forecast to 1.8%. With UK inflation data from October 2025 coming in at 2.9%, the Bank of England is widely expected to maintain its restrictive policy, keeping the Pound supported. This contrasts sharply with the situation we saw just a few years ago in late 2022, when policy announcements created severe volatility.\nOn the other side, the Japanese Yen continues to be weighed down by uncertainty around the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy timing. The interest rate differential remains a powerful driver, as the 10-year Japanese government bond yield is only 0.9% while equivalent UK gilts offer over 4.2%. We don\u2019t expect this gap to narrow significantly until the BoJ signals a more aggressive hiking cycle, which markets now don\u2019t anticipate until mid-2026.\nFor derivative traders, this suggests buying GBP/JPY call options is a good way to profit from more upside while limiting risk. Looking at expirations in early 2026 would give the trade enough time to play out, especially if we break above the recent highs and target the 208.00 zone. The current upbeat market sentiment, similar to the risk-on environment of late 2024, also works against the safe-haven Yen.\nThe 205.00 level is a critical psychological support that should be watched closely. A dip to this level could be a good entry point, but a firm break below it would be a warning sign that the bullish momentum is fading. This level is a logical area to place stops for futures positions or to reassess option strategies.\nAny pullbacks should be viewed as buying opportunities as long as the broader trend holds. Selling out-of-the-money put options with strikes near the 21-day Simple Moving Average at 203.70 could be a way to collect premium. This strategy is based on the expectation that this first layer of dynamic support will hold, as it has consistently in recent months."

The 205.00 psychological level, which sits close to this week\u2019s low, acts as an initial floor, followed by the 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 203.70, which provides the first layer of dynamic support.\nMomentum indicators remain aligned with buyers. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows the MACD line holding above the Signal line, while the histogram continues to widen in positive territory, which points to strengthening bullish momentum rather than exhaustion. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) trades near 66, upbeat yet still below the overbought region.\nNear-term, the upside bias remains intact as long as GBP/JPY holds above the rising 21-day SMA. A shallow pullback would likely find support at 203.70, followed by the 50-day SMA at 202.43, while the 100-day SMA near 200.66 serves as a deeper cushion.\nA break above Wednesday\u2019s peak would open the door toward the 207.50-208.00 zone. A drop in the RSI toward 50 or a loss of momentum on the MACD would indicate consolidation rather than a trend reversal. The overall technical backdrop continues to support buying on dips.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and com"

                "body": "Tracking Forex pairs: what GBP/JPY can tell us about the global economy\nImage: Supplied\nEven in South Africa, GBP/JPY is a common choice among active traders, largely because of its strong price movements and liquidity. Yes, there are other, perhaps safer options like gold and USD/ZAR, but GBP/JPY stands out for those looking for faster-paced opportunities.\nNot only this, but GBP/JPY can actually inform trading strategies across multiple markets, mainly because of what it tells us about the global economy. So what does it tell us, and how can you use that information to your advantage?\nWhat GBP/JPY Can Tell Us About the Global Economy\nPut simply, GBP/JPY tells us exactly how global investors are feeling about risk at any given moment. Looking at the GBPJPY live price on Exness right now, for instance, you can see whether traders are leaning towards risk-on or risk-off sentiment.\nIf the pair is climbing steadily, it indicates growing confidence in riskier assets \u2013 often reflecting optimism about the UK economy or broader global growth \u2013 and if there\u2019s a sharp decline, that indicates investors are moving into safer havens like the Japanese yen \u2013 often reflecting uncertainty or caution in global markets.\nThe reason this is the case is because of the unique economic roles and investors\u2019 perceptions attached to both currencies in the pair. The British pound is widely considered a risk-sensitive currency: it tends to appreciate when investors feel confident about economic growth or higher interest rates.\nThe Japanese yen, on the other hand, has earned a reputation as a safe-haven currency: it tends to remain stable or even strengthen during periods of global uncertainty or market stress.\nEssentially, when investors are optimistic, they move capital into riskier assets, including the pound, seeking higher returns, which ultimately push GBP/JPY higher. On the other hand, during periods of global uncertainty, investors flock to safety, buying yen and selling pounds, which drives the pair down.\nIn this way, upward movements reflect risk-on sentiment and global confidence, while downward movements signal risk-off and a flight to safety.\nHow to Use This Information Across Markets\nAs we mentioned before, tracking GBP/JPY isn\u2019t just useful for forex traders \u2013 it can provide meaningful insight for your entire portfolio across multiple asset classes.\nThe reason for this is simple: the currency pair acts as a real-time benchmark of global investor sentiment and economic health, and sentiment is a primary driver of asset prices worldwide. By knowing whether investors are risk-on or risk-off, then, you can make your decisions far more informed across equities, commodities, bonds, or any other currencies.\nLet\u2019s say, for instance, you\u2019re applying a 5 minute scalping strategy in crude oil on a platform such as Exness. Even though oil isn\u2019t a currency, its price is going to react strongly to shifts in global risk sentiment. If GBP/JPY is climbing steadily \u2013 signalling a risk-on environment \u2013 it\u2019s going to be easier to anticipate short-term bullish momentum in crude oil as traders move into riskier assets.\nConversely, if GBP/JPY suddenly drops sharply, it could indicate an imminent risk-off move, meaning crude oil prices might experience a rapid decline. By monitoring the forex pair alongside your scalping charts, you effectively gain an early warning system.\nBecause the pair reacts almost instantly to changes in global sentiment \u2013 often before other markets fully price in these shifts \u2013 you can adjust your entries and exits quickly, confirming the strength of trends and avoiding false signals without having to rely solely on price action in the commodity itself.\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s the only indicator. On the contrary, if you\u2019re only relying on GBP/JPY sentiment to make your scalping decisions, you risk being caught off guard by short-term noise or reversals. But if you use it alongside solid technical analysis and the best indicators \u2013 such as mo"

                "body": "Nasdaq Seeks 4x Expansion of Options Trading Limit for BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF\n- Nasdaq seeks to quadruple the daily options limit for BlackRock\u2019s IBIT from 250,000 to 1 million contracts due to growing institutional demand.\n- IBIT dominates Bitcoin ETF options, with US$50 billion (AU$77 billion) in open interest, accounting for 98% of trading volume and 96% of open interest.\n- The proposal includes FLEX options exemptions and aims to deepen liquidity, improve market efficiency, and facilitate larger, lower-risk trading strategies.\nNasdaq\u2019s International Securities Exchange has applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise the daily trading limit on options for BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 to 1,000,000 contracts. The request highlights growing interest from institutional investors seeking more sophisticated ways to hedge and manage Bitcoin exposure.\nThe filing emphasises that IBIT\u2019s current cap restricts trading activity and limits the ability of market participants to implement larger, lower-risk strategies. With a market capitalisation of US$86.2 billion (AU$133.3 billion) and average daily volume of 44.6 million shares, IBIT now rivals the largest equity ETFs in terms of scale and liquidity.\nNasdaq also seeks to exempt physically delivered FLEX options from any caps, aligning IBIT with other major commodity ETFs and encouraging trading to shift from over-the-counter markets to regulated venues.\nRelated: Bitcoin Pushes Past $90k on Mixed ETF Flows, While Analysts Warn of Fragile Support\nIBIT Dominates Bitcoin Options Market\nIBIT has rapidly become a dominant player in Bitcoin options markets. Open interest in its options exceeded US$50 billion (AU$77 billion) in October, comparable with the Deribit exchange. The ETF accounts for nearly all Bitcoin ETF options activity, with 98% of trading and 96% of open interest, demonstrating strong institutional adoption.\nThis increase marks the second time Nasdaq has sought to expand IBIT\u2019s position limits. The first adjustment, raising the limit tenfold to 250,000 contracts earlier this year, was approved by the SEC in July after activity accelerated shortly after options were launched.\nAnalysts note that the current proposal reflects continued growth in institutional participation, as larger investors increasingly seek regulated exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs.\nExperts anticipate that a higher limit will enable more structured products linked to IBIT, facilitating larger allocations in a controlled manner. While short-term Bitcoin prices may not be immediately affected, the change is expected to improve market efficiency, deepen liquidity, and allow institutions to manage positions with reduced risk.\nPublic comments on the SEC proposal will be accepted until 17 December 2025, signalling that a final decision could be forthcoming as IBIT demonstrates its capacity to handle greater trading volumes.\nRelated: South Africa Flags Crypto and Stablecoin Gaps as Emerging Threat to Financial Stability"

Learn more about how crypto prices are calculated on CoinGecko.\nEthereum Price Chart (ETH)\nETH Converter\nETH Historical Price\nHow do you feel about ETH today?\nRecently Happened to Ethereum\nAbout Ethereum\nEthereum is a blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications, operating through thousands of independent nodes worldwide rather than through a central authority.\n-\nSmart Contract Pioneer: Ethereum introduced programmable smart contracts that automatically execute agreements when predetermined conditions are met, revolutionizing how digital transactions and applications function.\n-\nProof of Stake Security: Following The Merge in September 2022, Ethereum transitioned from energy-intensive mining to an efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, reducing energy consumption by over 99%.\n-\nProgrammable Money: Ether (ETH) serves as both the native currency for transactions and the fuel that powers decentralized finance applications, NFT marketplaces, and thousands of decentralized applications across its ecosystem.\nWhat Is the Difference Between Ethereum and Ether (ETH)?\n-\nEthereum is the network. It is the decentralized, global blockchain platform that runs smart contracts and supports applications. Think of it as a global computer or an operating system.\n-\nEther (ETH) is the cryptocurrency. It is the native token or \"fuel\" of the Ethereum network. ETH is used to pay transaction fees (known as \"gas\") and to secure the network through staking. Ether is the asset that is bought, sold, and traded on exchanges.\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\nEthereum operates as a global, decentralized computer that executes programs called smart contracts. The network consists of thousands of independent nodes operated by individuals and organizations worldwide, all maintaining a shared record of transactions and data. When someone initiates a transaction or interacts with an application on Ethereum, validators process and confirm these actions, adding them to the blockchain permanently.\nUnlike traditional centralized systems where a single entity controls operations, Ethereum distributes authority across its entire network. This design ensures that no single party can manipulate transactions or shut down applications. The network's native cryptocurrency, ether, serves multiple purposes: it pays for transaction fees, compensates validators for securing the network, and functions as collateral in various financial applications.\nSmart Contracts & EVM\nSmart contracts are self-executing programs stored on the Ethereum blockchain that automatically carry out agreements when specific conditions are met. Written primarily in Solidity, a programming language designed for Ethereum, these contracts run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which acts as a global computing platform distributed across thousands of nodes.\nThe EVM ensures that smart contracts execute identically on every computer in the network, creating a trustworthy environment where outcomes are predictable and tamper-proof. Developers can build anything from simple payment systems to complex financial instruments, gaming platforms, and decentralized organizations. Once deployed, smart contracts operate autonomously without the need for intermediaries, and their code remains publicly verifiable on the blockchain.\nThis programmability distinguishes Ethereum from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies focused solely on transferring value. Applications built on Ethereum can hold and transfer assets, enforce rules, manage identities, and coordinate activities between multiple parties without traditional intermediaries like banks, brokers, or administrators.\nProof of Stake\nEthereum secures its network through Proof o"

The company appears increasingly confident that the future of DeFi will shift toward more robust infrastructure, rather than simply seeking quick returns.\nFrom the outset, their focus has been on projects that deliver real economic value, including technology capable of providing stable liquidity and more efficient market mechanisms.\nWe are launching the $75M DWF Labs DeFi Fund, focused on perp DEXs, money markets, and yield protocols across @ethereum , @BNBCHAIN , @solana , and @base .\nCapital + liquidity + ecosystem support for teams ready to scale. pic.twitter.com/d6n0CWHHKA\n\u2014 DWF Labs (@DWFLabs) November 26, 2025\nHow DWF Labs Is Expanding Its Reach Across Multiple Networks\nDWF Labs has targeted four networks simultaneously, each with its own distinct dynamics. They are not only exploring automated trading protocols but also dark-pool DEXs that allow large transactions to take place without worrying about excessive slippage.\nMeanwhile, decentralized money markets are also gaining attention, as digital asset-based lending and borrowing models are beginning to be seen as a bridge between crypto and broader financial applications. Furthermore, yield protocols utilizing sophisticated schemes are also on the funding radar.\nPreviously, we highlighted a Bybit report identifying 16 blockchains with fund freezing mechanisms, including BNB Chain. This mechanism was described as an additional security measure to protect users from suspicious activity within a short period of time.\nHowever, we also reported that this feature has attracted the attention of institutions, which consider it a sound risk management measure. Therefore, it\u2019s understandable that the DWF sees the potential for strengthening the DeFi sector on this network, especially as institutional perceptions begin to shift toward safer financial applications.\nCoinbase expanded the network through the launch of ETH-based loans. The whole setup runs on Morpho over Base, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 network, where transactions typically cost just a few cents.\nThis feature allows Ethereum holders to obtain funds without having to sell their assets first. This is quite helpful for traders who want to maintain asset exposure while gaining additional liquidity."

Ethereum (ETH) has extended its up leg above $3,000, as technical indicators signal easing bearish momentum. Ripple (XRP), on the other hand, is capped under resistance at $2.30 despite inflows into spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\nData spotlight: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP extend ETF inflows\nBitcoin ETFs listed in the United States (US) experienced inflows on Wednesday, reflecting improving risk appetite among institutional investors. SoSoValue data shows that Bitcoin recorded mild ETF inflows, totaling $21 million on Wednesday, pointing to a subtle return of institutional investors.\nHowever, macroeconomic uncertainty, concerns about the Federal Reserve's (Fed) December monetary policy decision, and a lack of conviction in the market's ability to sustain the recovery continue to undermine investor confidence while accentuating risk-off sentiment.\nETF inflows must steadily increase to support positive sentiment and increase the odds of a steady uptrend targeting highs above $100,000.\nEthereum ETFs, on the other hand, experienced their fourth consecutive day of inflows, with nearly $61 million recorded on Wednesday, $79 million on Tuesday, $97 million on Monday, and $56 million on Friday. The cumulative inflow volume totals $12.87 billion as of Wednesday, with net assets of $18.88 billion.\nXRP ETFs recorded nearly $22 million in inflows on Wednesday, bringing the cumulative net volume to approximately $644 million and net assets to $676 million. The steady inflows, now on their ninth consecutive day, indicate that institutional investors are paying attention to altcoin-based ETFs.\nChart of the day: Bitcoin rises amid easing bearish momentum\nBitcoin is edging closer to $92,000 at the time of writing on Thursday, supported by an upward-trending Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42 on the daily chart.\nBullish momentum will likely surge if the RSI lifts above the 50 midline, increasing the chances of closing the gap to $100,000.\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has confirmed a buy signal on the same daily chart. Investors will consider increasing their risk exposure if the blue MACD line remains above the red signal line while the indicator continues to rise. The green histogram expanding above the zero line underpins increasing bullish momentum.\nStill, Bitcoin is tracing under pressure, with a downward-sloping 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $100,937, the 200-day EMA at $105,515 and the 100-day EMA at $105,562, capping rebounds. Losses below $90,000 may persist unless BTC reclaims the 50-day EMA as support.\nAltcoins update: Ethereum, XRP send mixed signals\nEthereum is holding above $3,000 at the time of writing on Thursday, as bulls push to reclaim control. The RSI has risen to 41 from the oversold region on the daily chart, indicating that bearish momentum is narrowing and that ETH bulls could push toward the 50-day EMA at $3,468.\nAt the same time, the MACD indicator triggered a buy signal on Wednesday, encouraging investors to increase their risk exposure. A steady uptrend is required above the zero line to reinforce the bullish grip.\nHowever, two Death Cross patterns on the same daily chart signal that the bearish outlook is still apparent and may continue weighing Ethereum down. A Death Cross pattern forms when a shorter-term moving average crosses and settles below a longer-term moving average, as observed on the daily chart.\nAs for XRP, recovery remains a pipe dream, with the price capped under resistance at $2.30. The RSI is stable at 46, in"

                "body": "Solana Continues Its Strong Market Push As SOL Adoption Grows Across DeFi And Institutional Platforms\nSolana has remained one of the most watched networks in the broader crypto market, with its strong technical performance and steady activity across DeFi and institutional platforms.\nMany analysts have been tracking Solana\u2019s recent movements, and the network\u2019s momentum continues to shape discussions in crypto news communities. Remittix also appeared in conversations around blockchain technology adoption today after its new product update, creating additional attention toward technical progress in the sector.\nSolana Price Action And Market Structure\nSolana has regained momentum heading into late November, reclaiming mid-range support and pressing into the heavily contested $144 to $145 resistance band. Currently trading around $140, analysts note that SOL has formed a sequence of higher lows beneath this ceiling, a structure often associated with pre-breakout compression when combined with rising volume. If price can break above this level with conviction, the next liquidity pocket sits at $152 to $155, reflecting unfilled inefficiencies from earlier trading ranges.\nMomentum strengthened as several analysts highlighted Solana\u2019s ability to reclaim key higher-timeframe zones, with the token having repeatedly defended the $115 to $128 dollar demand region throughout 2025. This reclaim has reopened discussions about broader upside scenarios, including reactions toward $168 to $176, an area defined by former monthly imbalances and historical resistance.\nIn the short term, traders are focused on Solana\u2019s immediate support at $137 to $138 and secondary zones at $132 to $134 and $126 to $128 dollars, all of which have consistently attracted buyers. Upside resistance remains firm at $144 to $145 dollars. A confirmed breakout above $145 would likely shift sentiment decisively and validate the improving technical landscape, but until that move arrives, SOL remains in a tight compression pattern. With strong buying interest, improving indicators and a reclaim of higher-timeframe structure, Solana\u2019s setup is constructive, yet traders agree that its next move depends on clearing the month\u2019s most important resistance zone.\nLatest Remittix Update As The Wallet Goes Live\nA major highlight today came from Remittix after announcing that its wallet is now officially available on the Apple App Store. The application operates as a fully functioning crypto wallet designed for secure storage and asset management. The team confirmed that the wallet\u2019s Phase 1 release is stable and ready for wider ecosystem integration.\nA more extensive upgrade is expected in December, when Remittix plans to introduce its crypto-to-fiat functionality inside the same application. This feature aims to streamline digital asset transfers into traditional financial systems. The team has also confirmed that the Android rollout is already in development.\nA preview of the current build is visible in the beta demonstration shared on social media, including footage from community testers through the cryptoksic beta clip. Remittix has also undergone a full audit by CertiK, and the project\u2019s verification status is publicly listed on the CertiK Skynet page. Their team verification is accessible under the project\u2019s fundamental health section.\nRemittix Technology Progress\nRemittix continues to prepare additional ecosystem releases alongside the wallet. Community testing recently expanded, allowing more iOS users to participate in the feedback cycle as the wallet moves through successive development stages.\nThe Remittix token is currently priced at $0.1166, and the project has reported more than $28.2 million raised through private funding, along with over 686 million tokens distributed.\nThe ecosystem also introduced a referral program where users can generate daily USDT rewards through the dashboard, adding another engagement layer to the platform.

                "body": "Solana has recently seen its on-chain trading activity soar, outpacing the combined trading volumes of centralized exchanges. This marks a significant milestone for the blockchain, especially as the broader market experiences both positive developments and ongoing challenges. While institutional interest and advancements in decentralized finance (DeFi) are driving growth, concerns about security and price fluctuations persist.\nInterest from institutional investors in Solana-based assets is on the rise, fueled by substantial inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and strategic moves by corporate treasuries. According to SoSoValue, U.S.-listed Solana ETFs have accumulated net inflows totaling $510 million, with $11 million added in the last week of November alone. This trend reflects a broader shift in the crypto market, as more companies allocate resources to digital assets through DeFi platforms that offer yield opportunities.\nSeveral Solana-focused treasury firms, including Forward Industries, Defi Development, and Upexi, collectively manage assets exceeding $3 billion in SOL. These organizations are capitalizing on Solana\u2019s fast transaction speeds and low costs to maximize returns.\nDespite strong institutional backing, Solana\u2019s token price has experienced notable swings. After reaching an intraday peak of $134 in early December, the price has dropped to $126.9. Technical analysis indicates a bearish trend, with futures open interest declining from $17.1 billion in September to $6.95 billion, suggesting reduced activity from retail traders. The token is also trading below key moving averages, and its Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains near 32, signaling ongoing selling pressure.\nSecurity breaches have added further complexity to Solana\u2019s outlook. In late November, South Korean exchange Upbit suffered a $36.8 million hack, with attackers stealing Solana-based assets such as SOL, USDC, and DeFi tokens including BONK and JUP. This incident occurred as Dunamu was preparing for a $10.3 billion merger with Naver Financial, raising concerns about the vulnerabilities of hot wallets on high-speed blockchains. Upbit responded by suspending Solana-related services and moving remaining funds to cold storage, but the event highlighted persistent risks within crypto infrastructure.\nDespite these setbacks, institutional investment in Solana remains robust. DWF Labs, a leading crypto market maker, has pledged $75 million to support DeFi initiatives across Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain. Their focus is on building institutional-grade infrastructure, such as dark-pool decentralized exchanges and yield-generating products. Managing partner Andrei Grachev has stressed the importance of scalable solutions to facilitate large-scale liquidity migration to on-chain platforms. This optimism is reflected in the DeFi sector, where total value locked (TVL) has recently exceeded $120 billion, approaching the highs seen in 2021.\nLooking ahead, Solana\u2019s challenge will be to maintain its rapid growth while ensuring security and stability. The dominance of on-chain trading suggests a shift toward decentralized platforms, but obstacles remain. For example, Forward Industries, a major Solana treasury holder, reported $668 million in unrealized losses as SOL\u2019s price fell from its November 2024 high of $263.2. This volatility underscores the risks associated with fast-paced adoption, even as core metrics\u2014such as Solana\u2019s $200.69 million in monthly fee revenue\u2014point to strong long-term prospects."

Several data points show rising work across major blockchain projects.\nThe shift comes while the wider crypto market begins to show early signs of recovery and developers expand new use cases on Solana and other networks.\nChainlink Leads Santiment\u2019s New DeFi Development Ranking\nIt is worth noting that the latest Santiment ranking placed Chainlink (LINK) at the top of active DeFi development.\nThe list reviewed real development events from GitHub and removed low-value actions, which gives a clearer picture of actual work.\nChainlink holds the first position on the chart. DeepBook and DeFiChain follow next. FOX, Lido DAO, Babylon, Injective, Curve, and Osmosis also appeared in the top group.\nIn a medium article, Santiment explained that development activity helps show how much attention each ecosystem receives from its builders.\nThe ranking covered developers who write code, update features, and keep systems stable.\nThis focus is important because users often look at active development to understand which projects might remain strong over time.\nThe ranking also highlights the range of teams still building even during market swings.\nStill, work continues across different chains. Each project shows a mix of steady progress and industry-specific changes.\nChainlink remains one of the most active projects in the space, which reflects its wider role across many networks.\nThe chart shared in the ranking shows Chainlink with a comfortable lead in development activity over the past 30 days.\nOther projects move up or down in smaller steps, but the overall picture points to consistent work across several DeFi platforms.\nChainlink Supports Growth of Tokenized Stocks on Solana\nA separate update shows new progress around tokenized stocks on Solana.\nThe xStocks platform introduced stock and ETF exposure onchain, which removes the need for users to leave the network to get exposure to traditional markets.\nKamino now provides trading access to these assets. The platform offers assets such as METAx, GOOGLx, TSLAx, and NVDAx.\nNotably, Kamino relies on pricing data built with Chainlink (LINK). The pricing model uses data from multiple United States equity exchanges.\nAlso, this design avoids dependence on onchain liquidity and reduces manipulation risk.\nMarket-status signals and staleness alerts help show when data is fresh and when markets are open or closed.\nThe xStocks market on Kamino has grown to almost $5 million in size and has more than 270 users.\nThese assets can serve as collateral for lending. Users can also loop positions to increase exposure.\nThe system creates a simpler way to move between different asset types inside Solana, which supports a broad trading workflow.\nKamino states that the aim is to allow users to access many asset classes in one place. The introduction of tokenized stocks is part of that plan.\nChainlink\u2019s role in pricing helps support this structure and shows how data services link traditional markets with blockchain tools.\nChainlink Oracle Dominance and Market Direction\nMeanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) now holds about 62% of the oracle sector when measured by secured value.\nThe total value secured sits at about $80.5 billion. Chronicle is the next largest with 11% and about $8.8 billion secured. The gap shows how widely Chainlink feeds are used.\nOracle services provide data that supports lending, trading, and many automated systems.\nThe current level of dominance suggests that Chainlink continues to supply most major platforms that rely on external data.\nRecent movement across the market points to early signs o"

                "body": "Stock Market Today - Dow 47,427 and Nasdaq 23,214 \u2014 Fed Cut Bets Power DELL, HOOD, and URBN in Holiday Rally\nU.S. markets surged as the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq hit new highs, driven by AI hardware gains from Dell (NYSE: DELL), FinTech expansion by Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD), and retail strength from Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ: URBN) | That's TradingNEWS\nStock Market Today - Wall Street Extends Thanksgiving Rally as Fed Cut Bets Ignite AI, Retail, and FinTech Stocks\nU.S. equities delivered a decisive rally heading into Thanksgiving, driven by renewed confidence in a December rate cut and strong corporate earnings across key sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 314.67 points (+0.67%) to 47,427.12, the S&P 500 gained 0.69% to 6,812.61, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.82% to 23,214.69. The Russell 2000 added 0.8%, signaling a broadening rally that now includes small caps.\nThe week marked the fourth consecutive daily gain for all three major indexes, and the best Thanksgiving stretch since June. For the week, the S&P 500 gained 3.2%, the Dow 2.6%, and the Nasdaq 4.2%, led by tech and consumer discretionary sectors. Treasury yields fell sharply, with the 10-year yield dropping below 4%, while the U.S. Dollar Index weakened to 99.58, reflecting global investors rotating toward risk assets.\nInvestor sentiment strengthened after initial jobless claims fell to 216,000, the lowest reading since April, signaling continued labor-market resilience without reigniting inflationary concerns. Fed funds futures now assign an 85% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December, according to CME data. Liquidity remains thin ahead of the long weekend, but trading desks report consistent risk-on positioning into year-end.\nAI Hardware Dominates as Dell and Broadcom Lead While HP Cuts Deep\nAI infrastructure plays dominated the session as investors rewarded companies delivering tangible, earnings-backed growth from artificial intelligence build-outs.\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) jumped 6% after the company raised full-year revenue guidance to $111.2\u2013$112.2 billion from $105\u2013$109 billion, and boosted adjusted EPS to $9.92 from $9.55. The company revealed $12.3 billion in AI-server orders this fiscal year and expects total AI-related demand to exceed $30 billion in 2025. Management emphasized accelerating enterprise orders, confirming that AI servers now represent Dell\u2019s fastest-growing segment.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) gained 3.3% following an upgraded $435 price target from Goldman Sachs, which forecasted a 100% year-over-year increase in AI chip revenue next fiscal year. Analysts cited Broadcom\u2019s deepening relationship with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) as a major tailwind, with Google now incorporating Broadcom\u2019s AI networking chips into its TPU clusters. Alphabet stock continued its ascent, logging its 13th all-time high in November and accumulating 24% gains month-to-date, up 92% in six months.\nIn contrast, HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) dropped 1.5% after announcing a restructuring that will cut 4,000\u20136,000 jobs, or roughly 10% of its workforce, to achieve $1 billion in cost savings through 2028. CEO Enrique Lores said the move aligns with HP\u2019s strategy to \u201cembed AI functionality across the entire product portfolio,\u201d but the market penalized near-term earnings guidance. Despite long-term strategic alignment with AI hardware, investors viewed the layoffs as a sign of slowing traditional PC demand.\nNvidia, AMD, and Oracle Benefit From Renewed AI Confidence\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) edged higher by 1.4% after Tuesday\u2019s brief dip on reports that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) could transition part of its training workloads to Google\u2019s TPU chips. The market viewed the reaction as overdone, as Nvidia remains the central supplier of enterprise GPUs.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) gained 3.9% on optimism surrounding its MI300X AI processor ramp, which is being integrated into data centers across hyperscale clients. Analysts see AMD\u2019s server segment expa"

However, the two worst-performing Dow stocks in May -- both from the healthcare sector -- kept the index's rally in check, with one of them plunging over 25%.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n1. UnitedHealth Group\nShares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) crashed 26.6% in May after multiple negative developments sent shockwaves through the investing community. In mid-May, UnitedHealth suddenly replaced its CEO, Andrew Witty, with former CEO Stephen J. Hemsley with immediate effect and suspended its earnings outlook for the full year because of a surge in medical costs.\nIn between, The Wall Street Journal reported a criminal investigation against UnitedHealth by the Department of Justice for a \"possible medicare fraud.\" Days later, The Guardian released a scathing report alleging UnitedHealth put patients' health at risk by paying secret bonuses to nursing homes to cut hospital transfers.\nFor now, UnitedHealth expects to \"return to growth\" in 2026 and has sued The Guardian for defamation. Regaining investor confidence, however, may not be easy. The stock is down 38% so far this year, as of this writing.\n2. Merck\nMerck (NYSE: MRK) stock lost 9.8% in May and plunged to its 52-week low of $73.31 a share after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing drugmakers in the U.S. to cut the prices of prescription drugs. This comes at a time when Merck already expects tariffs to add $200 million to its costs this year.\nAdvertisement\nInvestors are also worried about Merck's future once its blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda loses patent exclusivity. In mid-May, analysts at Citi slashed Merck stock's price target to $84 per share from $115 per share citing the pharmaceutical company's growth challenges and a \"lack of urgency\" to develop a business that could soften the impact of a potential loss of up to 20% of sales for Keytruda once its patent expires.\nMerck, however, has a strong pipeline, remains committed to dividend growth, and yields 3.9%.\nShould you invest $1,000 in UnitedHealth Group right now?\nBefore you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UnitedHealth Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

                "source": "The Globe and Mail",

                "body": "Key Points\nWalmart has consistently demonstrated its ability to deliver results.\nConsumers turn to Walmart's low prices to stretch their dollars.\nHowever, the stock itself is looking very expensive right now.\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT) just reported another solid all-around quarter, especially considering many retailers are struggling due to cost-of-living increases, which is straining consumer spending and hitting the lower and middle classes particularly hard. Walmart is on track to beat the S&P 500 for the second consecutive year and has more than doubled over the last three years, compared to a 65% gain in the S&P 500.\nLet's consider why Walmart continues to perform as well as a red flag that the company discussed on its latest earnings call -- and whether the dividend-paying Dow Jones Industrial Average component is a worthwhile investment now.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nWalmart is in a league of its own among major retailers\nThere's an exhaustive list of consumer-facing companies that are struggling. To name a few -- RH and Target are hovering around five-year lows. Home Depot is on track to deliver its third consecutive year of lower earnings and is warning about a prolonged slowdown in home improvement spending due to affordability challenges and a sluggish housing market.\nAnd yet Walmart continues to deliver good results -- growing sales and earnings while maintaining a solid operating margin, given its high volume.\nWalmart's results showcase the nuances of purchasing decisions. Often, consumers don't eliminate a purchase, but shift the source -- for example, cutting back on food spending by cooking from home instead of going to restaurants, or making coffee at home instead of going to Starbucks.\nWalmart is capturing a significant portion of this widespread shift toward value. Consumers who typically frequent pricier outlets may shift some of that spending toward Walmart to save money. Walmart is only converting around $0.04 of every $1.00 in sales into operating income.\nTherefore, the Walmart value proposition is accurate in the sense that Walmart offers customers good deals. Walmart can afford to have razor-thin margins and undercut the competition because it has more sales than any other retailer in the world.\nWalmart has also made it easier than ever to shop, offering convenient options like home delivery through Walmart+ and a significantly improved curbside pickup program. On the Nov. 20 earnings call, Walmart said that membership income generated from Walmart+ continues to grow by double digits.\nWalmart is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in its supply chain and operations, as well as for customers through a recently announced partnership with OpenAI, which will enable shopping through ChatGPT.\nAll in all, Walmart continues to leverage its strengths by delivering value through low prices and convenience to its customers.\nLower-income consumers are getting hit the hardest\nDespite these strong results, Walmart has not shied away from the impact of industrywide challenges on its performance. Low-income customers are spending less, which is a headwind for Walmart. But at the same time, it's in a good spot to take market share if these conditions persist. Walmart CFO John Rainey said the following on Walmart's third-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call:\nBut when we look at the low-income cohort versus the middle and higher-income, we have seen some moderation in spending in the low-income cohort. And that's consistent with things you've seen from a macro perspective in October, wage growth. The disparity in wage growth between those cohorts was as large as it's been in almost a decade.\nLike Home Depot, Walmart is openly discussing the affordability crisis. It also stated that if these conditions persist, consumers will seek even greater value, which is why Walmart is gaining market share.\nWalmart isn't worth an ul"

                "body": "The S&P 500 is up about 18% compared to this time last year, and plenty of investors are enjoying big jumps in their portfolios. But that doesn\u2019t automatically mean everything is great.\nSome investors fear the market is getting too expensive. When stock prices rise faster than company profits, it usually means emotions are pushing prices up \u2014 not actual performance. And that can make the market more vulnerable to a pullback.\nPlus, there's a fair amount of instability in the economy right now. Inflation is still persistently high, with September's Consumer Price Index rising 3% year-over-year in September. (1) Tariffs have opened the door to a world of uncertainty. And while the U.S. unemployment rate is still historically low, it's notably higher than it was two years ago. (2)\nThat\u2019s why it makes sense for investors to focus on assets that can deliver solid growth and remain fairly steady, even when the outlook feels uncertain. Here are four sectors wealth advisors identified as \u201cpromising\u201d for Bloomberg that you may want to consider. (3)\nAI and the clean energy revolution are driving demand for metals such as copper and lithium. So you may want to branch out into metals if you aren\u2019t already invested in this sector.\nThe benefit of metals is that they\u2019re tangible assets, so there\u2019s an inherent value in them due to being limited in supply. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no risk in investing in metals. Commodity prices can change due to factors like tariffs, supply chain issues and waning demand.\nBut all told, a lot of general infrastructure depends on metals. Investing in this sector could be a path toward relatively stable growth over a long period of time. Some options for investing in metals include buying shares of commodity ETFs, or buying shares of refinery or mining company stocks.\nAs is the case for any investment, if you\u2019re going to buy shares of a company\u2019s stock, make sure to do your research. Specifically, look at each company\u2019s balance sheet to make sure it\u2019s not too debt-heavy. Also make sure to understand how each company makes its money and how stable the business has been through the years.\nIn 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates repeatedly to combat soaring inflation. (4) As a result, a lot of people put home buying plans on hold, and many real estate projects were paused due to a combination of supply chain backlogs and high borrowing costs.\nAt the same time, the pandemic caused a shift in many consumers\u2019 behavior, driving people to focus more on experiences than physical purchases. And with interest rates coming down, it sets the stage for more luxury real estate development, particularly within the hospitality space.\nHigh-end hotels and resorts can deliver reliable income \u2014 and they often increase in value over time. If you\u2019re not invested in real estate yet, this could be a smart area to explore.\nOne option to look at is hospitality REITs or real estate investment trusts. One big perk of REITs is that they have to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.That steady income could help offset other losses in your portfolio that might ensue if the broad stock market declines.\nAnother option is to invest in individual hospitality stocks. Once again, before choosing shares of individual companies, you\u2019ll want to pay attention to factors like debt, earnings and income-generating strategies.\nOf course, luxury real estate isn\u2019t without its risks. If the economy slips into a long recession, vacations are usually the first thing people cut. And another pandemic could hit the hospitality industry hard, just like in 2020. Even so, if you\u2019re thinking long term, adding a little hospitality exposure could be a smart way to diversify.\nRead More: Are you richer than you think? 5 clear signs you\u2019re punching way above the average American\nAs Bloomberg reports, the top two companies in the S&P 500 \u2013 Nvidia and Microsoft \u2013 comprise 15% of the index.

Critically, this performance masks a dramatic concentration: just five names\u2014Rheinmetall (+~140%), Siemens Energy (~+120%), Commerzbank (~118%), Heidelberg Materials (~+85%), and Deutsche Bank (~+84%)\u2014account for approximately 60\u201380% of index gains.\nMacro Context\nGermany's economic stagnation persists, with GDP growth forecasts at just 0.2% for 2025, improving to 1.2% in 2026, as industrial output struggles against high energy costs and supply chain disruptions. The ECB has held rates at 2% since October 30, after 200 basis points of easing between June 2024 and June 2025, prioritizing inflation control near the 2% target. Geopolitical risks, including ongoing conflicts and U.S.-China trade frictions, could shave 0.5\u20131% off euro area GDP via tariff shocks per ECB analysis. Despite Germany's weakness, the ECB raised 2025 eurozone growth forecasts to 1.2% in September, signaling qualified regional optimism. Berlin's \u20ac500 billion infrastructure fund marks a historic fiscal pivot, with defense spending jumping to \u20ac86 billion (2.4% of GDP in 2025) and constitutional reforms enabling massive infrastructure and defense borrowing over twelve years. Defense expenditures are projected to reach \u20ac162 billion by 2029. While positive effects are backloaded to mid-2026 onward, markets are pricing fiscal optimism as a key offset to cyclical weakness.\nTechnical Consolidation & Range-Bound Dynamics\nThe DAX has been range-bound between 23,000\u201325,000 since May 2025, following a volatile first half that saw an ~18% rally into March highs, followed by a sharp ~19% correction into April lows, and subsequently a ~28% recovery back into the current consolidation zone. Within this range, price action has been directionless and neutral\u2014unable to generate sustained conviction in either direction. As long as the index remains confined within 23,000\u201325,000, the technical bias remains neutral with no clear edge. The picture turns bullish not only on daily closes above 25,000, but especially on weekly and monthly confirmations. Such a breakthrough of all time highs sets up a classical \u201cany new high possible\u201d scenario. Conversely, the picture turns bearish on daily breaks below 23,000, but critically on weekly and monthly closes below. Such a breakdown would open a retracement toward the yearly open level and the April 2025 lows into ~19,000.\n(Source: TradingView)\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.\nBottom Line\nDAX Futures ($FDAX) have delivered respectable gains in 2025 despite Germany's economic stagnation, buoyed by fiscal reform optimism, ECB support, and extraordinary concentration in defense and financial sectors. The index now sits at a technical inflection: range-bound between 23,000\u201325,000 since May, it faces a binary outcome defined by confirmations above 25,000 (bullish) or below 23,000 (bearish). The critical risk worth highlighting: The DAX's headline ~19% return masks deteriorating breadth, with 60-80% of gains concentrated in five names. A correction in defense or financials could rapidly erase year-to-date performance, leaving only weak cyclical names behind. This concentration risk amplifies volatility and narrows profit opportunities to position rotation\u2014not broad-based exposure.\n\u2014 50 Pips, Trader & market analyst."

                "body": "Frankfurt \u2013 Thursday, 27 November 2025\nGermany\u2019s stock market extended its rebound on Thursday, but with far less fireworks than earlier in the week. By midday, the DAX 40 was up around 0.2% at roughly 23,780 points, while the MDAX of mid-caps gained about 0.7% to 29,425 points and the small\u2011cap SDAX climbed roughly 1% to around 16,500 points, putting German equities on track for a solid weekly gain of more than 3%. [1]\nThe broader European picture was calm: the pan\u2011European STOXX Europe 600 hovered essentially flat near 574 points, as investors paused after a three\u2011day rally driven by hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December and by tentative progress toward a ceasefire in Ukraine. With Wall Street closed for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, trading volumes in Frankfurt were thinner than usual. [2]\nDAX extends its \u201cThanksgiving rally\u201d, but momentum cools\nThe DAX has now recovered almost all of its November losses. Market commentators point to a sharp sentiment swing since Fed officials began signalling that a rate cut at the December meeting is on the table, easing fears of a prolonged period of restrictive policy. [3]\nAround midday on Thursday:\n- DAX 40 traded near 23,783 points, up about 0.2\u20130.3%.\n- MDAX rose about 0.7% to 29,425 points, outpacing the large\u2011cap index.\n- EURO STOXX 50 dipped around 0.1%, highlighting that Germany\u2019s market was again among the more resilient within the eurozone. [4]\nAnalyst Jochen Stanzl of Consorsbank noted that the DAX has almost erased its November drawdown and characterised the recent rebound as a shift from a November \u201cblues\u201d mood into a \u201cThanksgiving rally\u201d \u2013 a colourful shorthand for how quickly fear has given way to renewed risk appetite. [5]\nAcross Europe, sector moves were modest. Healthcare stocks lagged, while financial services led gains \u2013 a pattern that also played out in Germany, where Deutsche B\u00f6rse was one of the standout performers in the blue\u2011chip index. [6]\nPuma explodes higher on fresh takeover speculation\nThe story of the day in Frankfurt was unmistakable: Puma.\nShares in the sportswear group at one point surged more than 17% to just under \u20ac20, before easing to a still\u2011hefty gain of around 15% by midday. [7]\nThe catalyst: a Bloomberg report that Chinese sportswear giant Anta Sports is exploring a possible takeover bid for Puma, potentially alongside a private\u2011equity partner. Other names, including Chinese rival Li Ning and Japan\u2019s Asics, were also mentioned in media coverage as potential interested parties, underlining that the brand remains strategically attractive despite a brutal share\u2011price collapse in recent years. [8]\nPuma\u2019s stock has lost roughly 60% this year and nearly 85% since its peak about four years ago, leaving the company with a market value of only around \u20ac2.5 billion even after Thursday\u2019s jump \u2013 a size that makes it a digestible target for larger global players. [9]\nFor the DAX, the move is symbolically important: it shows that beaten\u2011down German consumer names are now cheap enough to attract cross\u2011border M&A interest. It also injects a burst of speculative energy into an otherwise slow, holiday\u2011thinned session.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse rallies on JPMorgan upgrade; E.ON sinks\nAnother big driver within the DAX was Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Its shares climbed about 4%, reaching their highest level since mid\u2011October, after JPMorgan upgraded the stock from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cOverweight\u201d and lifted its price target to \u20ac292. [10]\nThe U.S. bank argued that the operator of the Frankfurt exchange is undervalued relative to the quality and breadth of its business mix \u2013 a narrative that resonated on a day when trading\u2011infrastructure firms benefited from investors\u2019 appetite for dependable earnings streams.\nOn the downside, utility heavyweight E.ON fell about 1.8% after a cautious note from Goldman Sachs. The bank reminded investors that Germany\u2019s Federal Network Agency could soon present its new regulatory framework, which may be less generous than current condit"

                "body": "Even though Intuit Inc.'s (NASDAQ:INTU) recent earnings release was robust, the market didn't seem to notice. Our analysis suggests that investors might be missing some promising details.\nExamining Cashflow Against Intuit's Earnings\nIn high finance, the key ratio used to measure how well a company converts reported profits into free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio (from cashflow). To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\nOver the twelve months to October 2025, Intuit recorded an accrual ratio of -0.10. Therefore, its statutory earnings were quite a lot less than its free cashflow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$6.4b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$4.12b. Intuit shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On Intuit's Profit Performance\nAs we discussed above, Intuit has perfectly satisfactory free cash flow relative to profit. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Intuit's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Better yet, its EPS are growing strongly, which is nice to see. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. Obviously, we love to consider the historical data to inform our opinion of a company. But it can be really valuable to consider what other analysts are forecasting. At Simply Wall St, we have analyst estimates which you can view by clicking here.\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Intuit's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "US stock futures advanced early in the Asian session on Friday, November 28. The bulls were eying a five-day winning streak amid expectations of a December Fed rate cut.\nHowever, Japanese economic indicators fueled speculation about a December Bank of Japan rate hike, capping the morning gains. A BoJ rate hike coinciding with a Fed rate cut could send USD/JPY sharply lower, raising the risk of a yen carry trade unwind. Notably, the Nikkei 225 fell 0.04% in early trading, as bets on a BoJ rate hike overshadowed expectations for a Fed rate cut.\nTokyo\u2019s so-called \u2018core-core\u2019 annual inflation rate held at 2.8% in November, remaining well above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. Sticky inflation could support a 25-basis-point BoJ rate hike in December, potentially narrowing the US-Japan rate differential in favor of the yen.\nMeanwhile, Japanese retail sales jumped 1.6% month-on-month in October after stalling in September, signaling a pickup in economic momentum. For context, private consumption accounts for around 55% of Japan\u2019s GDP. Moreover, a pickup in consumer spending may fuel demand-driven inflation, supporting a more hawkish BoJ rate path.\nA stronger yen could trigger a carry trade unwind and weigh on US equity futures. In July 2024, the BoJ cut purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5%. USD/JPY plunged from 153.889 to 141.684 in the fallout from the BoJ policy decision. The Nasdaq 100 E-mini Futures slid from 19,648 on July 31, 2024, to an August 5 low of 17,351. Markets could turn cautious if speculation about a BoJ rate hike intensifies.\nThe chances of a December Fed rate cut have soared in recent sessions, kick-starting a recovery across US stock futures. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a 25-basis-point December Fed rate cut increased from 39.1% on November 20 to 84.7% on November 28.\nNotably, the absence of US CPI data has left jobs data to influence the Fed\u2019s rate path. The Kobeissi Letter commented on recent jobs data, stating:\n\u201cJob cuts tracked by MacroEdge jumped 70,609 MoM in October to 154,559, the highest in at least 2 years. Monthly job cuts have now exceeded 100,000 for the 5th time this year. At the same time, layoff announcements compiled by Challenger Gray spiked 99,010 to 153,074, the highest since March. This also marks the highest monthly number for any October in 22 years.\u201d\nAs US layoffs signal a deteriorating labor market, shifting sentiment toward the Fed\u2019s policy stance remains key in the near term.\nFutures extended their gains from Wednesday, November 26, during the Asian session. The Dow Jones E-mini climbed 52 points, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini rose 47 points, while the S&P 500 E-mini advanced 7 points.\nLater on Friday, traders should closely monitor FOMC members\u2019 speeches for views on the labor market, inflation, and monetary policy. Growing calls for a December cut could push US equity futures higher in a shortened US trading session. There are no US economic reports for traders to consider today.\nFollowing the recent rebound, the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini remained above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs, signaling bullish momentum.\nNear-term trends will hinge on Fed speeches and USD/JPY price trends. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nTraders should brace for potential market volatility in the coming sessions. Rising bets on a BoJ rate hike and a Fed rate cut could send USD/JPY sharply lower, raising the risk of a yen carry trade unwind.\nBank of Japan and Fed monetary policy forward guidance will be key in the Friday session in the absence of fresh US data.\nFollow our live coverage and consult the economic calendar for real-time market updates.\nWith over 28 years of experience in the financial industry, Bob has worked with various global rating agencies and multinational banks.

At least 31 people were killed, and more than 57,000 acres were scorched in densely populated communities including Altadena, Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Sunset Mesa, where Cherkas\u2019 house overlooked the Pacific Ocean.\nThousands of empty lots now dot neighborhoods that would otherwise be brimming with holiday decorations. Survivors say those inescapable reminders of what was lost gives them a renewed appreciation of Thanksgiving.\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic and try not to dwell on it,\u201d Cherkas said. He's seen wildfires disrupt the lives of plenty of other people. But now, he said, \u201cI am that other person.\u201d\nSo instead of getting ready for his annual party, Cherkas and his wife chose to spend Thanksgiving this year with old neighbors from Sunset Mesa who relocated to Arizona before the fire hit.\nBeing with old friends, he said, \u201cmakes it feel a little bit like being home.\u201d\nCherkas intends to rebuild but says permitting is taking much longer than expected. Like all natural disasters, rebuilding is an onerous process. Fewer than 2,000 permits have been issued in burn zones out of 5,000 applications received to date, according to the state\u2019s dashboard. About 3,100 are under review and thousands more have yet to be submitted.\nTom Reed, who also lost his home in the Palisades Fire, said this year has been a study in creative problem-solving. For Easter, rather than hosting the annual egg hunt for his grandchildren in the backyard, he and wife threw a party in the courtyard of their rental condo. The adults wore T-shirts with eggs attached via velcro. Instead of hunting for eggs, grandchildren hunted for grandparents.\n\u201cThings have changed, but I gotta find amusement,\u201d he said\nWhen the question of where to host Thanksgiving came around, Reed decided one day was simply not enough. Instead of cramming everyone into the condo, Reed, his wife and the rest of the family will spend the weekend at Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino Mountains.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look back because it will mess with your head,\u201d he said.\nAcross the county, in Altadena, Freddy Sayegh is back in his smoke-damaged house. It has been remediated, but his wife and two children remained at their rental for several months.\nTucked in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, Altadena felt like a small village nestled within a megapolis. It was filled with mom-and-pops stores and multigenerational families who purchased homes when other parts of the county were out of reach.\nSayegh and his extended family lost seven properties in the Eaton Fire, homes and businesses included. He has spent much of this year jumping from one rental to another waiting to be able to move back into his house.\nBefore the fire, Thanksgiving with the Sayeghs could mean celebrating with up to 60 people spread throughout \u201cone big home cooking and sleeping and drinking and partying for 48 hours,\u201d he said.\nThis year won\u2019t be like that. Some relatives have decided to vacation out of state, and others made reservations to dine out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been broken up into pieces,\u201d he said.\nBut a strong sense of community defined Altadena, and many are determined to nurture its essence. Some residents have thrown block parties on their otherwise vacant streets, and others meet for weekly game nights or other gatherings throughout the area.\nNext week, Sayegh is hosting a 1980s-themed extravaganza called Back to Altadena that will take over a small block in the western side of the neighborhood near the worst"

                "body": "FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker explains \"emotional decision\" to leave role over Mamdani's mayoral win\nFor the first time, FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker is explaining why he decided to announce his resignation just one day after Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.\n\"Look, it's a complicated, emotional decision to leave. But ideologically, there's no doubt that the mayor and I disagree on some very fundamental things to me,\" Tucker, who was appointed to the role in August 2024, told \"CBS Mornings\" in his first interview since handing in his resignation letter on Nov. 5.\nIn a closely-watched decision last week, Tucker's police counterpart, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Mamdani's offer to stay in her role. Months before the election, Mamdani softened his sharp criticism of the NYPD and clarified that he is \"not running to defund the police,\" distancing himself from old social media posts.\nDespite his public apology to the NYPD, Tucker said Mamdani still has some work to do when it comes to winning over the support of first responders. Beyond that, some of Mamdani's stances, like his refusal to support Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, have alarmed many Jewish New Yorkers.\n\"I think it's a factor [in my decision to resign], no doubt,\" said Tucker, who is Jewish. \"And I don't want to tell you that it's the only factor. But I believe that the things that I have heard the mayor say would make it difficult for me to continue on in such a senior executive role in the administration.\"\nAccording to exit polls, 31% of Jewish New Yorkers voted for Mamdani, with 65% voting for independent opponent Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani won every borough but Staten Island.\nIn an October debate, Mamdani, who will make history as New York City's first Muslim mayor, vowed to \"be the mayor who doesn't just protect Jewish New Yorkers, but also celebrates and cherishes them.\"\nHowever, Tucker and some prominent Jewish leaders \u2013 like Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the senior rabbi at New York City's Central Synagogue \u2013 aren't convinced by the mayor-elect's words of reassurance. In an October sermon, Buchdal accused Mamdani of contributing \"to a mainstreaming of some of the most abhorrent antisemitism.\"\n\"More importantly than hearing it, we want to see it,\" Tucker said.\nHe pointed to Mamdani's response to a protest last week outside of an Upper East Side synagogue hosting an event to support Jewish emigration to Israel, during which activists shouted threats. A Mamdani spokesperson was later quoted saying he \"discouraged the language,\" adding in an apparent nod of support to the protesters that \"these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.\"\nTucker said Mamdani should have come out quickly to condemn the behavior and rhetoric.\n\"You know, I don't know that the public has heard appropriately from him,\" he said.\nInside headquarters in Brooklyn, where the FDNY coordinates responses to emergencies across America's biggest city, Tucker says they're still waiting for outreach from Mamdani.\n\"I haven't had any personal conversations with the mayor-elect. I haven't heard from anyone in his incoming administration, nor has the department. And so I only hope that is not an indicator of their feelings about the FDNY. I'd like to think they think everything is going so well here that they don't need to transition so fast,\" he joked.\nMamdani and his team have not responded to CBS News' requests for comment on this story."

                "body": "SPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for the entirety of Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 1.\nOne big question ahead of Season 5 of Stranger Things is answered in the fourth episode of the final season, now streaming on Netflix.\nViewers and fans have long debated over Season 2\u2019s Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) and her place in the show\u2019s story after her arrival and standalone episode \u201cThe Lost Sister.\u201d She hadn\u2019t returned to the narrative in Seasons 3 or 4.\nToward the end of Episode 4, \u201cSorcerer,\u201d Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and Hopper (David Harbour) discover that Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton) has captured none other than Kali, 008, Eleven\u2019s \u201clost sister.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to bring her back because Linnea\u2019s an incredible performer. We wanted to give her another chance to shine, but we talk about it every year, every season. We didn\u2019t want to just put her in, to put her in,\u201d Ross Duffer said. \u201cWe wanted her to have a real impact on the narrative and on Eleven\u2019s journey. As we hit this final season, it felt wrong to not bring her back.\u201d\nWatch on Deadline\nSome felt that Kali\u2019s episode in Season 2 distracted from the plot, and many wondered if it would be a one-off moment not to be revisited later. In Season 4, Henry mentioned that 008 had still been present at the time of a traumatic memory for Eleven, but Kali wasn\u2019t present at the Massacre of Hawkins Lab.\n\u201cIt would have felt like, \u2018Oh, there was just this loose end or a mistake episode, and we didn\u2019t want that. We didn\u2019t feel like we could end the story of Stranger Things without bringing her back into the fold,\u201d Ross continued. \u201cAs you get into the second volume, you really see how she fits into the narrative and Eleven\u2019s journey, and she plays a really important role moving forward. Linnea\u2019s awesome, so it\u2019s definitely a big swing for this season, but one we\u2019re excited about.\u201d\nFrom the discovery scene, it seems as though Kay and her crew have determined how to extract Kali\u2019s powers and somehow transform them into the satellite technology they use to inhibit Eleven from using her own abilities. Hooked up to machines with a shaved head of her own, Kali opens her eyes to Eleven as they reconnect with no words said.\n\u201cIt was really, really exciting. The Duffers don\u2019t bring anyone back for no reason. [Kali]\u2019s definitely utilized heavily within the season,\u201d Brown told Deadline. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting because I don\u2019t think Eleven has much family in her life, or at least people that entirely understand what she\u2019s been through. One of those people honestly being Will, and not even Mike truly understands what she\u2019s been through. So I think Will and Kali are the two people that know that trauma and so I think every scene I had with her felt more emotional and more intense than the rest.\u201d\nStranger Things has had no shortage of overbearing scientists and other figures who hope to harness the mysterious powers of Eleven and The Upside Down for their own nefarious reasons, from Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine) to the Russians from Season 3 and 4.\nModine\u2019s Dr. Martin Brenner is largely responsible for the 5-season story arc as the creator of Eleven and the catalyst for Henry Creel\u2019s (Jamie Campbell Bower) growth into an all powerful being, aided by Eleven when she banished the first of Brenner\u2019s experiments to another dimension, from which The Upside Down was born. Brenner, who was long thought dead as of Season 1, made his way back to Eleven in Season 4 before he met his end in Episode 8, appropriately titled \u201cPapa.\u201d\n\u201cWe knew we needed a character to take over for Dr Brenner, because even though Matthew doesn\u2019t want to admit that he\u2019s dead, he is. He keeps putting out in the press, I think it\u2019s really cute, that he might still be alive. No, but he is firmly dead. So we needed a replacement for him, and something we did, we\u2019ve started doing this more as we went along, but we have done it before, which is working with our casting director, Carmen [Cuba], to find someone who we think would be really in"

                "body": "The Japanese yen extended its weakness into Thursday as a firm risk-on tone lifted major currencies and global equity futures. NZD and AUD outperformed, USD/JPY held a pivotal support zone, and the Nikkei 225 continued to shadow yen weakness as it hovered near the 50,000 level. With bullish signals appearing across several yen crosses and volatility seasonally low ahead of Thanksgiving, the next directional move hinges on whether sentiment can stay buoyant into week\u2019s end.\nView related analysis:\n- USD/JPY Probes Support as US Dollar Stumbles on Fed Cut Bets\n- Thanksgiving Market Seasonality: US Dollar, EUR/USD and Gold\n- Nasdaq 100 Leads Wall Street, Meta Bounce Gains Traction\n- Nasdaq 100 Outlook: Thanksgiving Seasonality and Volatility Trends\nYen Outlook: Weakness Persists as Global Risk Appetite Improves\nNew Zealand Dollar Surges After RBNZ Signals End of Easing Cycle\nThe New Zealand dollar was the strongest FX major on Thursday after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) signalled the end of their easing cycle. They delivered the well-telegraphed 25bp cut, though cited concerns of rising inflation. NZD/USD rose 1.4% during its best day in seven months, NZD/JPY closed to its highest level since January amid a weak Japanese yen environment.\nAustralian Inflation Re-Accelerates, RBA Cuts Priced Out\nAustralia\u2019s CPI came in hot which further vindicates the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) for inaction amid cried for further cuts. The monthly gauge of annual trimmed mean inflation rose to a 10-month high of 2.8%, CPI less volatile items and travel is now at 3.7% while weighted and broad CPI is at 3.5% y/y. Rate cuts have been effectively priced out of the RBA cash rate futures curve, with odds of a hike from Q3 2026 creeping higher into 2027. AUD/USD rose 0.7% during its best day in three months.\nYen Crosses Strengthen as Risk-On Tone Builds\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: Tradingview\nWall Street rose for a fourth day heading into Thanksgiving, and the risk-on tone left the yen as the weakest major currency. This opens the door for further upside across several yen crosses if sentiment remains buoyant.\n- AUD/JPY formed a bullish engulfing candle above its 20-day EMA and closed back above the 10-day EMA. A move towards 103 now looks plausible.\n- CHF/JPY printed a bullish engulfing day at its 20-day EMA and appears poised to retest cycle highs. A break above 196 assumes continued trend strength at record levels.\n- EUR/JPY bounced cleanly from its 10-day EMA and is edging closer to its cycle high, with a break above the 182 handle implied.\n- CAD/JPY formed a bullish engulfing candle between the 10 and 20-day EMAs and prior highs around 110.64, putting a run towards 112 on the radar for bulls.\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nI outlined the importance of the February high at 155.89 as a potential pivotal level yesterday, and so far it is holding as support. USD/JPY printed its most bullish candle in five sessions around this level, forming a two-bar bullish reversal (bullish piercing line) and hinting at a swing low around the 10-day EMA.\nHowever, volatility is likely to be low today as we head into Thanksgiving in the US. Using data since 1992, the average range for USD/JPY on Thanksgiving Day is just 0.55%, with a median of 0.44% \u2014 making it the least volatile session across the three days either side of the holiday. Average and median returns are slightly negative (but effectively flat) at -0.01% and -0.03%.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nThe Friday after Thanksgiving shows an average return of 0.09% and a median of 0.18%, with the highest win rate of the seven days monitored at 66.7%.\nSo we could be in for a quiet session today, with the potential for a retracement within Wednesday\u2019s range before bulls re-emerge tomorrow if the seasonal Thanksgiving pattern plays out.\n- A break beneath Wednesday\u2019s low (155.65) assumes a deeper pullback to the 155 area, near the weekly VPOC an"
