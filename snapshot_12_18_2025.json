So that's supporting both gold and silver right now,\" said Kelvin Wong, senior market analyst at OANDA, adding that some profit-taking could emerge at current levels.\nFed Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank can still cut rates amid a cooling labor market and would \"absolutely\" defend its independence if challenged, as he awaits an interview with U.S. President Donald Trump for Powell's succession.\nData earlier this week showed the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, above a Reuters poll forecast of 4.4% and the highest since September 2021.\nThe Fed last week delivered its third and final quarter-point rate cut of the year, with markets now pricing in two additional 25-basis-point cuts in 2026.

Silver, after an impressive surge to $66.88, slipped 0.7% to $65.78. A stronger dollar put pressure on metals, drawing investors to take profits after silver\u2019s standout rally. The recent uptick in US unemployment to 4.6% has markets expecting the Federal Reserve to cut rates even further in 2026, following three reductions already this year. While rate cuts are usu..\nally good news for gold and other non-yielding assets, short-term dollar strength can sway the market\u2019s mood. Political uncertainties, including President Trump\u2019s move to block Venezuelan oil shipments, added to safe-haven demand. Platinum rallied 2.5% to a 17-year high and palladium picked up 0.2%.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Metals take a breather while signals develop.\nThe latest pullback in gold and silver highlights how strong rallies often set up for pauses\u2014especially before major data drops like the US Consumer Price Index figures due soon. A firmer dollar generally puts pressure on metals, but if inflation cools or the Fed signals a more dovish path, metals could attract new attention. Platinum\u2019s surge to levels unseen in 17 years and continued strength in palladium show investors eyeing the wider precious metals arena amid longer-term shifts.\nThe bigger picture: Global crosswinds drive precious metals demand.\nThinner labor data in the US and expectations for more rate cuts are reshaping forecasts for non-yielding assets like gold and silver. On the global stage, flashpoints such as US blocks on Venezuelan oil are boosting safe-haven interest. As the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of England each chart their next moves, the metals market\u2019s sensitivity to macro policies and geopolitical swings remains front and center.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Gold loses momentum as traders book profits, US CPI data in focus\n- Gold price loses ground in Thursday\u2019s early European session, pressured by profit-taking and a stronger US Dollar.\n- Fed rate cut bets and geopolitical risks could boost safe-haven flows, capping the downside of Gold.\n- Traders will closely monitor the US November CPI inflation report on Thursday.\nGold price (XAU/USD) edges lower below $4,350 during the early European trading hours on Thursday. The precious metal retreats from seven-week highs amid some profit-taking and a rebound in the US Dollar (USD). The potential downside for the yellow metal might be limited after the recent US jobs data reinforced market expectations of further interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and dragged the USD lower. Lower interest rates could reduce the opportunity cost of holding Gold, supporting the non-yielding precious metal.\nFurthermore, geopolitical tensions escalate after Venezuela deploys its navy to escort oil ships amid US blockade threats. This, in turn, could boost the Gold price as it is considered a traditional safe-haven asset.\nTraders brace for the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, which will be published later on Thursday. The headline CPI is expected to show a rise of 3.1% YoY in November, while the core CPI is projected to show an increase of 3.0% YoY during the same period. Also, the US weekly Initial Jobless Claims will be released later in the day.\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Gold declines on profit-taking ahead of key CPI report\n- Venezuela\u2019s government has ordered its navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from its port, escalating the risk of a confrontation with the US after President Donald Trump ordered a \u201cblockade\u201d aimed at the country\u2019s oil industry.\n- Trump spoke in a national address early Thursday, saying that the next chairman of the Fed will be someone who believes in lower interest rates \"by a lot.\u201d He further noted that he will soon announce a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n- Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Wednesday backed further interest-rate cuts to get the central bank\u2019s setting back to neutral, per Bloomberg. However, Waller also warned there\u2019s no need to rush amid elevated inflation.\n- Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said on Tuesday that he did not support cutting rates last week and does not see a case for cutting rates next year unless inflation declines.\n- The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Tuesday revealed that Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose by 64,000 in November after falling by 105,000 in October. The Unemployment Rate in the US ticked higher to 4.6% in November from 4.4% in October.\n- Futures on the federal funds rate are now pricing in a 31% probability the Fed will reduce rates next month after the NFP report, compared with 22% just before, according to LSEG estimates.\nGold holds a positive long-term technical bias\nGold trades on a negative note on the day. According to the four-hour chart, the precious metal maintains a constructive outlook, with the price holding above the key 100-day Exponential Moving Average. The path of least resistance is to the upside as the Bollinger Bands widen and the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is located above the midline, suggesting that further upside looks favorable.\nIf green candlesticks show up and momentum builds above the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band of $4,352, XAU/USD could be gearing up for another run at an all-time high of $4,381, en route to the $4,400 psychological mark.\nOn the other hand, if the pair prints more red candles and stays below the December 17 low of $4,300, this could attract sellers toward the December 16 low of $4,271. The additional downside filter to watch is the 100-day EMA of $4,233.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed).

While coordinated OPEC+ production cuts offset non-OPEC gains in 2024, global output rebounded in 2025, rising an estimated 2.2 MMbpd. Non-OPEC producers contributed about 1.7 MMbpd of that increase, with Brazil, Guyana and Argentina responsible for roughly 28% of total global growth.\nIn Brazil, crude oil output surged in 2025 following the start-up of new FPSOs in deepwater developments. Production exceeded 4.0 MMbpd for the first time in October, supported by the October start-up of Equinor\u2019s Bacalhau field and additional capacity additions earlier in the year. The EIA forecasts Brazilian crude production will average about 4.0 MMbpd in 2026, supported by two additional FPSOs scheduled to come online at Petrobras\u2019 Buzios field.\nGuyana continues to post one of the fastest oil production growth rates globally, with output rising nearly tenfold since 2020. Production averaged an estimated 750,000 bpd in 2025, driven by developments in the Stabroek Block operated by ExxonMobil, alongside partners Hess and CNOOC. The EIA noted that ExxonMobil\u2019s Yellowtail project reached full capacity in late 2025, pushing Guyana\u2019s production above 900,000 bpd in November. The start-up of the Uaru project in 2026 is expected to add 250,000 bpd, helping Guyana surpass 1.0 MMbpd by 2027.\nIn Argentina, crude production growth is being driven by the Vaca Muerta shale play, one of the few unconventional oil basins outside the U.S. producing at scale. Argentine output is forecast to rise from about 740,000 bpd in 2025 to roughly 810,000 bpd in 2026, with Vaca Muerta accounting for more than 60% of national production.\nThe EIA said combined growth from Brazil, Guyana and Argentina will remain a key factor shaping global supply balances as non-OPEC production continues to expand into 2026.\nPictured above: The Buzios 7 FPSO, operating offshore Brazil.

Germany\u2019s IFO Business Confidence poll reported that sentiment deteriorated for the second straight month.\nTraders\u2019 eyes shift to the ECB\u2019s December monetary policy meeting, which is expected to be an event that would not move the needle, as President Christine Lagarde and Co. are expected to hold rates unchanged for this meeting and for the whole next year.\nIn the meantime, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could be a headwind for the Euro. The Ukrainian President Zelenskiy exerts pressure on Europe, saying that they should use Russia\u2019s frozen assets to end Putin\u2019s appetite for war.\nPolitico revealed that the US and Russia would hold talks over the Ukraine war in Miami this weekend.\nEuro Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies this week.

However, he stressed that there is no urgency to deliver additional easing, adding that inflation is unlikely to reaccelerate.\n- The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that Nonfarm Payrolls increased by 64K in November, topping forecasts of 50K and rebounding from October\u2019s revised \u2013105K decline.

                "body": "EUR/USD has had an interesting day as a stronger US Dollar has pushed the pair down for a retest of support at the 1.1700 handle. However, bulls remain interested and this is evidenced by the bounce back toward the 1.1750 handle as the day wore on.\nThe rest of this week still brings US CPI and an ECB meeting into the picture. This begs the question, where will EUR/USD be on the last day of 2025? Let us take a look at all the factors that could play a role and shape price action over the coming days.\nECB Meeting Preview\nThe European Central Bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged tomorrow. Markets have already priced in a stable deposit rate of 2.0%, and nearly all major institutions predict no change. While the decision itself seems predetermined, the meeting is expected to be tense due to significant disagreements within the Governing Council regarding the future path of inflation and interest rates.\nThe central conflict lies between \"dovish\" members, who want to cut rates sooner, and \"hawkish\" members, who advocate for patience. New macroeconomic projections are fueling this debate. Inflation is expected to fall below the 2% target in 2026 and 2027 (around 1.7%), which supports the argument for cutting rates now. However, inflation is projected to rise back above the target in 2028, largely due to delayed carbon pricing regulations.\nThe \"hawks\" argue that the Eurozone economy is resilient with growth expected to exceed 1% in 2025 and that the bank should not react to temporary dips in inflation when long-term risks remain. If ECB President Christine Lagarde adopts a \"hawkish\" tone during the press conference, emphasizing this resilience and a commitment to keeping rates restrictive, it could boost the value of the Euro, potentially pushing the EUR/USD exchange rate toward 1.1900.\nFor a full ECB Preview, read ECB: Rates on hold, debate heats up\nUS CPI Release\nThe BLS office cannot publish monthly inflation figures for October because the recent government shutdown stopped them from collecting the necessary price data.\nInstead, they will only release the yearly inflation rate for November, which I expect to rise to 3.2%, up from 3% in September. This increase is largely caused by higher taxes on imported goods and rising insurance premiums.\nDespite this rise, inflation isn't expected to climb much further because energy is getting cheaper, rent hikes are slowing, and pay raises are becoming smaller. By the second half of 2026, the inflation rate should fall back down to around 2.5%.\nIn the short-term though, a spike in inflation could add some strength to the US Dollar.and thus weigh on EUR/USD\nFor all market-moving economic releases and events, see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar. (click to enlarge)\nTechnical Analysis on EUR/USD\nLet us start with the technical picture on the four-hour chart\nEUR/USD has found significant support at the 1.1700 handle which was the swing high on December 4.\nA retest earlier in the day and aggressive bounce highlights this area as crucial to immediate bullish continuation.\nThe period-14 RSI also bounced back above the 50 level, a sign of bullish momentum.\nThe four-hour chart below also sees price trading within an ascending channel of sorts. Some may see the channel as a bear flag as well which would hint at a break lower.\nHowever, the overarching macro picture hints at bullish continuation which makes an upside break of the channel seem more likely at this stage.\nEUR/USD Four-Hour Chart, December 17, 2025\nSource:TradingView.com\nSupport\n- 1.1700\n- 1.1657 (100-day MA)\n- 1.1572\nResistance\n- 1.1800\n- 1.1919 (YTD Highs)\n- 1.2000 (psychological level)\nFollow Zain on Twitter/X for Additional Market News and Insights @zvawda\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or directors.

                "body": "The US Dollar weakened again during the American session, allowing EUR/USD to recover from earlier losses and stabilize near the 1.1750 area. Price action remains cautious as investors position themselves ahead of two major risk events: the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy decision and the release of US Consumer Price Index data.\nRecent US labor market figures delivered mixed signals. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that Nonfarm Payrolls fell sharply by 105,000 in October before rebounding with a 64,000 gain in November. The immediate response saw the US Dollar soften, but that weakness proved temporary as the Greenback later regained some lost ground.\nMarket expectations for Federal Reserve policy remain largely unchanged. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, traders continue to price in roughly a 25% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in January, little changed from levels seen prior to the employment report. Many participants viewed the sharp October payroll decline as distorted by the temporary loss of government jobs linked to the shutdown, limiting its longer-term impact on the Dollar.\nAdding to the cautious tone, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the latest labor data offered a mixed picture and did not alter the broader policy outlook. He reiterated his preference for keeping rates unchanged in December, highlighting survey data that continue to point toward rising input costs and lingering inflation pressures.\nLooking ahead, Wednesday\u2019s US economic calendar is relatively quiet in terms of top-tier releases, but several Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak. If policymakers reinforce the message of patience and signal support for holding rates into early 2026, the US Dollar may find near-term support, potentially capping EUR/USD upside attempts.\nAttention will then shift firmly to Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting. Alongside its rate decision, the ECB will publish updated economic projections, which could influence expectations around the future policy path. Any signals of confidence in the inflation outlook or resistance to near-term easing may provide the Euro with renewed support.\nUntil clarity emerges from these key events, EUR/USD is likely to trade in a tight range, with momentum driven primarily by shifts in rate expectations on both sides of the Atlantic.\nTrade Idea:\nEUR/USD buy on dips toward 1.1680, targeting 1.1820, with a stop below 1.1620, as ECB guidance and softer US inflation risks may support the Euro."

While the broader structure remains constructive, the immediate advance may be vulnerable while price trades below this zone, leaving the focus on whether the November uptrend can extend or if a deeper pullback will materialize. Traders should stay nimble as event-risk volatility into the BoE stands to shape the next leg for Sterling.

Join live on Monday\u2019s at 8:30am EST.\nBritish Pound Price Chart \u2013 GBP/USD Daily\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; GBP/USD on TradingView\nTechnical Outlook: In my last British Pound Short-term Outlook, we noted that GBP/USD was trading into uptrend resistance, \u201cwith the weekly / monthly opening-range taking shape just below. From a trading standpoint, losses would need to be limited to 1.3129 for the November advance to remain viable with a breach above 1.3284 needed to fuel the next leg of the rally.\u201d Sterling registered an intraday low at 1.3180 that day before reversing sharply higher with the subsequent breakout extending 2.1% off the December low.\nThe rally failed yesterday at the 61.8% retracement of the September decline at 1.3453. A softer-than-expected print on UK inflation data today briefly triggered a decline of more than 1% off the monthly high but the losses have since been recovered with GBP/USD still attempting to mark a fourth consecutive weekly advance. The focus now shifts to the Bank of England rate decision with the broader rally still vulnerable while below this resistance pivot.\nBritish Pound Price Chart \u2013 GBP/USD 240min\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; GBP/USD on TradingView\nNotes: A closer look at Sterling price action shows GBP/USD continuing to trade within the confines of an ascending pitchfork extending off the November lows. Price rebounded off the 25% parallel today and keeps immediate focus on a break of this week\u2019s range.\nSupport rests with the November high and the 38.2% retracement of the November advance at 1.3269/86. Note that the lower parallel converges on this threshold into the close of the week. A break / daily close below this slope would be needed to suggest a more significant high is in place and a larger trend reversal is underway. Subsequent support objectives rest with the 61.8% retracement at 1.3181 and the May / August low at 1.3140.\nA topside breach / close above Fibonacci resistance at 1.3453 is needed to mark uptrend resumption with subsequent objectives eyed at the October high at 1.3528 and 1.3593-1.3626- a region defined by the May / August high and the September high-day close (HDC). Look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nBottom line: The British Pound is range-bound just below resistance ahead of major event risk tomorrow. While the broader outlook remains constructive, the immediate advance may be vulnerable while below this pivot zone. From a trading standpoint, losses would need to be limited to 1.3269 for the November uptrend to remain viable with a breach above 1.3453 needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to cut rates by 25bps tomorrow for the fourth-time this year.

Spot prices currently trade around the 1.3370 region, down less than 0.10% for the day, as traders opt to wait on the sidelines ahead of the key central bank event risk and US consumer inflation data.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) is scheduled to announce its policy decision later today and is widely expected to lower interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), following a pause in November. The bets were reaffirmed by softer UK consumer inflation figures on Tuesday, which continue to undermine the British Pound (GBP) and turn out to be a key factor acting as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair.\nThe UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.2% over the year in November, marking a notable slowdown from 3.6% in October and missing expectations for a reading of 3.5%. Moreover, the gauge excluding volatile food and energy items \u2013 core CPI \u2013 climbed 3.2% YoY last month, compared to consensus estimates and October's 3.4% print.\nThis comes on top of a rise in Britain\u2019s unemployment rate to its highest since the start of 2021 and provides the BoE headroom to ease monetary policy further. The GBP bears, however, seem reluctant to place aggressive bets and opt to wait for more cues about the BoE's policy path before placing fresh bets. Apart from this, the lack of follow-through US Dollar (USD) buying supports the GBP/USD pair.\nDespite the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) cautious outlook, traders have been pricing in the possibility of two more rate cuts in 2026 amid visible signs of a softening US labor market. Moreover, expectations for a dovish replacement of Fed Chair fail to assist the USD in capitalizing on the overnight recovery. This, in turn, warrants caution before positioning for deeper losses for the GBP/USD pair.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoE Interest Rate Decision\nThe Bank of England (BoE) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the BoE is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is usually bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP). Likewise, if the BoE adopts a dovish view on the UK economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is seen as bearish for GBP.\nRead more.Next release: Thu Dec 18, 2025 12:00\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 3.75%\nPrevious: 4%\nSource: Bank of England\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

Core inflation also surprised on the downside, slipping from 3.4% to 3.2% instead of holding steady.\nThe softer inflation data reinforced conviction that the Bank of England will cut interest rates at Thursday\u2019s policy meeting. It also strengthened bets that policymakers may pursue a more aggressive easing cycle in early 2026, prompting Sterling to weaken as rate cut expectations were repriced.\nThe US Dollar (USD), meanwhile, found some support on Wednesday as markets modestly scaled back expectations for near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nAlthough recent US labour market indicators continue to point to cooling conditions, November\u2019s non-farm payrolls report proved less negative than feared.

The AUD/USD pair may gain ground as the Aussie Dollar could receive support from investors\u2019 caution following the release of Australia\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations, which rose to 4.7% in December from November\u2019s three-month low of 4.5%, supporting the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) hawkish stance.\nThe AUD could find support as markets grow increasingly expectant of an RBA rate hike as early as February. Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank now expect the RBA to start tightening sooner than previously projected, pointing to stubborn inflation in a capacity-constrained economy. Their forecasts followed the central bank\u2019s hawkish hold on rates at its final 2025 meeting last week.

We can steadily bring the policy rate down toward neutral,\u201d Waller said.\n- The CME FedWatch tool suggests that Fed funds futures are pricing an implied 75.6% chance of a hold in rates at the US central bank's next meeting in January, up from nearly 74% a week ago.\n- The US November jobs report showed payroll growth of 64K, slightly above forecasts, but October figures were revised sharply lower, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest since 2021, underscoring a gradually cooling labor market. Retail sales were flat on the month, reinforcing signs that consumer demand is losing momentum.\n- Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in a blog post on Tuesday that the jobs report was a mixed picture and that it did not change the outlook, and that he would prefer to leave rates unchanged at the last Fed meeting.\n- Fed officials are split over whether more easing of monetary policy is needed next year.

                "body": "AUD/USD corrects further to near 0.6620 as US Dollar gains, US CPI in focus\n- AUD/USD falls further to near 0.6620 as the US Dollar outperforms its peers.\n- The Fed and the RBA are unlikely to cut interest rates in the near term.\n- Investors await the US CPI data for fresh cues on the US interest rate outlook.\nThe AUD/USD pair extends its correction further to near 0.6620 during the European trading session on Wednesday, which started on Thursday after refreshing an almost three-month high near 0.6686. The Aussie pair is under pressure as the US Dollar (USD) recovers further on expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is done with reducing interest rates, at least for now, after lowering them by 75 basis points (bps) this year to 3.50%-3.75%.\nAt the time of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades 0.4% higher to near 98.60.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of the Fed reducing interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.25%-3.50% in the January meeting is almost 20%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also stated in the policy meeting last week that the bar for another interest rate cut is very high.\nMeanwhile, the rising United States (US) jobless rate has also failed to lift Fed dovish expectations. The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Tuesday showed that the Unemployment Rate accelerated to 4.6% in November, the highest reading seen since September 2021.\nGoing forward, the major driver for the Fed\u2019s monetary policy outlook will be the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November, which will be released on Thursday.\nOn the Australian Dollar (AUD) front, the currency is broadly stable against its other peers as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected to hold interest rates at their current levels. The RBA is unlikely to make dovish monetary adjustments in the near term as inflationary pressures have risen above the central bank\u2019s tolerance band of 2%-3%.\nEconomic Indicator\nUnemployment Rate\nThe Unemployment Rate, released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), is the percentage of the total civilian labor force that is not in paid employment but is actively seeking employment. The rate is usually higher in recessionary economies compared to economies that are growing. Generally, a decrease in the Unemployment Rate is seen as bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while an increase is seen as bearish. That said, the number by itself usually can't determine the direction of the next market move, as this will also depend on the headline Nonfarm Payroll reading, and the other data in the BLS report.\nRead more.Author\nSagar Dua\nFXStreet\nSagar Dua is associated with the financial markets from his college days.

Sterling slid after soft UK inflation revived expectations of another Bank of England cut, while the US dollar firmed broadly ahead of key US data. Meanwhile, USD/JPY wrongfooted bears despite a widely expected Bank of Japan hike, and Nikkei futures showed signs of a deeper corrective phase.\nView related analysis:\n- USD/JPY and AUD/JPY Test Key Support as Japanese Yen Strengthens\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: Momentum Fades as US Data Takes Centre Stage\n- Japanese Yen Technical Outlook: USD/JPY, CHF/JPY, AUD/JPY\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: Soft Jobs Cools AUD/USD Momentum\n- Japanese Yen Weakness Lifts USD/JPY and EUR/JPY while Nikkei Holds 50k\nUSD/JPY and Nikkei Outlook Ahead of Key Central Bank Risk\nIt was a volatile day for the British pound after weak inflation data put another BoE rate cut firmly back on the radar, with markets pricing a near-100% chance of a 25bp cut on Thursday. GBP/USD fell as much as 0.9% before recouping around half of the day\u2019s losses, leaving an elongated bearish hammer on the daily chart. AUD/USD fell for a fifth day during its most volatile session in a month, with a high-to-low range of 1.1%\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nDivisions within the Fed remain evident. Governor Waller again reiterated his preference for lower interest rates, contrasting with comments from Bostic the previous day, who argued a cut is not warranted. Market pricing is erring on the side of caution following last week\u2019s not-so-dovish Fed cut, with the dot plot leaving room for just a single 25bp cut in 2026. Money markets price a 75.6% chance of a hold in January and a 44.8% chance of a 25bp cut in March.\nIncoming data will shape those expectations, with CPI and jobless claims due today and consumer sentiment scheduled for Friday. The US dollar index was the strongest major currency on Thursday, while the Japanese yen was the weakest, despite expectations for the Bank of Japan to hike by 25bp tomorrow. The move appears fully priced, leaving little room for surprise unless the usually tight-lipped BoJ signals future cuts at the meeting \u2014 which looks unlikely.\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nDespite expectations of a BoJ hike, options traders are turning more bullish on USD/JPY, with risk reversals rising to show calls gaining relative to puts. With the US dollar hinting at a swing low \u2014 printing a bullish pin bar on Wednesday followed by a small bullish candle on Thursday \u2014 and USD/JPY posting a solid bullish daily bar, upside risks appear greater than I anticipated in yesterday\u2019s report.\nThe daily chart shows a decent rebound from support, keeping the 156.16 high in focus. However, a small rising wedge has formed on the 1-hour chart, alongside bearish divergences on both RSI (2) and RSI (14), which warns of a near-term pullback. Bulls could look to buy dips towards 155.29 or the broader 155.00\u2013155.10 zone in anticipation of another leg higher. A break above 156.20 would open the door for a move back towards the 157 highs.\nMy bias on USD/JPY remains bullish while prices hold above 154.30. That said, the Bank of Japan meeting is tomorrow, which could lift volatility if policymakers deliver a hawkish hike and strengthen the Japanese yen (pushing USD/JPY lower).\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nNikkei 225 Futures (NK) Technical Analysis\nThe Nikkei appears to be in a three-wave corrective phase following its strong rally above 50,000, which topped out in early November. Last week\u2019s second consecutive (and minuscule) doji has been followed by a clear bout of bearish range expansion this week, signalling that the index has likely entered wave C of an ABC retracement.\nThis opens the door for a move below 48,000. A 100% projection of wave A measured from wave B sits just above 46,000, making it a plausible downside target for bears should 48,000"

                "body": "Japanese Yen remains confined in a range as traders await BoJ rate decision on Friday\n- The Japanese Yen consolidates in a range as traders seem reluctant ahead of the BoJ meeting.\n- Bets for an imminent BoJ rate hike and a weaker risk tone lend support to the safe-haven JPY.\n- Dovish Fed expectations might keep a lid on the USD recovery and cap the upside for USD/JPY.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) extends its sideways consolidative price move through the Asian session on Thursday as traders opt to move to the sidelines ahead of the key central bank event risk. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is scheduled to announce its decision at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Friday and is widely expected to hike interest rates. The focus, however, will be on BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's post-meeting press conference, which will be scrutinized for cues about the future policy path and provide a fresh directional impetus to the JPY.\nHeading into the key central bank event risk, some repositioning trade might infuse volatility around the JPY amid worries about Japan's worsening fiscal health. That said, hawkish BoJ expectations mark a significant divergence in comparison to bets for more rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed), which keeps a lid on the attempted USD recovery and acts as a tailwind for the lower-yielding JPY. Apart from this, a generally weaker tone around the equity markets benefits the JPY's safe-haven status and warrants some caution for bearish traders.\nJapanese Yen traders seem non-committed ahead of the crucial BoJ rate decision on Friday\n- Traders turn cautious and refrain from placing aggressive directional bets around the Japanese Yen ahead of the start of a two-day Bank of Japan meeting this Thursday. The central bank will announce its policy decision on Friday and is widely expected to hike interest rates to 0.75%, or a three-decade high.\n- Furthermore, recent reports suggest that the BoJ would likely maintain a pledge to keep raising interest rates, but stress that the pace will depend on how the economy reacts to each hike. Hence, comments from BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda will be looked for cues about how far the central bank could raise rates.\n- Investors have been selling shorter-dated Japanese government bonds amid hawkish BoJ expectations. Adding to this, reports on the size of government spending next year fueled worries about Japan's worsening fiscal health and lifted the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB to its highest level since June 2007.\n- The resultant narrowing of the yield differential between Japan and other major economies acts as a tailwind for the Japanese Yen during the Asian session on Thursday. The US Dollar, on the other hand, preserves the overnight recovery gains and supports the USD/JPY pair heading into the key central bank event.\n- The upside for the USD, however, seems limited amid dovish Federal Reserve expectations. Traders have been pricing in the possibility of two more rate cuts by the US central bank in 2026. Apart from this, speculations that the new Trump-aligned Fed chair will be dovish keep a lid on any meaningful USD appreciation.\n- Traders also seem reluctant to place aggressive bets and opt to wait for the release of the latest US consumer inflation figures, due later during the North American session. The crucial data will be looked for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path, which should provide some impetus to the USD and the USD/JPY pair.\nUSD/JPY bulls await sustained strength above the 156.00 mark before placing fresh bets\nThe overnight breakout through the 100-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), along with positive oscillators on hourly and daily charts, backs the case for a further move up for the USD/JPY pair. However, it will still be prudent to wait for a sustained strength beyond the weekly high, around the 156.00 mark, before placing fresh bullish bets. Spot prices might then extend the positive momentum towards the monthly high, around the 157.00 neighborhood, touched las"

USD ends higher\nMajor FX rates traded in subdued ranges through the Asian session, with markets largely marking time ahead of a heavy 24-hour run of central-bank decisions and key data releases. Volatility was limited, reflecting caution rather than conviction, as investors await clarity from multiple policy fronts.\nThe yen was a modest underperformer. USD/JPY ticked a little higher to around 150.80, despite, or arguably because of, only mild verbal intervention from Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara, who said authorities were closely watching market moves, including long-term interest rates. The lack of any concrete warning or escalation was taken as a signal that Tokyo remains uncomfortable with yen weakness but is not yet prepared to act, allowing the currency to drift softer.\nRegional equities were mostly lower, tracking the soft tone on Wall Street on Wednesday, where weak price action weighed on sentiment and reinforced a defensive bias across risk assets.\nEarly data flow came from New Zealand, where third-quarter economic growth surprised to the upside and exceeded Reserve Bank of New Zealand forecasts. The expansion was broad-based, with investment spending showing particular strength, although household consumption lagged somewhat. While the data suggest the economy is beginning to lift itself off the canvas, markets were unconvinced. New Zealand rates edged lower and the kiwi dollar drifted modestly, reflecting lingering caution around the durability of the recovery and the near-term policy outlook.\nIn Washington, President Trump delivered a televised address from the White House that included several economy-related announcements. Trump said every U.S. service member will receive a one-off \u201cwarrior dividend\u201d payment of $1,776 before Christmas, a fiscal transfer worth roughly $2.5 billion. While modest in macro terms, the move reinforces expectations of targeted fiscal support and the renewed use of direct cash payments. Trump also said he would soon name a new Federal Reserve chair who favours significantly lower interest rates, remarks likely to keep markets alert to policy-credibility risks.\nThe rest of Thursday brings a packed agenda. The Bank of England is expected to cut rates by 25bp to 3.75%, the ECB is seen holding policy steady, and U.S. November CPI is due. Attention then turns to Friday, when the Bank of Japan is expected to deliver a historic rate hike, to 0.75%, its highest level in three decades.\nAsia-Pac stocks:\n- Japan (Nikkei 225) -1.07%\n- Hong Kong (Hang Seng) -0.44%\n- Shanghai C"

But after such a steep slide, the move now looks stretched. Recent U.S. private-sector data has held up well, limiting the risk of the Fed delivering a fourth consecutive cut in January. At the same time, the latest Canadian inflation report revealed easing price pressures. Throw in crude oil hitting multi-year lows and it takes some of the sting out of the bullish CAD case. Traders should now be alert for signs of a swing bottom, which could mark the start of a corrective bounce.\nShifting Macro Backdrop Questions Bearish Bias\nWhen we turned bearish on USD/CAD at the end of November, the backdrop was clear: Canadian data was perking up, the Bank of Canada (BoC) looked close to calling time on cuts, and Fed easing bets were building fast. Fast forward to now and the tone has shifted. U.S. data has held up better than feared, Canadian inflation has softened, and crude has slumped to multi-month lows. That\u2019s a very different mix to what drove the breakdown.\nOn the U.S. side, November payrolls rose 64,000 after October\u2019s 105,000 slump tied to federal job losses, but private-sector hiring is the real story. It's averaged 75,000 over the past three months, led by healthcare and construction. And while retail sales were flat in October, the control group that feeds into GDP delivered a chunky gain, pointing to underlying resilience in spending. That combination makes a fourth consecutive Fed cut in January look unlikely.\nCanada\u2019s overall data tone has been decent, helped by a big drop in unemployment in November, but the November inflation report released earlier this week told a different story. Headline CPI held at 2.2% from a year earlier, while core slipped below 3% for the first time since March, with the average of the two core measures sliding to 2.8%. Food prices jumped 4.2% over the year, but most other components cooled, with gasoline slumping 7.8% over the same period. That softness gives the BoC time to pause and assess rather than rush into tightening policy, especially with crude hitting multi-month lows.\nPut it all together and the backdrop looks less one-sided than it did a few weeks ago. The bearish USD/CAD move was justified, but after such a sharp breakdown, the risk-reward is shifting. With 1.3725 acting as support, traders should be watching for signs of a swing bottom and a corrective bounce rather than chasing fresh lows.\nUSD/CAD Bottoming?\nSource: TradingView\nGiven the price action on Wednesday, we may have just seen one in the form of a bullish engulfing candle. Coming after a prolonged downturn and a string of doji candles pointing to market indecision, the merits of the signal are arguably strengthened, especially as the reversal came ahead of key support at 1.3725.\nWith RSI (14) flicking higher from oversold territory and MACD looking like it\u2019s bottoming deep in negative territory, the momentum picture suggests downside strength is waning. While both remain firmly in bearish territory, favouring a similar bias, combined with Wednesday\u2019s price signal, it feels like we may be at or nearing a turning point.\nPullbacks towards 1.3725 would offer an attractive entry level for longs, allowing for a stop to be placed beneath the level for protection against a resumption of the prior bearish trend. Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee we\u2019ll see a pullback given the price signal, meaning those looking to enter around current levels would need to assess what target would be necessary for the trade to stack up from a risk-reward perspective.\nLevels to consi"

The US Dollar (USD) holds ground from market caution ahead of the release of the delayed US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report due later in the day, which is expected to provide further insight into how price pressures are evolving.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller, who is under consideration to become chair of the central bank, reiterated his dovish stance on interest rates during a CNBC forum. \u201cBecause inflation is still elevated, we can take our time - there\u2019s no rush to get down. We can steadily bring the policy rate down toward neutral,\u201d Waller said.\nThe CME FedWatch tool suggests that Fed funds futures are pricing an implied 75.6% chance of a hold in rates at the US central bank's next meeting in January, up from nearly 74% a week ago.\nThe USD/CAD pair may gain ground as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) faces challenges amid declining Oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades lower near $56.00 per barrel at the time of writing. However, the downside of the Oil prices could be restrained amid rising geopolitical tensions.\nThe United States (US) has ordered a complete halt to maritime traffic involving sanctioned Oil tankers traveling to and from Venezuela. At the same time, Washington is pushing for stricter sanctions on Russia\u2019s energy sector to support peace negotiations over Ukraine, fueling worries about possible disruptions to global supply.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency,"

November\u2019s Consumer Prices Index showed inflation steady at a 2.2% annual rate, below expectations of 2.4%.\nKey influences on the Canadian Dollar include BoC interest rates, Oil prices, economic health, inflation, and trade balance. The BoC aims to maintain inflation between 1-3% by altering interest rates, with higher rates generally benefiting the CAD.\nWe are seeing USD/CAD test the 1.3800 level this week, bouncing from a three-month low around 1.3745. This move is happening as the US Dollar regains some strength across the board. The market is currently cautious ahead of major data releases.\nMarket Watch On Inflation Report\nThe recent US jobs report showed a notable softening, with unemployment rising to a four-year high of 4.6%. This weak data has put pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider easing its policy in the coming year. As a result, we see the market is now seriously debating a rate cut as early as the March 2026 meeting.\nIn contrast, the Bank of Canada appears to be on hold, with Governor Macklem stating that current rates are appropriate. The latest inflation reading of 2.2% supports this neutral stance, as it sits comfortably within the bank\u2019s target range. This policy difference is creating a fundamental headwind for USD/CAD.\nAll eyes are now on the US Consumer Price Index report scheduled for release tomorrow. A lower-than-expected inflation number would reinforce the case for Fed cuts and could quickly reverse the recent gains in USD/CAD. Conversely, a surprise to the upside might push the pair higher as traders postpone their rate cut expectations.\nAnother key factor supporting the Canadian dollar is the price of oil, which has firmed up in recent weeks. Recent data shows WTI crude futures for delivery in early 2026 are holding above $82 a barrel, supported by ongoing OPEC+ supply discipline. This provides a solid underlying bid for the loonie that we cannot ignore.\nHistorically, we\u2019ve seen the US Dollar weaken when the Federal Reserve pivots towards rate cuts ahead of its peers, similar to the cycle we observed back in 2019. This historical pattern suggests the path of least resistance for the US dollar could be lower over the medium term. This environment of uncertainty makes buying options an attractive strategy to manage risk.\nConsidering the potential for a sharp move after tomorrow\u2019s inflation data, we should look at options strategies. Buying USD/CAD puts with a strike price below 1.3700 for expiration in late January could be a way to position for a return to the recent lows. This approach allows us to capitalize on a potential downturn while defining our maximum risk."

                "body": "GBP/JPY Price Forecast: Pair steadies above 207.00 ahead of BoE and BoJ decisions\n- GBP/JPY rebounds from the 207.00 area after UK inflation weighs on Sterling.\n- Traders avoid aggressive bets ahead of Thursday\u2019s BoE monetary policy meeting.\n- A sustained break above 208.00 could open the door for a move toward a fresh year-to-date high above 209.00.\nThe British Pound (GBP) trims earlier losses against the Japanese Yen (JPY) on Wednesday after an initial sell-off triggered by softer-than-expected UK inflation data. At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is trading around 207.80, rebounding after buyers stepped in near the 207.00 psychological level.\nThe recovery, however, lacks conviction and appears driven by short-term repositioning, as traders remain reluctant to take aggressive bets ahead of the interest rate decisions from both the Bank of England (BoE) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ).\nLooking ahead, most of the policy outcome is already priced in. The BoJ is expected to raise interest rates, while the BoE is seen cutting rates, leaving the focus firmly on forward guidance that could play a key role in setting the next move for GBP/JPY.\nFrom a technical perspective, GBP/JPY remains in a strong uptrend on the daily chart, marked by a clear sequence of higher highs and higher lows. Prices continue to trade comfortably above key moving averages, reinforcing the broader bullish bias.\nOn the upside, the 208.00 psychological level acts as immediate resistance. A sustained break above this barrier could open the door for another leg higher toward a fresh year-to-date high above 209.00, with scope for further gains if bullish momentum strengthens.\nOn the downside, immediate support is seen near 207.00, which aligns with the 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A break below this level would weaken the near-term outlook and expose the 204.00\u2013205.00 support zone near the 50-day SMA. A decisive drop below the 50-day SMA would shift the tone toward a deeper corrective phase, with the 100-day SMA around 201.00 coming into focus.\nMomentum indicators remain supportive, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) holding near 60 and staying above its midline, suggesting that bullish momentum is still intact.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoJ Interest Rate Decision\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) announces its interest rate decision after each of the Bank\u2019s eight scheduled annual meetings. Generally, if the BoJ is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is bullish for the Japanese Yen (JPY). Likewise, if the BoJ has a dovish view on the Japanese economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is usually bearish for JPY.\nRead more.Next release: Fri Dec 19, 2025 03:00\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 0.75%\nPrevious: 0.5%\nSource: Bank of Japan\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and commodities market.

Spot prices drop to a fresh daily low, around the 207.30 area during the early European session and for now, seem to have stalled the previous day's recovery move from an over one-week low.\nThe UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.2% over the year in November, marking a notable slowdown from 3.6% in October and missing expectations for a reading of 3.5%. Adding to this, the core gauge, which excludes volatile food and energy items, climbed 3.2% YoY during the reported month, compared to consensus estimates and October's 3.4% print. The data reaffirms market bets that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates on Thursday, which, in turn, weighs on the British Pound (GBP) and exerts some downward pressure on the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe Japanese Yen's (JPY) relative outperformance could further be attributed to the growing acceptance of an imminent rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Friday. The bets were lifted by BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments last week, saying that the likelihood of the central bank's baseline economic and price outlook materialising had been gradually increasing. Ueda added that the BoJ is getting closer to attaining its inflation target, backing the case for further policy normalization. Apart from this, a weaker tone around the equity markets is seen as another factor benefiting the safe-haven JPY.\nThe aforementioned fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for the GBP/JPY cross is to the downside. Traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets and opt to wait on the sidelines ahead of the key central bank event risks \u2013 the BoE rate decision on Thursday and the latest BoJ policy update on Friday. The latter will play a key role in influencing the near-term JPY price dynamics amid concerns about Japan's deteriorating fiscal condition on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's massive spending plan and help in determining the next leg of a directional move for the currency pair.\nEconomic Indicator\nConsumer Price Index (YoY)\nThe United Kingdom (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly basis, is a measure of consumer price inflation \u2013 the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall \u2013 produced to international standards. It is the inflation measure used in the government\u2019s target. The YoY reading compares prices in the reference month to a year earlier. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Last release: Wed Dec 17, 2025 07:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nActual: 3.2%\nConsensus: 3.5%\nPrevious: 3.6%\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nThe Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation, as measured by the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) at around 2%, giving the monthly release its importance. An increase in inflation implies a quicker and sooner increase of interest rates or the reduction of bond-buying by the BOE, which means squeezing the supply of pounds. Conversely, a drop in the pace of price rises indicates looser monetary policy. A higher-than-expected result tends to be GBP bullish.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "Bitcoin is now, almost paradoxically to its original ethos, being adopted by Wall Street. Bittensor is a new finger to \u201cthe man\u201d of centralization. It\u2019s a sizzling hot narrative. With the rise of AI, concerns have arisen about the tech\u2019s concentration and centralization.\nBittensor, and its cryptocurrency, TAO, aims to decentralize AI services. Despite losing nearly 53% in 2025, some believe Bittensor is a next-generation Bitcoin for the AI age. But how realistic is this optimism?\nThe Premise and Promise of Bittensor\nThe network just completed a reward halving on December 15, reducing its supply of minted coins. The problem is, many have heard this narrative before.\nSponsoredPlenty of cryptocurrencies have claimed to be \u201cthe next Bitcoin\u201d \u2013 because there\u2019s money to be made with that story.\nHowever, there could be some real value for Bittensor over the long run \u2013 though it has hurdles to overcome, as any sort of ambitious crypto project like this would.\nThe tale of Bittensor is not unlike Bitcoin: There are powerful incumbents, and a new network can take on and even upend this world order.\nFor years, influencers rehashed an often similar, anthemic phrase of \u201clong Bitcoin, short the banks\u201d. Notwithstanding that now Bitcoin is embedded in Wall Street banks and publicly traded DAT stocks, this narrative worked well.\nA premise is that AI companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Deepseek have become too big and frightening, and people need to be concerned about their rise.\nDecentralizing artificial intelligence workloads and replacing proof-of-work puzzles with actual real-use AI is Bittensor\u2019s basic gist.\n\u201cBitcoin proved that cryptographic incentives could coordinate a global network of hardware to secure a ledger,\u201d Evan Malanga, an executive at Yuma, one of the largest backers of the Bittensor platform, told BeInCrypto. \u201cBittensor takes that same mechanism and redirects the compute power toward something that has direct benefits in today\u2019s world: Training and running AI models, applications, and infrastructure.\u201d\nAnother Bitcoin? Really?\nIt\u2019s important to note that Yuma is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), whose firm was one of the earliest backers of various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Zcash, and Decentraland.\nSponsored SponsoredIt was also an early investor in Coinbase, Circle, and Chainalysis. DCG\u2019s CEO, Barry Silbert, is clearly on board with Bittensor \u2013 which for some could be considered a positive signal.\nBittensor does have some Bitcoin-like characteristics. There are only 21 million units of TAO, clearly a nod to BTC. Bittensor also has halvings, which in December reduced its rewards from 7,200 TAO to 3,600 per day.\nInstead of the energy-intensive proof-of-work riddles Bitcoin uses, Bittensor uses something called proof-of-intelligence, where nodes must perform tasks to prove their capability in handling AI workloads. The better a node\u2019s task output quality, the higher the chance it can receive rewards in TAO.\nNodes that are allowed on the Bittensor network are then assigned a subnet, of which there are currently 128. These subnets have different AI-related specialties.\n\u201cEach subnet is like a specialized marketplace for a specific type of AI service \u2013 some focus on image generation, others on language models,\u201d said Arrash Yasavolian, the cofounder of Taoshi, which runs a financial intelligence subnet.\nCentralization Versus Decentralization\nConcerns about AI often center on a few companies having concentrated power. Concentration in any industry typically means higher prices and poorer services for customers \u2013 sometimes both at the same time.\nSponsoredBittensor aims to make AI more of a global good with its decentralization characteristics, like having independent node operators power the subnets for its artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\u201cAI is redefining every industry,\u201d said Ken Jon Miyachi, CEO of BitMind, which runs a subnet focused on deepfake detections on Bittensor. \u201dBitcoin revolutionized the "

The major DeFi lending platforms on Ethereum, Aave, MakerDAO, and Compound, hold about 72% of the market share.\nAave increased its TVL by 52% in Q2 2025, outpacing broader DeFi growth of 26%. The protocol has expanded across 14 blockchain networks and handles billions in flash loans and cross-chain transactions monthly.\nBinance is leveraging cheaper transaction fees and an overall better user experience to compete. Platforms built on other chains like Solana, which holds 5.1% of DeFi deposits, have demonstrated that users will migrate for lower costs and better performance.\nMarket data also suggests there\u2019s room for competition despite Ethereum\u2019s lead. DeFi lending is experiencing rapid growth, with over 7.8 million users. The market has also surged by about 38% from $19.1 billion in 2024 to over $26 billion by mid-2025.\nThe partnership with Venus Protocol gives Binance immediate access to established DeFi infrastructure rather than building from scratch.\nJoin Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes"

The company also plans to introduce perpetual futures tied to stocks outside the U.S. next year.\nThe offering mirrors services offered by competitors like Kraken and Robinhood, which Coinbase described as an \u201cimportant milestone toward enabling tokenized stocks.\u201d Coinbase also plans to debut a service allowing institutions to tokenize assets.\nIn an interview with Decrypt, Coinbase Head of Trading Scott Shapiro said the company hopes to offer access to tokenized stock trading in the coming quarter. He noted that Coinbase\u2019s stock offering, from the get-go, is compatible with Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to do,\u201d he said, explaining that the tokenization timeline is largely dependent on guidance being crafted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cThe government shutdown obviously didn't help.\u201d\nShapiro said that Coinbase\u2019s model for tokenization will allow market participants to \u201cwrap and unwrap\u201d traditional shares, which can move across various blockchains and applications while \u201cthe underlying stock is still custodied in a safe place.\u201d\nFollowing Robinhood\u2019s support of Kalshi-powered prediction markets this summer, Coinbase indicated that its entry into space will also tap the Polymarket competitor. The company noted that it plans to integrate additional prediction market platforms in the future.\nThe company said that it will also allow U.S. customers to trade perpetual futures, which allow traders to indefinitely hold leveraged positions tied to digital assets. In July, Coinbase began offering perpetual-style futures for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nThe company said that customers can now trade any asset that\u2019s supported on a Solana-based decentralized exchange directly within Coinbase\u2019s mobile app. The feature was teased in August, when Coinbase first offered access to tokens on its Ethereum layer-2 network, Base.\n\u201cWith millions of assets on Base and Solana now available by default in the main Coinbase app, we'll continue expanding to further networks over time,\u201d a company blog post stated.\nCoinbase highlighted that its Base app, a rebrand of the company\u2019s self-custody wallet, has become available in 140 countries. The app allows users to earn from posts and play games, blending social elements with features that crypto users have grown accustomed to.\nThe company said its \u201csystem update\u201d also entails an AI-powered advisor for wealth management that can help customers build portfolios or digest news.\nFinally, the exchange said that it would offer a service allowing companies to create custom stablecoins, allowing them to put their \u201cbrand front-and-center in every transaction.\u201d That dovetails with x402, an internet standard stablecoin payments that can be used to power AI agent payments, the exchange added.\nAnalysts at investment bank Compass Point estimated this week that Coinbase could take in $230 million annually from prediction markets. However, analysts at investment bank Mizuho also warned that a significant portion of users are likely to sell crypto to fund wagers.\nCoinbase shares changed hands around $244 on Wednesday, according to Yahoo Finance.

                "body": "Advertisement|Remove ads.\nThe BONK.fun ecosystem\u2019s market capitalization nearly doubled on Tuesday night, soon after a U.S. class-action lawsuit targeted Pump.fun, Solana Labs, and other parties.\nAccording to Coingecko data, the overall market cap of the BONK.fun ecosystem surged by about 98.5% in one day, reaching about $241 million. The trading volume also shot up as a number of BONK-related tokens saw big gains. BONK.fun, which is also known as LetsBONK.fun, is a Solana (SOL)-based memecoin launchpad and trading platform. Many people think it is a direct competitor to Pump.fun.\nBONK.fun\u2019s native token BONK was trading at $0.058555, down 0.8% over the past day. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around BONK rose to \u2018bullish\u2019 from \u2018bearish\u2019 over the past day, while chatter around the cryptocurrency remained in \u2018low\u2019 levels.\nMeanwhile, SOL was trading at $127.66, up 0.3% over the past day. Solana\u2019s price was among the top 10 trending coins on Stocktwits, coming 4th. However, on Stocktwits, retail sentiment around SOL remained in \u2018bearish\u2019 territory with \u2018low\u2019 levels of chatter over the past day.\nThe rally occurred after a federal court in New York ruled that the plaintiffs could file a second amended complaint in a lawsuit first filed in January 2025. Diego Aguilar and Michael Okafor are two of the plaintiffs who said that Pump.fun, Solana, and associated entities let insiders get early access to new tokens. This allowed them to buy them at low rates and then sell them when prices rose, inflicting financial losses on retail investors.\nAccording to the court documents shared by Burwick Law, new claims have been added, including almost 5,000 internal chat records from a private source that the plaintiffs say reveal that platform users are working together. The lawsuit also discusses Solana Labs' infrastructure and validator mechanics, as well as tools developed by Jito Labs, saying that these made it easier for insiders to process transactions faster.\nMarket watchers and the crypto community seemed to think that the legal change could be bad news for Solana. An X user and Cradano ambassador named Pete said on X that this lawsuit \u201ccould get ugly for Solana\u201d and \u201ccould even begin its downfall.\u201d\nOn the other hand, BONK.fun's ecosystem got more attention, and investors seemed to have moved to other Solana-based memecoin platforms like BONK.fun. Notably, Pump.fun and other defendants denied misconduct in previous proceedings.\nAs per AMBCrypto, in July 2025, BONK.fun momentarily overtook Pump.fun in 24-hour revenue, generating $1.32 million, reflecting 61% of total sales volume versus Pump.fun, which consisted only of 19%.\nRead also: XRP Outperforms Bitcoin, Ethereum \u2013 But Analysts Warn BTC\u2019s Volatility Is Far From Over\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com"

The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% in early trading Tuesday. It\u2019s a bit below the all-time high it set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.2%. Treasury yields were mixed after one report said the unemployment rate was at its worst level last month since 2021, but employers also added more jobs than economists expected. A separate report said sales at U.S. retailers and restaurants were unchanged in October.\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.\nWall Street inched slightly lower early Tuesday ahead of the release of U.S. employment and inflation reports that could drive the direction of interest rates.\nFutures for the S&P 500 fell 0.2% before the bell Tuesday, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were unchanged. Nasdaq futures lost 0.2%.\nShares in Roomba maker iRobot sank more than 20% in premarket trading after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. That was on top of a nearly 73% decline on Monday. The company known for its robotic vacuums said it doesn\u2019t expect any disruptions to its devices as it is taken private.\nFord Motor Co. shares ticked up a little more than 1% after the automaker announced Monday that it is pivoting away from its once-ambitious electric vehicle plans amid financial losses and waning consumer demand. Ford, which has poured billions of dollars into electrification along with most of its industry peers, said it will no longer make the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck.\nThe main focus on Wall Street this week will be several big updates on how the U.S. economy is faring.\nEconomists expect the jobs report from November, due Tuesday, to show employers added 40,000 more jobs than they cut during the month. An update on inflation Thursday is forecast to show U.S. consumers paid prices that were 3.1% higher in November than a year before.\nInvestors are hoping that the job market will weaken by just enough to get the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but not so much that the economy slips into recession. Lower rates help boost the economy and prices for investments, but also may worsen inflation.\nEconomists expect Tuesday\u2019s report to show the unemployment rate at 4.4%, which would keep it near its worst level since 2021.\nAlso coming Thursday is the government's latest data on retail sales.\nIn Europe at midday, Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, while the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.2% lower. Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.5%.\nIn Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 declined 1.6% to 49,383.29 as preliminary factory data showed manufacturing slowing slightly. The S&P Global Flash purchasing managers index rose to 49.7 from 48.7 in November on a scale of up to 100 where 50 marks the cut off for expansion.\nInvestors are watching Japanese data carefully ahead of a Bank of Japan policy meeting on Friday that is widely expected to result in an interest rate hike that could rattle world bond, currency and cryptocurrency markets.\nChinese markets also retreated after figures for November, released Monday, came in weaker than expected. Retail sales rose at their slowest rate since 2022, during the pandemic, at 1.3% from a year earlier in November. Lending and investment also weakened.\n\u201cOverall, the data set confirms a loss of momentum into (the) year-end and is consistent with our growth forecasts that moderating to around 4%\u201d in the last quarter of this year, Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank said in a report.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.5% to 25,235.41, while the Shanghai Composite index lost 1.1% to 3,824.81.\nSouth Korea's Kospi gave up 2.2% to 3,999"

This decline emphasized the potential for an impending rate cut by the BoE. Subsequently, the sterling weakened, raising expectations for more rate reductions in the coming years.\nBank stocks led the upward trend, with the FTSE 350 banking index recording its highest level since 2008, driven by notable gains in HSBC Holdings, Standard Chartered, and Barclays. Energy stocks, rebounding by 2.5%, were lifted by rising oil prices following U.S. actions against Venezuelan oil tankers.\nIndustrial metal miners saw a 2.4% surge, supporting the FTSE 100 in its race to have its best year since 2009.

Core inflation softened too, landing at 2.4%, suggesting that while price pressures are easing, they\u2019re still not gone for good. These figures have markets betting that the ECB will likely keep interest rates where they are, pausing for now. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s ifo business climate..\nindex fell to its lowest since May, flagging ongoing economic stagnation in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Even so, analysts like ING think glimmers of recovery are starting to take hold. Despite the tough backdrop, Siemens Healthineers stood out, jumping after an upgrade from RBC Capital Markets, who see untapped potential in asset sales and improved liquidity. Similarly, defense group KNDS announced ambitions for a substantial dual-listing in Frankfurt and Paris by 2026, eyeing a hefty \u20ac20 billion valuation\u2014provided markets cooperate.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Cautious optimism finds its footing.\nWith eurozone inflation behaving and the ECB expected to hold rates steady, investors are skimming the headlines for pockets of opportunity in a sluggish climate. The DAX\u2019s latest moves underline how sensitive markets remain to central bank signals and business outlooks. Eye-catching gains\u2014like those from Siemens Healthineers and KNDS\u2019s IPO plans\u2014highlight that while the overall mood is tepid, some stocks and sectors could still deliver growth.\nThe bigger picture: Recovery\u2019s path is far from smooth.\nEurope is wrestling with a two-speed recovery: inflation is nearly back on track, which reassures policymakers, but weak business sentiment reveals underlying challenges. Companies forging ahead with strategic sales, IPOs, and expansions are betting that recovering demand and fresh investment will help drive a turning point, even if nervousness still lingers across the region.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

It came after inflation data published Wednesday showed that the U.K. inflation rate cooled to 3.2% in November, down from 3.6% a month earlier.\nThe index was lifted higher by financial services and homebuilder stocks, which reacted positively to the November inflation figures and the prospect of an interest rate cut from the Bank of England this week.\nThe BOE's nine-member monetary policy committee is expected to trim interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75%, given a backdrop of lackluster growth and signs that unemployment could be ticking higher.\nHomebuilder Barratt Redrow gained 3.7%, topping the FTSE 100, while retirement savings firm Phoenix Group finished the session 3.3% higher.\nThe British pound fell in the aftermath of the inflation print, and was last seen trading around 0.2% lower against the U.S. dollar.\nAgainst the euro, the pound lost around 0.3%.\nYields on British government bonds, known as gilts, fell across the curve following the inflation print.

                "body": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance the First Capital, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCAP) share price is 179% higher than it was three years ago. Most would be happy with that. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 50% gain in the last three months.\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for First Capital investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nDuring three years of share price growth, First Capital achieved compound earnings per share growth of 9.7% per year. In comparison, the 41% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of First Capital's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWhat About Dividends?\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of First Capital, it has a TSR of 210% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nA Different Perspective\nIt's good to see that First Capital has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 128% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 3% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Before spending more time on First Capital it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.\nOf course First Capital may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of growth stocks.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if First Capital might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 6:15 a.m. ET, Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025. U.S. stock futures are edging higher early Wednesday after a mixed Tuesday session, as investors recalibrate expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts and brace for a late-week burst of inflation data. The pre-market tone is being shaped by three forces: a \u201cnoisy\u201d jobs report that revived easing bets, a rebound in oil after fresh Venezuela headlines, and a busy stretch for earnings and deal-driven single-stock moves. [1]\nUS stock futures rise modestly ahead of the opening bell\nAs of roughly 5:50 a.m. ET, futures pointed to a slightly stronger start for Wall Street:\n- Dow Jones futures: 48,234, +0.21%\n- S&P 500 futures: 6,824, +0.34%\n- Nasdaq 100 futures: 25,240.5, +0.40% [2]\nThe modest uptick comes after Tuesday\u2019s uneven close, when the Dow fell about 0.6%, the S&P 500 slipped about 0.2%, and the Nasdaq finished slightly higher, reflecting a market that\u2019s struggling to pick a clear direction into year-end while macro uncertainty remains elevated. [3]\nWhy markets are hesitant: inflation reports are about to take over the tape\nThe next big test for risk assets is inflation\u2014and the calendar is unusually concentrated late in the week.\nReuters reports markets are focused on U.S. CPI on Thursday and PCE inflation on Friday, data that could quickly reshape the outlook for 2026 rate cuts. [4]\nThat matters because traders have been leaning more dovish again after the latest labor data and the Fed\u2019s most recent decision. Reuters notes the Fed delivered its third quarter-point cut of 2025 last week, and markets are still pricing about two quarter-point cuts in 2026. [5]\nThe tension: the Fed\u2019s \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d credibility is being tested by signs of a cooling labor market, while inflation has not fully disappeared as a risk. That push-pull is why each major data point is landing harder than it normally would in mid-December.\nFed speakers in focus: Waller and Williams set the tone before CPI\nWednesday also brings key Fed communication risk, starting early in the U.S. session.\nInvesting.com reports Fed Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled to speak at 8:15 a.m. ET, his first remarks since last week\u2019s rate cut\u2014an appearance that could influence how aggressively markets price the next leg of easing. [6]\nSeparately, MarketWatch\u2019s calendar highlights that New York Fed President John Williams is also slated to speak this morning (listed at 9:05 a.m. ET). [7]\nInvestors are also tracking Fed leadership speculation: Investing.com says a Wall Street Journal report indicates President Donald Trump is set to interview Waller regarding the next Fed chair, with Powell\u2019s term scheduled to end in May. [8]\nCommodities are back in the driver\u2019s seat: oil jumps, metals surge\nOil rebounds on Venezuela blockade headlines\nEnergy is back in focus after crude bounced sharply. Reuters reports oil rose more than 2% after President Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, injecting new supply uncertainty into a market already grappling with shifting geopolitics. [9]\nAt around 6:00 a.m. ET, Markets Insider showed:\n- WTI crude futures: $56.57, +2.35%\n- Brent crude futures: $60.34, +2.55% [10]\nTraders will also watch U.S. inventory signals: Reuters notes API data showed U.S. crude stocks fell 9.3 million barrelslast week, with official EIA figures due later Wednesday for confirmation. [11]\nSilver and gold stay red-hot\nMeanwhile, precious metals continue to post outsized moves. Reuters reports silver surged past $65/oz and hit an intraday record $66.52, with gold also advancing as rate-cut expectations firmed and investors positioned ahead of CPI/PCE. [12]\nMarkets Insider data around 6:00 a.m. ET showed silver futures near $65.91 (+3.39%) and gold futures near $4,317.71 (+0.36%).

When the overtaxed systems lost pressure, fire hydrants ran dry.\n- Nearly a year later, residents and experts are weighing solutions that would make more water available for firefighting, including installing cisterns, tapping water from swimming pools, or even turning to mobile pumps and pipes that could quickly route water where it\u2019s needed.\nAs the flames of the Palisades fire licked at his home, Ricardo Kawamura stood in his front yard watching smoke pour out of a second-story window. He saw a fire engine parked next to a hydrant on his street, and called for help.\n\u201cThey told me they did not have enough water,\u201d Kawamura said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, there was nothing that they could do at that time.\u201d\nAfter two of the most destructive fires in the state\u2019s history, The Times takes a critical look at the past year and the steps taken \u2014 or not taken \u2014 to prevent this from happening again in all future fires.\nAs the fire spread, the water system quickly lost pressure as crews drew heavily on hydrants, residents ran sprinklers and hoses, and water gushed out of melted pipes. Hillside tanks ran out of water, and many hydrants, particularly in higher-elevation areas, lost pressure and ran dry.\nAn additional source of frustration for residents was the fact that one vital water asset \u2014 the Santa Ynez Reservoir \u2014 sat empty and dry as their neighborhoods burned.\nHow did entire communities find themselves in the midst of raging fires without enough water on hand to fight them?\nThe answers have exposed the weaknesses of Los Angeles\u2019 water systems and prompted widespread calls to redesign Southern California\u2019s water infrastructure. Water managers and experts said the water systems in Pacific Palisades and Altadena were never designed for wildfires that rage through entire neighborhoods, or for infernos intensified by climate change. In fact, their design effectively guaranteed that hydrants would lose pressure and fail during a giant fire.\nThe loss of pressure in hydrants had happened before in various wildfires, including the 2008 Freeway Complex fire, the 2017 Tubbs and Thomas fires, the 2018 Woolsey fire and the 2024 Mountain fire.\nBut the historic devastation of the Palisades and Eaton fires has led residents and experts to search urgently for ways to ensure more water is available next time.\nProposed ideas include installing emergency shutoff valves that can reduce the loss of water as buildings burn, designing new neighborhood systems with cisterns that store water for firefighting, encouraging the use of household firefighting equipment that draws on swimming pools, and having temporary pipes and pumps that can be deployed quickly when a fire erupts.\nSo far, however, local officials in Los Angeles and L.A. County appear to have taken few, if any, concrete steps toward major changes.\nWhen the flames began tearing through Pacific Palisades, the 117-million-gallon Santa Ynez Reservoir had been empty for nearly a year. In early 2024, a major tear was discovered in its floating cover. The contractor hired to do the repairs had not yet begun when the fire exploded.\nHaving this key piece of the water system empty at a time of high fire danger was inexcusable, said George Engel, an entertainment executive whose house was left standing while neighboring homes were destroyed.\n\u201cThe city wasn\u2019t prepared for it at all,\u201d Engel said. \u201cWe just basically had no support.\u201d\nThe Palisades fire killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of homes.\n\u201cThis should never happen again,\u201d Engel said. \u201cWe need to learn from this. We need to fix it.\u201d\nAfter a 10-month review, California officials concluded that it had been necessary to drain the reservoir to protect public health, and that even if the reservoir had been full, the system of pipes throughout the area \u201cwould have been quickly overwhelmed\u201d and lost pressure bec"

                "body": "Daniel \u201cBullet\u201d S. Bohm, age 72 of the Town of Belle Plaine, Shawano County passed away at his home on Tuesday afternoon December 16, 2025.\nDaniel Scott Bohm was born on March 16, 1953 in Shawano as the son of the late Willard and Beatrice (Singer) Bohm. As a young boy while working on a neighboring farm he said he was fast as a speeding bullet and hence earned the nickname Bullet from then on. He graduated from Shawano High School in 1971. From there, Bullet enlisted to serve his country in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam era; serving as an MP in Okinawa. He was united in marriage to Patricia \u201cPatty\u201d Heling on June 27, 1981 at the St. John\u2019s Lutheran Church in Belle Plaine. The couple more recently joined St. Martin Lutheran Church in Clintonville. Bullet worked for the Equity in Shawano prior to his employment at Ardex All American Mineral in Shawano. Bullet\u2019s younger years were spent spending time outdoors ice fishing, and hunting for deer and pheasants. He always had fun spending time with friends and family at the hunting cabin in the swamp. In more recent years, Bullet enjoyed spending time in his garage with a cold beer. He was a jokester who was always able to make everyone smile, had a remarkable memory, and was great at helping his family with math.\nSurvivors include: His Wife: Patricia \u201cPatty\u201d Bohm.\nChildren: Taylor (Rachel Lohrengel) Bohm & Maggie Bohm.\nSiblings: Randall (Mary) Bohm & Sherry Hoffman.\nAlso his Grandpups: Pickles & Frankie.\nHe was preceded in death by his parents Willard and Beatrice Bohm. Also waiting for him is his dearly loved bulldog, Finley.\nThe family would like to extend their deepest thanks to their angels on Earth, Sabrina and Heather, from Thedacare Hospice, for their compassionate care of Bullet.\nBullet\u2019s funeral service will be held Monday, December 22, 2025 at 12pm at the St. Martin Lutheran Church in Clintonville with Rev. Jason Zobel officiating. Inurnment will take place at a later date at St. John\u2019s Lutheran Cemetery in the Town of Belle Plaine.

Sterling slid after soft UK inflation revived expectations of another Bank of England cut, while the US dollar firmed broadly ahead of key US data. Meanwhile, USD/JPY wrongfooted bears despite a widely expected Bank of Japan hike, and Nikkei futures showed signs of a deeper corrective phase.\nView related analysis:\n- USD/JPY and AUD/JPY Test Key Support as Japanese Yen Strengthens\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: Momentum Fades as US Data Takes Centre Stage\n- Japanese Yen Technical Outlook: USD/JPY, CHF/JPY, AUD/JPY\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: Soft Jobs Cools AUD/USD Momentum\n- Japanese Yen Weakness Lifts USD/JPY and EUR/JPY while Nikkei Holds 50k\nUSD/JPY and Nikkei Outlook Ahead of Key Central Bank Risk\nIt was a volatile day for the British pound after weak inflation data put another BoE rate cut firmly back on the radar, with markets pricing a near-100% chance of a 25bp cut on Thursday. GBP/USD fell as much as 0.9% before recouping around half of the day\u2019s losses, leaving an elongated bearish hammer on the daily chart. AUD/USD fell for a fifth day during its most volatile session in a month, with a high-to-low range of 1.1%\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nDivisions within the Fed remain evident. Governor Waller again reiterated his preference for lower interest rates, contrasting with comments from Bostic the previous day, who argued a cut is not warranted. Market pricing is erring on the side of caution following last week\u2019s not-so-dovish Fed cut, with the dot plot leaving room for just a single 25bp cut in 2026. Money markets price a 75.6% chance of a hold in January and a 44.8% chance of a 25bp cut in March.\nIncoming data will shape those expectations, with CPI and jobless claims due today and consumer sentiment scheduled for Friday. The US dollar index was the strongest major currency on Thursday, while the Japanese yen was the weakest, despite expectations for the Bank of Japan to hike by 25bp tomorrow. The move appears fully priced, leaving little room for surprise unless the usually tight-lipped BoJ signals future cuts at the meeting \u2014 which looks unlikely.\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nDespite expectations of a BoJ hike, options traders are turning more bullish on USD/JPY, with risk reversals rising to show calls gaining relative to puts. With the US dollar hinting at a swing low \u2014 printing a bullish pin bar on Wednesday followed by a small bullish candle on Thursday \u2014 and USD/JPY posting a solid bullish daily bar, upside risks appear greater than I anticipated in yesterday\u2019s report.\nThe daily chart shows a decent rebound from support, keeping the 156.16 high in focus. However, a small rising wedge has formed on the 1-hour chart, alongside bearish divergences on both RSI (2) and RSI (14), which warns of a near-term pullback. Bulls could look to buy dips towards 155.29 or the broader 155.00\u2013155.10 zone in anticipation of another leg higher. A break above 156.20 would open the door for a move back towards the 157 highs.\nMy bias on USD/JPY remains bullish while prices hold above 154.30. That said, the Bank of Japan meeting is tomorrow, which could lift volatility if policymakers deliver a hawkish hike and strengthen the Japanese yen (pushing USD/JPY lower).\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nNikkei 225 Futures (NK) Technical Analysis\nThe Nikkei appears to be in a three-wave corrective phase following its strong rally above 50,000, which topped out in early November. Last week\u2019s second consecutive (and minuscule) doji has been followed by a clear bout of bearish range expansion this week, signalling that the index has likely entered wave C of an ABC retracement.\nThis opens the door for a move below 48,000. A 100% projection of wave A measured from wave B sits just above 46,000, making it a plausible downside target for bears should 48,000"

Dowa Holdings surged 7% after an upbeat target from Daiwa Securities, and Fujikura also advanced. Still, gains were confined to select names: the broader Topix edged down and most Tokyo stocks lost ground.

Added to changing US tariffs and new leadership, this creates a complex backdrop for Japan\u2019s economy and its global role.
