                "body": "Photo by Kerem Uzel/Bloomberg\nFollowing an extraordinary rally that captured the attention of global markets, most investors are not anticipating gold to repeat its dramatic performance in 2026. Nevertheless, many leading asset managers remain optimistic about the metal\u2019s prospects, believing that the same factors that drove gold to new heights are still at play.\nIn 2025, gold soared by 65%\u2014its most impressive annual gain in nearly fifty years\u2014as both individual and institutional investors, along with central banks, increased their holdings. The precious metal benefited from a convergence of supportive conditions, including declining interest rates and heightened geopolitical uncertainty, even surpassing its inflation-adjusted peak from 1980.\nBloomberg interviewed over a dozen investment professionals managing trillions in assets to assess their views after gold\u2019s historic year. The majority indicated they are maintaining their positions, confident in gold\u2019s enduring appeal.\nIan Samson, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International, commented, \u201cWe still foresee gold climbing in 2026, as the underlying drivers remain strong.\u201d Samson reduced his exposure during a particularly volatile period in October but has since increased his holdings, citing ongoing central bank purchases, lower interest rates, and persistent fiscal deficits as key reasons.\nMany investors also highlighted diminishing trust in major developed-world currencies, fueled by challenges to central bank independence and mounting government debt, as a crucial factor supporting gold. Rising public debt in advanced economies contributed to political tensions last year, from legislative gridlock in the US and political deadlock in France to scrutiny of Japan\u2019s record budget.\nMike Wilson, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief investment officer and strategist, described gold as \u201cessentially a hedge against fiat currencies now more than ever.\u201d This perspective gained momentum in late 2025, as concerns about currency devaluation grew and prominent investors like Ken Griffin and Ray Dalio pointed to gold\u2019s rally as a warning sign.\nWilson recommends allocating 20% of portfolios to real assets such as gold to guard against inflation, suggesting a shift from the traditional 60/40 stocks and bonds mix to a 60/20/20 split. He emphasized that the currency debasement narrative has become widely accepted.\n\u201cWhen everyone is aware of the story, you have to wonder: Is it already reflected in the price?\u201d Wilson remarked. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is, because I haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in fiscal behavior globally. In fact, the opposite seems true.\u201d\nDarwei Kung, head of commodities and portfolio manager at DWS Group, noted that his firm is holding a slightly above-average allocation to gold-related assets and plans to maintain this stance into 2026. He anticipates a moderate increase in gold prices by year-end, along with short-term trading opportunities as broader market dynamics influence the metal.\nAccording to Massimiliano Castelli, head of global sovereign markets strategy at UBS Asset Management, pension and insurance funds showed growing interest in gold throughout 2025. Some institutions that had never previously invested in gold allocated around 5% of their strategic portfolios to the metal, attracted by its strong returns and its ability to offset risks elsewhere.\n\u201cNaturally, we don\u2019t expect the same explosive gains as last year, when gold outperformed all other asset classes,\u201d Castelli said. \u201cHowever, we remain optimistic about gold\u2019s prospects.\u201d\nHistory suggests caution. Exceptional rallies have often been followed by extended periods of subdued returns. For example, after gold reached a record $1,921 per ounce in 2011 due to the global financial crisis, it took nine years to revisit that level. Similarly, a prolonged bear market followed the metal\u2019s 127% surge in 1979.\nDespite the recent rally, gold remains underrepresented in US investment portfolios. According to a December analys"

(Zacks)\n- Spot gold rose 0.5% and was headed for a weekly gain of about 3.9% after hitting a record late December. (Reuters)\n- Next on the calendar: U.S. CPI on Jan. 13, then Barrick\u2019s full-year results on Feb. 5. (Bureau of Labor Statistics)\nBarrick Mining shares ended Friday modestly higher, a quiet finish to a week when gold swung around U.S. data and policy headlines. The stock closed up 0.8% at $47.81. (Zacks)\nThat matters now because the trade has turned simple: bullion up, miners up \u2014 until it isn\u2019t. With gold close to record territory, investors are watching whether next week\u2019s inflation numbers keep rate-cut bets alive and, by extension, keep a floor under the group. (Reuters)\nGold typically draws support when interest rates are expected to fall because it yields nothing. On Friday, traders leaned that way after payrolls missed forecasts and markets continued to price at least two Federal Reserve cuts this year. (Reuters)\nSpot gold was up 0.5% at $4,496.09 an ounce by early afternoon in New York, and U.S. gold futures settled 0.9% higher at $4,500.90, Reuters reported. Bullion hit a record $4,549.71 on Dec. 26. (Reuters)\n\u201cPayrolls are showing us a poor job creation environment,\u201d Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said, pointing to a mix of uncertainty and an \u201ceasing Fed\u201d as supportive for precious metals. (Reuters)\nPeers moved with the tape. Newmont gained 2.0% to $108.99, while Agnico Eagle climbed 2.5% to $191.14; the VanEck Gold Miners ETF rose 1.1%. (MarketWatch)\nSome banks are leaning into the move, with caveats. HSBC said this week gold could reach $5,000 an ounce in the first half of 2026, but warned a correction later in the year was possible if tensions ease or the Fed pauses cuts. (Reuters)\nFor Barrick specifically, the next hard catalyst is its earnings date. The company said it will release full-year and fourth-quarter 2025 results before markets open on Feb. 5, with a management webcast later that morning. (Barrick)\nUntil then, traders tend to focus on what moves the metal and the dollar. The near-term risk is straightforward: a hotter inflation print could lift Treasury yields and the greenback, pressuring gold and the miners that have ridden it higher. (Reuters)\nThe next test comes quickly. U.S. CPI data for December are due on Tuesday, Jan. 13, and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling tied to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs is expected on Jan. 14; beyond that, markets will look to the Fed\u2019s Jan. 27-28 meeting and Barrick\u2019s Feb. 5 results.

                "body": "14 Reasons Silver Isn't Second Place to Gold When It Comes to Investing\nHistorically, gold has been seen as a more valuable investment than silver, with 26% of Americans saying gold is the strongest investment.\nBut that doesn't mean silver isn't without its benefits. While it can be seen as volatile, particularly over a short period, silver is often considered an inflation-proof option for investors looking to boost their bank accounts.\nTo get to the facts on silver and whether it's a wise investment, here are 14 considerations before you add this shiny commodity to your portfolio.\nCan you retire early? Take this quiz and find out.\n1. Silver is more affordable than gold\nSilver is significantly more affordable than gold at $51 per ounce as opposed to $4,095 per ounce, making it appealing to investors looking to enter the precious metals market at a lower price point. Just think of how much a gold bar is worth.\nYou'll still get some of the benefits of gold if you're buying a hard asset that you can hold, but you won't pay thousands of dollars for a tiny physical amount the way you would with gold.\nWho really has the cheapest auto insurance in your area? Check your zip code here.\n2. Silver can be easier to sell\nDue to its lower cost, silver can be easier to offload quickly in small sums, which is a plus for those needing to free up liquid assets quickly, particularly for everyday spending.\nGiven its low price, you may not be able to use silver as a down payment for a house, but it could be helpful for day-to-day purchases.\n3. Silver makes a wonderful gift\nWant to start a tradition of gifting an investment to a younger relative? Silver is a great place to begin since it's more affordable and can easily be given in amounts you can hold in your hand. Look at coins or bullion for a physical investment that can be gifted.\n14 benefits seniors are entitled to but often forget to claim\n4. You have options to invest in silver\nWhile coins, jewelry, or bullion might be the first items that come to mind when you think of silver, there are several options for investing in silver.\nThere are futures, ETFs that own silver or silver miners, and silver mining stocks. Each of these comes with risks beyond silver's volatility, so do thorough research on the securities you're considering.\n5. Silver has a strong industrial demand\nThroughout your day, you probably use multiple items made with silver and don't even realize it. And we don't just mean jewelry. Silver is known for its industrial demand, from batteries and solar panels to auto parts.\nIn fact, 56% of silver's total supply goes to industrial uses, which means during booming economic times when industrial demand and manufacturing are high, silver prices may get a boost.\n6. Lower premiums on silver\nWhen buying silver bullion, you won't pay a raw price or what dealers call a spot price. Instead, you'll pay a premium, which is the price you pay over the spot price. However, on silver, these premiums tend to be lower than gold, creating a lower entry barrier.\n$1,000,000 saved?

Silver has a smaller market share than gold\nWhile the total amount of new silver each year is close to 1 billion ounces, compared to gold's mere 120 million ounces, its value is so much lower that its market share is dwarfed by gold's.\nGold's overall market value is 80 times bigger than silver's. This smaller value leads to greater volatility, as market swings are felt more significantly.\n8. The use of silver at home is rebounding\nDemand for the silver you use on your table is rebounding after a dip during the pandemic. Silver bowls, silverware, vases, and more are being used again for entertaining, which could help drive silver prices up.\n9. Silver doesn't follow the stock market\nSilver is often seen as a hedge against inflation and the stock market because it tends to follow its own rhythm and has historically performed well over long "

                "body": "New Delhi, Jan 10 (IANS) Gold and silver continued their structural bull run into the start of 2026 on the back of enhanced safe haven demand and industrial demand, analysts said on Saturday.\nGold futures with February expiry gained significantly during the week touching Rs 1,38,875 per 10 grams, up from Rs 1,35,752 at last week's close. The price of 10 grams of 24-carat gold closed the week at Rs 1,37,122 up from Rs 1,34,782 of the prior week, according to data published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA).\nMCX Silver contracts for March expiry showed significant surge during the week surging to Rs 2,52,002 per kg, confirming a decisive breakout from its recent consolidation range and re-entering a strong bullish channel.\n\"COMEX gold remained firm near $4,500 per ounce, gaining over 1 per cent and consolidating just below record highs after its strong multi-week rally,\" said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money.\nMeanwhile, COMEX silver futures jumped over 6 per cent to around $79.79 per ounce, rebounding from $75 as industrial demand revived alongside renewed safe-haven buying, he added.\nInvestor sentiment in silver remains firmly constructive, supported by persistent supply deficits, record central bank buying as well as rising green-energy demand linked to solar, EVs and AI infrastructure.\nLooking ahead, near-term volatility cannot be ruled out, driven by profit-taking, dollar movements and high-frequency macro data from US and other major economies, analysts said.\nRecent pullbacks in precious metals were largely seen as healthy profit-taking rather than signs of trend fatigue, and the speed of subsequent rebounds has reinforced confidence in the longer-term uptrend.\nGold surged nearly 66 per cent in CY25, surpassing $4,500 per ounce, while silver outperformed with a 171 per cent rise.\nAnalysts said that the ongoing surge in gold and silver is being driven by structural demand rather than short-term speculative activity. Sustained central-bank gold purchases, elevated geopolitical uncertainty, and expectations of global monetary easing continue to reinforce gold\u2019s role as a core portfolio hedge."

As per the US Energy Information Administration data, implied stock builds in the previous year were among the largest since 2020.\nSupply exceeds demand\nCrude oil prices in 2025 were pressured by a confluence of supply-side and structural factors. OPEC+ began unwinding earlier production cuts, adding barrels to an already soft macroeconomic backdrop, while robust non-OPEC growth\u2014led by U.S. output at record levels\u2014further diluted any geopolitical risk premium. Tariff and sanctions adjustments by the U.S. toward Russia, Iran, and Venezuela shifted trade flows but failed to create lasting shortages, allowing inventories to swell.Meanwhile, China\u2019s strong import activity largely fed strategic reserves rather than immediate consumption. This muted demand signals and cushioned sharper price declines. Adding to the imbalance, refined product inventories climbed faster than crude in several regions, compressing margins and weakening the pull on upstream demand.\nMaduro\u2019s arrest possible impact\nOn January 3, 2026, U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, flying him and his wife to New York to face narco-terrorism and drug-trafficking charges, both pleaded not guilty. The episode jolted global oil politics because Venezuela\u2014an OPEC founder with the world\u2019s largest proven reserves\u2014has been constrained by sanctions, underinvestment, and operational decay.Though the arrest may introduce political uncertainty, the immediate impact on global crude supplies remains limited. Venezuela currently produces just under 1 mb/d -less than 1% of global output- and ongoing U.S. sanctions and tanker blockades have already sharply constrained its exports.\nIn the short term, there may be modest supply disruption, but global inventories remain ample and projects a 3.8 mb/d surplus well into 2026. Brent oil almost unchanged and stabilized near $60\u201361, reflecting skepticism that political upheaval will translate into sustained supply shocks. In fact, the arrest may open doors for eventual U.S. and European investment.\nMaduro\u2019s removal may introduce short-lived volatility, but structural oversupply and constrained Venezuelan capacity will likely neutralize any significant price spike. If political stabilization and investment unfold, Venezuela\u2019s crude output may gradually increase, which may pressure oil prices in the medium term, but the path remains slow and uncertain.\nSupply \u2013 Demand dynamics\nForecasts diverge, but most agree on surplus conditions in 2026. The EIA expects production to exceed consumption, with global inventory builds of more than 2 mb/d on average. There is a forecast that OPEC+ will hold output steady into Q1\u201926, which helps limit volatility but doesn\u2019t erase the surplus. Meanwhile, the IEA has warned of a possible \u201csuper-glut\u201d, a surplus of 3\u20134 mb/d, if OPEC+ and rivals continue adding more supply than demand can absorb.Persistent oversupply is expected to be the dominant theme, driven by strong output from OPEC+ and non-OPEC producers such as the U.S., Brazil, and Guyana. Inventory builds projected by the EIA and IEA reinforce the view that the market will struggle to absorb additional barrels, even as OPEC+ holds production steady in early 2026. Unless the group pivots to deeper cuts, the surplus bias will likely cap any sustained price rally.\nOn the demand side, growth remains modest, with the IEA projecting an increase of roughly 1.2 mb/d, concentrated in Asia. However, global economic uncertainty, slower-than-expected recovery in China, and cautious monetary policies in major economies are tempering the bullish sentiment. These factors, combined with high stock levels, suggest that demand alone will not be sufficient to tighten balances significantly. As a result, price movements will hinge more on supply discipline than on consumption trends."

                "body": "Crude Rallies as Iranian Protests Escalate\nFebruary WTI crude oil (CLG26) today is up +1.79 (+3.10%), and February RBOB gasoline (RBG26) is up +0.0352 (+2.00%).\nCrude oil and gasoline prices are up sharply today, posting 1-month highs. Rising tensions in Iran, the fourth-largest producer in OPEC, are supporting crude prices as protests against the government escalate. Also, optimism in the US economic outlook is supportive for energy demand and crude prices after the US Dec unemployment rate fell and Jan consumer sentiment increased. Crude prices are moving higher today despite a rally in the dollar index to a 4-week high.\nUnrest in Iran is boosting crude prices after the Iranian government said \"rioters\" who damage public property or clash with security forces will face the death penalty. President Trump warned the country's regime would \"pay hell\" if protesters were killed. Iran produces more than 3 million bpd, and its crude production could be disrupted if the protests against the government worsen.\nSigns of strength in the US economy are supportive for energy demand and crude prices. The Dec unemployment rate fell -0.1 to 4.4%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of 4.5%. Also, the University of Michigan US Jan consumer sentiment index rose +1.1 to 54.0, stronger than expectations of 53.5.\nStrength in the crude crack spread is supportive of oil prices, as the crack spread rose to a 3-week high today. The increase in the crack spread encourages refiners to boost their crude purchases and refine the crude into gasoline and distillates.\nThe upcoming annual rebalancing of commodity indexes will see buying of oil contracts, a bullish factor for crude. Citigroup projects that the BCOM and S&P GSCI indexes, the two largest commodity indexes, will see inflows of $2.2 billion in futures contracts over the next week to rebalance the indexes.\nConcerns about energy demand are negative for crude prices after Saudi Arabia on Monday cut the price of its Arab Light crude for February delivery to customers for a third month.\nMorgan Stanley predicted that a global oil market surplus is likely to expand further and peak mid-year, pressuring prices, as it cut its crude price forecast for Q1 to $57.50/bbl from a prior forecast of $60/bbl, and cut its Q2 crude price forecast to $55/bbl from $60/bbl.\nVortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days fell -3.4% w/w to 119.35 million bbl in the week ended January 2.\nStrength in Chinese crude demand is supportive for prices. According to Kpler data, China's crude imports in December are set to increase by 10% m/m to a record 12.2 million bpd as it rebuilds its crude inventories.\nCrude garnered support after OPEC+ on Sunday said it would stick to its plan to pause production increases in Q1 of 2026. OPEC+ at its November 2025 meeting announced that members would raise production by +137,000 bpd in December, but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus. The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026. OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore. OPEC's December crude production rose by +40,000 bpd to 29.03 million bpd.\nUkrainian drone and missile attacks have targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past four months, limiting Russia's crude oil export capabilities and reducing global oil supplies. Also, since the end of November, Ukraine has ramped up attacks on Russian tankers, with at least six tankers attacked by drones and missiles in the Baltic Sea. In addition, new US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have curbed Russian oil exports.\nLast month, the IEA projected that the world crude surplus will widen to a record 3.815 million bpd in 2026 from a 4-year high of over 2.0 million bpd i"

Although there were some positive data points from the Eurozone, the pair struggled to gain ground due to the US dollar\u2019s strength as the job market remained stable and yields were steady.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about forex tools? Check our detailed guide-\nThe US NFP report was the most significant event of the week. The headline job growth of 50,000 was disappointing, but the other details told a more balanced story. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.4%, and wage growth accelerated, which supports the idea that the underlying labor market remains stable. This combination helped to fade expectations of a quick change in Federal Reserve policy, keeping the dollar strong.\nEarlier this week, US data sent mixed signals. Some housing indicators showed signs of slowing down, but consumer sentiment surprised, which helped keep risk appetite stable and prevent the dollar from falling sharply. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin also sounded cautious, saying that job growth is slow but steady and that inflation progress is likely to stay sluggish. That message made it clear that rates will remain unchanged for now.\nThe markets mostly ignored data from the Eurozone. Retail sales increased 2.3% YoY and 0.2% MoM, which was significantly better than expected. The same happened with German industrial production. However, these positive developments could not benefit the euro, as traders were more concerned with the impact of policy changes than with reviewing past growth data. The euro didn\u2019t have an apparent reason to stop declining, as the ECB\u2019s guidance was still mostly neutral.\nNext week\u2019s outlook for EUR/USD remains cautious. Inflation signals and central bank communication are likely to have a significant effect on the markets.\nEUR/USD Major Events Next Week:\n- Sentix Investor Confidence\n- ECB policymakers\u2019 commentaries\n- US CPI and PPI inflation\n- US retail sales and weekly jobless claims\nIf US inflation remains high, the dollar could strengthen, pushing EUR/USD below the 1.1600 level. If inflation data comes in lower or the Fed shows more caution, the EUR/USD pair could stabilize. However, unless US data clearly disappoints, any recovery is likely to remain limited.\nEUR/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Bearish Below 1.1680\nThe daily chart for the EUR/USD indicates the pair staying under pressure, with prices trading below all major moving averages. The pair has pulled back from the late-December highs near 1.1800 and is now holding steady around 1.1630. The 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-period MAs are stacked in a bearish manner, adding to the short-term negative bias.\nMomentum indicators also show signs of weakness. The RSI is close to the oversold region below 35, indicating that bearish momentum remains strong. However, selling pressure could start to slow down near key support. Recent attempts to recover have been feeble, suggesting a limited demand for dips thus far.\nFrom a structural perspective, the price is testing a clear demand zone between 1.1620 and 1.1600. If this area breaks clearly, it could lead to deeper losses. On the contrary, if it holds steady, the pair could start a corrective rebound.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about the best crypto exchange?

The pair has logged nine down sessions out of the last eleven and two consecutive negative weeks, which is not noise but a meaningful correction from the late-year breakout. On the dollar side, the December Non-Farm Payrolls report showed 50,000 new jobs versus expectations of 60,000, but the unemployment rate fell from 4.5% (revised from 4.6%) to 4.4%. That single line item was enough to support the greenback because it reinforces the \u201cstill-tight\u201d labor narrative and keeps the Federal Reserve under less pressure to rush into aggressive cuts. The U.S. Dollar Index has pushed through the 98.85\u201399.00 resistance band and opened room toward 100.25\u2013100.40, while U.S. 2-year yields trade above roughly 3.5% and 10-year yields above 4.15%. Against that backdrop, EUR/USD naturally trades on the back foot despite a slightly better-than-expected euro area retail sales print at +0.2% month-on-month versus +0.1% forecast. The euro has domestic support, but the cleaner impulse right now comes from the U.S. side.\nRead More\n-\nVOO ETF At $638 With The S&P 500 At 6,966: How Jobs Data, $37.6T U.S. Debt And Trump\u2019s $1.5T Defense Plan Hit The ETF\n10.01.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs XRPI, XRPR and Bitwise XRP Hold $1.47B as XRP-USD Price Hovers Near $2\n10.01.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast: NG=F Near $3.13 As Warm Winter Smashes The Winter Premium\n10.01.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast: Dollar Near 158 As Fed Hold Bets Grow And BoJ Stays Cautious, 161.94 High Back In Play\n10.01.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nWeekly EUR/USD Structure And Major Levels\nOn the weekly chart, EUR/USD broke higher in December after defending the early-month line in the sand near 1.1589. From the November low, the pair rallied almost 3% before stalling exactly at the 1.1747\u20131.1775 resistance cluster. That band is defined by the 2025 high-week close, the 61.8% retracement of the September decline, and the 2025 high daily close. Price then spent roughly four weeks failing to clear this ceiling, turning it into a clear distribution zone. The subsequent decline has dragged spot down toward initial weekly support at 1.1598, which is the 61.8% retracement of the November advance and also where a key internal trendline (\u201c75% parallel\u201d) converges over the next few weeks. As long as EUR/USD holds 1.1598 on a weekly closing basis, the move can still be classified as a standard pullback within a broader up-leg. A clean weekly close below 1.1598 would confirm that a more significant high has been set at 1.1747\u20131.1775 and would reframe this move as the start of a broader down phase.\nDownside Grid: 1.1598, 1.1500, 1.1394 And 1.1254\nIf EUR/USD loses 1.1598, the next technical magnet is the 1.1497\u20131.1505 band, which blends the 78.6% retracement of the July rally with the March 2020 and March 2022 highs. A break of that area exposes 1.1394, the April high close that acts as the final line separating a controlled retracement from a full reset of the 2025 advance. Beneath 1.1394 sits a deeper structural pivot at 1.1254\u20131.1276, combining the 38.2% retracement of the 2025 range with the 2023 swing high. If price ever trades and holds below that zone, the current bullish phase in EUR/USD is effectively cancelled and the market returns to a broad, choppy range with a heavier bearish bias. In other words, 1.1598 is the first decision point, 1.1497\u20131.1505 is the confirmation of a more aggr"

The pair fell after failing to maintain its early-week gains. US services and labor data, not any UK developments, drove the move.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about forex tools? Check our detailed guide-\nThe first pressure arose when the US ISM Services PMI came in higher than expected, indicating that the services sector is still growing despite high interest rates. The new orders and prices paid for parts stayed the same, which supports the idea that inflation risks in the service economy are still high. This helped the dollar and pushed US Treasury yields higher, which in turn pushed the GBP/USD down.\nThe ADP Employment Report, released mid-week, showed that hiring in the private sector remained stronger than expected. The data made markets less likely to expect aggressive easing and more likely to want the dollar ahead of Friday\u2019s jobs report, even though it isn\u2019t always a good predictor of official payrolls.\nFollowing Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report, which showed that job growth remained strong and unemployment was lower than expected, the GBP/USD pair fell even faster. Wage growth also remained strong, which alleviated concerns about a rapid decline in the job market. The data made it less likely that the Fed would cut rates early, which helped the dollar end the week strong and put sterling on the defensive.\nThe market\u2019s direction next week will hinge on whether the new data on inflation and activity reinforce the notion of a robust US economy or pave the way for earlier policy easing.\nGBP/USD Major Events Next Week:\n- The US CPI inflation report will show whether price pressures are easing or staying the same\n- US PPI data, which shows how inflation is changing upstream\n- US retail sales, to gauge consumer demand\n- Weekly unemployment claims for unemployment benefits in the US provide insight into the job market in the near future.\n- UK GDP numbers, which could change expectations about the Bank of England\u2019s policy outlook\nIf US inflation or consumer data worsens, the dollar will likely remain strong, and the GBP/USD will remain under pressure. On the other hand, lower prices or spending, along with weak UK GDP risks, could alter the market\u2019s direction and allow sterling to stabilize or bounce back.\nGBP/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Critical Demand Zone at 1.3400\nThe daily chart for GBP/USD suggests a strong bearish momentum after falling below the 100-day MA with a bearish crossover of 20- and 50-day MAs. However, the price holds near the demand zone at 1.3400, while a breakout could push the price further lower towards the 200-day MA at 1.3350.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about the best crypto exchange?

                "body": "Dollar Strengthens as Jobs Miss and Fed Pause Odds Rise\nThe U.S. dollar gained on Jan. 9 and was poised for a second consecutive weekly rise after December payrolls came in weaker than expected, even as the unemployment rate \"ticked down.\" Markets are parsing the mixed labor picture alongside growing odds the Federal Reserve will hold rates and a pending Supreme Court decision on presidential tariff powers that could unsettle trade flows and FX volatility.\nThe dollar rallied on Jan. 9 after U.S. labor-market data showed payrolls disappointed while the unemployment rate \"ticked down,\" reinforcing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged at its late-January meeting. The dollar index rose to about 98.883 in early Asian trade and later climbed toward the 99 area, reaching roughly 99.15 as the greenback extended gains across major currencies. The move positioned the currency to record a second straight weekly advance.\nLabor Department figures showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 50,000 in December, below consensus estimates near 60,000. Weekly initial jobless claims were around 208,000 and announced job cuts fell to 35,553 in December, the lowest monthly total since July 2024. Market participants parsed the soft payroll print as noisy rather than definitive: Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered, highlighted that the standard error for nonfarm payrolls is about 20,000 and suggested markets may not overreact to the headline miss.\nTraders moved quickly to price the monetary-policy implications. Fed-funds futures implied roughly an 89 percent probability that the Fed will hold rates at its Jan. 27-28 meeting, up from about 68 percent a month earlier. That shift in expectations has supported the dollar by reducing near-term prospects for further policy tightening and reinforcing a premium on U.S. safe-haven assets as investors weigh the timing of eventual rate cuts later in the year.\nAcross spot markets, USD/JPY traded around the mid-150s, quoted near 156.9 in early Asian trade and reported nearer 158 at times, while EUR/USD sat around $1.1633 and GBP/USD near $1.3403. The offshore yuan changed little around 6.98 per dollar, USD/CAD was about C$1.39 and USD/CHF near 0.801-0.802. Commodity-linked currencies underperformed, with AUD/USD at roughly $0.6675. Bitcoin was trading near $91,300.\nBeyond labor data and Fed pricing, markets marked a high-stakes legal variable: the Supreme Court is considering whether the president can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs without congressional approval. A ruling against that authority could complicate U.S. trade policy, upend negotiations and potentially prompt companies and customs brokers to seek as much as $150 billion in refunds for duties already collected. Timing of a decision remained uncertain, leaving firms and markets on alert for an outcome that could materially affect trade flows and FX volatility.\nGlobal developments added nuance. Japanese household spending surprised to the upside for November and the Bank of Japan has tightened policy, with Governor Kazuo Ueda saying \"the central bank would continue raising borrowing costs if economic and price developments moved in line with its forecasts.\" Chinese inflation data due this week and signs of easing inflation in Europe are additional near-term catalysts.\nIn the coming days, markets will track follow-up U.S. labor and inflation releases, any Supreme Court statement or ruling, and further shifts in Fed-rate pricing. Together, those data and policy events will determine whether the dollar's recent strength endures or reverses as investors recalibrate growth, inflation and policy risk.\nSources:\nKnow something we missed?

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Slides Toward 1.34 Floor as Hot US Data and Fed\u2013BoE Gap Hit Sterling\nSterling trades near 1.3420 with downside risk toward 1.3350 as stronger US jobs, sticky services inflation and key US CPI and UK GDP releases dictate the next move | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD: Dollar Strength Pins Sterling Near 1.34 as Fed\u2013BoE Divergence Widens\nUS Data Rebuilds Support Under the USD and Pressures GBP/USD\nGBP/USD is trading around 1.3420, very close to its weekly low and the critical 1.3400 zone, after failing to hold early-week gains toward 1.3567, where a clear short-term top formed before a sharp reversal. The latest leg down is driven almost entirely by USD strength. A run of stronger-than-expected US data has reset Fed expectations and pushed the US Dollar Index (DXY) back to a four-week high around 99.00, while GBP has offered little resistance. The US side delivered a series of upside surprises: ISM Services PMI beat expectations, confirming ongoing expansion in the US services sector, with new orders and prices paid still elevated \u2013 a combination that keeps services inflation sticky. The ADP report showed private-sector hiring stronger than forecast, reinforcing the notion that labor demand is still resilient. Across the official labor data, one recent Nonfarm Payrolls print showed a headline gain of 50,000 versus 60,000 expected, but the unemployment rate fell to 4.4% from 4.5%, and average hourly earnings rose 3.8% year-on-year versus 3.6% expected. Another major jobs release highlighted 210,000 new jobs, underscoring how noisy but persistently firm the US labor market remains. The result is simple: markets have scaled back expectations for near-term Fed cuts. The probability of a March cut has dropped from above 70% to roughly 40%, US yields have moved higher, and the USD has repriced up across the board. That macro repricing is what pulled GBP/USD off 1.3567 and drove it into the 1.34 handle.\nBoE Under Pressure as UK Data and Inflation Undermine Sterling\nOn the UK side, the story is the opposite. UK inflation has cooled to around 2.5%, just above the BoE\u2019s 2% target, while the growth profile remains fragile. The upcoming UK GDP print will be watched closely, but unless it comes in significantly above expectations it only reinforces a familiar narrative: the BoE is under pressure to cut earlier than the Fed. That policy divergence \u2013 a Fed delayed by strong data versus a BoE dragged toward easing \u2013 is a structural headwind for GBP/USD. Markets already see UK as the weaker macro leg in the pair: softer inflation, lacklustre growth and fiscal concerns keep UK asset risk premia higher than the US. That is why, despite no major UK shock last week, GBP/USD has traded as a passenger to the US side and slid from above 1.35 to the 1.34 area.\nDXY, Cross-Market Risk Tone and Why GBP Is the Weak Side\nThe broader USD backdrop reinforces the downside bias in GBP/USD. The US Dollar Index found strong support at a key Fibonacci level near 97.94, then built an ascending triangle from the Christmas lows and broke higher as the latest data hit. The break above the 98.85\u201399.00 resistance band has opened the way toward the heavy 100.00\u2013100.22 resistance zone. As long as DXY trades above 98.85, the dollar has the technical and macro justification to stay bid. Cross-asset signals are risk-off: Gold trades around $4,500, a very high level given a firmer dollar and rising US yields, which confirms strong hedging and fear in the system. Crypto has rolled over, with Bitcoin struggling to sustain levels below $90,000, and the institutional appetite for high-beta risk is clearly fading. In that environment, high-beta currencies like GBP are naturally weaker against a defensive USD, and GBP/USD becomes a preferred short on any rallies rather than a buy on dips.\nShort-Term Structure in GBP/USD: From 1.3567 Top to the 1.3400\u20131.3360 Support Band\nTechnically, the short-term picture in GBP/USD is clearly bearish. Price rejected 1.3567"

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Structure: From 139.87 Reset Back Toward 158.80\nThe USD/JPY structure is back in clear upside mode after the correction from the 161.94 high washed out to 139.87 and stalled. That three-wave drop down to 139.87 looks completed, and the pair has now pushed back through 157.88, extending the recovery leg that started from the 142.66\u2013145.47 region. The current swing is working toward a Fibonacci projection at 158.80, defined as the 161.8% extension of the 142.66 \u2192 150.90 rally measured from 145.47. As long as price holds above the near-term support band around 156.10, the market is treating this as a trend continuation phase rather than a topping pattern. A sustained break of 158.80 opens the way to the 200% projection near 161.95, essentially a retest of the 161.94 peak. The message from price is straightforward: the correction from 161.94 to 139.87 is likely over, and the larger uptrend from 102.58 is trying to reassert itself through the 158\u2013162 zone.\nMulti-Timeframe Trend: Long-Term Uptrend From 75.56 And 102.58 Still Favors Dollar Strength\nOn the higher timeframes, USD/JPY is still riding a secular bull market that began at 75.56 in 2011 and was reinforced by the 102.58 low in 2020. The advance off 102.58 into 161.94 created a powerful primary up leg. The subsequent drop to 139.87 fits as a corrective phase within that bigger structure, not a full trend reversal. If the market pushes decisively through 158.85\u2013161.94, the technical roadmap starts pointing to the next major projection zone near 176.55, calculated as the 61.8% extension of the 102.58 \u2192 161.94 move, measured from 139.87. That level is a medium-term concept rather than an immediate target, but it explains why dip-buyers have been so aggressive above 140 and why every pullback toward the mid-150s is being treated as opportunity rather than danger. From a structural point of view, the bullish thesis only starts to erode if USD/JPY breaks back below the 154.38\u2013154.30 region and turns the recent range into another leg of a wider consolidation instead of a launchpad.\nUSD/JPY And NFP: Four-Day Dollar Run As Labor Data Keeps Fed In \u201cHold\u201d Mode\nThe latest U.S. jobs report reinforced the dollar side of USD/JPY. Non-farm payrolls for December printed around 50,000, softer than the 66,000 consensus, but not weak enough to signal acute labor stress or force immediate rate cuts. The market read this as \u201cslower but still functional\u201d employment rather than the start of a recessionary slide. Rate expectations adjusted accordingly. The probability of the Federal Reserve holding rates unchanged at the January 28 meeting is now above 95%, and the odds of no move in March stand near 70.9%, with April still showing a majority leaning toward a neutral stance rather than rapid easing. That repricing has pushed the dollar higher against the yen, driving a four-session winning streak in USD/JPY and a short-term gain of more than 1%, with spot back above 157. The DXY index has climbed above 99 and is probing the psychological 100 area, confirming that flows are rotating back toward U.S. assets rather than away from them. For USD/JPY, this combination\u2014labor that is cooling but not collapsing and a central bank comfortable staying on hold\u2014keeps the interest-rate spread firmly in favor of the dollar.\nRate Differentials And DXY: Why The Dollar Leg Of USD/JPY Still Has The Initiative\nThe backdrop across U.S. macro data continues to justify higher-for-longer expectations. A prior 6.4% monthly rebound in building permits, after a \u22123.7% reading, hinted early that the housing slowdown was stabilizing instead of spiraling. Real activity data into late 2025 then confirmed that the economy had more momentum than bears were pricing, with growth revised up to around 4.3% annualized in Q3 against earlier expectations near 3.3%. That kind of upside revision makes it difficult for the Fed to pivot quickly into a cutting cycle. Markets have already shifted from aggressively discounting multip"

                "body": "Equities Weekly Outlook: US Q4 Banks Earnings, TSMC, Delta Air\nU.S. banks kick off earnings season this week with Q4 results from top lenders, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup. According to FactSet, Q4 2025 S&P 500 earnings growth is expected at 8.3%, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of expansion.\n2025 was a strong year for U.S. financials, and earnings season is likely to be another positive catalyst for the sector, supported by a stronger-than-expected U.S. economy.\nU.S. GDP was upwardly revised, while consumer spending remained strong, inflation cooled, and concerns about a slowing labor market persisted. The strong growth is expected to support loan growth in Q4.\nInvestors will also be watching NIMs. The Fed cut rates three times in the last three meetings of the year. Rate cuts would usually exert downward pressure on NIMs; however, they also reduce liabilities by lowering interest paid on deposits.\nIn Q3, investment banking revenues continued their strong rebound, driven by rising dealmaking activity. IB fees will remain a key focus in Q4, given their influence on revenue growth in previous quarters.\nTrading activity is also likely to perform well in Q4, driven by increased market volatility, including a sharp decline in November amid concerns about the AI bubble, followed by record highs in December.\nJPMorgan reports on Tuesday, with Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo on Wednesday. This is followed by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reporting on Thursday or before the opening bell.\nJP Morgan (Tuesday)\nJPMorgan\u2019s share price is at a record high. Strength in its trading and investment banking segments drove strong Q3 results, which the company reported in October. While the share price initially fell 4%, it quickly pared those losses to less than 2% by the close.\nIn Q3, profit increased 16% to $5.07 EPS. Revenue rose 9% to $46.4 billion, with fixed income trading up 21% and equity trading up 33% to $33 billion. Investment banking also showed signs of growth, increasing 16%, and this area could see further growth in 2026, with IPO;s expected to see heightened activity.\nExpectations are for Q4 profits to increase 3% to $4.94 per share, with revenue up 7% to $ 46.2 billion.\nHow to trade JPM Q4 earnings\nThe share price has trended higher since the April low, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows, reaching a record high of 335 last week. The RSI supports further upside while it remains out of overbought territory.\nBuyers will look to rise above 335 to fresh record levels, bringing 350 into focus.\nSupport can be seen at 320, the January low, and November high. Below here, the rising trendline support at 310 comes into play ahead of 300, the December low.\nDelta Airlines (Tuesday)\nDelta Air Lines' share price is surging as the stock market anticipates stronger growth prospects for the airline group, which is typically cyclical.\nThe share price broke out of consolidation around the end of November, taking the stock up to record highs, where it remains.\nThe 18% decline in oil prices across 2025 also supported the stock.\nIn Q3 earnings, reported on October 9, the share price saw a significant day move but still rallied 4.3% after the company posted a 14% rise in quarterly profits and a 6% rise in revenue.\nMain cabin revenue dipped in the quarter. However, investors cheered an 8% increase in corporate revenue and a 9% rise in premium revenue, which includes first-class and economy seats.\nThe company is forecasting EPS of $1.60 to $1.90, with a midpoint of $1.75, above the $1.65 estimate.\nHow to trade DAL earnings\nAfter falling to a low of 34.40 in April, Delta Air Lines has trended higher, reaching a peak of 73.10. The price trades above its 50 and 200 SMA. The bearish RSI divergence could be a reason to be cautious.\nBuyers will look to push above 73.10 to fresh record highs, with 75 and 80 as the next levels to watch.\nSupport is at 68.90, the January low, with a break below here opening the "

Otherwise, outlook will stay bullish even in case of deep pullback.\nIn the long term picture, up trend from 116.83 (2011 low) is resuming. Next target is 251.09 (2007 high). This will remain the favored case as long as 55 M EMA (now at 182.91) holds."

                "body": "Bitcoin heads into 2026 with strong institutional demand, supportive macro conditions, and bullish technical signals pointing toward a potential move to $150,000.\nBitcoin (BTC) is trading near $92,000 as markets digest a wave of institutional validation, including fresh Bitcoin-linked ETF filings from Morgan Stanley and MSCI\u2019s decision to retain crypto-exposed companies in its flagship indexes.\nIn my view, this backdrop sets the stage for a renewed upside push toward $150,000 during 2026.\nIn this article, I\u2019ll outline the macro backdrop, key levels, and the core scenarios shaping Bitcoin\u2019s outlook for the year ahead.\nAmong the top arguments favoring a Bitcoin bull market in 2026 include the end of \u201cfour-year halving cycle,\u201d US debt crises, favorable regulations, and a growing institutional adoption.\nFor most of Bitcoin\u2019s history, prices followed a fairly predictable four-year rhythm tied to the halving, an event that cuts new BTC supply in half roughly every four years.\nHistorically, Bitcoin tended to peak about 12\u201318 months after a halving, followed by a sharp correction as speculative excess faded.\nThe April 2024 halving has followed a similar script so far.\nBitcoin experienced a post-cycle blow-off and subsequent correction, reinforcing the idea that the price may decline to as low as $40,000 if the four-year cycle model plays out as intended.\nNonetheless, such bearish setups have discounted positive fundamentals such as the ongoing BTC supply absorption by digital asset treasurys (DATS) and exchange-traded funds (ETF).\nHere\u2019s some statistics to shed light on the matter. As of January 2026, all the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs were collectively managing nearly 1.3 million BTC worth $117.86 billion, almost double since their debut two years ago.\nAt the same time, DATS have amassed over 1.09 million BTC (~$109.72 billion as of the time of writing) in the past five years. That includes accumulation even during BTC\u2019s price dips, hinting at a long-term bullish scenario shared by these public firms.\nSuch a strong demand for Bitcoin didn\u2019t exist during the previous four-year cycles. And it won\u2019t pare back in 2026, as well, justifying a sustained uptrend toward the $150,000 price target by the year\u2019s end.\nUS. monetary policy has turned notably more dovish than at prior Bitcoin cycle peaks.\nThe Federal Reserve delivered three interest-rate cuts in 2025, and CME FedWatch data shows bond traders pricing in up to two additional cuts in 2026.\nRates rose substantially in 2018 and 2022 bear cycles, hurting prices. The 2026 2026 Fed rate outlook contrasts with previous crypto bull-market tops, suggesting sufficient liquidity to pump riskier assets like Bitcoin.\nIn 2026, Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cstore-of-value\u201d narrative is being reinforced by fiscal conditions, increasing the odds of BTC price hitting $200,000.\nElevated public debt and longer-term currency debasement risks are keeping investor attention on scarce assets, including Bitcoin, as alternative monetary hedges.\nRising debt increases pressure on policymakers to manage financing costs, often by keeping interest rates lower for longer, tolerating higher inflation, or relying on financial repression.\nOver time, these policies tend to weaken the real purchasing power of fiat currencies. For instance, the US dollar index (DXY) closed 2025 at over a 9.50% loss under debt pressure, worsened further by Donald Trump\u2019s seesaw economic policies.\nAs confidence in fiscal discipline erodes, capital gradually moves toward scarce alternatives such as gold\u2014and, increasingly, Bitcoin\u2014particularly among institutions seeking long-duration protection instead of cyclical exposure.\nThe regulatory path for Bitcoin and a broader crypto market has become clearer in the US. In my view, this further supports the case for a $150,000 BTC price by the year\u2019s end.\nGrayscale\u2019s 2023 court win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) helped open the door for regulated spot products. The US then approved spot Bitcoin"

The latest move represents roughly 0.08% of the fund\u2019s $3.53 billion in assets under management (AUM), a modest but notable vote of confidence in a market still digesting steep Bitcoin losses.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading at $90,635.99, having shed about 19.7% over the past three months. Short-term sentiment remains fragile, with the 1-day technical signal flashing Sell, underscoring continued downside pressure in spot trading.\nYet the inflow into BITB hints at a different narrative among ETF investors: some appear willing to use the drawdown as an opportunity to add exposure through regulated vehicles rather than capitulate. While the flow is small in percentage terms relative to AUM, it suggests that institutional and sophisticated retail holders are still treating the recent weakness as cyclical rather than structural, positioning for a potential rebound once macro conditions or regulatory clarity improve.\nFor a more detailed analysis and real-time sentiment trends, check the live cryptocurrency prices here."

This figure places Ethereum\u2019s DeFi TVL at more than 9 times that of the next largest Layer 1 ecosystem. Stablecoin usage also remained high throughout the year, with $18.8 trillion settled on the network.\nThese figures coincided with a decline in transaction costs across the ecosystem. Fees on Ethereum Layer 1 fell to 5-year lows, while Layer 2 networks recorded transaction costs below $0.01, lowering expenses for payments, remittances, and savings-related activity. At the same time, expanded paymaster infrastructure enabled applications to cover the fees for users, often removing the need to hold ETH for gas.\nCrypto platforms also expanded their use of Ethereum during 2025. Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken all launched tokenized stocks on the chain using Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, therefore providing extended access to United States equities beyond standard market hours. Robinhood also announced plans to build its own Layer 2 network using Arbitrum\u2019s Orbit technology.\nMeanwhile, regulatory clarity supported the launch of new crypto-focused neobanks, which introduced payment cards and rewards programs while reporting millions of dollars in daily spending volume.\nNetwork Upgrades and Ecosystem Expansion\nBeyond DeFi and stablecoins, Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem continued to expand across institutional and technical fronts. Institutional participation increased through the expansion of ETH digital asset treasuries, with more than $35 billion worth of ETH held in exchange-traded funds and strategic reserves.\nYou may also like:\n- Truebit Suffers $26.5M Loss in First Major DeFi Hack of 2026\n- The Highway Analogy: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Plan to Scale Ethereum 1000x\n- CNBC Crowns XRP Hottest Crypto Trade of 2026 Over BTC and ETH: Here\u2019s Why\nAdditionally, more institutions used Ethereum smart contracts to manage capital on-chain, access DeFi-based yield strategies, and distribute over $12 billion in real-world assets.\nThe network\u2019s rollup-focused roadmap also progressed during the year. Combined throughput across Layer 2 networks reached an average of 5,600 transactions per second, while the Fusaka upgrade, deployed in December, increased blob capacity and reduced Layer 2 costs. The Layer 1 gas limit was also raised to 60 million, expanding settlement capacity by approximately 33%.\nEthereum celebrated 10 years of being live in July 2025, which was marked by a record of more than 88 million smart contracts deployed, while daily transactions reached a new high of 1.74 million. Developer activity also remained elevated, with 32,000 active developers across the ecosystem and over 16,000 new ones joining between January and September."

                "body": "Solana has rolled out an urgent validator update, v3.0.14, now recommended for general use across Mainnet-Beta. The release targets both staked and unstaked validators, including test nodes, and signals the network\u2019s continued focus on operational resilience.\nAccording to Solana Status, validators should apply the patch immediately to reduce exposure to potential disruptions. Consequently, the update reinforces Solana\u2019s approach of deploying preventative fixes before issues affect users or applications.\nValidator Update Reinforces Network Reliability\nThe v3.0.14 release continues a pattern of rapid maintenance updates across Solana\u2019s v3 validator client series. Besides addressing potential vulnerabilities, these patches aim to strengthen long-term performance and stability.\nDevelopers often push such updates quietly, ensuring validators install them before any network impact becomes visible. Hence, the absence of a detailed changelog aligns with Solana\u2019s emphasis on proactive defense.\nAdditionally, rising on-chain activity has increased the importance of validator reliability. The recent launch of the SKR token highlights growing demand across DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets.\nStable validator layer supports higher throughput and smoother user experiences. Consequently, the network continues prioritizing infrastructure hardening alongside ecosystem growth.\nMajor Upgrades Shape Solana\u2019s Roadmap\nMoreover, Solana\u2019s broader roadmap includes structural upgrades designed to address congestion and decentralization concerns. The Alpenglow upgrade, introduced in September 2025, replaced legacy consensus components with Votor and Rotor.\nThese changes target faster finality and parallel execution, improving scalability. The network plans mainnet deployment this year, expanding capacity for complex applications.\nSignificantly, the Firedancer validator client also plays a central role. Released in Q1 2025 by Jump Crypto, Firedancer runs alongside the Agave client. Its modular design enables parallel processing and targets extremely high throughput.\nThe Agave 3.0.6 release, recommended in October, further supported validator efficiency. Together, these upgrades aim to future-proof Solana\u2019s infrastructure.\nSOL Price Structure Reflects Compression and Accumulation\nSource: CoinCodex\nHowever, SOL price action shows near-term caution despite structural optimism. Solana traded near $135.31, posting a mild daily decline while maintaining a weekly gain above 2%. Market capitalization hovered near $76.3 billion, supported by steady circulation levels.\nAccording to moonbag, SOL\u2019s long-term chart structure supports a breakout toward higher psychological levels, with $400 emerging as a potential upside target. Weekly price compression within a symmetrical triangle suggests prolonged accumulation. Resistance near $260 remains critical, while sustained strength above $180 could unlock higher targets.\nSource: X\nEljaboom highlighted improving short-term structure after SOL reclaimed the $135\u2013$138 demand zone. Additionally, higher lows continue forming, which limits downside risk. Analysts see $145 as a near-term pivot, with $187 emerging as a key resistance level ahead of February."

The S&P 500 gained 0.6% and the Nasdaq rose 0.8% on the day. (AP News)\nWith Wall Street shut for the weekend, traders head into Monday\u2019s open trying to square two competing signals: hiring is slowing, but stocks keep pushing to new highs. A softer labor market can bring rate cuts closer, yet it can also hint at a broader cooling that hits profits.\nFriday\u2019s rally followed a government report that pointed to slower job growth in December, while the jobless rate ticked down. The mix kept investors in the game and left bond yields moving in opposite directions across maturities, a familiar pattern when the rate outlook is still in flux. (Investopedia)\nNonfarm payrolls rose by 50,000 in December and the unemployment rate held at 4.4%, the Labor Department said. The report showed job gains in food services and drinking places, health care and social assistance, while retail trade lost jobs. (Bureau of Labor Statistics)\nThe next test is inflation. The consumer price index (CPI), the government\u2019s main monthly read on price pressures, is due on Tuesday; \u201ccore\u201d CPI strips out food and energy and is watched for underlying trends.\nS&P Global Market Intelligence economists said the December CPI is getting extra scrutiny after data collection issues in prior months and noted that \u201ca cut in US interest rates is not widely expected until June.\u201d They also said the Fed has cut by 25 basis points \u2014 a quarter of a percentage point \u2014 at each of the last three meetings. (S&P Global)\nEarnings add another lever. JPMorgan Chase is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, with the bank set to host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET, it said. (JPMorgan Chase)\nCitigroup is due a day later, saying it plans to release results around 8 a.m. ET on Wednesday, followed by a webcast and teleconference. (Citi)\nFor Dow watchers, the index is now within striking distance of 50,000 \u2014 a round-number level that can draw extra attention even when the news flow is thin. Monday\u2019s first move will likely come from rates, not headlines.\nBut a downside scenario is easy to sketch. A hotter-than-expected CPI could push yields up and force investors to reprice the path for Fed cuts, while early bank results could revive worries about credit costs or a slower consumer.\nWhat markets watch next is Tuesday\u2019s CPI report and JPMorgan\u2019s results the same morning, a one-two punch that could set the tone for the first full earnings week of 2026."

The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), broad-based S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 13%, 16%, and 20%, respectively. It marked the third time in nearly a century that the S&P 500 had gained at least 15% for three consecutive years.\nThis overwhelming optimism on Wall Street has been fueled by the prospect of future interest rate cuts, the rise of artificial intelligence, the advent of quantum computing, and a resilient U.S. economy.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\nBut when things seem too perfect for the stock market is precisely when investors should be concerned.\nAlthough no forecasting model, data point, or correlative event can guarantee short-term directional moves in the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite, select models, data points, and events have uncanny track records of foreshadowing what's to come for stocks. One ultra-rare event, which has been observed only three times in 155 years, offers an ominous warning for Wall Street and investors in 2026 (and beyond).\nThis has only been witnessed three times since January 1871\nAt any given time, there are headwinds that threaten to upend the stock market. But there's arguably no greater hurdle for Wall Street to overcome than pricey equity valuations.\nValue is, itself, a subjective term that's going to vary from one investor to the next. With no ideal blueprint for evaluating public companies, what one investor finds to be pricey might be viewed as a screaming bargain by another. This subjectivity is one of the reasons why short-term directional moves in the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite are so unpredictable.\nHowever, one historically accurate valuation tool, which has been back-tested 155 years, has done a phenomenal job of cutting through this subjectivity and providing investors with apples-to-apples valuation comparisons for the S&P 500. This time-tested valuation yardstick is the Shiller Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, which is also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E Ratio, or CAPE Ratio.\nMost investors turn to the traditional P/E ratio when evaluating whether a public company is cheap, fairly valued, or pricey. The P/E ratio is arrived at by dividing a company's share price by its trailing 12-month earnings per share (EPS). While this valuation measure works well for mature businesses, it often falls short with growth stocks and loses its usefulness during recessions, when EPS can turn negative.\nIn comparison, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E Ratio is based on average inflation-adjusted EPS over the previous 10 years. Accounting for a decade's worth of EPS history minimizes the impact of recessions and shock events and ensures that the Shiller P/E remains useful during all economic climates.\nSince the beginning of 1871, the Shiller P/E has averaged a multiple of 17.33. However, it's spent most of the last 30 years above this 155-year average. This is the result of the internet breaking down information barriers between Wall Street and Main Street, as well as interest rates hovering at or near historic lows throughout much of the 2010s. In other words, investors were willing to accept more risk and higher valuation premiums.\nBut based on what history tells us, there comes a point where valuations become too extended.\nS&P 500 Shiller PE Ratio hits 2nd highest level in history \ud83d\udea8 The highest was the Dot Com Bubble \ud83e\udd2f"

                "body": "The FTSE 100 has hit a record high. Is now the time to start investing?\nAs the new year got into its stride, so did the UK's index of leading shares.\nThe FTSE 100 climbed above 10,000 points for the first time since it was created in 1984, cheering investors - and the chancellor, who wants more of us to move money out of cash savings and into investments.\nThe index tracks the performance of the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange and rose by more than a fifth in 2025.\nBut with many people still struggling with everyday costs, and with talk of some stocks being overvalued, does the FTSE's success really make it a good time to encourage first-time investors?\nInvesting v saving\nPeople can invest their money in many different ways and in different things. Various apps and platforms have made it easy to do.\nCrucially, the value of investments can go up and down. Invest \u00a3100 and there is no guarantee that the investment is still worth \u00a3100 after a month, a year, or 10 years.\nBut, in general, long-term investments can be lucrative. The rise of the FTSE 100 is evidence of that. Shareholders may also receive dividends, which they could take as income or reinvest.\nFor years, the advice has been to treat investments as a long-term strategy. Give it time, and your pot of money will grow much bigger than if it was in a savings account.\nIn contrast, cash savings are much more steady and safe. The amount of interest varies between account providers, but savers know what returns will be. Savings rates have held up quite well over the last year, but interest rates are generally thought to be on the way down.\nSavings accounts are popular when putting money aside for emergencies, or for holidays, a wedding or a car - for one predominant reason: you can usually withdraw the money quickly and easily.\n\"It is important that everyone has savings. It gives you access when you need it,\" says Anna Bowes, savings expert at financial advisers The Private Office (TPO).\n\"It means you do not need to cash out your investments at the wrong time.\"\nEvangelists for investing agree that savings are an important part of the mix for everyone managing their money.\n\"People starting out should have a cash buffer in case of emergency before going into investing,\" says Jema Arnold, a voluntary non-executive director at the UK Individual Shareholders Society (ShareSoc).\nOne in 10 people have no cash savings, and another 21% have less than \u00a31,000 to draw on in an emergency, according to the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nBut Arnold and others point out that cash is not without risk either. As time goes on, the spending power of savings is eroded by the rising cost of living, unless the savings account interest rate beats inflation.\nRisk and reward\nOur brains make a judgement about risk and reward thousands of times every day. We consider the risk of crossing the road against the reward of getting to the other side and so on.\nWith money, those who are more risk-averse have tended to stick with savings, while others have moved into investments. It also helps if you have money you can afford to lose.\nIt is worth remembering that millions of people already have money for their pension invested, although it is often managed for them and they may not pay much attention to it.\nThe FCA says seven million adults in the UK with \u00a310,000 or more in cash savings could receive better returns through investing.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has advocated more risk-taking from consumers. For those with the money, she says the benefit of long-term investing for them, and the UK economy as a whole, is clear.\nShe is altering rules on tax-free Isas (Individual Savings Accounts) in a much-debated move aimed at encouraging investing.\nIt is also why, in a couple of months' time, we are all going to be blitzed with an advertising campaign (funded by the investment industry) telling us to give investing some thought.\nIt will be a modern version of the Tell Sid c"

                "body": "^GSPC Today, January 10: Soft US Jobs Data Lifts Rate-Cut Bets\nUS jobs data came in softer, with slower payroll growth but a lower unemployment rate. That mix firmed Fed rate cut bets and supported global equities. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) hovered near 6,900 as traders weighed policy easing odds and earnings setup. For Germany, the move fed fresh risk appetite, with the DAX edging to a new peak. We break down what the labor signal means, key S&P 500 today levels to watch, why a DAX record high matters, and how investors in Germany can position.\nWhat softer US jobs mean for rates and stocks\nThe mixed US jobs data cooled hiring momentum while the jobless rate dipped, a combination that often nudges the Fed toward easier policy. Markets raised the odds of earlier cuts, easing pressure on valuations. Lower rate expectations tend to support growth stocks and long-duration assets. That backdrop steadied risk sentiment and kept major indices near recent highs, even as investors wait for earnings to confirm margins.\nFor Germany, US policy drives global funding costs and demand. Easing expectations and soft US jobs data helped push the DAX to fresh records, supported by exporters and quality tech. Autos and industrials benefit if the US outlook stays resilient while financing costs trend lower. Local coverage highlighted the upbeat tone as the index advanced to new highs Marktbericht: DAX in Rekordlaune.\nS&P 500 today: levels and momentum\nThe index traded near 6,902, with a session range of 6,892 to 6,920 and a prior close of 6,921. The 50-day average at 6,816 is first support, followed by the middle Bollinger band near 6,866. The 200-day average at 6,317 is the longer-term floor. On the upside, the year high at 6,978 and the upper Bollinger band around 6,980 mark resistance.\nMomentum stayed constructive but not stretched. RSI sits at 57.5, while the MACD histogram is positive at 2.78. ADX near 12 signals a weak trend, so breakouts need volume confirmation. Stochastic at 87 flags near-term froth, and ATR around 59 points implies typical daily swings. Together, that favors buying pullbacks over chasing strength.\nDAX record high: spillovers and sectors\nA softer US growth pulse with lower joblessness tends to reduce rate fears, helping German shares. The DAX moved to a record as cyclical and quality growth names caught a bid, supported by cooling policy risk and improving earnings visibility. Local market reports noted US jobs data as a key driver Aktien Frankfurt: Dax bleibt auf Rekordkurs \u2013 US-Jobdaten st\u00fctzen \u2013 boerse.de.\nGerman multinationals are tightly linked to US demand. When US jobs data softens without signaling recession, it can lift margins through cheaper capital while keeping revenues stable. That mix helps exporters, semis, and industrial suppliers. Banks can also benefit from tighter spreads and improving credit quality if growth holds. Watch sector breadth to judge the strength behind a DAX record high.\nStrategy: how to position from Germany\nWe prefer quality growth with solid cash flow and select cyclicals that benefit from lower funding costs. Use the 6,816 50-day average as a risk marker for S&P 500 exposure, and trim into tests of 6,980 resistance if breadth fades. Earnings revisions will be key. If guidance holds, soft US jobs data plus easing odds can support a grind higher.\nA path toward rate cuts favors extending duration gradually. Core euro government or investment-grade bond ETFs can balance equity risk. Keep some dry powder for volatility spikes, given ADX shows no strong trend. For US exposure, consider euro-hedged share classes if currency swings rise. Reassess after major US data prints and central bank meetings.\nFinal Thoughts\nSofter US jobs data shifted the focus back to policy easing, lifting risk appetite and setting a supportive tone for equities. For Germany, that meant a DAX record high as exporters and quality tech gained. In the US, S&P 500 today levels show support near 6,816 and resistance around 6,98"

Chip stocks rose and helped to boost the S&P 500, with Intel gaining after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d with the chipmaker\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Lip-Bu Tan.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly report showed 50,000 workers were added to nonfarm payrolls in December, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a rise of 60,000, just above November\u2019s downwardly revised increase of 56,000. The unemployment rate eased, as expected, to 4.4%.\nFed funds futures traders are now pricing in only a 4.8% chance of a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s Jan. 27-28 meeting, down from 11.6% before the data. The next cut is unlikely before at least April.\n\u201cPayrolls were a little bit light relative to consensus, but still fairly strong numbers,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.\n\u201cWe are back to normal in terms of economic reporting so that\u2019s a bit of a relief for everyone.\u201d\nBefore now, the release of U.S. economic data had been delayed because of the long federal government shutdown.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 252.84 points, or 0.51%, to 49,518.95, the S&P 500 rose 53.23 points, or 0.77%, to 6,974.69 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 216.38 points, or 0.92%, to 23,696.40.\nAll three indexes are set for weekly gains in the first full trading week of 2026, with the Dow on track for its biggest weekly gain since the last week of November.\nMSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.01 points, or 0.58%, to 1,035.46.\nEuropean shares ended at a record high. A jump in Glencore helped put the STOXX 600 on its longest weekly winning streak since May. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.97%.\nDollar, two-year yields up\nAfter the jobs report the dollar initially gave up almost all the day\u2019s gains versus a basket of major currencies, having risen by nearly 0.2% earlier. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, was last up 0.26% at 99.13.\nInterest rate sensitive two-year Treasury yields were higher after the data, while 10-year yields were last down slightly. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Fed, rose 5 basis points to 3.538%, from 3.488% late on Thursday. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 1.2 basis points to 4.171%.\nIn commodities, crude oil ended sharply higher. Brent futures rose $1.35, or 2.18%, to settle at $63.34 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $1.36, or 2.35%, to $59.12.\nInvestors have become more convinced that production in Venezuela, even under U.S. control, may not rise meaningfully for some time.\nSupreme Court didn\u2019t rule on Trumps\u2019 tariffs Friday\nInvestors had been bracing for a possible U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nBut the court is expected to issue its next rulings on Wednesday. The court indicated on its website on Friday that it could release decisions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting next Wednesday."

                "body": "LEG Immobilien SE: German Residential Landlord Navigates A Nervous Rate Plateau\n11.01.2026 - 04:57:00LEG Immobilien SE is currently trading in a fragile middle ground, where the panic of surging interest rates has faded but conviction is still in short supply. The stock has eased slightly over the past few sessions after a strong multi month recovery, suggesting that investors are weighing relief about stabilizing bond yields against enduring concerns over German housing regulation and refinancing risk.\nOn the latest close, LEG Immobilien SE finished around the mid 90 euro range, after drifting lower over the last five trading days with a modest single digit percentage pullback. That soft step back contrasts with the much stronger ninety day performance, where the stock has rallied sharply off its autumn lows, recouping a significant share of the brutal drawdown that had pushed many European landlords into deep value territory.\nMarket data from multiple sources such as Yahoo Finance and B\u00f6rse Frankfurt indicate that the current quote sits well above the recent 52 week low in roughly the mid 60s, yet still meaningfully below the 52 week high in the low 110s. In other words, the stock now trades in the upper half of its yearly range, a classic zone of consolidation where both bullish and bearish narratives can plausibly claim the upper hand.\nOver the last week of trading the daily candles have been tight, with relatively low volatility compared to the wild swings seen during the peak of the rate shock. Short term traders will note that the five day curve has a slight downward tilt, but without the kind of heavy volume or aggressive pricing that signals capitulation. This looks more like profit taking after a sharp multi month rise than the start of a new structural selloff.\nLooking further back, the ninety day trend has been decisively positive. From depressed levels in early autumn the share price climbed by several tens of percent into late year, tracking the sharp pullback in European yields and a broader rotation back into interest rate sensitive assets. That rally helped narrow the valuation gap versus net asset value and eased fears of a prolonged downward spiral in the German residential sector.\nFrom a sentiment standpoint, the slightly negative move over the most recent week feels more like a pause for breath than a verdict against the company\u2019s fundamentals. Rate expectations have stabilized, the worst case scenarios on regulation have not materialized, and equity analysts are increasingly focused on balance sheet resilience rather than existential risk.\nLearn more about LEG Immobilien SE and its German residential portfolio strategy\nOne-Year Investment Performance\nFor investors who stepped into LEG Immobilien SE roughly one year ago, the ride has been anything but smooth, yet the destination now looks surprisingly rewarding. Based on market data from German exchanges, the stock closed in the low 80s one year ago and has since climbed into the mid 90s, implying a gain in the low to mid teens percentage range before dividends.\nPut differently, a hypothetical 10,000 euro investment at that time would now be worth around 11,000 to 11,500 euros, excluding any reinvested payouts. Given the bruising macro backdrop for European property owners, this positive outcome feels almost counterintuitive. Investors were forced to endure high volatility, stretches of pronounced drawdown and an almost nonstop flow of negative headlines about rates, valuations and regulation.\nThe emotional arc for those buy and hold investors has been intense. Early on, as yields surged and property valuations were slashed, it likely felt as if the market was on a one way street toward distress, with every bounce an invitation to sell. Yet those who resisted the urge to capitulate have now been paid for their courage with a respectable double digit gain and a healthier looking balance between risk and reward. It is a vivid reminder that in rate sensitive "

                "body": "Vanguard founder Jack Bogle helped spearhead the low-cost index fund, putting average returns within reach of every investor. But you can make superior returns by picking better-than average stocks. For example, the Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) share price is up 72% in the last three years, slightly above the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 17% in the last year.\nSince it's been a strong week for Fastenal shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nFastenal was able to grow its EPS at 4.6% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 20% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\nWhat About Dividends?\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Fastenal, it has a TSR of 85% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nA Different Perspective\nFastenal shareholders have received returns of 20% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the general market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 13% per year. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Fastenal ."

The market maintains the bullish bias amid a strong economy and the Fed\u2019s dovish reaction function, but lacks the momentum seen in 2025 when Trump pulled back on aggressive tariffs and the Fed was in a clear easing mode.\nThis year the main risk for the bullish outlook is inflation. The \u201crun it hot\u201d narrative continues to underpin stocks, and we\u2019ve seen from the latest GDP report and the Atlanta Fed GDPNow how the economy looks to be accelerating. That hasn\u2019t translated into persistent inflationary pressures besides the tariff driven spike in the summer.\nI have a feeling that US CPI will be more important in the next months because inflation worry is what is constraining the Fed from acting more quickly and with more conviction on rate cuts. In fact, while weak labour market data was seen as positive for the stock market on expectations of more Fed cuts, this year it might be seen as negative if it comes with higher CPI data due to the above-mentioned constraint.\nNASDAQ TECHNICAL ANALYSIS \u2013 DAILY TIMEFRAME\nOn the daily chart, we can see that the Nasdaq has been compressing into a rising wedge. These types of patterns can resolve into a downside breakout taking the price to the base of the wedge or an upside breakout leading to a strong rally after the consolidation.\nNASDAQ TECHNICAL ANALYSIS \u2013 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME\nOn the 4 hour chart, we can see more clearly the recent choppy price action that formed the rising wedge. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup around the bottom trendline to position for a rally into new all-time highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking lower to pile in for a drop into the base of the wedge around the 24900 level.\nNASDAQ TECHNICAL ANALYSIS \u2013 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME\nOn the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have a minor upward trendline defining the current bullish momentum on this timeframe. The buyers will likely continue to lean on the trendline to keep pushing into the top trendline of the wedge, while the sellers will look for a break lower to extend the drop into the bottom trendline. The red lines define the average daily range for today.\nUPCOMING CATALYSTS\nToday we conclude the week with the US NFP report and potential US Supreme Court decision on Trump\u2019s tariffs."

Brandon Bell | Getty Images\nNew dietary guidelines from the Trump administration have some big asks of Americans, from prioritizing protein to avoiding highly processed food. The most onerous directive, though, was probably for moms and dads.\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins want them to stop giving their kids sugar until they turn 11.\nThat, says Keri Rodrigues, a mother of five boys and the president of the National Parents Union, is \u201ccompletely unrealistic.\u201d Her group, which has been critical of other administration policies, represents 1.7 million parents.\n\u201cSugar is everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s in bread, it\u2019s in all kinds of other things,\u201d she said.\nNo one is saying kids can\u2019t eat foods that contain natural sugar, such as bananas and fresh mango, but avoiding added sugar \u2014 which most everyone agrees should be limited \u2014 would require incredible diligence. The old rules, which most parents failed to abide by, only asked them to hold the line till their kids turned 2.\nThe new guidance, strictly followed, would mean a wholesale overhaul of most kids\u2019 diets and the traditions of childhood. There\u2019d be no more Halloween candy, ice cream cones at the county fair, Cracker Jack at the ballgame or even a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich.\nThe guidelines are the government\u2019s declaration of war on added sugar, Kennedy said when announcing the new recommendations Wednesday, pointing to the high rates of obesity among American children. Approximately 1 in 5 American children and teens are obese, according to 2024 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe new guidelines, spearheaded by Kennedy and Rollins, say that no amount of added sugar is recommended or considered part of a healthy diet.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other health groups have praised the guidelines\u2019 recommendations for Americans to avoid added sugar.\nThe new guidelines tell parents to avoid any added sugar for children 4 and under and stress that \u201cno amount of sugar is recommended\u201d for kids between 5 and 10. The previous guidelines, in addition to asking parents to avoid giving kids sugar till 2, recommended that added sugars remain under 10 percent of daily calories for kids older than that.\nConsuming too much added sugar is linked to conditions such as weight gain and obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which in 2024 pointed to a 2021 survey showing that a majority of one-to-five year olds had consumed at least one sugary drink in the week prior to the survey.\nA Department of Health and Human Services official said highly processed foods, which often contain added sugar, trigger something akin to addiction, and early exposure can make it difficult to resist eating too much sugar later in life. POLITICO granted the official anonymity because they were not allowed to speak publicly.\nHHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the dietary guidelines \u201care a guideline and recommendation for Americans.\u201d He stressed that they were only a recommendation.\nDietary guidelines affect how federal programs like school meals are run, but Americans have never faithfully adhered to them.\nTina Descovich, a mother of five and the co-founder of Moms for Liberty, a conservative parents\u2019 rights organization, said she thought it would be hard to comply with the new guidance once children start to attend school and play dates.\nDescovich recalled her time as a Brevard County, Fla., school board member between 2016 and 2020. Parents often complained about sugar-laden breakfast foods the kids were served, she said, adding that she agreed that getting such foods "

                "body": "RFK Jr.'s new dietary guidelines emphasize red meat, full-fat dairy. How healthy are they?\nSome experts say red meat and full-fat dairy can be high in saturated fats.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced updated federal dietary guidelines on Tuesday, though some of the recommendations are being challenged by health experts.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are updated every five years, recommended that Americans limit highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates.\nSome nutrition and diet experts, however, questioned other recommendations, including consuming red meat and full-fat dairy, a reversal of past nutrition guidance.\nThey told ABC News that while red meat and full-fat dairy can be part of a heathy diet, they also can be high in sodium and saturated fats, which can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nEmphasis on red meat and protein\nIn a factsheet released along with the guidelines, the administration said it was recommending that American prioritize eating protein-rich foods with every meal including red meat, poultry, seafood and eggs in addition to plant-sourced protein foods.\nThis is a stark contrast from past years in which guidelines have encouraged Americans to limit the amount of red meat being consumed.\nNutrition experts contend that red meat is high in protein and contains several nutrients including iron, zinc, potassium, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12.\nHowever, some experts add that red meat is also high in saturated fats, which has been shown to increase levels of \"bad\" cholesterol and increase the risk of heart disease, according to the American Heart Association.\nAdditionally, the 2025 Scientific Report -- an independent report written by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee that helps the HHS and Department of Agriculture develop the next set of dietary guidelines -- found that reducing items with saturated fats, such as processed and unprocessed red meat with plant-based protein foods, can lower cardiovascular disease risk.\n\"I'm concerned about the focus on protein and if we're telling people to have protein at every meal that might increase overall meat consumption, and for many Americans that could also increase saturated fat intake, especially if people lean toward red meat rather than lean cuts of meat, seafood beans, nuts, and seeds as their protein sources,\" Maya Feller, a registered dietitian based in New York City, told ABC News.\nThe factsheet also claimed that previous federal dietary guidelines have \"demonized\" protein in favor of carbohydrates.\n\"Protein was never demonized in U.S. dietary guidelines. As it is, Americans are consuming protein in amounts well above the amount that is necessary to sustain health and development,\" Marie-Pierre St-Onge, a professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, told ABC News.\nThe guidelines also advise adults to consume between 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\nFeller said there isn't enough evidence to suggest that all Americans need to be consuming that much protein, and that a variety of protein sources is beneficial.\n\"The majority of the population has one or more non-communicable diseases, which require thoughtful meal planning to adjust macronutrient needs,\" she said. \"Increasing protein intake should include a variety of proteins from both plant and animal sources.\"\nThe American Heart Association said in a statement on Wednesday that it welcomes the new dietary guidelines and its emphasis on fruits and vegetables while limiting highly processed foods and added sugars.\nHowever, regarding protein, the AHA said it encourages prioritizing plant-based proteins, seafood and lean meats and to limit high-fat animal products including \"red meat, butter, lard and tallow, which are linked to increased cardiovascular risk.\"\nMixed views on full-fat dairy\nU.S. health officials said during a press conference on Wednesday that full"

                "body": "New federal dietary recommendations have sparked mixed reactions from the embattled restaurant industry, as changing guidelines could encourage Americans to dine out less often or choose from a smaller pool of restaurants when they do leave home.\nThe departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled the nutrition guidelines on Wednesday. The recommendations, which are updated every five years, pushed for higher consumption of protein and full-fat dairy and reduced intake of processed foods and sugary drinks.\nThe guidelines are primarily a public health tool for federal agencies, health-care providers and nutrition experts, so it's unclear how much they will influence individual consumer choices. Although the recommendations largely focus on eating at home, they lightly touched on the restaurant industry as well.\n\"When dining out, choose nutrient-dense options,\" the guidelines advise.\nWhile the recommendations could discourage Americans from spending at restaurants \u2014 especially at a time when high inflation has curbed trips to dine out \u2014 some pockets of the industry had a positive reaction to the changes. The changes could give a particular boost to struggling fast-casual chains like Sweetgreen and Chipotle, which have long touted the type of natural ingredients championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make American Healthy Again\" movement.\nOne lobbying executive who represents restaurant companies, whose organization was involved in meetings with the White House on the new guidelines, said the outcome could have been \"far worse\" for the sector. The person, who declined to be named because their organization was involved in private discussions, said the end result was better for the industry than proposed guidance from earlier in 2025 was.\nHowever, the executive said they are still concerned the guidelines could encourage Americans to eat at home when diners have affordable options to incorporate those foods at restaurants. That implication could also ruffle feathers among restaurant chains and their franchisees.\nDespite those potential concerns from some, industry lobbying group the National Restaurant Association backed the new guidelines.\n\"Now, more than ever, restaurant operators are offering a wider variety of options, allowing consumers to choose what best fits their dietary needs, preferences, and lifestyles. We congratulate Secretary Kennedy and the Trump Administration on the release of the new guidelines and look forward to continued collaboration with policymakers to ensure that nutrition guidance remains practical, flexible, and supportive of access and innovation,\" National Restaurant Association spokesman Sean Kennedy said in a statement to CNBC.\nRestaurant franchise lobbyist the International Franchise Association, called the approach \"nuanced\" and said it may limit the number of price increases restaurants have to make.\n\"Fortunately, the more nuanced approach of these guidelines helps ensure our members will not have to raise prices and that consumers can continue to make their own choices,\" the group said. \"Any future regulations or guidance must keep potential cost increases top of mind, as restaurant owners already face numerous regulatory burdens and supply chain challenges, which most often disproportionately affect small business owners, like franchisees, and ultimately, American consumers.\"\nHow fast casual could benefit\nSome of the most supportive reactions came from chains that had been beaten down in 2025, including Chipotle and Sweetgreen. Both fast-casual names saw pullbacks from younger consumers who continue to struggle in a K-shaped economy, where spending has concentrated more among the highest earners.\nLoading chart...\nSweetgreen, which was the biggest restaurant sector laggard last year with a nearly 80% stock decline, cheered the new guidelines.\nA spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"We keep ultra-processed ingredients and added sugars out of our restaurants, sour"

CGTN is not responsible for any of the translations.\nEditor's note: Fawad Razaqzada is a senior market analyst from Forex.com. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.\nThe US dollar (USD) has had a slightly choppy start to the year. What's notable, though, is how quickly markets have brushed aside the geopolitical noise \u2013 not just from Venezuela, but also from Greenland.\nWith geopolitics taking a back seat, attention turns firmly to the US data calendar. This week's employment indicators could influence the USD or Japanese yen (JPY) forecast and the near-term direction of other major pairs.\nGeopolitics fail to rattle risk appetite\nFollowing the weekend's dramatic headlines out of Venezuela, the dollar started the first full trading week of 2026 on the front foot. The euro and Swiss franc softened, while gold, silver, and equity markets all pushed higher. Oil prices were more volatile, swinging sharply before slipping back on Tuesday amid concerns about additional supply entering the market. Oil prices softened after US President Donald Trump suggested the US could take control of up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan crude.\nBut the broader market reaction has been notably muted. The dollar has clawed back some ground, though this appears more likely to be due to seasonal inflows and weakness in the euro (hit by weaker data) than any geopolitical premium.\nAs mentioned, the market response has been mixed rather than defensive. That suggests investors are not expecting immediate escalation, instead weighing short-term uncertainty against longer-term implications for Venezuelan oil production. While deeper US involvement in Venezuela, or any form of military action linked to Greenland, would be more market-moving \u2013 potentially driving some flows back into the yen \u2013 risk appetite remains intact for now. That backdrop continues to underpin USD/JPY.\nAll eyes back on US labor data\nA raft of US employment reports is due for the rest of this week, which could help shape market expectations for the early part of January.\nHistorically, the dollar often struggles in December before finding its feet again as the new year gets underway. With a large chunk of Federal Reserve easing already priced in, dollar bears may find it hard going unless the data takes a clear turn for the worse. Any upside surprises, therefore, should help support the USD/JPY forecast, particularly with the yen still under pressure amid a lack of meaningful pushback from either the Bank of Japan or the Japanese government.\nAdmittedly, it hasn't been the strongest start to the year for US macro numbers, with this week's ISM manufacturing purchasing managers' index coming in on the soft side. That said, it followed a run of stronger-than-expected data towards the end of 2025, including jobless claims, pending home sales, and Q3 GDP. Growth in Q3 was revised up to an annualized 4.3 percent, well above the 3.3 percent consensus, which complicates the argument for aggressive Fed rate cuts this year.\nAt present, markets aren't fully pricing in the next 25 basis point cut until June, with a second one pencilled in for September. Those expectations could easily be pared back if the upcoming labor market data come in firm.\nWith the Fed now more focused on employment than inflation, labor market data carries added significance for the dollar. For now, the near-term outlook for the greenback remains neutral to mildly constructive.\nTechnical USD or JPY forecast: Price action still favors the upside\nFrom a technical point of view, despite this week's pullback from the 157.00 area, the path of least resistance for USD or JPY still looks higher. The main bearish argument at this stage is that the pair failed"

He intends to change the political situation based on his high approval rating for the Cabinet. With the news of the early general election, the Japanese financial market seems to be fluctuating.\nMajor Japanese media, including the Yomiuri Shimbun, reported on the 11th that Prime Minister Takaichi has begun a review to dissolve the House of Representatives (House of Representatives) at the beginning of the regular session of the National Assembly, which is scheduled to convene on the 23rd.\nThe Japanese National Assembly consists of the upper house (the upper house) with a term of six years and the lower house with a term of four years. The upper house is guaranteed a term of office, but the lower house can be dissolved by the prime minister at any time. If the dissolution of the House of Representatives is carried out, the election schedule is likely to be \"voting on February 8 after the election announcement on January 27\" and \"voting on February 15 after the election announcement on February 3.\"\nPrime Minister Takaichi is considering dissolving the House of Representatives because of his high approval rating for the Cabinet. According to surveys by the Yomiuri Shimbun and the Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei), it has maintained 70% since its inception.\nThe total number of seats in the House of Representatives is 465. The Liberal Democratic Party has 199 seats, with 34 seats in the ruling coalition, the Japan Restoration Congress, barely meeting its majority (233 seats). The Liberal Democratic Party is trying to bring the People's Democratic Party (27 seats) into the coalition for a more stable political operation, but it is not easy.\nNikkei said, \"Prime Minister Takaichi is still below the majority in the upper house, so cooperation with opposition parties is essential for political management,\" adding, \"The intention is to gain public trust in his policies through elections.\"\nDissolution of the House of Representatives is the prime minister's greatest authority. There have been a total of 22 dissolution since the formation of the Liberal Democratic Party in 1955. Within one year of taking office, it was the highest, reaching 60%. Prime Minister Takaichi also took office on October 21 last year, and it has not yet been 100 days.\nAfter the dissolution of the House of Representatives, the election did not necessarily help the prime minister at the time. Of the nine cases dissolved within a year after taking office, only six have been secured by the ruling party.\nIn 2024, when political donations were a problem, in 2009, when the government was replaced by the Democratic Party, and in 1979, when the general consumption tax was newly established, the backlash was released to the ruling party, resulting in election defeat. Currently, the approval rating for the Takaichi Cabinet is high, but the approval rating for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is only 30%, which is also considered worrisome.\nNews of the early general election is also affecting the Japanese financial market. The yen fell to 158 yen per dollar in the New York foreign exchange market on the 9th (local time), the lowest level in about a year since mid-January last year.\nNikkei said, \"The yen plunged as news of the dissolution of the House of Representatives became known to the market,\" adding, \"It is because of concerns that if Prime Minister Takaiichi accelerates his finances actively, the fiscal deterioration will continue.\"\nOn the other hand, the Nikkei futures (March) surged to 53,860 yen at one point on the Osaka Stock Exchange on the 9th.
