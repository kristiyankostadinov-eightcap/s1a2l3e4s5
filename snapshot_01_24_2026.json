                "body": "Understanding the relationship between gold prices and the U.S. dollar: What to know for 2026\nGold prices have been making headlines over the last year, and the last several months in particular, as the price has surged past recent highs and set fresh records nearly every week. At the same time, the U.S. Dollar Index has been hovering near multi-month lows, marking a significant retreat from its highs just a year ago. For investors watching their portfolios, these parallel movements aren't coincidental. They're part of a long-standing dynamic that continues to reshape the investment landscape.\nThe relationship between gold and the U.S. dollar has taken on renewed importance as a number of looming issues, like economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and shifting monetary policies, create an environment where understanding this connection could mean the difference between protecting and eroding wealth. After a year that saw gold climb substantially and the dollar fall in tandem, investors are now confronting a fundamentally different market than they faced early last year.\nWhat exactly should investors know about the relationship between gold prices and the U.S. dollar right now, though? That's what we'll examine below.\nFind out how to add gold and other precious metals to your portfolio today.\nUnderstanding the relationship between gold prices and the U.S .dollar: What to know for 2026\nAt its core, gold's historical relationship with the U.S. dollar is rooted in simple economics: Gold is priced in dollars globally, so when the dollar strengthens, gold becomes more expensive in other currencies and tends to lose some demand, putting downward pressure on its price. Conversely, when the dollar weakens, gold becomes relatively cheaper for holders of other currencies, which can boost demand and lift prices. This dynamic has created a generally inverse correlation between gold prices and the U.S. dollar over decades.\nBut why does this matter? For investors and analysts, movements in the U.S. Dollar Index, which acts as a measure of the dollar's strength against a basket of major world currencies, often serve as a quick barometer for how gold might fare. A rising U.S. Dollar Index historically corresponded with pressure on gold, while a falling U.S. Dollar Index offered a lift.\nYet the relationship isn't ironclad. In recent years, and particularly as markets dealt with rising global debt, geopolitical uncertainty and renewed demand for alternatives to traditional financial assets, gold and the dollar have occasionally moved in the same direction. For example, global safe-haven demand during periods of market stress can push both gold and the dollar higher simultaneously, even if that runs contrary to the usual inverse pattern.\nAnd, when it comes to how the U.S. dollar and gold could interact throughout the course of 2026, several factors could influence this dynamic, including:\nMonetary policy and interest rates\nFederal Reserve decisions on interest rates play a significant role in shaping both the dollar and gold prices, meaning that any Fed rate decisions that occur this year could have an impact. Higher interest rates tend to support the dollar by offering better returns on dollar-denominated assets, making non-yielding gold less attractive. Conversely, expectations of rate cuts, or even political pressure on the Fed, can weaken the dollar and make gold more appealing.\nStart protecting your investment portfolio with precious metals now.\nInflation expectations\nGold has long been viewed as a hedge against inflation, and right now, inflation, while cooler compared to recent highs, is still not fully under control. Where it heads next remains to be seen. When inflation expectations rise, particularly if real yields turn negative, investors often seek gold to preserve purchasing power. A weaker dollar often accompanies rising inflation expectations, reinforcing gold's safe-haven appeal.\nGeopolitical tension and safe-haven demand\nCon"

Given the drama since the start of the year, I wouldn't rule that out.\nIn any case, these moves are notable and USD/JPY is having a look at the post-BOJ lows.\nIt's certainly not only the yen though as cable is at the best levels in 14 weeks and is further pressing higher. From Monday's low, it's up 230 pips and has been lifted by hawkish comments from Greene, along with stronger retail sales and PMI beats.\nThe week ahead is also a big one as Trump is likely to name a new Fed chief. There are risks around US equity flows as well with all the megacap tech names reporting earnings.\nThe rule of thumb on the Fed decision is that Kevin Warsh or Kevin Hassett (particularly the latter) would be dollar negative while Rick Rieder or Chris Waller would be dollar supportive.\nWe also get a proper Fed decision on Wednesday, though the market is pricing in virtually no likelihood of a rate cut, and no cut is fully priced in until July. The Fed wants to wait and see how the economy develops as we get mixed indications on growth. Airlines have reported high spending in premium segments but today, railroad CSX had a downbeat view on 2026 freight volumes and overall macro.\nInflation appears to be trending down but there is still some angst about how inflation plays out."

However, the president also said he's reached a deal framework with NATO regarding Greenland's future; details about the deal have not been released at this time.\nTensions between Trump and US Federal Reserve are also providing support for silver, which like gold acts as a safe haven in times of turmoil. On January 9, the US Department of Justice served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment over Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee this past June.\nTrump denied knowledge of the investigation, but the move has still reignited concerns about Fed independence, with Powell linking it to the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump would like.\nPowell's term as Fed chair ends in May, but two years still remain on his term as a governor of the board.\nTarget rate probabilities for January Fed meeting.\nChart via CME Group.\nThe Fed's next rate announcement is set for January 28, and CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool shows strong expectations for a hold. That's despite core consumer price index (CPI) data showing that inflation rose by a lower-than-expected 0.2 percent for December. On an annual basis, core CPI was up 2.6 percent.\nTrump has frequently criticized Powell for not lowering rates quickly enough, and Powell's replacement, who has not yet been announced, is widely expected to be more in line with Trump's views.\n\u201cWe see increased interference with the Fed as a key bullish wildcard for the precious metals in 2026,\u201d Carsten Menke, head of next-generation research at Julius Baer Group, told Bloomberg.

Tariff concerns and silver's new status as a critical mineral in the US have also provided support.\nIn addition to its appeal as a precious metal, silver's industrial side shouldn't be forgotten \u2014 according to the Silver Institute, the white metal's \"global silver industrial demand is poised to grow further as demand from vital technology sectors accelerates over the next five years.

                "body": "What is the price of silver today?\nIn recent years, with inflation problematic and higher interest rates impacting investors of all types, many turned to gold for protection and portfolio diversification. And the yellow metal subsequently surged in price, surpassing numerous price records on its way toward the $5,000 per ounce mark. But another precious metal has quietly but impressively grown at the same time: silver.\nLong considered the cost-effective precious metal alternative to gold, the price of silver has surged recently and is now up by more than 200% from where it sat in January 2025. And that remarkable growth could easily continue in the weeks and months ahead, especially if certain economic conditions are met. This potential can be both daunting and encouraging for prospective investors \u2013 and advantageous for those who are already invested in the metal or considering adding more to their portfolio right now.\nTo better determine the value of investing in silver now, it helps to know where the price currently stands. So, what is the price of silver per ounce now? That's what we'll outline below (and explain why getting invested now could make the most sense).\nProtect your portfolio with gold and silver here now.\nWhat is the price of silver today?\nThe price of silver is $99.72 per ounce as of January 23, 2026, according to American Hartford Gold, a precious metals dealer. That's up dramatically from just $31 for the same amount of metal in January 2025. So the price growth here is unmistakable and, for investors who have been priced out of the gold market entirely, this could be the smart (and affordable) way to get invested in precious metals now.\nWaiting for the price to decline is generally not advisable. While silver prices can be more volatile than gold, over time, they tend to only increase, so waiting for a temporary drop in the price could be an expensive mistake worth avoiding.\nGet started with a silver investment today.\nWhy should you invest in silver now?\nWhile not identical, the benefits of silver investing are similar to those gold offers. Thanks to a consistent price, particularly during inflationary periods, silver can help your portfolio hedge against the corrosive impacts of inflation in a way that other assets cannot. Accordingly, it can help function as a critical diversifier for those whose portfolios are otherwise too heavily made up of stocks, bonds, real estate or other investment types.\nAnd while gold and silver aren't typically considered income-producing assets, a quick glance at the price chart for either over the past year illustrates that, right now at least, both may be able to be sold for a rapid profit. Still, with industrial demand for silver expected to remain powerful, waiting around to invest may not make sense, either. Instead, consider speaking with a financial advisor or precious metal company that can answer any questions you may have and help you determine the exact role silver can play in your portfolio now.\nThe bottom line\nThe price of silver per ounce currently sits just under $100 per ounce. That said, this is the price for the metal before any dealer mark-ups, which can easily cause the price to rise considerably higher. So, if you need the inflation hedge and portfolio diversification the metal represents and don't want to pay the exorbitant price you'd otherwise have to in order to secure the same benefits with gold, it could make sense to get started with the metal this month. Just be sure to keep silver as a critical but limited portion of your overall portfolio, typically capped at 10% or less, to avoid overcrowding your other assets at the same time."

This strength reflects both resilient safe\u2011haven flows and robust industrial demand, pushing the gold-silver ratio to just above 50 - its lowest level since 2011. Silver\u2019s higher volatility relative to gold, driven by its smaller market size and dual role as both an industrial and investment metal, has amplified recent moves.\nSupport for silver has been reinforced by a weaker US dollar, lower real yields, and stronger investor appetite for hard assets amid heightened policy uncertainty. Silver has also been boosted by a historic short squeeze and strong retail buying. At the same time, industrial demand - particularly from solar, electrification, and grid infrastructure investment - has tightened the physical market at a time when mine supply growth remains limited. With most silver produced as a by\u2011product of other metals, the sector is unable to respond quickly to higher prices, leaving the market in a persistent deficit that continues to underpin the bullish narrative.\nRisks do remain though. A sharper global slowdown or sustained high prices could trigger demand destruction, especially across industrial sectors. Silver\u2019s inherent volatility also means it can overshoot in both directions.\nDespite these risks, the broader setup remains constructive. Strong industrial demand, tight physical balances, and solid investor interest continue to support the market. Silver is benefiting simultaneously from its precious metal momentum and industrial strength - a rare combination that continues to define this cycle.\nMeanwhile, gold is nearing the key $5,000/oz level, extending a blistering rally, surging a further 14% this year, supported by a weaker dollar, escalating geopolitical concerns, continued central bank buying, and mounting worries over the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence.\nThis publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

                "body": "The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has a checkered relationship with American oil companies. In the 1970s, OPEC member states pushed the likes of Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP\u2014part of what has been dubbed Big Oil\u2014out of the developing world, seizing their concessions and handing them over to their own national oil companies. In the decades since, however, OPEC has quietly become a friend to Big Oil. OPEC has used its market power to keep prices high, making it profitable for North American and European companies to develop their own oil that was often expensive to produce, such as crudes lifted by deepwater rigs, fracked from shale, or melted from solid bitumen.\nFrom one perspective, the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, and its apparent capture of the oil sector of a founding member of OPEC, looks like a bid to reclaim Washington\u2019s lost influence over the global oil supply. Thus, the Trump administration\u2019s assault on climate action and cleaner substitutes such as electric vehicles and renewable energy may represent a complementary policy to sustain oil demand. While closer alignment between US and Venezuelan production may eventually undercut OPEC\u2019s market power, Trump\u2019s rollback of climate policy may ultimately reinforce global demand for oil in ways that the cartel is well placed to exploit.\nForeign Investors and Energy Nationalists\nIt is unlikely that the Trump administration\u2019s urging of international oil companies (IOCs) to restart investment in Venezuela will move the needle on supply much in the short term. In the longer term, however, US influence on Venezuelan oil suggests the potential for a larger American role in the global oil market. OPEC has yet to react publicly, although it is certainly paying close attention to any potential challenge to its dominant position.\nPresident Donald Trump has said that he aims to \u201ctake back\u201d control of natural resources that US firms lost to Venezuela in past decades. In 1976, the Venezuelan government cancelled the concessions of Exxon, Gulf, Mobil, Texaco, Chevron, and Arco seven years early, albeit with compensation. The 1976 nationalization was the culmination of taxation changes that started in 1958 (by some accounts earlier) and that saw the Venezuelan state tilt the terms ever more deeply in its favor. In further nationalizations between 2005 and 2007, ConocoPhillips and Exxon pulled out rather than acquiesce to the Venezuelan government\u2019s punitive changes in terms. Outstanding claims against Venezuela exceed $10 billion for ConocoPhillips and $1.5 billion for ExxonMobil. Other companies, notably Chevron, accepted the new terms and stayed, which is why Chevron is now in pole position to lead any recovery in Venezuela. These past bouts of energy nationalism are partly behind the reluctance of Exxon and other foreign investors to get back into the country.\nToday, Venezuela is considered still one of the riskiest countries for investors.\nToday, Venezuela is considered still one of the riskiest countries for investors. In 2021, the most recent year for which the Fraser Institute (a prominent Canadian thinktank) polled mining firms to rank the country\u2019s investment attractiveness, Venezuela came in 76th out of 84 nations. In 1970, it ranked near the top of the list of free economies. With Washington claiming influence over Venezuela\u2014holder of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves\u2014will investment risks decline to reasonable levels?\nCredible analysis finds that supply from Venezuela is likely to rise by roughly 500,000 barrels/day over the next year or two, likely through such companies as Chevron, Spain\u2019s Repsol, Italy\u2019s ENI, and France\u2019s Maurel & Prom, which have all applied for US authorization to export oil from the country. For context, that amount is about as much as is produced per day in the North Sea oilfields. Such an increase would push Venezuelan production to around 1.4 million barrels/day, almost as much as Nigeria.\nFurther gains\u2014beyond t"

                "body": "The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has a checkered relationship with American oil companies. In the 1970s, OPEC member states pushed the likes of Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP\u2014part of what has been dubbed Big Oil\u2014out of the developing world, seizing their concessions and handing them over to their own national oil companies. In the decades since, however, OPEC has quietly become a friend to Big Oil. OPEC has used its market power to keep prices high, making it profitable for North American and European companies to develop their own oil that was often expensive to produce, such as crudes lifted by deepwater rigs, fracked from shale, or melted from solid bitumen.\nFrom one perspective, the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, and its apparent capture of the oil sector of a founding member of OPEC, looks like a bid to reclaim Washington\u2019s lost influence over the global oil supply. Thus, the Trump administration\u2019s assault on climate action and cleaner substitutes such as electric vehicles and renewable energy may represent a complementary policy to sustain oil demand. While closer alignment between US and Venezuelan production may eventually undercut OPEC\u2019s market power, Trump\u2019s rollback of climate policy may ultimately reinforce global demand for oil in ways that the cartel is well placed to exploit.\nForeign Investors and Energy Nationalists\nIt is unlikely that the Trump administration\u2019s urging of international oil companies (IOCs) to restart investment in Venezuela will move the needle on supply much in the short term. In the longer term, however, US influence on Venezuelan oil suggests the potential for a larger American role in the global oil market. OPEC has yet to react publicly, although it is certainly paying close attention to any potential challenge to its dominant position.\nPresident Donald Trump has said that he aims to \u201ctake back\u201d control of natural resources that US firms lost to Venezuela in past decades. In 1976, the Venezuelan government cancelled the concessions of Exxon, Gulf, Mobil, Texaco, Chevron, and Arco seven years early, albeit with compensation. The 1976 nationalization was the culmination of taxation changes that started in 1958 (by some accounts earlier) and that saw the Venezuelan state tilt the terms ever more deeply in its favor. In further nationalizations between 2005 and 2007, ConocoPhillips and Exxon pulled out rather than acquiesce to the Venezuelan government\u2019s punitive changes in terms. Outstanding claims against Venezuela exceed $10 billion for ConocoPhillips and $1.5 billion for ExxonMobil. Other companies, notably Chevron, accepted the new terms and stayed, which is why Chevron is now in pole position to lead any recovery in Venezuela. These past bouts of energy nationalism are partly behind the reluctance of Exxon and other foreign investors to get back into the country.\nToday, Venezuela is considered still one of the riskiest countries for investors.\nToday, Venezuela is considered still one of the riskiest countries for investors. In 2021, the most recent year for which the Fraser Institute (a prominent Canadian thinktank) polled mining firms to rank the country\u2019s investment attractiveness, Venezuela came in 76th out of 84 nations. In 1970, it ranked near the top of the list of free economies. With Washington claiming influence over Venezuela\u2014holder of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves\u2014will investment risks decline to reasonable levels?\nCredible analysis finds that supply from Venezuela is likely to rise by roughly 500,000 barrels/day over the next year or two, likely through such companies as Chevron, Spain\u2019s Repsol, Italy\u2019s ENI, and France\u2019s Maurel & Prom, which have all applied for US authorization to export oil from the country. For context, that amount is about as much as is produced per day in the North Sea oilfields. Such an increase would push Venezuelan production to around 1.4 million barrels/day, almost as much as Nigeria.\nFurther gains\u2014beyond t"

The contract provides for the delivery of up to six million barrels of oil and is valid for one year.\nEarlier this week, refining and trade sources told Reuters that BPCL had awarded tenders to buy Iraqi and Omani crude on the spot market, as India\u2019s refiners are raising supply of crude from the Middle East to offset in part the volumes they lost from Russia following the U.S. sanctions.\nAll Indian refiners have said they would comply with the U.S. sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, and Russian supply to India has now plunged to a three-year low.\nAdditionally, BPCL is scouring the market for spot cargoes of Murban crude from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in a separate tender, according to Reuters\u2019 sources.\nOver the past weeks, India\u2019s refiners have significantly raised purchases of non-Russian oil supplies as they want to avoid angering the United States amid difficult India-U.S. trade negotiations.\nThe biggest state refiner, Indian Oil Corporation, is also said to have bought several crude oil cargos from Angola, Brazil, and the UAE to replace Russian barrels under sanctions.\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nTsvetana is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing for news outlets such as iNVEZZ and SeeNews."

                "body": "USD Breaks Down as USD/JPY Snaps Back: EUR/USD, GBP/USD\nUS Dollar Drops with Aggression\nWith just a few hours to go until the close the US Dollar is down by more than 1.6% on the week, which would mark the largest weekly sell-off for the currency since May, just before the swing-low was set on the first day of Q3.\nThe week opened with fear around heightened tariffs after President Trump ramped up tensions over last weekend and I had warned that something of this nature could show in last Friday\u2019s video. In the article last Friday, I had highlighted EUR/USD grinding at a big spot of support of 1.1592 but I still held preference for USD-weakness against the British Pound, which has broken out in a big way so far this week.\nThis is helped along by a larger pullback in USD/JPY, which is driving on the back of both fears of more rate hikes from the BoJ and the possibility of intervention at the 160.00 level as it seems the bank wants to set a line-in-the-sand for speculators. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that reversal is near but given the change of pace it is something that needs to be monitored in early trade next week.\nThat said \u2013 we\u2019re at the point now where we can see what USD bears are made of. It\u2019s simple to be bearish at highs or near resistance, but what ultimately will make the trend is whether bears can push while near support or lows, as lower-lows are necessary for downside continuation. And that\u2019s really been the missing piece for the past almost seven months now, after the sell-off in the Dollar stalled on the first day of Q3 and H2, 2025.\nUS Dollar Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nThe mirror image of that six months of stall following a clean trend last year is EUR/USD, which is now testing a breakout from a symmetrical triangle and bull pennant formation. The 1.2000 level looms large here as buyers shied away from a test of that level last September, again, right when the Fed cut rates. But there\u2019s also a lower-high from that at 1.1804 which is what I\u2019m looking at as next resistance, and given shorter-term structure, there\u2019s backdrop for trend continuation that I\u2019ll look at a little lower.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Shorter-Term\nAs I said in the Tuesday webinar my preference for USD-weakness remains GBP/USD and as a comparison, Cable is already at a fresh high which speaks to that. But \u2013 if we are going to see a legitimate trend build in the US Dollar it\u2019s the Euro that it will need some help from, as the single currency is a whopping 57.6% of the DXY basket.\nIf looking to work with the move, chasing this breakout test, particularly when so close to a prior lower-high, can be a challenge. Instead, there\u2019s a few levels of note for pullbacks that can at least allow for more cogent risk management on continuation scenarios.\nIn last Friday\u2019s article I looked at the 1.1592 level that was in-play at the time, and this was notable as it\u2019s a Fibonacci level related to the 1.1492 price that helped to set the lows back in November. Now \u2013 the 23.6% retracement from that same study plots at 1.1717, and this is an area for higher-low support potential. There are also longer-term Fibonacci levels at 1.1748 and 1.1686, along with the swing-low from yesterday at 1.1669.\nEUR/USD Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/USD\nI still prefer GBP/USD for USD-weakness scenarios and the way the pair has traded over the past couple of weeks keeps that alive. When USD-strength was running into the end of last week, GBP/USD was building a falling wedge formation. That began to breakout earlier this week, helped along by the initial dash of USD-weakness.\nI looked at an updated setup in the webinar on Tuesday, getting more detailed with the four-hour chart to show how the trend could be worked with after the initial breakout, and the 1.3414 Fibonacci level came in cleanly as support that"

                "body": "EU-US Strained Relations Impact\nEurozone flash PMIs displayed mixed results with services expanding. Manufacturing PMI showed some improvement but remained below the 50-mark, signalling contraction. US economic data supports a steady interest rate outlook from the Federal Reserve, with Q3 GDP revised upward and inflationary pressures noted in November.\nEUR/USD remains within specific Fibonacci retracement levels. The pair holds a mild positive momentum, with technical indicators hinting at a bullish tendency. Resistance is noted around the 1.1765 area, with targets set beyond this level.\nPolitical Sentiment Over Economic Fundamentals\nGiven the US dollar\u2019s weakness despite strong economic data, we believe the market is being driven more by political sentiment than by fundamentals. The current EUR/USD strength is a direct result of strained transatlantic relations, and this trend is likely to continue in the near term. Therefore, traders should be cautious about betting on a dollar rebound based on economic figures alone.\nThis geopolitical risk has pushed currency volatility to levels we haven\u2019t seen in some time. The Cboe EuroCurrency Volatility Index (EVZ), for instance, touched a 10-month high of 9.8 just last week, up from an average of 6.5 throughout the last quarter of 2025. This elevated volatility suggests that options strategies designed to profit from large price swings could be more effective than placing simple directional bets.\nThe policy divergence between the central banks is also becoming a key factor supporting the euro. While the Fed is holding steady, we recall European Central Bank officials in December 2025 hinting at a more aggressive stance on inflation, which the market interpreted as hawkish. This contrasts with the Fed\u2019s current wait-and-see approach, making the euro fundamentally more attractive.\nWe have seen this pattern before, particularly during the trade tariff disputes in 2024, when political headlines repeatedly overrode economic data releases. In such an environment, the dollar remained weak for extended periods even when US growth was outpacing Europe\u2019s. History suggests that until these political tensions with the EU are clearly resolved, the path of least resistance for the dollar is down.\nFor the coming weeks, we see value in buying EUR/USD call options to capitalize on further upside while limiting risk. Given the high volatility, strategies like a bull call spread could help reduce the upfront premium cost. A break above the key 1.1765 resistance level could trigger a quick move towards the 1.1800 handle.\nToday\u2019s upcoming US PMI data release will be a crucial test of this market dynamic. A stronger-than-expected reading might fail to lift the dollar if sentiment remains negative, confirming the political theme\u2019s dominance. However, a miss on the data could significantly accelerate the EUR/USD rally, as it would align weak data with the existing bearish dollar sentiment."

                "body": "The GBP/USD exchange rate surged past 1.3540 as UK Retail Sales and PMIs posted unexpectedly positive results. Retail Sales increased by 0.4% month-over-month in December, surpassing forecasts of a 0.1% decline, while annual sales rose from 1.8% to 2.5%, outperforming expected growth of 1%.\nBusiness activity in the UK showed marked improvement in January, with Services and Composite PMIs rising to 54.3 and 53.9, respectively. This bolstered the outlook for a less dovish stance from the Bank of England, affecting traders\u2019 expectations of interest rate cuts.\nConsumer Sentiment and Inflation in the US\nIn the United States, the final reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment for January climbed to a five-month high of 56.4, higher than anticipated. US inflation expectations dipped slightly, reflecting a one-year forecast of 4% and a five-year projection of 3.3%.\nA technical outlook for GBP/USD suggests potential further gains, with resistance at 1.3788 and support levels starting at 1.3452. The Bank of England\u2019s policy decisions, based on price stability and inflation, play a major role in the currency\u2019s value. Economic indicators like GDP and the trade balance also impact the Pound.\nBased on this positive UK economic data, we should anticipate the Bank of England will be less likely to cut interest rates soon. The surprise strength in retail sales and business activity reduces the pressure on them to ease monetary policy. Consequently, traders are now pricing in fewer rate cuts for this year, which is a bullish signal for the Pound.\nThis trend is further supported by the latest inflation figures we have seen from the Office for National Statistics. With the UK\u2019s core Consumer Price Index (CPI) still elevated at 3.9%, well above the BoE\u2019s 2% target, Governor Greene\u2019s concerns about wage growth seem justified. This persistent inflation gives the central bank more reason to keep rates higher for longer compared to its peers.\nUS Economic Outlook and Market Impact\nOn the other side of the pair, the US economy presents a more mixed picture, creating a clear policy divergence. While US consumer sentiment has improved, recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show a slight uptick in weekly jobless claims, hinting at a softening labor market. The CME FedWatch Tool indicates that markets are still aggressively pricing in over 100 basis points of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2026, a stance that weakens the US Dollar.\nFor derivatives traders, this suggests positioning for a continued rise in the GBP/USD exchange rate, especially if it can decisively break the 1.3600 level. Buying call options on GBP/USD or implementing bullish call spreads could be effective strategies to capitalize on this expected upward momentum. The key is the growing gap between a reluctant Bank of England and a Federal Reserve that is expected to start cutting rates.\nWe saw a similar dynamic unfold back in 2023 when expectations of faster BoE rate hikes relative to the Fed caused GBP/USD to rally significantly over several months. That historical pattern of policy divergence leading to Sterling strength appears to be re-emerging. Traders should watch the upcoming central bank meetings closely for any change in tone that could either accelerate or reverse this trend."

                "body": "The broad-based US dollar failed to stop its downward trend and remained under pressure on the day. As of now, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, is hovering near a two-week low of 98.26.\nHowever, the reason for its bearish bias could be attributed to multiple factors, including the resolution of Greenland-related disputes, mixed US labor data, and ongoing speculation surrounding the Federal Reserve\u2019s leadership and future policy direction.\nThe US Dollar initially gained some ground earlier in the week after a framework agreement on Greenland\u2019s future was reached between the United States and the European Union. During a meeting between US President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, both sides agreed on a framework addressing Greenland\u2019s entitlements. In addition, President Trump lifted the 10% tariffs on several EU countries and made it clear that the US would not try to take Greenland by force.\nTherefore, these developments helped ease geopolitical concerns and gave the dollar a short-term boost, but it later fell again as markets worried about the Fed\u2019s leadership and future policy plans.\nOn the data front, US labor market figures released by the Department of Labour also contributed to the mixed sentiment. Weekly initial jobless claims rose slightly to 200,000 for the week ending January 17, missing the initial estimate of 212,000 but marginally higher than the previous week\u2019s revised figure of 199,000. Meanwhile, the four-week moving average decreased by 3,750 to 201,500. Continuing jobless claims also fell by 26,000 to 1.849 million for the week ending January 10.\nTherefore, the mixed US labor data added uncertainty for traders, limiting the US dollar\u2019s gains, as slightly higher jobless claims and falling continuing claims signaled a stable but cautious economic outlook.\nThe US Dollar Index is trading around $98.45, attempting to stabilize after a sharp pullback from the $99.50 area. On the 2-hour chart, price recently tested a rising trendline near $98.25, where buyers stepped in, as shown by long lower candlestick wicks.\nThe structure has shifted into a short-term descending channel, while the broader uptrend remains intact above the trendline.

But the macro picture should favour a bit more dollar strength in the coming days, in our view.\u201d\nRisk appetite secured an initial boost on Wednesday following President Trump\u2019s comments that he would not use force to secure a deal on Greenland.\nSave on Your GBP/USD Transfer\nGet better rates and lower fees on your next international money transfer.\nCompare TorFX with top UK banks in seconds and see how much you could save.\nThere was a further boost to confidence after the European close after Trump stated that a deal on Greenland had been reached with NATO Secretary-General Rutte and that the threatened tariffs on eight European countries from February 1st would not go ahead.\nMarkets were concerned that US threats would trigger selling in US bonds and equities which would hurt the dollar. With the immediate threat easing, there was a rebound in the dollar.\nCommerzbank forex strategist Volkmar Baur commented; \"From a European perspective, it is too early to rejoice.\"\nHe added; \u201cHowever, the most likely outcome is still that the next wave of excitement will pass us by after a brief period of volatility and that the market will refocus on central banks and interest rate differentials.\"\nING considers that attention will turn towards the Federal Reserve policy decision next week.\nAccording to the bank; \u201cWe discussed last week how Powell's fierce response to the criminal investigation signalled upside risks to the dollar, as he and other members could have turned more hawkish in a meeting without any rate change to reinforce the independence message.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court also held a hearing on the US Administration case to dismiss Fed Governor Cook. The initial signs are that the court is not mindful to back Trump due to the threat to Fed independence.\nMUFG still sees dollar risks, but added; \u201cThe loss of confidence in US policymaking is likely to remain a headwind for the US dollar as we have seen at the start of this year. However, the risk of a sharper US dollar sell-off has diminished after President Trump\u2019s quick climb down over Greenland, and early indications from the Supreme Court overnight that they are likely to rule against President Trump\u2019s decision to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\u201d\nLike this piece?

The AUD/USD pair holds ground following the preliminary reading of Australia's S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which came in at 52.4 in January versus 51.6 prior. Services PMI climbed to 56.0 in January from the previous reading of 51.1, while the Composite PMI climbed to 55.5 in January versus 51.0 prior.\nThe strong PMI data reinforced the likelihood of a tighter monetary policy from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), supported by Thursday\u2019s Australian employment data. Employment Change, which arrived at 65.2K in December, swung from 28.7K job losses (revised from 21.3K job losses in November, compared with the consensus forecast of 30K. Meanwhile, the Unemployment Rate declined to 4.1% from 4.3% prior, against the market consensus of 4.4%.\nThe AUD/USD pair also strengthened as the US Dollar weakened on increased risk aversion, which could be attributed to US-Greenland tensions. However, the sentiment improves slightly after US President Donald Trump reversed his stance after reaching a framework agreement with NATO for a possible future deal on Greenland.\nUS Dollar weakens ahead of PMI data\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is holding ground and hovering around 98.30 at the time of writing. Traders await the preliminary reading of the US S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which will be released later on Friday.\n- The US Gross Domestic Product Annualized grew at 4.4% in the third quarter of 2025, slightly more than expected and the previous reading of 4.3%. Additionally, the Initial Jobless Claims came in at 200K last week, below the market consensus of 212K.\n- US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose to 2.8% year-over-year in November from 2.7% in October. On a monthly basis, the PCE Price Index rose by 0.2%. The annual core PCE Price Index, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) preferred gauge of inflation, rose by 2.8% in November, following the 2.7% increase recorded in October and matching the market expectation.\n- US President Donald Trump said he would step back from imposing tariffs on goods from European nations opposing his effort to take possession of Greenland. He said earlier there is \u201cno going back\u201d on his ambitions regarding Greenland, alongside earlier threats to impose new 10% tariffs on eight European Union (EU) countries.\n- President Trump also said that the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had \u201cformed the framework of a future deal regarding Greenland.\u201d However, he did not outline the parameters of the so-called framework, and it remained unclear what the agreement would entail.\n- Fed officials have signaled little urgency to ease policy further until there is clearer evidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% target. Morgan Stanley analysts revised their 2026 outlook, now forecasting one rate cut in June followed by another in September, compared with their previous expectation of cuts in January and April.\n- The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, announced on Tuesday that it would leave its Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) unchanged. The one-year and five-year LPRs were at 3.00% and 3.50%, respectively. It is essential to note that any changes in the Chinese economy could impact the Australian Dollar, as both countries are close trading partners.\n- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the RBA to remain cautious, highlighting that inflation has stay"

                "body": "USD/JPY forecast: Forex Friday | January 26, 2025\n- USD/JPY forecast: The yen struggles to benefit from a slightly hawkish BoJ as political and fiscal risks dominate agenda\n- Japan\u2019s bond market is becoming a growing source of pressure for JPY\n- Broader dollar weakness keeping USD/JPY pair steady - for now\nThe USD/JPY, and more noticeably other JPY pairs, have been quite strong in recent months, thanks the ongoing weakness in the yen. The USD/JPY is being pulled in opposite directions. On paper, the Bank of Japan is becoming more confident about growth and inflation, which should support the yen. In reality, political uncertainty and rising Japanese bond yields are undermining that narrative and keeping the USD/JPY forecast tilted to the upside. We may have seen some intervention from MoF post the BoJ meeting as the yen rallied after the initial drop. But the move has been quite contained and nothing\u2019s confirmed.\nBOJ leaves policy unchanged\nThe BoJ left rates unchanged at 0.75%, striking a slightly more hawkish tone by upgrading both growth and inflation forecasts, and one member dissented by call for a hike. Governor Kazuo Ueda acknowledged that underlying inflation continues to grind higher. That matters because it keeps the door open for further tightening later this year.\nThe USD/JPY saw two-way price movement on the announcement. It initially gained during Ueda\u2019s press conference, before tumbling on potential MoF activity. But the pair has since stabilised.\nMy base case is now a summer rate hike, although Ueda carefully avoided giving any strong forward guidance during his presser. He also declined to comment directly on the yen, focusing instead on inflation dynamics and how FX could influence price stability. In short, the BoJ looks more comfortable with the idea of higher rates, but it is still moving cautiously.\nPolitics and bonds are the real problem for JPY\nUnder normal circumstances, this BoJ meeting might have pushed USD/JPY lower. But Japan\u2019s political and fiscal situation is dominating market psychology.\nPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi has dissolved the lower house ahead of the 8 February election, injecting some uncertainty into an already fragile fiscal backdrop. If Takaichi secures a strong mandate, investors fear policies that could further strain Japan\u2019s public finances.\nThis concern is already visible in the bond market. The 40-year Japanese government bond yield this week surged to a record high, and overall JGB yields have seen their biggest swings since the original Trump trade war period. Although yields briefly eased, they are pushing higher again, and that is bad news for the yen.\nRising yields driven by fiscal risk are very different from rising yields driven by healthy growth. In this case, higher yields are being interpreted as a sign of deteriorating debt dynamics, which makes Japanese assets less attractive and puts pressure on JPY.\nAs long as this bond market story continues, it is difficult for the yen to benefit meaningfully from the BoJ\u2019s slow shift toward tighter policy.\nDollar under mild pressure\nFrom the dollar side, it has been an interesting week after all the tariff-related volatility. However, volatility has already cooled, and the dollar has remained largely on the back foot, especially against commodity and emerging market currencies. We have also seen record highs for precious metals, which underscore the ongoing \u201cdollar debasement\u201d trade. Here, fears of a more politically influenced Fed is pushing investors towards gold and silver.\nBut against currencies with weak fiscal positions, the dollar stands ready to benefit, including against the yen. Recently we have also seen some strength is US activity data which could still delay Fed rate cuts and give the dollar support against the lower yielding yen.\nUSD/JPY forecast: Near-term upside, medium-term risks\nPutting it all together, the USD/JPY forecast remains mildly bullish in the near term, mainly due to political risk in Japan, rising"

                "body": "USD/JPY Today, January 24: BOJ Hold and Intervention Risk Jolt Yen\nUSD/JPY is in focus today after the BOJ kept the policy rate at 0.75% and signaled a steady normalization path. Traders weigh yen intervention risk near the 160 level as a Japan snap election injects policy uncertainty. Volatility is high, with quick swings that challenge carry trades and corporate hedges. For Japan-based investors, the mix of central bank guidance, fiscal debate, and overseas rates sets the tone. We outline key risks, levels, and practical steps to manage exposure.\nWhat BOJ Hold Means for Yen and Rates\nThe BOJ\u2019s hold at 0.75% keeps gradual tightening in view, while higher growth guidance suggests confidence in the recovery. Markets read this as a slow path, not a pause in intent. USD/JPY stayed sensitive around the 160 area as traders tested policy tolerance. For local investors, the message is to expect two-way moves, with each data point feeding the pace of normalization.\nAuthorities have signaled vigilance when moves turn disorderly. Recent spikes highlight rate check chatter and the possibility of action if volatility worsens. Bloomberg reported the yen\u2019s biggest jump since August as intervention risk increased, underscoring headline sensitivity source. USD/JPY traders should respect liquidity pockets around Tokyo hours and the fix, where swings can accelerate.\nSnap Election and Policy Uncertainty\nA Japan snap election adds uncertainty on fiscal priorities, energy subsidies, and wage policy. Campaign pledges may shape growth and inflation expectations, which feed back into currency views. USD/JPY could whipsaw as investors handicap the size and timing of support packages. Watch whether parties emphasize cost-of-living relief or long-term capex, since that affects demand and external balances.\nPolicy risk can lift term premiums in JGBs, especially if investors expect larger deficits or faster demand. Higher long yields tighten local financial conditions, which can temper yen weakness. For USD/JPY, that means rallies may fade if JGB yields firm relative to U.S. peers. Keep an eye on auction results and investor demand from life insurers and pension funds.\nInvestor Playbook for Volatility\nExporters can ladder forwards and layer zero-cost collars to guard margins while keeping some upside. Importers can trim open USD payables, pre-hedge near known cash flows, and use call spreads to cap worst-case moves. Calibrate tenor to shipment cycles and invoice dates. For USD/JPY, set hedge ratios that reflect budget rates and the firm\u2019s real FX pass-through.\nCarry trades face gap risk near event headlines and thin liquidity. Use defined stop-losses, maintain option protection, and size positions for higher realized vol. Diversify funding legs to reduce single-currency shocks. For USD/JPY, monitor cross-asset signals like JGB swaps and U.S. front-end moves. Avoid adding into spikes; scale only after volatility cools.\nKey Levels, Data, and Catalysts to Watch\nRound numbers attract options interest and dealer hedging, which can drive sharp, temporary breaks. Spot tests near 160 matter for sentiment and official tolerance. Track intraday behavior around the Tokyo fix and option cut. USD/JPY momentum often flips when liquidity improves in London hours, so avoid chasing moves if spreads widen or depth thins.\nFocus on BOJ communication, Tokyo CPI, wage signals, and U.S. rate expectations. CNBC noted the BOJ kept rates at 0.75% and raised growth forecasts ahead of the election source. For USD/JPY, pair these with U.S. data and Fed guidance. Calendar planning helps align hedge roll dates with key releases to reduce slippage.\nFinal Thoughts\nUSD/JPY sits at the center of Japan\u2019s market story today. A BOJ hold at 0.75% with steady normalization, rising yen intervention risk near 160, and a snap election create a volatile mix. We suggest practical steps: set clear hedge ratios, ladder forward maturities, and use options to cap tail risk. Traders should respect liquid"

                "body": "Stock market today: S&P 500 slips to second-weekly loss as Intel-led slump weigh\nThe BOJ delivered a fully expected hold with a single dissent and only modest forecast tweaks. With markets unmoved, attention turns to Ueda, where post-meeting dovishness could still matter for USD/JPY.\n- BOJ held rates at 0.75% in an expected 8\u20131 decision\n- Takata dissented again, but no broader support followed\n- Inflation language firmed while risks were judged balanced\n- Markets now look to Ueda for direction in USD/JPY\nPolicy Rate Holds at 0.75%\nThe Bank of Japan held policy steady in January, voting 8\u20131 to keep the overnight call rate around 0.75%, a decision fully expected by markets and economists. Takata was the sole dissenter, arguing that the price stability target had largely been achieved and that risks to prices were skewed to the upside, but with no support from other board members, the outcome was not read as hawkish. That contrasts with November, when both Takata and Tamura dissented ahead of December\u2019s hike, a reminder that while broader dissent does not guarantee action, it is when the risk of a move starts to feel more live.\nInflation, Growth Forecasts Upgraded\nIn its updated forecasts, the bank left its core inflation projections for fiscal years 2025 and 2027 unchanged at 2.7% and 2% respectively, the latter consistent with its inflation mandate. The 2026 forecast was nudged up by a tenth to 1.9%. More notable adjustments were made to the alternative core measure that excludes fresh food and energy, with forecasts for 2025 and 2026 lifted by two tenths to 3% and 2.2% respectively. The 2027 projection was left unchanged at 2%, easing pressure to tighten policy aggressively by Japanese standards. The upward revisions to the nearer-term inflation outlook partly reflected firmer growth expectations, with real GDP forecasts for 2025 and 2026 raised by 0.2% and 0.3% to 0.9% and 1%, respectively.\nSource: BOJ\nAssessment Firms Post December Hike\nFollowing the decision to lift rates by 25bp to 0.75% in late December, there was a clear shift in tone in the latest Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices. On underlying inflation, the language was firmer than before. Previously, inflation was described as sluggish and closely tied to the pace of growth. That wording has gone. Now, underlying inflation is seen rising moderately, with wages and prices reinforcing each other, suggesting the bank is increasingly comfortable that inflation momentum can be sustained, even as policy continues to normalise.\nThe labour market narrative has also firmed relative to three months ago. Before the December hike, labour shortages were framed as something that would emerge later if growth improved. In the latest assessment, labour tightness is more clearly embedded in the inflation story, reinforcing the idea that wage pressures are no longer hypothetical and are starting to look more durable. That\u2019s important. On risks, the earlier assessment that growth risks were skewed to the downside has been dropped, replaced by a broadly balanced view for both activity and prices.\nOn the external backdrop, the tone is noticeably calmer. Trade and overseas policy risks are still acknowledged, but they are no longer framed as dominant headwinds. Overseas growth is treated as stabilising, which helps explain why the bank appears comfortable letting policy normalisation proceed at a gradual pace.\nMarkets Unmoved, Ueda Awaits\nSource: Bloomberg\nThere was little reaction in the swaps market to the decision, outlook or updated forecasts, with another 25bp increase essentially deemed a lock by June with a second fully priced by December. That path would see the overnight rate lifted to 1.25%.\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY was also relatively steady, holding onto earlier modest gains, while the JGB 2s10s curve continued to bull-flatten, fitting with the move seen in the run-up to the meeting. Attention now turns to Governor Ueda\u2019s press conference, scheduled to begin at 3:30 "

                "body": "USD/CAD drifts lower as Canadian Retail Sales surprise to the upside\n- USD/CAD extends its decline as strong Canadian Retail Sales and broad USD weakness lift the Loonie.\n- US Dollar remains pressured by policy uncertainty and Fed independence concerns.\n- Focus shifts to US PMI data, UoM sentiment and next week\u2019s BoC and Fed meetings.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) extends gains against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, supported by a broadly softer Greenback and stronger-than-expected Canadian Retail Sales data. At the time of writing, USD/CAD trades around 1.3767, marking a fifth consecutive daily decline.\nData released by Statistics Canada showed that Retail Sales rose 1.3% MoM in November, beating market expectations of 1.2% and rebounding sharply from October\u2019s 0.3% decline.\nRetail Sales excluding autos were even stronger, climbing 1.7% on the month, above forecasts of 1.2%, after falling 0.6% in October.\nThe rebound in retail activity supports the Bank of Canada\u2019s (BoC) wait-and-see approach after inflation data released earlier this week showed easing monthly price pressures, even as annual inflation remains sticky above the BoC\u2019s 2% target. On a yearly basis, CPI accelerated to 2.4% in December from 2.2% in November, while the BoC\u2019s core CPI measure eased slightly to 2.8% from 2.9%.\nMarkets widely expect the BoC to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.25% at next week\u2019s meeting. In its December policy statement, the BoC said that \u2018if inflation and economic activity evolve broadly in line with the October projection, Governing Council sees the current policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment.\u2019\nThe central bank also stressed that \u2018uncertainty remains elevated\u2019 and added that if the outlook shifts materially, it stands \u2018prepared to respond.\u2019\u201d\nSteady Oil prices add another layer of support to the Loonie, given Canada\u2019s status as a major energy exporter. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades around $61 per barrel, up nearly 2.7% on the day.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar remains under sustained pressure despite some easing in US-EU trade tensions, as President Trump\u2019s protectionist trade agenda and growing interference with the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) independence continue to weigh on investor sentiment.\nPreliminary S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data showed Manufacturing PMI rising to 51.9 in January from 51.8, below expectations of 52.1, while Services PMI came in at 52.5, unchanged from December but below the 52.8 forecast.\nLooking ahead, traders await the release of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey, along with inflation expectations data. Markets are also widely expecting the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged at its January 27-28 monetary policy meeting.\nBank of Canada FAQs\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC), based in Ottawa, is the institution that sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for Canada. It does so at eight scheduled meetings a year and ad hoc emergency meetings that are held as required. The BoC primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at between 1-3%. Its main tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Canadian Dollar (CAD) and vice versa. Other tools used include quantitative easing and tightening.\nIn extreme situations, the Bank of Canada can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the BoC prints Canadian Dollars for the purpose of buying assets \u2013 usually government or corporate bonds \u2013 from financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker CAD. QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The Bank of Canada used the measure during the Great Financial Crisis of 2009-11 when credit froze after banks lost faith in each other\u2019s ability to repay debts.\nQuantitative t"

It says any bounce could run into selling interest around 1.3806, 1.3875, and 1.3932. Macro-wise, RBC expects both the Fed and the Bank of Canada to hold rates next week, and thinks that\u2019s largely priced in \u2013 so it may take data, not policy headlines, to shift the pair. It also notes Canada\u2019s monthly GDP can be a noisy read on quarterly growth, even if a routine BoC..\nhold could still come with upgraded forecasts after recent revisions.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Quiet central banks can still move fx.\nIf the Fed and BoC both stand pat, traders may fall back on rate differentials and economic surprises. RBC argues markets may still be underpricing the risk of later-year BoC hikes, which would typically support Canadian yields and the loonie. That\u2019s why even \u201cno change\u201d meetings can matter \u2013 a shift in yield spreads can tug usd/cad around without any dramatic decision.\nZooming out: Cad risk is about growth as much as rates.\nRBC frames Canadian dollar moves as increasingly tied to global demand and trade flows, not just interest rates. A busy calendar \u2013 including Canadian jobs, trade, and GDP data, plus the Fed and other global central banks \u2013 could quickly change the growth narrative.

                "body": "USD/CAD is stabilising around 1.3790, despite recent losses, as Oil prices begin to recover. A rise in West Texas Intermediate Oil, trading near $59.60 per barrel, is supporting CAD, given Canada\u2019s role as a major oil exporter to the US.\nSaudi Aramco is curbing oversupply concerns by referencing strong demand in emerging markets. Global Oil consumption has reached record highs and is projected to grow through 2026, boosting the Canadian Dollar\u2019s prospects.\nGeopolitical Uncertainties Impact USD CAD\nThe US Dollar is under pressure amid geopolitical uncertainties, impacting USD/CAD. Tensions arise from President Trump\u2019s initial threats of tariffs against European nations opposing his plans, which eased after a potential deal with NATO.\nEconomic uncertainties continue due to unclear US-NATO agreements and European leverage on US assets. Meanwhile, US GDP rose to an annualised 4.4% in Q3 2025, surpassing expectations, while jobless claims reached 200,000, slightly above forecasts.\nThe Canadian Dollar is influenced by several key factors. Oil prices and Canada\u2019s economic health, determined by interest rates, inflation, and trade balance, significantly affect CAD value. A strong economy boosts CAD, encouraging foreign investment and interest rate adjustments by the Bank of Canada.\nGiven the current situation on January 23, 2026, we see the USD/CAD pair caught in a tug-of-war. The Canadian dollar is gaining strength from rebounding oil prices, while the US dollar is supported by robust economic data. This conflict suggests that range-trading or volatility-based strategies could be effective in the coming weeks.\nCanadian Dollar Versus Economic Indicators\nThe primary support for the Canadian dollar is the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, now trading near $59.60 a barrel. Historically, we have observed a strong negative correlation between USD/CAD and oil prices, often around -0.7, meaning as oil rises, the pair tends to fall. With Saudi Aramco signaling strong demand for 2026, further oil price gains could push USD/CAD below the 1.3700 level.\nOn the other hand, the US economy is showing remarkable strength, which should not be ignored. The 4.4% GDP growth reported for Q3 of 2025 and last week\u2019s low jobless claims of 200,000 point to a resilient economy that may keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates. This underlying economic strength provides a solid floor for the US dollar and could limit the downside for the USD/CAD pair.\nGeopolitical uncertainty surrounding the US-NATO agreement on Greenland adds another layer of complexity, currently weighing on the US dollar. We see this as a driver of short-term volatility, making outright directional bets risky. The market\u2019s reaction to the Danish pension fund divesting from US Treasuries shows how sensitive sentiment is to these developments.\nConsidering these conflicting signals, we believe derivatives that profit from increased price swings are attractive. Buying options straddles on USD/CAD, which involves purchasing both a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiry, could be a prudent way to trade the expected volatility. This strategy can be profitable if the pair makes a significant move in either direction before the options expire.\nFor traders with a directional bias, a cautious approach is best. Given the momentum in oil prices, we could consider entering modest short positions on USD/CAD, but hedging them by purchasing out-of-the-money call options. This protects against any sudden reversal driven by positive US economic surprises or a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions."

                "body": "GBP/JPY maintains its strength near 214.30, following the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to keep the interest rate steady at 0.75%. Japan\u2019s CPI ex. Fresh Food eased to 2.4% in December, aligning with forecasts.\nAs the currency trades close to its multi-year high, the Bank of Japan avoids rate adjustments and retains a path of gradual monetary policy expansion. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi plans to dissolve the lower house for a snap election.\nJapan\u2019s Inflation Trends\nJapan\u2019s December CPI recorded a year-on-year increase of 2.1%, down from November\u2019s 2.9%. The Pound remains steady as the UK anticipates the latest Retail Sales and S&P Global PMI data.\nDespite a predicted 0.1% decline in December Retail Sales, the Bank of England is expected to continue its gradual easing policy. The Japanese Yen has weakened due to policy differences with other major central banks.\nThe Bank of Japan had pursued a loose monetary policy from 2013 to boost the economy and inflation. This approach led to Yen\u2019s depreciation, but interest rates were raised in 2024 as inflation pressures rose.\nThe move away from an ultra-loose policy came as inflation surpassed the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target. Global energy price hikes and salary increases within Japan are influencing economic stability.\nImplications of Monetary Policies\nThe key takeaway for us is the widening policy gap between the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Bank of England (BoE). With the BoJ holding rates steady at 0.75% while the BoE is expected to pursue rate cuts, the fundamental case for a strong GBP/JPY remains intact. We should position for this trend to continue, targeting moves above the current 214.30 level.\nThe BoJ\u2019s decision to pause was widely anticipated, especially with core inflation easing to 2.4%. This seems to be a new holding pattern after the series of gradual rate hikes we saw through 2024 and 2025, which began with the historic end to negative interest rates. We believe the BoJ will wait for stronger wage growth signals, similar to the strong \u201cShunto\u201d wage negotiation results of 2024, before considering another hike.\nOn the other side, the Pound Sterling is weighed down by expectations of BoE easing. The anticipated third straight monthly decline in retail sales continues a trend of consumer weakness we have seen for years; UK retail sales volumes fell by a notable 2.4% over the whole of 2024. This persistent weakness gives the BoE a clear reason to begin cutting interest rates in the coming months, which should keep pressure on the pound relative to other currencies.\nGiven this divergence, buying call options on GBP/JPY with strikes around 215.00 seems like a prudent strategy for the next few weeks. The upcoming snap election in Japan, called by Prime Minister Takaichi, will introduce volatility, making options a better tool than an outright long position as our risk is clearly defined. This volatility could provide better entry points for our positions.\nWe must keep a close eye on the upcoming UK flash PMI data for January. If the numbers show unexpected resilience in the UK economy, it could force markets to reconsider the timing of BoE rate cuts and cause a sharp, if temporary, dip in the pair. However, as long as the broader theme of BoJ inaction and BoE easing holds, we see any pullbacks as buying opportunities."

The BoJ Governor also affirmed that the bank needs to assess the implications of previous rate hikes before tightening policy further. These coments however, failed to provide any significant support to the Yen.\nThe BoJ kept its benchmark interest rate on hold at 0.75%, as widely expected, after a 25-basis-point hike in December that brought rates to their highest level in 30 years.\nIn the UK, Retail Sales data from December beat expectations.

Today, cryptocurrency ETFs account for nearly $150 billion in assets with nearly half of that coming from the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT).\nBut if you're choosing to go with a Bitcoin ETF this year instead of buying Bitcoin directly through one of the exchanges, there are a couple of things you should know first.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?

But when you own it through an ETF, you get the trading rules that come with it.\nSpecifically, Bitcoin ETFs trade during normal market hours. They don't trade around the clock like spot Bitcoin does. If you're a frequent crypto trader, this might make a Bitcoin ETF less attractive.\nYou need to consider management fees and expenses\nVirtually every ETF comes with a fee known as an expense ratio. The Bitcoin ETFs do as well. The iShares Bitcoin ETF's expense ratio of 0.25% is below average within this category, but it's something that will reduce returns over time. For something that can easily move up or down 5% in a day, a 0.25% annual fee may seem negligible, but it's something to keep in mind.\nAdvertisement\nShould you buy stock in iShares Bitcoin Trust right now?\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Bitcoin Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and iShares Bitcoin Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

                "body": "The SEC waived its standard 30-day waiting period, allowing immediate implementation while retaining authority to suspend the change within 60 days\nBitcoin and Ethereum News\nNasdaq has filed a rule change with the Securities and Exchange Commission to remove limits on options tied to spot Bitcoin and Ethereum\nexchange-traded funds. The proposal lifts existing 25,000-contract limits on options linked to products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale, ARK/21Shares and VanEck.\nThe filing, submitted Jan. 7 and made effective Wednesday, aligns crypto ETF options with rules applied to other commodity-based funds. The SEC waived its standard 30-day waiting period, allowing immediate implementation while retaining authority to suspend the change within 60 days.\nOptions are financial contracts giving traders the right to buy or sell underlying assets at set prices before certain dates. Exchanges typically impose limits to reduce risks of excessive speculation, market manipulation, and concentrated positions that could amplify\nvolatility.\nNasdaq stated the change would treat digital assets in the same manner as all other options qualifying for listing. The exchange argued that the proposal eliminates unequal treatment without compromising investor protection.\nThe SEC opened a comment period on the proposal, with final determination expected by late February unless the rule is suspended for review. The filing builds on Nasdaq's late 2025 approval to list options on single-asset crypto ETFs as commodity-based trusts.\nThat earlier move allowed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF options to trade on the exchange, but left existing position and exercise limits in place. Nasdaq has been steadily expanding its role in crypto markets through various initiatives.\nIn November, Nasdaq filed a proposal to raise position limits on options tied to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust from 250,000 contracts to 1 million. The exchange cited growing demand and argued existing caps constrained hedging and trading strategies.\nNasdaq's head of\ndigital assets strategy, Matt Savarese, said in November that the exchange was prioritizing regulatory approval to offer tokenized versions of listed stocks. Savarese pledged to move quickly through the SEC's review process.\nNasdaq and CME Group announced plans in January to unify their crypto benchmarks, rebranding the Nasdaq Crypto Index as the Nasdaq-CME Crypto Index. The multi-asset index tracks major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Chainlink and Avalanche.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).

The bot then \u201cfrontrun\u201d the hack, with proceeds split between the bot and a RocketPool validator.\nMakina\u2019s Deployer address reached out to both the bot and the validator via on-chain message, requesting the return of stolen funds, which total around 1,300 ether (ETH).\nLuckily, the majority of funds have since been recovered. Makina announced that the bot\u2019s operator returned \u201c920 ETH of the 1,023 ETH received by the MEV builder,\u201d keeping a 10% bounty.\nThey hope the validator will follow suit and ask for help in establishing contact.\nThe third hack came the following day. Saga announced it had paused its Saga EVM \u201cchainlet\u201d in response to a $7 million hack. The attack resulted in a 25% depeg of Saga-based stablecoin D.\nAn update confirmed the network remained paused. It also refers to a \u201ccoordinated sequence of contract deployments, cross-chain activity, and subsequent liquidity withdrawals,\u201d but the exact cause of the loss has not been disclosed.\nOn-chain activity\nOn-chain data shows Ethereum transactions at an all-time high. One might think this is good news for the ecosystem, but the reality isn\u2019t quite that simple.\nResearch from Andrey Sergeenkov details how cheaper transactions ushered in by the protocol\u2019s Fusaka upgrade in December have led to a rise in weekly new addresses, up to 170% of the 2025 average.\nOf the addresses identified by Sergeenkov, he notes \u201c$740,000 has been stolen this way from 116 victims.\u201d\nWhile the attack vector may be somewhat rudimentary, significant losses are not uncommon.\nIn December one unlucky user lost $50 million to a similar scheme, though this loss isn\u2019t included in Sergeenkov\u2019s data.\nAs transaction volume balloons, one can expect plenty more victims to come.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, late-2023\u2019s much-hyped Blast (\u201cbacked by Paradigm\u201d) is struggling to retain usership.\nOne eagle-eyed \u201cct observer\u201d noted its 24-hour fee revenue was listed as -$7 on data dashboard DeFiLlama.\nAt the time of writing, the figure was -$8. DeFiLlama\u2019s pseudonymous founder 0xnmgi explained that this results from Blast paying more for settlement on Ethereum than it receives in users\u2019 gas fees.\nThe layer 2 peaked at a staggering $2.5 billion of total value locked despite concerns over centralization and its pyramidal points program.\nGovernance games\nThe Trump-family-linked World Liberty Financial has raised eyebrows once again.\nPopular DeFi trader DefiSquared highlighted a recent \u201calarming governance vote\u201d to use unlocked WLFI tokens to grow the stablecoin USD1.\nThe vote took place over the new year. It was, DefiSquared says, allegedly dominated by insider wallets and amounts to \u201csell[ing] WLFI tokens at the expense of locked holders, in order to fund protocol revenue that goes only to themselves.\u201d\nEarlier this month, World Liberty announced the launch of lending platform World Liberty Markets. The protocol will be \u201cpowered by Dolomite,\u201d despite the DAO voting to launch an Aave instance, just over a year ago.\nPerps \u201cDEX\u201d Paradex announced a roll back of its layer-two chain, leaving the platform \u201coffline for approximately six hours.\u201d\nThe move was in response to an error which reportedly caused the price of bitcoin to crash to $0, liquidating traders on the exchan"

                "body": "Dow Jones Index forms an alarming pattern ahead of Magnificent 7 earnings\nThe Dow Jones Index remained in a tight range near its all-time high of $49,705 as traders waited for the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of the year and the Magnificent 7 earnings.\n- The Dow Jones Index has formed a rising wedge pattern on the daily chart\n- The Federal Reserve will deliver its first interest rate decision of the year on Wednesday.\n- Many companies, including those in the Magnificent 7, will publish their numbers.\nThe Dow Jones, which tracks 30 top blue-chip companies, was trading at $49,160, up by 35% from its lowest level in 2025, but down 0.6% for the week.\nThe index will likely experience high volatility next week as the Federal Reserve delivers its first interest rate decision of the year. Economists polled by Reuters expect the bank to leave interest rates unchanged between 3.5% and 3.75%.\nThis interest rate decision will provide more information about what to expect in the next meetings since officials have received more data after the last meeting in December. A report released this week showed that the US GDP expanded by 4.4% in the third quarter, higher than the previous estimate of 4.3%.\nMore data released this month showed that the headline Consumer Price Index rose to 2.6% in December, while core CPI was at 2.7%. Another report showed that the unemployment rate improved to 4.4% in December.\nThe Dow Jones Index will also react to key corporate earnings from the so-called Magnificent 7: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.\nAll these companies, valued at over $16 trillion, will be watched closely. After all, they are the biggest spenders in the artificial intelligence industry, which has helped to push the stock market to a record high. Strong financial results will likely push the index higher.\nThe other top Dow Jones constituents that will report earnings are Caterpillar, Boeing, UnitedHealth, Chevron, and IBM.\nDow Jones Index technical analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the Dow Jones Index has remained in a tight range in the past few weeks. A closer look shows that the index has formed a rising wedge pattern, with the two lines nearing their confluence.\nThe index has also formed a bearish divergence pattern, as the Relative Strength Index and the MACD have continued to fall over the past few months.\nTherefore, the index will likely retreat, potentially to the psychological level at $48,000 and then rebound. This aligns with Tom Lee\u2019s recent prediction. The Bitmine chair expects the stock market to drop by between 10% and 20% before rebounding.\nBroader look\nU.S. stocks were mixed Friday as the Nasdaq rose 0.3%, extending gains on easing geopolitical fears, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.1% and the Dow fell 0.8%, dragged down by a 3% drop in Goldman Sachs.\nMarkets rebounded earlier in the week after President Trump walked back threatened tariffs on eight European nations and signaled progress toward a framework deal involving Greenland, fueling what investors dubbed the \u201cTACO\u201d trade \u2014 a belief that aggressive rhetoric may give way to negotiation.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq are on track for a second straight weekly decline."

                "body": "The overall US stock market tried to rally early during the Friday session, but seems a little stuck at the moment as most traders will begin to focus on the earnings calls ahead.\nThe Nasdaq 100 tried to rally early during the Friday session, but seems a little stuck at the moment as there are some laggards out there causing a bit of a problem. That being said, I don\u2019t necessarily think that one is looking to start shorting this market. I think you\u2019ve got a situation where we probably just stay stuck in this overall range.\nSome tech is starting to drag the index down a little bit overall, not just in the Nasdaq 100 but also other indices, but really nothing of consequence. I think we\u2019re just biding our time at the moment.\nThe Dow Jones 30 is pulling back towards the 49,000 level. That\u2019s a large, round, psychologically significant figure, but I think we could drop even further than that. Perhaps we will test the 50-day EMA, which would just be more of the same action. I still believe that the Dow Jones 30 will find its way to the 50,000 level over the next several weeks.\nReally, all we need is a catalyst. And that catalyst comes in the form of earnings. We are getting into the meat of the earnings season. Somebody somewhere will do something to push this market to the upside, would be my suspicion.\nThe S&P 500, of course, looks quite a bit like the Nasdaq 100, as they are essentially the same index with a handful of companies running everything. Nonetheless, this is an interesting index because it is resilient due to the fact that traders will rotate into defensive stocks, which is kind of what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of days.\nThat being said, as we head into earnings season, that will be a major driver here as well. The 6,800 level seems to be a floor in the market. The 7,000 level seems to be a major psychological barrier, which I do think gets broken eventually, but in the short term may contain gains. There are a lot of concerns out there about trade disputes, which seem to be a never-ending situation here, but ultimately the US economy is still running fairly strong, and that will eventually show itself here.\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about chart patterns and how to trade them, please visit our educational area.\nChris is a proprietary trader with more than 20 years of experience across various markets, including currencies, indices and commodities.

Hunter | Jan 23, 2026 08:52\nThe relief rally continued cautiously as the immediate Greenland threat receded but tensions remained high between the interested parties at Davos.\nThe EU showed signs of increasing resistance to the whims of the White House, promising to defend itself \u201cagainst any form of coercion\u201d although also leaving the door ajar to the resumption of the trade deal which had been suspended. It remains to be seen whether this shot across the bows lands with the President over the coming months.\nMeanwhile, the domestic economy received some promising news, which was another factor in a positive day for the main indices. GDP growth and consumer spending came in higher than expected, jobless claims fell, and inflation was in line with estimates. This removes any immediate fears of a slowdown in the US economy, although by the same token it reduces the likelihood further of any corrective action from the Federal Reserve on interest rates.\nThe slight spike in shares took the Dow Jones into positive territory for the week and the index is now up by 2.7% this year. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are marginally down this week, but ahead by 1% and 0.8% respectively in the year to date. At the same time, the Russell 2000 remains the subject of most attention, with a further gain of 2% propelling the smaller cap index to another record close.\nThe FTSE 100 edged higher at the open in slightly unconvincing fashion. The continuing strength of the gold price serves as a reminder that investors remain selectively skittish, although its further gains underpinned Endeavour Mining shares once more. Elsewhere, there was some buying interest in some more defensive (as well as defence) stocks, consolidating a 2.4% gain for the premier index in the year to date.\nElsewhere, a surprise rise in retail sales over December and an improvement in a consumer confidence survey weighed on the more domestically focused FTSE 250 as it further reduced the likelihood of any immediate stimulus from the Bank of England. By the same token, the economy\u2019s resilience as seen in recent data releases, along with the increasing attraction of the UK as an investment destination, has enabled a rise of 3.8% for the index so far in January.\nBabcock (LON:BAB) delivered a topical trading update which underlined the reasons why the defence sector has been at the heart of investor interest over recent times.\nQuite apart from being a major contractor for the UK government, the group has interests across many jurisdictions within its numerous business units. Babcock revealed that its strong momentum from the first half continued into the third quarter, with some significant strategic developments which included, but were not limited to, being selected as the prime industrial partner in Indonesia\u2019s \u00a34 billion Maritime Partnership Programme and agreeing to two further Arrowhead 140 licences.\nBy unit, Nuclear growth continued with the business extended its partnership in the US Virginia Class submarine build, Aviation and Maritime were also strong, more than offsetting any weakness in the Land division given lower Rail activity. Meanwhile the \u00a3200 million share buyback programme is ongoing and, in terms of outlook, the group reiterated its guidance given that the vast majority of forecast revenue for the year was now contracted, and confirmed that it was likely to meet its stretching 8% margin target.\nExpectations for prospects have been on a march, which has weighed on the opening reaction to the update, but for the most part the likes of Babcock have lived up to their billing. The shares have risen by 193% over the last year, as compared to a gain of 19% for the wider FTSE 100, and by 385% over the last three years. Despite this meteoric rise, investor appetite is undiminished given the global backdrop and the market consensus of the shares as a strong buy is unlikely to waver any time soon.\n.\nTrading in financial instruments and/or cryptocurrencies involves high r"

                "body": "The FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 are still soaring, but the UK is still a great place to buy cheap shares. Some quality names have actually fallen in price, providing scope for a potential share price rebound in 2026.\nI\u2019ve done some research to dig out stocks with the best chances of a recovery this year. My work shows that City analysts think their share prices will double in value or more during the next 12 months.\nI too am optimistic these cheap stocks could rebound. Want to know why I think they\u2019re worth considering right now?\nGamma Communications\nGamma Communications (LSE:GAMA) helps companies switch to cloud-based systems, allowing them to modernise how they handle voice, video and messaging communications. It\u2019s a hot growth area, but one that\u2019s currently underperforming amid tough economic conditions.\nYet analysts remain overwhelmingly positive on the stock. Of the eight studying the FTSE 250 firm, seven consider it a Strong Buy, with the remaining one rating it a Buy.\nEven the least optimistic of this grouping\u2019s predicting a sharp price rebound over the next 12 months. They\u2019re tipping a 21% rise, to \u00a310.80. The most bullish number cruncher, meanwhile, is expecting Gamma shares to reach \u00a318.20, a whopping 104% uplift.\nHelped by falling interest rates, demand for its services might rebound strongly as businesses boost IT-related investment. Gamma will also benefit approaching the shutdown of all copper-based phone services in the UK next January.\nCard Factory\nCard Factory\u2018s (LSE:CARD) another FTSE 250 company trending lower over the last year. Not even its focus on the value end of the greetings market has protected its share price. But could it be about to turn higher?\nSeven brokers currently have ratings on the retailer. And their views on the company are largely positive \u2014 five class it as a Strong Buy, with two giving it a Hold rating.\nThis is reflected in their price forecasts for Card Factory shares. One analyst thinks the price will reach 170p during the next year, up 153% from today. Even the least bullish forecasts predicts a healthy 12% increase, to 75p.\nA prolonged downturn in the UK economy could hinder any such price recovery. But aided by recent international expansion, I think Card Factory could bounce back strongly this year.\nJD Sports Fashion\nJD Sport Fashion (LSE:JD.) is another casualty of tough market conditions. In particular, it\u2019s struggled to tackle weak consumer spending in its major US region. Fierce competition on main street and online haven\u2019t helped it either.\nCity analysts aren\u2019t overwhelmingly positive in their view of the FTSE 100 share. But opinions are undeniably more positive than negative. Out of 17 rating the stock, seven consider it a Strong Buy or Buy. The remainder have a Hold rating, with not a single one giving it a Sell.\nThe most optimistic JD share price target is 200p, up 146% from today. The most pessimistic is 85p, suggesting a 5% increase.\nI think there\u2019s a good chance of a robust rebound as analysts expect. Conditions are improving in North America \u2014 this week it reported \u201cimproved\u201d like-for-like sales there. And the broader athleisure fashion segment is tipped for further broad growth."

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic tug-of-war mode \u2013 not a euphoric melt-up, not a brutal crash, but a tense, emotional battlefield between cautious dip-buyers and macro-worried bears. Price action is defined by choppy swings, sharp intraday reversals, and constant fakeouts around key zones. That is exactly the kind of environment where disciplined traders can shine while FOMO chasers get punished.\nInstead of a clean straight-line rally, the German benchmark is showing a nervous, stop-hunt-heavy structure: quick pops on positive headlines, followed by fast profit-taking whenever economic doubts or central bank anxiety resurface. This is not weak; it is what a market looks like when big money is repositioning under the surface and nobody wants to admit yet whether we are closer to a fresh bull phase or a deeper correction.\nThe Story: To understand the current DAX mood, you have to zoom out from the candles and look at the European macro mix: ECB policy, German industry, energy prices, the euro versus the dollar, and global risk appetite.\n1. ECB and interest-rate nerves\nThe European Central Bank remains the main puppet master. Inflation in the eurozone has cooled compared to the extreme spikes of the previous years, but it is still sticky enough to keep the ECB in a cautious stance. Markets are constantly trying to front-run future rate cuts: whenever investors sense that the ECB might pivot to a more dovish tone, European equities, including the DAX, see a wave of risk-on buying. But any signal that the ECB could stay restrictive for longer quickly flips the script back to risk-off.\nThat push\u2013pull dynamic is feeding into German blue chips that are highly sensitive to financing conditions, from industrial giants to real estate-exposed names. Cheaper money would be rocket fuel for growth and cyclicals, but a longer spell of tight policy keeps a lid on valuations and encourages investors to stay selective rather than all-in.\n2. German economy: industrial powerhouse under pressure\nGermany\u2019s core story is still industrial production, exports, and the auto sector. But the narrative has shifted from unstoppable powerhouse to fragile champion. Manufacturing data has been sending mixed signals: some stabilisation in orders, but no clear breakout in momentum. The market is stuck between fears of a prolonged industrial slowdown and hopes that the worst of the energy and demand shock is already behind us.\nThe German auto heavyweights \u2013 the classic backbone of the DAX \u2013 are in the spotlight. They are fighting on multiple fronts: competition from US and Asian EV players, tightening emissions rules, and a shifting global demand map. When headlines are positive (for example, strong order books, better margins, or resilient guidance), the DAX gets a lift. When there are warnings about demand in China or cost pressure, the index feels the hit immediately.\n3. Energy prices and Germany\u2019s cost base\nEurope\u2019s energy drama is no longer at full crisis mode, but it is far from irrelevant. Natural gas and electricity prices remain a structural concern for Germany\u2019s energy-intensive industries: chemicals, metals, and manufacturing. Even if spot prices are calmer, companies are still adjusting to the reality of higher average costs than in the pre-crisis era. That bites into margins and caps how aggressively investors are willing to rerate these stocks.\nEvery time energy prices calm down or supply looks secure, you see renewed interest in cyclicals and industrials. Any hint of energy tension or geopolitical risk, and the DAX feels the weight again. This is why traders mus"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is sitting in a crucial decision zone, caught between cautious optimism and underlying macro stress. Instead of a clean, trending move, we are seeing a tense mix of choppy sessions, sudden spikes, and fast profit taking. German blue chips have shaken off some of the darkest recession fears, but nobody is fully relaxing. This is classic late-cycle behaviour: rallies that look powerful on the surface but are built on a very fragile foundation of central bank hope and global liquidity.\nOn the surface, European indices are trying to push higher, with the DAX hovering around a region that traders recognise as a major battleground for bulls and bears. The market is not collapsing, but it is not mooning either. Think grinding climb with traps on both sides: late buyers risk getting shaken out, early shorts risk getting squeezed hard. Volatility is hiding under the calm, and that is exactly what short-term traders want.\nThe Story: To understand what is really driving the DAX right now, you have to zoom out to the European and global macro picture.\n1. ECB vs Inflation vs Growth\nThe European Central Bank is stuck in a classic policy dilemma. Inflation has cooled compared to its peak, but it is not fully tamed, while growth in Germany and the wider Eurozone remains weak. That means every ECB meeting and every speech from ECB officials is a volatility event for the DAX.\nMarkets are trying to price in the timing and depth of potential rate cuts. Too fast and the ECB risks reigniting inflation. Too slow and they risk strangling already fragile industrial activity. The current narrative from CNBC Europe and other outlets is all about this balancing act: can the ECB pivot to a more growth-friendly stance without destroying their inflation-fighting credibility?\nFor the DAX, that tension is everything. Lower rates would support valuations for exporters, autos, and growth names. But if the ECB sounds too hawkish, you will see immediate pressure on high-beta DAX components and cyclical sectors. Traders are basically front-running central bank language day by day.\n2. German Economy: From \"Sick Man of Europe\" to Quiet Stabilisation?\nGermany has been battling a cocktail of negative drivers: high energy costs, weaker global demand, structural issues in autos and manufacturing, and uncertainty around China. The recession narrative dominated headlines, and at one point sentiment around German assets was outright toxic.\nLately, the tone has shifted from pure doom to cautious stabilisation. Manufacturing data is no longer collapsing; it is more in a fragile sideways pattern. That is not bullish in a classic sense, but it is less bad than feared. And in markets, \"less bad\" after extreme pessimism often equals a powerful relief rally.\nGerman autos and industrials remain under intense scrutiny. Any positive surprise in order books, export data, or guidance from names like VW, BMW, Siemens, or the big chemical players can quickly flip sentiment. When those sectors show even a hint of recovery, DAX bulls tend to step in aggressively, betting that the worst is behind us.\n3. Euro vs Dollar, Energy, and Global Risk Mood\nThe DAX is not just a German story; it is a global risk asset that reacts to the US dollar, commodity prices, and Wall Street sentiment.\n- Euro vs Dollar: A softer euro is generally supportive for DAX exporters, making German products cheaper abroad and boosting earnings translated back into euros. A stronger euro, driven by expectations of a more hawkish ECB relative to the Fed, can weigh on export-heavy sectors and cap ind"

At the same time, major tech firms have leaned more heavily into debt issuance to fund the infrastructure race. This matters for earnings because the market\u2019s attention is moving from \u201cwho spends the most\u201d to \u201cwho can sustain the spend without eroding free cash flow,\u201d especially if AI monetization takes longer than expected.\nThat financing story runs straight into the second constraint: power. Datacenter development is increasingly bottlenecked by grid interconnections, equipment lead times, and local permitting. In some markets, datacenters face multi-year grid connection delays, and energy dynamics are already becoming a political and economic story in their own right. In practical terms, this makes AI capacity a more delicate operational issue than the market may assume, particularly for the largest cloud platforms.\nThis is where Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta will be pressed most directly. Azure in particular is under a microscope, with traders hyper-focused on whether growth is decelerating and how much of that is demand versus capacity. Amazon has signaled that capex is likely to remain elevated into 2026 as it expands cloud capacity, and that\u2019s the type of forward guidance that can swing sentiment sharply depending on how confident management sounds about payback. For Meta, the advertising engine remains healthy (more below), but the company has openly framed 2026 as another year of heavy AI infrastructure investment, which keeps the \u201cROI debate\u201d front and center.\n- Digital Advertising\nWhile AI infrastructure dominates the top of the agenda, digital advertising is quietly setting up as the second major swing factor. According to Dentsu, global ad spending is expected to rise 5.1% and surpass $1 trillion in 2026 for the first time, with algorithm-driven advertising comprising roughly 71.6% of total spend.\nThat\u2019s supportive for Alphabet and Meta broadly, but the details will matter. Meta, for example, has emphasized the scale of short-form consumption and monetization progress, but it will also need to justify the investment surge supporting ad delivery systems. Amazon\u2019s ad business remains the wild card and could again be the biggest advertising story inside the Mag 7 if spending holds up.\n- Enterprise & AI Spending vs. Consumer Softness\nA third theme is the omnipresent \u201ctwo-speed economy,\u201d with the dividing line between AI-accelerated enterprise demand versus discretionary hardware and autos.\nApple may have a difficult time spinning a strong narrative this quarter because the market is weighing strong iPho"

                "body": "The Dangers That Scientists Found Inside L.A.\u2019s Smoky Homes\nThe first studies of last year\u2019s fires have revealed some unexpected hazards of urban mega-fires.\nAfter just a year, the fires that spread around Los Angeles are already the most studied urban wildfires in history. While the Palisades Fire lapped at the edge of UCLA, the Eaton Fire, on the east side of town, came dangerously close to Caltech. Even as the fires were spreading, these research powerhouses, as well as the University of Southern California, deployed sensors, scientists, and new hypotheses. Researchers around the city began collecting water, soil, and air samples; physicians started to recruit participants into long-term health studies.\nEven as the researchers absorbed the reality of the damage across an area that included 20 million residents, they understood that this was a chance, one that might never exist again, to better understand the nature of these types of disasters. These particular fires offered researchers opportunities to collect samples in ways they hadn\u2019t before been able to\u2014\u201cso close to the fire and so timely,\u201d Yifang Zhu, an environmental scientist at UCLA, told me.\nSome of these efforts will take years to become fully fleshed out. The Los Angeles Fire Human Exposure and Long-Term Health Study, for instance, is a multi-institution, 10-year effort to better understand the short- and long-term health impacts of the fires. A year after the fires, though, researchers have some early answers to what happens to mental and physical health after wildfires move from trees and shrubs to homes and buildings.\nNot all fires are the same, and although these fires started in the hills with scrub brush, they ended up in urban areas, flaming through more than 18,000 structures. \u201cIt\u2019s a new type of fire, because it\u2019s an urban conflagration,\u201d David Eisenman, a researcher at UCLA who has spent the past 25 years studying the impact of disasters on mental and physical health, told me. These fires may start in areas where wildland and urban settlements edge up against one another, but as they spread, they \u201cmostly consume, by volume, man\u2011made products in megacities\u2014that\u2019s a real difference.\u201d Researchers have long studied what goes into the air when trees burn in a fire, but when the fuel is homes, cars, and businesses\u2014the stuff of people\u2019s lives\u2014what ends up in the air is largely unknown. The many chemicals, including asbestos and lead, in our homes can form a toxic soup. The combustion process can also create new hazards; scientists were surprised to find airborne nanoparticles of hexavalent chromium, the contaminant made famous by the movie Erin Brockovich, hanging around cleanup sites.\nOne surprise lesson was that the fire risk didn\u2019t end once the smoke had dissipated. Levels of benzene spiked, then came down after about a week. But even after the outdoor air began to clear, measures of hazardous chemicals in indoor air showed signals from fire-related compounds that had infiltrated people\u2019s homes and kept off\u2011gassing. While people were looking to the smoke and fire as the danger, scientists were seeing real risk lurking inside homes, as people hunkered down. \u201cThe outdoor air became cleaner, but the indoor levels went up,\u201d Zhu said.\nSmoke has been linked to increased respiratory and heart problems, so researchers were already on high alert for some issues. Still, they dug into emergency-room data from the weeks after the fire started without any assumptions about what they might find. When researchers combed through emergency diagnoses at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for people living in fire-affected zip codes, then compared those numbers with the same period across the previous seven years, they found that respiratory illness spiked by 24 percent. They also observed a 46 percent increase in heart-attack rates. (Fine particulates from smoke can trigger inflammation and disrupt heart rhythms.) Although researchers expected to see some of these effects, the scal"

Trump accused JPMorgan Chase of closing his accounts for political reasons after he left office in 2021.\nTreasury yields held relatively steady, suggesting foreign investors weren\u2019t rushing out of the U.S. bond market.\nYields got some support from reports on the U.S. economy\u2019s strength that came in better than expected. One said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected in a potential signal that the pace of layoffs remains low. A second suggested the U.S. economy grew at a faster rate during the summer than the government initially estimated.\nA third said that inflation in November was close to economists\u2019 expectations, while spending by U.S. consumers was a touch better than expected.\nGlobal markets have calmed following an easing of long-term Japanese government bonds, which had spiked early in the week on worries that Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi might make moves that would add heavily to the government\u2019s already big debt.\nThe 40-year Japanese government bond yield slipped back after hitting a record of more than 4%. It was trading at 3.0955% early Friday.\nIn other dealings early Friday, the price of gold rose 0.8%, remaining close to the $5,000 level. Silver gained 2.3%. Prices of such precious metals often rise when investors are looking for something safer to own.\nU.S. benchmark crude oil added 52 cents to $59.88 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, was up 54 cents at $64.60 per barrel.\nThe euro slipped to $1.1750 from $1.1755.\n___\nAP Business Writers Stan Choe, Matt Ott and Yuri Kageyama contributed."

                "body": "Japan Stocks Today, January 24: BOJ Hold Lifts Banks; Nikkei Extends Rally\nNikkei today extended its rally after the Bank of Japan kept the policy rate at 0.75% by an 8\u20131 vote and upgraded its outlook. Banks outperformed on higher yields, while chip names were mixed after Intel\u2019s weak guide. The BOJ press conference with Governor Ueda is the key risk event, as traders seek clues on the yen and the pace of future hikes. With a busy earnings calendar ahead, the BOJ rate decision shapes near-term sector leadership in Japan.\nBOJ hold and upgraded outlook: what it means now\nThe BOJ held the short-term policy rate at 0.75% with an 8\u20131 vote, signaling a steady hand after recent tightening. The BOJ rate decision keeps financial conditions supportive while acknowledging progress toward its price goal. Markets now price a slower path of hikes, pending the BOJ press conference. Stocks reacted with gains led by rate-sensitive groups, while traders watched JGB yields and the yen for confirmation.\nPolicymakers upgraded their outlook, pointing to sustained inflation near target and firm wage trends. This supports a gradual normalization but not a rapid series of hikes. Any hint of tolerance for higher 10-year yields could lift bank net interest margins. We will watch the BOJ press conference for signals on balance sheet plans and how officials weigh growth risks against sticky services inflation.\nSector moves: banks lead, chips mixed\nMegabanks and insurers outperformed as curve steepening improves lending spreads and investment income. Domestic loan growth and lower deposit beta add support. If long yields rise modestly, value factors can stay in favor. Traders also cited a calmer tone into the BOJ press conference, which reduced volatility hedges. Cash-rich banks with conservative payout policies remain in focus for dividend investors in Japan.\nChip-related names were mixed after Intel\u2019s weak guide, while index heavyweights helped the benchmark advance. Contribution data showed testing and pharma strength aiding the close, reflecting stock-specific flows rather than a broad tech surge. See the day\u2019s contribution snapshot from Yahoo! Finance Japan. Exporters tracked the yen, with investors weighing BOJ tone against global demand for electronics.\nYen watch and what to listen for from Ueda\nA firmer yen typically pressures exporters but supports domestic demand and small caps via lower import costs. A softer yen helps overseas earners and tourism plays. The BOJ press conference can shift FX-sensitive flows within minutes. We focus on references to the neutral rate, wage settlements, and tolerance for higher term yields, all of which set the near-term path for Nikkei today sector leadership.\nFirst, wording on inflation persistence and services prices. Second, guidance on the pace and scale of future hikes or balance sheet runoff. Third, any comment on FX spillovers. Even small changes in phrasing can move USD/JPY. As Reuters noted, traders stayed cautious ahead of remarks, keeping dry powder for post-press moves.\nEarnings calendar and trading playbook\nA busy results slate this week will test the rally. Banks could guide on net interest margins and buybacks. Exporters will detail currency assumptions and orders. Chip names face scrutiny on capex and AI server demand after Intel. The BOJ press conference sets the macro backdrop, but earnings will decide stock selection, especially where guidance and dividend policies surprise.\nConsider barbell exposure: megabanks and insurers for rising-yield support, plus quality exporters with natural hedges and pricing power. Add defensives in healthcare and rail if yen volatility spikes. Use earnings to upgrade winners with improving free cash flow. Keep position sizes flexible around the BOJ press conference and key guidance dates, using staggered entries to manage event risk.\nFinal Thoughts\nJapan\u2019s equity rally extended as the BOJ held at 0.75% with an 8\u20131 vote and upgraded its outlook, reinforcing a gradual"
