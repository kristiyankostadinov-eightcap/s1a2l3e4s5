The main catalyst is interest-rate math: if markets think Fed cuts are coming, bond yields typically ease, which makes non-yielding assets like gold more appealing. A softer US dollar can amplify that move by making metals cheaper for overseas buyers. But year-end trading can exaggerate swings \u2013 with thinner liquidity, any bout..\nof profit-taking can hit harder than usual.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate bets are steering the whole complex.\nFutures pricing still points to roughly two Fed cuts next year, even though policymakers have sounded cautious. That gap matters because positioning in metals often tracks real yields and the dollar more than headlines. If upcoming data cools growth and inflation, the rally can extend \u2013 but if yields bounce or the dollar firms, crowded trades can unwind quickly, especially into the holidays.\nZooming out: This rally is broad not just a safety bid.\nGold\u2019s surge has been impressive, but silver\u2019s even bigger run and the strength in platinum and palladium suggest more than simple fear.

Buyers stayed active on dips through the week, and the market held its tone even with the Fed pushing back on early-2026 easing expectations.\nNovember inflation cooled more than expected \u2014 core at 2.6%, headline at 2.7% versus 3.1% forecast \u2014 giving traders confidence that price pressures are easing. That kept the market leaning toward additional policy loosening even though the Fed signaled reluctance.\nThe 25 bp cut on December 10 brought the target to 3.50%\u20133.75%, but the dot plot showed only one more cut in 2026 and three officials dissented. Traders haven\u2019t seen that level of internal division since 2019.\nRate-cut odds for January hover near 21%, with April treated as the more realistic window. Even with the hawkish tone, the easing already delivered continues to support spot gold.\nTensions between the United States and Venezuela escalated after Washington halted sanctioned oil flows over a tanker seizure. Putin\u2019s reaffirmed claims in Ukraine added to the risk backdrop. None of this looks close to resolution, and safe-haven demand stayed firm. With spot gold up 65% year-to-date \u2014 the strongest annual performance since 1979 \u2014 the geopolitical bid remains part of the structure.\nHoliday liquidity can stretch moves in both directions. The first short-term level traders are watching is the weekly pivot at $4,133.95 on XAU/USD. The next meaningful floor is the $3,886.46 swing bottom, positioned above the $3,846.50\u2013$3,720.25 retracement zone. The longer-term trend stays bullish as long as price holds above the 52-week moving average at $3,402.69.\nCentral bank demand remains a strong tailwind. Roughly 220 tonnes were added in Q3, China extended its buying streak to 12 months, and Brazil re-entered the market after two years. ETF flows remain positive, and positioning still doesn\u2019t look overstretched relative to price action.\nA retest of $4,381.44 remains the primary upside focus. A sustained move through that main top could carry spot gold into the mid-$4,400s quickly, especially if early-2026 labor data softens and unemployment pushes above 4.5%. That would likely accelerate expectations for additional easing.\nShort-term momentum holds as long as XAU/USD stays above $4,133.95. The intermediate bias remains supported while $3,886.46 is intact, and the longer-term bullish structure stays in place above the 52-week moving average at $3,402.69. Under those conditions, the bias stays bullish with room for another breakout attempt early in 2026.\nMore Information in our Economic Calendar.\nJames Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

The stepped-up enforcement highlights a tougher U.S. stance on sanctions evasion and adds uncertainty around crude supply flows from Venezuela at a time when markets are already sensitive to geopolitical disruptions.\nThe tanker action comes against a backdrop of rising Middle East tensions after Israel warned the United States that recent missile exercises by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard could be misread as preparations for a strike. While U.S. intelligence does not currently see evidence of an imminent Iranian attack, Israeli officials have stressed that risk tolerance is far lower following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas assault, raising concerns about miscalculation and unintended escalation.\nEnergy markets have responded by building in a higher geopolitical risk premium. Traders remain focused on the possibility that even a limited Israel\u2013Iran confrontation, or defensive pre-emptive actions triggered by misinterpretation, could disrupt oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for global crude supply.\nAt the same time, the Venezuelan tanker interceptions underscore Washington\u2019s willingness to more actively police sanctions, potentially tightening effective supply from Latin America. While Venezuelan crude exports have continued despite sanctions via opaque shipping routes, repeated U.S. interdictions increase uncertainty around delivery reliability and insurance costs.\nTogether, the Middle East risk backdrop and firmer U.S. enforcement action are providing support to oil prices, even as broader macro concerns, including global growth and monetary policy, continue to cap upside. For now, the market appears more focused on tail risks to supply than on near-term demand headwinds."

This uptick was largely attributed to the United States advancing its efforts to seize Venezuelan oil tankers amid escalating geopolitical concerns in the Middle East.\nThis morning\u2019s gains followed a two-week decline in oil prices, fueled by fears of a significant oversupply in 2026, particularly with the potential for Russian oil to re-enter the market amid ongoing peace negotiations related to the Ukraine conflict. However, potential disruptions to Venezuelan oil exports, driven by a series of U.S. operations targeting oil tankers, have helped counter these bearish concerns. Reports indicate that the U.S. is currently pursuing its third Venezuelan tanker within two weeks, following the seizure of another over the weekend.\nThe Trump administration has intensified its rhetoric against Venezuela, alleging that the country is responsible for enabling the flow of illegal drugs and criminal activity into the U.S. Recently, President Trump announced a blockade aimed at all sanctioned oil tankers associated with Venezuela, which could significantly disrupt the nation\u2019s already struggling oil exports. It's important to note that Venezuela possesses the largest proven oil reserves globally and ranks as the twelfth-largest crude oil producer, according to data from Worldometer.\nAdditionally, renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are providing a further boost to oil prices. Reports emerged over the weekend that Israel is preparing to brief the U.S. about a potential new offensive against Iran, amidst growing concerns about Tehran's ballistic missile capabilities and nuclear ambitions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump later this month, where he is expected to advocate for intensified action against Iran. Should these tensions escalate, they could further threaten oil production in the region, although the exact trajectory of U.S.-Israel relations regarding Iran remains uncertain.\nIn summary, the confluence of U.S. actions targeting Venezuelan oil and the prospect of renewed military confrontations in the Middle East is reshaping expectations for global oil supply, amplifying the risk premium in oil markets.\nThe above content was completed with the assistance of AI and has been reviewed by an editor."

                "body": "The United States is chasing a third oil tanker near Venezuela amidst intensified efforts by President Donald Trump to enforce an oil blockade on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government. The US Coast Guard is actively pursuing this \u201cdark fleet\u201d vessel, which is evading sanctions and flying a false flag under judicial seizure orders.\nAt the time of reporting, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices rose by 0.54%, reaching $56.85. WTI, a high-quality crude oil, is sourced from the United States and refined easily due to its low gravity and sulphur content. It acts as a benchmark in the oil market.\nInfluence On WTI Oil Prices\nThe price of WTI oil is influenced by supply and demand dynamics, political instability, OPEC decisions, and the value of the US dollar. Weekly inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute and the Energy Information Agency also affect WTI oil prices. Changes in inventories signal varying supply and demand levels, influencing oil prices accordingly.\nOPEC, comprising 12 oil-producing nations, affects WTI oil prices through production quotas. Lowering quotas can increase prices by reducing supply, while increased production generally lowers prices. OPEC+ includes additional non-OPEC members, like Russia, amplifying its global influence.\nThis ongoing pursuit of a Venezuelan tanker is a reminder that the sanctions regime initiated years ago remains a key factor for crude prices. As we see today, these enforcement actions create headline risk that can cause short-term price spikes. Derivative traders should be prepared for increased volatility as this situation develops in the final weeks of 2025.\nThese supply-side disruptions, even minor ones, are happening in an already tight market. We just saw OPEC+ agree in their early December 2025 meeting to hold production cuts steady into the first quarter of 2026, aiming to keep a floor under prices. This commitment from major producers provides a fundamentally bullish backdrop for oil.\nDemand Side Dynamics\nOn the demand side, the most recent EIA report from last week showed a surprise inventory draw of 2.1 million barrels, against analyst expectations of a small build. This suggests demand is holding up better than anticipated, especially with winter heating needs peaking in the Northern Hemisphere. This stronger demand signal further supports the case for higher prices.\nGiven these factors, we see the potential for sharp upward movements in WTI, which is currently trading around $82. Traders should look at options strategies that benefit from rising prices and increased implied volatility. Buying near-term call options or setting up bull call spreads could be effective ways to position for a potential breakout above recent resistance levels.\nHistorically, we can look back to the early 2020s when similar geopolitical events in the Persian Gulf or Venezuela caused significant, albeit sometimes brief, price rallies. Those periods showed that even the threat of a supply disruption is enough to move the market significantly. Therefore, holding some bullish exposure seems prudent, as the risk is skewed to the upside heading into the new year."

                "body": "US pursuing third oil tanker in Venezuela Blockade \u2014 Reuters\nThe United States (US) is still in pursuit of a third oil tanker near Venezuela, officials told Reuters on Sunday, as US President Donald Trump intensifies an oil blockade on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government.\n\"The United States Coast Guard is in active pursuit of a sanctioned 'dark fleet' vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion,\" a U.S. official said. \"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.\u201d\nAnother official affirmed that the tanker was under sanctions but reiterated that it had not yet been boarded and that interceptions may take several forms, including sailing or flying near to vessels of concern.\nMarket reaction\nAt the time of writing, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading 0.54% higher on the day to trade at $56.85.\nWTI Oil FAQs\nWTI Oil is a type of Crude Oil sold on international markets. The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as \u201clight\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined. It is sourced in the United States and distributed via the Cushing hub, which is considered \u201cThe Pipeline Crossroads of the World\u201d. It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API\u2019s report is published every Tuesday and EIA\u2019s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings. Their decisions often impact WTI Oil prices. When OPEC decides to lower quotas, it can tighten supply, pushing up Oil prices. When OPEC increases production, it has the opposite effect. OPEC+ refers to an expanded group that includes ten extra non-OPEC members, the most notable of which is Russia.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

                "body": "EUR/USD posts modest gains above 1.1700 as ECB signals pause\n- EUR/USD trades with mild gains near 1.1710 in Monday\u2019s early Asian session.\n- The European Central Bank signaled it was done with monetary easing.\n- The Fed cut policy rates by 25 bps at its December meeting, its third consecutive reduction.\nThe EUR/USD pair posts modest gains around 1.1710 during the early Asian session on Monday. The Euro (EUR) strengthens against the Greenback after the European Central Bank (ECB) left its policy rates unchanged and took a more positive view on the Eurozone economy, which has shown resilience to global trade shocks. Financial markets are likely to remain subdued as traders book profits ahead of the long holiday period.\nThe ECB kept its key policy rates on hold at 2.0% since June, and its latest pause last week also came with upgrades to growth and inflation forecasts. Traders expect a lengthy rate pause until at least June after ECB President Christine Lagarde cited heavy uncertainty and avoided forward guidance. Signals that the rate cut cycle is ending could provide some support to the shared currency against the US Dollar (USD) in the near term.\nAcross the pond, the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered a widely expected 25 basis-point (bps) rate cut in December, bringing the federal funds rate to 3.50-3.75%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that a rate hike is not likely in the near future and that the US central bank is in a \"wait-and-see\" mode to assess incoming economic data.\nThe Summary of Economic Projections, or so-called \"dot plot,\" indicated a median expectation of only one additional rate cut in 2026. Nonetheless, markets are now pricing in expectations for potentially two or more rate cuts next year, according to the CME FedWatch tool. This, in turn, could undermine the USD and act as a tailwind for the major pair.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four larges"

The Euro strengthens with the European Central Bank (ECB) maintaining policy rates and forecasting better growth and inflation in the Eurozone.\nThe ECB held key policy rates at 2.0% since June, pausing with recent positive economic assessments. Expectations suggest a rate pause until at least June amid uncertainties.\nFed Rate Movements\nIn the US, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points in December, making it 3.50-3.75%. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at no imminent rate hikes, monitoring economic trends closely.\nThe \u201cdot plot\u201d projects possibly one more rate cut in 2026. Yet, market trends imply potential multiple cuts next year, possibly lowering the USD\u2019s worth against the Euro.\nThe Euro is the currency for 20 EU countries and is second in global trade. In 2022, it comprised 31% of all forex transactions with a daily turnover exceeding $2.2 trillion.\nThe ECB manages Eurozone\u2019s monetary policy, seeking price stability. Higher Eurozone interest rates typically boost the Euro\u2019s value.\nEconomic Indicators and Trends\nInflation and economic data like GDP impact the Euro\u2019s value. A favourable trade balance boosts Euro value through demand for exports.\nWith the European Central Bank signaling a pause and the Federal Reserve cutting rates, we see a clear policy divergence favoring the Euro. The EUR/USD is currently holding above 1.1700, and this fundamental backdrop suggests a potential upward trend. Derivative traders should consider positioning for further Euro strength against the Dollar in the coming weeks.\nThe ECB\u2019s confidence seems justified, as the latest Eurozone flash HICP inflation for November 2025 held firm at 2.1%, just above their target. Furthermore, recent sentiment indicators like Germany\u2019s IFO Business Climate index have shown unexpected resilience, supporting the central bank\u2019s decision to hold rates at 2.0%. This economic stability reduces the probability of any near-term rate cuts from the ECB.\nOn the other hand, the Fed\u2019s dovish stance is being reinforced by softening US economic data. Core PCE inflation, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge, has trended down to 2.8%, and the most recent ISM Manufacturing PMI reading for November 2025 dipped to 48.5, indicating a contraction. This data fuels market speculation, reflected in the CME FedWatch tool, for more rate cuts in 2026 than the Fed has guided for.\nGiven this outlook, buying EUR/USD call options with expirations in late January or February 2026 appears to be a viable strategy. With holiday markets typically showing lower implied volatility, the cost of purchasing these options could be relatively attractive. This approach allows for capturing potential upside while defining risk to the premium paid.\nWe can look back to the period of policy divergence in late 2021 and early 2022 for a historical parallel, where a more aggressive Fed drove significant currency moves. While the roles are now reversed, it demonstrates how a widening gap in central bank policy can act as a powerful catalyst for the EUR/USD pair. This historical precedent supports the view that the current divergence could fuel a sustained trend."

                "body": "After another surge higher early this week on Tuesday and a move above the 1.18030 vicinity, the EUR/USD began to seeing selling emerge. By Wednesday of this week, before central bank announcements from the BoE and ECB on Thursday, which delivered anticipated news, the EUR/USD sank to nearly 1.17030. And then on Friday the EUR/USD again touched the 1.17030 area once again.\nHowever, it must be said in defense of the EUR/USD that the currency pair was trading around the 1.16440 mark before the U.S Federal Reserves interest rate decision and statement the previous Wednesday. In other words the EUR/USD has maintained a rather well defined move higher in the past week and a half of trading.\nBut now the holiday season is getting ready to unfold, and broad Forex volumes will become very quiet tomorrow and on Tuesday. And by Christmas eve traders need to understand even the EUR/USD will see limited movement per the shuttered global financial system during the holiday.\nTop Forex Brokers\nThe 1.17100 as Potential Barometer\nThe 1.17100 has seen some sustained trading below its sphere and price action may look to this mark as a barometer regarding outlook for the EUR/USD near-term. However, traders should be careful to not fall into a trap and decide short-term trading conditions match mid-term outlooks in the coming two weeks. Yes, equilibrium per market values in the EUR/USD will be expressed in the day to day results seen, but as large players sit on the sidelines speculators should make sure they do not get flustered if surges occur without any real explanation.\nPerhaps early this coming week nervous sentiment should be considered a risk in the broad markets, but U.S equities via the major indices did find stability on Friday before going into the weekend. Light volumes in the coming days and weeks will cause instability, but results must be questioned. If U.S markets remain stable going into Christmas perhaps this could spark a reversal upwards for the EUR/USD.\nTest Lows Wednesday and Friday and Signals\nSome technical traders may point to the test of lows on Wednesday and Friday of this past week as a dangerous signal for the EUR/USD.\n- A possible correction lower in what may be considered an overbought market is always a thought, but the move lower may have also taken place because nervous behavioral sentiment existed and will vanish.\n- With the holiday season about to start, two full weeks of light trading are looking at speculators in the face, the chance that last week\u2019s price action was merely a \u2018false flag\u2019 should also be considered.\nEUR/USD Weekly Outlook:\nSpeculative price range for EUR/USD is 1.16850 to 1.17700\nTrading conditions in the coming days should be looked at suspiciously. Certainly financial institutions will be active throughout Wednesday of this week, but volumes will be definitely lower than normal trading days. The EUR/USD has done a solid job of gaining the past month. The EUR/USD at its current values still remains within a healthy realm. The 1.17100 may be used as a signal early this week, if buying breaks above this level and is maintained on Monday it may demonstrate another shift in sentiment that suggests upside price action will develop for the EUR/USD.\nIf a move below the 1.17000 mark takes place on Monday and sees the level become durable resistance, it could mean some financial institutions have positioned themselves cautiously ahead of the holiday season which is notorious for producing results that don\u2019t always correlate with mid-term outlooks. Day traders should be careful early this week if they decide to participate in the EUR/USD and the broad Forex market because choppy conditions will be a factor. After Tuesday of this week, the EUR/USD may be best left alone unless a trader feels the need to speculate within very quiet markets.\nReady to trade our weekly forecast?

                "body": "Market moves this week have been somewhat counterintuitive, with neither the yen nor the pound reacting in the way many might have expected. The yen weakened after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates, while sterling edged higher following a Bank of England rate cut.\nPound to Dollar (GBP/USD): 1.3378\nEuro to Dollar (EUR/USD): 1.17105\nDollar to Japanese Yen (USD/JPY): 157.734\nBoth decisions were widely anticipated and largely priced in, meaning markets focused less on the actions themselves and more on the tone of accompanying statements and press conferences.\nFriday\u2019s main event was the Bank of Japan meeting. As expected, the central bank raised rates by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent, the highest level since September 1995. The move continues the BoJ\u2019s slow and cautious normalisation away from decades of ultra-loose policy.\nIn its statement and during Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s press conference, the Bank said underlying inflation is rising moderately and being supported by strong wage growth. Officials argued that the wage price cycle appears sustainable, allowing for further gradual tightening if economic conditions evolve as expected.\nDespite the hike, policy remains accommodative, with real interest rates still deeply negative. The BoJ stressed there is no preset path for rates and reiterated it would remain flexible.\nMarkets reacted by selling the yen. USD/JPY briefly moved above 156 as investors judged that guidance was not as hawkish as some had anticipated. Japanese government bond yields rose, with the 10 year yield climbing above 2 percent, while the Nikkei rallied. There were no immediate signs of a disruptive carry trade unwind.\nPound Stable Following BoE Cut\nThe BoJ decision capped a busy pre-Christmas week that also included a Bank of England rate cut, an ECB hold, US CPI data and two US jobs reports, including the delayed October release.\nDespite the heavy calendar, markets have seen limited net movement. The US dollar is slightly higher overall, while the pound has managed modest gains against the euro since Thursday\u2019s BoE meeting, pushing EUR/GBP down to around 0.875.\nAs ING explained, the BoE may have cut rates, but the meeting was not especially dovish and the voting split provided some support for sterling:\n\u201cSterling drew some support from a Bank of England press release which was not as dovish as we had expected. Many of the decision makers cited the fact that expectations for wage growth remained stubbornly high and were concerned about structurally high inflation.\nWe suspect that these wage expectations will come down in the New Year in line with lower headline inflation. In all, we continue to expect 25bp rate cuts in February and April, compared to market pricing of just one cut. And that should mean EUR/GBP continues to find support ahead of 0.87.\u201d\nDovish expectations had built earlier in the week following key UK data releases. The jobs report showed unemployment rising to 5.1 percent, the highest since 2021, alongside a year on year fall in payrolled employees. Vacancies continued to decline to around 729,000 in the three months to November, below pre-pandemic levels, while youth unemployment rose to its highest in over a decade.\nThis suggests the labour market is not just cooling but risks weakening more sharply, which could push the BoE toward a more aggressive easing cycle.\nInflation data reinforced that view. CPI fell to 3.2 percent in November from 3.6 percent in October, the lowest reading in eight months. Core inflation eased to 3.2 percent and services inflation cooled to 4.4 percent. The sharper-than-expected slowdown supports the view that inflation peaked earlier in the year and is now trending lower.\nWhile the pound has held up well so far, the broader backdrop still points to further rate cuts in early 2026. If that plays out, sterling could come under renewed pressure once markets move beyond the year-end lull."

                "body": "AUD/USD update\nAUD/USD retreats as profit taking and US dollar strength weigh in\nAUD/USD slipped 0.63% last week as US dollar strength and risk aversion weighed on markets, with traders now focused on RBA minutes and GDP data for direction.\nThree-week winning streak comes to an end\nAUD/USD finished lower last week at 0.6611 (-0.63%), snapping its three-week winning streak. The pullback coincided with a rebound in the US Dollar Index (DXY), as traders largely looked through last week\u2019s key US data releases.\nMixed signals from US economic data\nThe cooler US November consumer price index (CPI) report was viewed as unreliable due to measurement issues stemming from the prolonged government shutdown. Meanwhile, the November non-farm payrolls (NFP) report offered mixed signals.\nOn the positive side, private payrolls proved relatively resilient, rising by 69,000 in November. Offsetting this gain, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% \u2013 the highest level since September 2021.\nOn balance, last week\u2019s US data reinforced expectations for two 25 basis point (bp) Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in 2026, without advancing the case for a more aggressive Fed easing cycle next year.\nRisk aversion also played a role in Australian dollar's (AUD) decline, as US equities spent much of the week under pressure amid concerns over elevated valuations and high debt levels in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Finally, last week\u2019s decline in AUD/USD reflected profit taking following its sharp 4.10% rally from 21 November low of 0.6419 to 10 December high of 0.6685.\nKey events ahead\nLooking ahead, Tuesday\u2019s Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) December meeting minutes and Wednesday\u2019s third-quarter (Q3) gross domestic product (GDP) print will be pivotal, alongside month- and quarter-end rebalancing flows, in determining whether AUD/USD can retest recent highs.\nRBA meeting minutes\nDate: Tuesday, 23 December at 11.30am AEDT\nAt its December Board meeting, RBA held the cash rate unchanged at 3.60%, as widely anticipated, marking the third consecutive hold.\nThe decision came with a hawkish tone in the accompanying statement. Key observations included inflation appearing more broad-based, strengthening private sector growth, a recovering housing market, a still-tight labour market, capacity utilisation remaining above long-run averages, elevated unit labour costs, and the potential for further capacity pressures if private demand continues to accelerate.\nRBA Governor Michele Bullock\u2019s subsequent press conference reinforced this hawkishness, noting that a rate cut was not considered, while the Board did discuss scenarios that could warrant a hike. She emphasised RBA\u2019s tightening bias, stating that \u2018if it looks like inflation is not coming back to the band then the Board will have to take action, and it will.\u2019\nThe upcoming minutes will be closely scrutinised for deeper insights into potential triggers and timing around a first rate hike or a shift back toward a neutral policy stance.\nAustralian interest rate market starts the week pricing in 9 bp of RBA rate hikes for February. There are 25 bp of rate hikes priced for July and a cumulative 41 bp of rate hikes priced between now and the end of 2026.\nRBA cash rate chart\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nAs noted earlier, AUD/USD staged an impressive 4.10% rally from 21 November low at 0.6419 to 10 December high of 0.6685.\nThe pullback since then to Thursday\u2019s low of 0.6592 has unfolded in an orderly fashion, characteristic of a healthy correction rather than the start of a deeper reversal.\nWith this constructive price action in mind, as long as AUD/USD holds above short-term support in the 0.6590 \u2013 0.6580 zone, the path of least resistance remains higher, favouring a retest of the recent peak at 0.6685.\nA clean break above there would target the mid-September high at 0.6706, with the next major hurdle being trend channel resistance, currently near 0.6750.\nAUD/USD daily chart\n- Source: TradingView.

                "body": "Australian Dollar Outlook: RBA\u2013Fed Split Could Drive AUD Higher\nMarkets are rapidly repricing Australian interest rates higher while the US moves toward cuts \u2014 a mix that has historically been powerful for the Aussie dollar.\nThe tables are turning for the Australian dollar\nMake no mistake: the outlook for interest rates in Australia and the United States is diverging rapidly \u2014 and that shift could soon start working in favour of the Australian dollar.\nWith US rates being cut again while the Reserve Bank of Australia has held steady, short-term policy rates in both countries are now effectively aligned at around 3.6%. That\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve matched since late 2024.\nSo far, the currency market has been slow to react. Many investors still believe US rates are near their low point, while Australian rates may yet fall further. But that assumption is increasingly under pressure.\nIs the AUD Strong or Weak?\nAnalyzing the Australian dollar against a wide range of currencies offers a more complete view of its global strength. This approach captures broader trade relationships, emerging market trends, and diverse economic factors, providing a clearer picture of the dollar's performance in the world economy.\nWhy February could be the turning point\nThe next two months bring a heavy run of inflation and labour-market data in both economies. If current trends persist, money markets see a growing chance that US policy rates could fall below Australia\u2019s as early as February.\nThat would be a significant moment. US rates have not been below Australia\u2019s since 2000.\nMarkets are now moving away from the idea of further Australian rate cuts. Instead, expectations have swung toward rate rises over the next year, while the Federal Reserve is expected to continue easing. This reversal has already reshaped bond markets, pushing Australian yields sharply higher relative to the US.\nHistorically, such divergences have mattered. When Australia has moved into a clear interest-rate advantage over the US, the Australian dollar has often risen sharply \u2014 sometimes by double-digit percentages over relatively short periods.\n\u2e3b\nWhat drives the Aussie when rates diverge\nWhen forecasting the Australian dollar, markets look beyond just cash rates. Key drivers include:\n\u2022 Interest rate differentials across the yield curve\n\u2022 Global risk appetite\n\u2022 Commodity prices and trade demand\n\u2022 Relative economic growth and inflation\nAll else being equal, a stronger yield advantage creates positive \u201ccarry\u201d for the Aussie \u2014 making it more attractive to hold relative to the US dollar. If that advantage widens meaningfully, the path of least resistance for AUD/USD could be higher.\n\u2e3b\nEconomic consequences of a stronger AUD\nA rising Australian dollar would have mixed effects across the economy:\nPotential benefits\n\u2022 Cheaper imports, easing \u201cimported\u201d inflation\n\u2022 Improved margins for importers\n\u2022 Some relief for consumers facing cost-of-living pressures\nPotential headwinds\n\u2022 Reduced competitiveness for exporters\n\u2022 Lower Australian-dollar earnings for companies reporting in US dollars\n\u2022 Slower growth if export demand softens\nIronically, a strong enough currency could eventually cool inflation to the point where further rate hikes become unnecessary \u2014 tempering the very forces that lifted the dollar in the first place.\n\u2e3b\nMarkets, shares, and the FX puzzle\nInterest-rate markets have already repriced aggressively, with the gap between Australian and US bond yields widening to multi-year extremes. Yet the Australian dollar has not followed as decisively as in past cycles.\nThat raises a key question: is the currency lagging the rates market?\nIf history is a guide, the answer may be yes \u2014 at least initially. In prior cycles, the Aussie often moved later, but sharply, once the divergence became undeniable.\n\u2e3b\nWhat it means for investors and businesses\nFor Australian investors, the implications are far-reaching:\n\u2022 Currency risk matters again: Overseas equity returns may need active hedging if th"

The pair fell below 155 during Tokyo trading on 15 December after comments by Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara were taken as accepting a rate hike. The USD/JPY then saw a modest rebound on dollar buying linked to reports surrounding the Fed chair succession, before trending weaker into 16 December. The pair extended its decline to the low for the week of 154.40 after US employment data and retail sales released during US trading came in below market expectations. The USD/JPY rose back above 155 on 17 December after UST yields rose and the dollar strengthened, then continued to push higher to around 155.50. The pair dipped briefly in early Tokyo trading on 18 December, although the upward trend persisted and carried the USD/JPY to 155.98 during European trading. The pair fell sharply to below 155.50 after US CPI came in well below market expectations, then rebounded as some market participants questioned the reliability of the data due to the impact of the partial government shutdown. The USD/JPY rose past 156 on 19 December after the BOJ announced its policy decision, then rose further following BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's press conference, bringing 157 into view (Figure 1). Among G10 currencies, the Swiss franc, the yen, and the dollar strengthened ahead of the BOJ meeting this week.

                "body": "USD/JPY falls to near 157.50 during the early Asian session, influenced by potential US Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026 due to softened inflation and a cooling US jobs market. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has raised interest rates to 0.75%, the highest in 30 years, signalling a more restrictive monetary policy.\nMarket anticipated US Fed rate cuts have led to a loss in value for the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. A 21.0% chance for a Fed rate cut in January is indicated, with current Fed stance limiting potential Dollar losses, as per the CME FedWatch tool.\nJapanese Economic Recovery\nBoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda confirmed Japan\u2019s moderate economic recovery and emphasized close monitoring of the economy following the recent rate hike. Despite a lack of forward guidance on future rate paths, this hawkish shift offers only uncertain future directions for the Yen.\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s value is tied to Japan\u2019s economic performance, Bank of Japan policies, and broader market risk sentiment. Known as a safe-haven currency, the Yen often gains strength during market volatility, as traders seek stability amidst turbulence.\nGiven the USD/JPY is softening around 157.50, we should recognize the shifting momentum driven by central bank policy divergence. The Federal Reserve has already cut rates three times in the latter half of 2025, a response to a clear economic slowdown. This trend suggests the path of least resistance for the US dollar is lower.\nRecent data reinforces this view, making a short position on the pair attractive. We have seen US CPI inflation for November 2025 fall to 2.8%, well off its earlier highs, while the latest Non-Farm Payrolls report added only 150,000 jobs. This cooling data provides a strong foundation for expecting further Fed easing in 2026.\nBoJ Rate Hike Impact\nOn the other side, the Bank of Japan\u2019s recent rate hike to 0.75% is a major policy shift. When we recall that the BoJ only ended its negative interest rate policy back in early 2024, this move shows a firm commitment to policy normalization. This fundamental change provides a strong tailwind for the yen.\nThe narrowing interest rate differential is the most critical factor here. The US 10-year Treasury yield has fallen to around 3.75% on rate-cut expectations, while the 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield has climbed to 1.10%. This spread has compressed significantly from its peak in 2024, removing a key pillar of support for a higher USD/JPY.\nFor the coming holiday-thinned weeks, traders should consider strategies that profit from a further decline in USD/JPY. Buying put options with a target strike around 155.00 could be a viable strategy to capitalize on downward momentum. This approach also limits risk if Fed officials successfully talk up the dollar or if holiday trading leads to unexpected volatility.\nHowever, we must remain cautious about the BoJ\u2019s lack of clear forward guidance, which could temper yen strength. A break below the 157.00 level would be a key technical signal confirming the downtrend. Conversely, a failure to break lower could see the pair drift sideways as the market awaits the next major catalyst in January."

Rising tensions between the US and Venezuela, along with concerns about renewed Israel-Iran conflict and persistent uncertainties stemming from the protracted Russia-Ukraine war, boost demand for the safe-haven JPY. Furthermore, comments from Japan\u2019s top foreign exchange official, Atsushi Mimura, fueled speculation about a possible government intervention and further benefited the JPY.\nMeanwhile, Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda left the door open to further tightening, though he remained vague on the exact timing and pace of future rate hikes. Adding to this, worries about Japan's worsening fiscal condition, aggravated by the recent steep rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yields, might hold back the JPY bulls from placing aggressive bets. Adding to this, hawkish comments from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) officials could help limit deeper USD losses and offer some support to the USD/JPY pair.\nJapanese Yen is underpinned by reviving safe-haven demand, renewed intervention speculations\n- Atsushi Mimura, Japan\u2019s Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs and top foreign exchange official, said on Monday that he is concerned about one-way moves and warned of appropriate action against an excessive decline in the Japanese Yen.\n- The US intercepted a Venezuelan oil tanker over the weekend and is in active pursuit of a third in less than two weeks. This comes after US President Donald Trump last week ordered a blockade of sanctioned tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.\n- Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that officials are concerned that Iran is reconstituting nuclear enrichment sites and are preparing to brief Trump on options for attacking the missile program again, NBC News reported on Saturday.\n- Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s top foreign policy aide said on Sunday that changes made by the Europeans and Ukraine to US proposals did not improve prospects for peace. This contributes to driving safe-haven flows towards the JPY.\n- The Bank of Japan, as was widely expected, raised its policy rate to 0.75%, or a 30-year high, at the end of the December meeting on Friday and reiterated that it would continue to hike rates if the economy and prices move in line with forecasts.\n- In the post-meeting press conference, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said that the central bank will closely look at the impact of the latest interest rate change, and the pace of monetary adjustment will depend on economic, price, and financial outlooks.\n- Ueda, however, did not offer clarity on future hikes. Moreover, concerns about Japan's worsening fiscal health \u2013 led by a sharp rise in Japanese government bond yields and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's spending plan \u2013 might cap gains for the JPY.\n- The recent hawkish comments from influential Federal Reserve officials pushed the US Dollar to a one-week high on Friday and should contribute to limiting any meaningful corrective slide for the USD/JPY pair, warranting caution for bears.\n- In fact, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said that monetary policy is in a good place to pause and assess the effects of 75 basis points (bps) of interest rate cuts on the economy during the first quarter, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.\n- Traders, however, are still pricing in a greater possibility of two more interest rate cuts by the US central bank in 2026.

Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has fallen to 21.0% from 24.4% a week ago.\nThe University of Michigan reported on Friday that the Consumer Sentiment Index was revised downward to 52.9 in December from 53.3 previously. Consumer Expectations Index fell to 54.6 from 55.0. Meanwhile, One-year Inflation Expectations were revised up to 4.2% from 4.1% in both the initial estimate and the prior month.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a"

Reuters flagged two key supports in the background:\n- The Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate sits at 2.25%, a three\u2011year low.\n- Prime Minister Mark Carney has committed to spending aimed at boosting productivity and accelerating natural resource project construction\u2014an important tailwind for a market with big resource exposure. [4]\nMeanwhile, the commodity complex remains central to Canada\u2019s equity story. Oil settled around the mid\u2011US$50s on Friday, while metals stayed firm\u2014conditions that tend to amplify TSX sector leadership in materials and energy. [5]\nTrading schedule: the TSX week is effectively \u201cfront-loaded\u201d\nIf you\u2019re planning around catalysts, the calendar matters as much as the data.\nThe TSX/TSXV schedule shows:\n- Wednesday, Dec. 24 (Christmas Eve): early close at 1:00 p.m. ET\n- Thursday, Dec. 25: closed (Christmas Day)\n- Friday, Dec. 26: closed (Boxing Day) [6]\nIn plain English: most of the week\u2019s real price-setting likely happens Monday and Tuesday.\nThe week-ahead catalyst list for Canada: GDP + the Bank of Canada\u2019s deliberations\nEven with holiday conditions, Canada has two macro events that can still move rates, the loonie, and TSX sector leadership.\n1) Canada October GDP (Tuesday, Dec. 23)\nCIBC\u2019s week-ahead calendar highlights monthly GDP as the key Canadian number. CIBC expects October GDP to decline 0.3% m/m, in line with the advance estimate, while also emphasizing that the weakness may be driven by one-off factors and could be followed by a rebound signal for November. [7]\nWhy it matters for stocks:\n- A softer GDP print can reinforce a lower-rate narrative, potentially supporting rate-sensitive equities (financials, real estate, consumer discretionary).\n- But if investors interpret it as broader stagnation rather than \u201cone-offs,\u201d cyclicals can wobble, and the market may rotate back toward defensives and gold-linked names.\n2) Bank of Canada \u201cSummary of deliberations\u201d (Tuesday, Dec. 23, 1:30 p.m. ET)\nThe Bank of Canada is scheduled to publish its summary of deliberations from the meeting leading up to its Dec. 10 rate decision. The release time is 13:30 ET. [8]\nCIBC\u2019s preview suggests the summary is likely to show little if any consideration of an interest-rate move, with policymakers balancing downside growth risks against upside inflation risks. [9]\nWhy it matters for the TSX:\nEven without an immediate decision, the tone can shift 2026 rate expectations, which feed directly into valuations, bank margins, and the Canadian dollar\u2014especially in a thin market where small flows can create outsized price moves.\nThe consumer backdrop: retail sales were soft, but November \u201cflash\u201d bounced\nA key datapoint landing right before the holiday week: October retail sales fell 0.2%, according to Statistics Canada, but an early estimate pointed to a 1.2% rebound in November.

                "body": "GBP/JPY trades with negative bias below 211.00/multi-year peak amid modest JPY strength\n- GBP/JPY attracts some sellers at the start of a new week, though it lacks follow-through.\n- Reviving safe-haven demand and intervention fears boost the JPY, weighing on the cross.\n- The BoE\u2019s hawkish tilt acts as a tailwind for the GBP and should limit losses for spot prices.\nThe GBP/JPY cross kicks off the new week on a softer note and erodes a part of Friday's strong gains to a fresh high since August 2008 \u2013 levels just above the 211.00 mark. The downtick, however, lacks bearish conviction, with spot prices rebounding a few pips from the Asian session trough and currently trading around the 210.80-210.75 region, down less than 0.10% for the day.\nAgainst the backdrop of persistent geopolitical uncertainties stemming from the protracted Russia-Ukraine war, concerns about renewed Israel-Iran conflict, and rising tensions between the US and Venezuela boost demand for traditional safe-haven assets. This, along with speculations that Japanese authorities would step in to stem further weakness in the domestic currency, benefits the Japanese Yen (JPY), which, in turn, is seen as a key factor weighing on the GBP/JPY cross.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) left the door open to further tightening after raising its rate to a 30-year high on Friday, though it offered little clues about the future policy path. Moreover, worries about Japan's worsening fiscal condition, aggravated by a steep rise in the Japanese government bond (JGB) yields, hold back the JPY bulls from placing aggressive bets. Apart from this, the Bank of England's (BoE) hawkish tilt supports the British Pound (GBP) and the GBP/JPY cross.\nAs was expected, the BoE MPC voted 5-4 to lower the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75%. However, a close vote split revealed differences within the committee, especially after the recent inflation surprise. This, in turn, forced investors to scale back their expectations for more aggressive easing next year. Moreover, the emergence of some US Dollar (USD) selling acts as a tailwind for the GBP and warrants caution before positioning for deeper GBP/JPY losses.\nTraders now look forward to the release of the final UK Q3 GDP print for some impetus amid relatively thin trading volumes on the back of the year-end holiday season. Nevertheless, the aforementioned fundamental backdrop makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that the GBP/JPY cross has formed a near-term top around the 211.00 mark.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Key Takeaways\nBitcoin gave forecasters plenty of rope in 2025 and in Tom Lee\u2019s case, the year ended with both validation and controversy.\nThe market set a fresh record in October 2025, when Bitcoin surged past $125,000 and briefly peaked near $126,000, before reversing sharply in the final months of the year. By late December, Bitcoin was trading around $88,000, more than 30% below its October high.\nAgainst that backdrop, Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors\u2019 Managing Partner and head of research and one of Bitcoin\u2019s most prominent bulls, found himself at the center of renewed scrutiny over price forecasts and internal messaging.\nBitcoin entered 2025 already near historic highs and pushed decisively higher during the year, fueled by post-halving dynamics, institutional participation and strong speculative momentum. Prices surged past $100,000 and set a new all-time high in October.\nThat rally, however, was followed by a steep pullback in the final quarter, reinforcing a familiar Bitcoin pattern: explosive upside followed by rapid retracement. Those two price points, the October peak and the late-year drawdown, form the benchmark against which 2025 predictions can be measured.\nLee also made a fast-timeline Bitcoin call, saying the asset could hit a new all-time high by the end of January 2026 \u2013 even as Bitcoin trades in the mid-$80,000s, well below its October 2025 peak near $126,000 \u2013 while simultaneously backing his broader crypto thesis through BitMine, which recently added nearly $89 million in Ethereum.\nLee\u2019s bullish case centers on untapped demand from institutions and traditional brokerage and retirement accounts enabled by ETFs, arguing that even small allocations from a vast pool of non-holders could meaningfully shift demand.\nThe debate intensified when screenshots began circulating on social media that were attributed to Fundstrat Global Advisors and described as internal 2026 crypto strategy guidance.\nScreenshots shared on X , described as internal 2026 strategy guidance, warn of a sharp pullback in early 2026, with Bitcoin potentially falling to the $60,000\u2013$65,000 range, Ether to around $1,800\u2013$2,000, and Solana to $50\u2013$75 before longer-term opportunities emerge. The screenshots were first shared on X by a user known as Heisenberg (@Mr_Derivatives).\nFundstrat has not publicly released the document, and its authenticity has not been independently verified.\nIn response to claims that Fundstrat was \u201ccontradicting itself,\u201d X user Cassian (@ConvexDispatch) argued that the screenshots reflected differing mandates within the firm rather than a unified forecast reversal.\nTom Lee, the firm\u2019s head of research, focuses on macro cycles, liquidity conditions and longer-term structural trends. By contrast, digital asset strategy lead Sean Farrell oversees crypto portfolio positioning and near-term risk management, while technical analyst Mark Newton concentrates on price structure and trend behavior.\nWhile their frameworks differ, the analysts reportedly share a common view that early 2026 could be volatile for both crypto and broader markets. The divergence lies in implementation: defensive positioning and downside scenarios aimed at navigating potential drawdowns versus a longer-term bullish outlook tied to liquidity and adoption trends.\nObservers pushing back on claims of contradiction argue that short-term caution and long-term optimism are not mutually exclusive, and that the screenshots reflect standard portfolio risk management rather than a reversal of Fundstrat\u2019s broader crypto thesis.\nLee also acknowledged Cassian\u2019s post by writing \u2018Well stated\u2019 on X.\nMoreover, Heisenberg called it a \u2018great explanation .\u2019\nBitcoin\u2019s 2025 performance leaves Lee\u2019s record mixed:\nThe Fundstrat episode underscored how public-facing optimism and internal risk scenarios can coexist, but also how quickly nuance is lost once screenshots enter social media circulation.\nBitcoin investors assessing Lee\u2019s forecasts should distinguish between directional "

With assets under management now at roughly $1.35 billion, the latest flow represents about 0.82% of total AUM, signaling that a meaningful slice of capital is positioning for a rebound in the underlying crypto market.\nSuch an allocation shift is notable given the fund\u2019s leveraged mandate: investors are effectively doubling down on near-term volatility in Bitcoin. The inflow suggests a cohort of traders is viewing recent weakness as an entry point rather than a reason to retreat, even as macro uncertainty and shifting expectations around monetary policy continue to pressure risk assets.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading at $88,918.88. Over the past three months, Bitcoin has dropped about 23.21%, reflecting a sharp consolidation after this year\u2019s earlier rally. Short-term momentum remains fragile, with the 1-day technical signal flashing Sell, underscoring the tension between tactical dip-buying and still-cautious technical readings.\nFor now, the latest flows into BITX highlight that speculative appetite in the crypto derivatives and leveraged ETF space is far from extinguished, even as the broader trend has turned choppy.

                "body": "Strategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR)\u2014the company formerly known as MicroStrategy\u2014heads into the Dec. 22, 2025 U.S. session as one of the market\u2019s most closely watched \u201cBitcoin proxy\u201d equities. The setup is unusually headline-driven right now: fresh Bitcoin purchases, capital-raise/dilution dynamics, index-related flow risks, and company guidance that can swing wildly with Bitcoin\u2019s year-end price.\nAs of the latest available trade data, MSTR closed at $164.82, while Bitcoin traded around $88,633.\nBelow is what matters most for investors before the opening bell.\nThe fastest takeaways for Dec. 22\n- This is still a Bitcoin-linked stock first. When BTC moves sharply, MSTR often moves more\u2014up or down. Reuters has described Strategy\u2019s stock decline this year as closely tied to Bitcoin\u2019s downturn from an October peak. [1]\n- Strategy just reported another ~$1B Bitcoin buy. In an SEC filing, Strategy disclosed it bought 10,645 BTC for $980.3 million at an average price of $92,098 (Dec. 8\u201314), bringing holdings to 671,268 BTC at an average acquisition price of $74,972. [2]\n- Financing and dilution are the core debate. Those buys were funded through the company\u2019s at-the-market program, including sales of MSTR common stock and multiple preferred issues. [3]\n- Index classification risk is rising. MSCI is consulting on whether to exclude companies whose digital-asset holdings exceed 50% of assets from indexes\u2014an issue that could impact passive flows into stocks like Strategy; analysts estimated potential outflows up to $9 billion for Strategy in a downside scenario. [4]\n- Nasdaq-100 risk eased\u2014at least for now. Strategy remains in the Nasdaq 100, with the index changes effective Dec. 22, removing a near-term overhang of forced selling tied to that reshuffle. [5]\n- Company guidance is now explicitly tied to a BTC year-end range. Strategy updated FY2025 guidance using an assumed $85,000\u2013$110,000 BTC price at Dec. 31, with diluted EPS ranging from about -$17 to +$19\u2014a reminder that reported earnings can be extremely BTC-sensitive under fair-value accounting. [6]\nFirst, \u201cStrategy Inc\u201d in plain English\nStrategy completed a rebrand and legal name change from MicroStrategy to Strategy Inc in 2025, but it still trades under MSTR for its Class A common stock. The company also has multiple listed preferred securities (e.g., STRK, STRF, STRD, STRC) that it uses as part of a broader \u201cBitcoin treasury\u201d capital strategy. [7]\nThe practical implication for investors: while Strategy still has an enterprise software business, market pricing is dominated by Bitcoin exposure + the mechanics of how the company funds additional Bitcoin purchases. [8]\nWhere MSTR starts the week: price, BTC, and sentiment\n- MSTR last close: $164.82\n- BTC spot (reference): ~$88,633\nThis matters because Strategy\u2019s own disclosures emphasize how strongly results can track Bitcoin price changes, and recent market coverage continues to frame MSTR as a high-beta way to express a Bitcoin view. [9]\nThe biggest company-specific catalyst: Strategy\u2019s latest Bitcoin purchases\nThe most recent disclosed buy (Dec. 8\u201314)\nIn its SEC filing, Strategy reported it acquired:\n- 10,645 BTC\n- $980.3 million aggregate purchase price\n- $92,098 average purchase price\n- Total holdings: 671,268 BTC\n- Aggregate purchase price: $50.33 billion\n- Average purchase price across holdings: $74,972 [10]\nThe prior week buy (Dec. 1\u20137)\nA separate SEC filing covering the prior week disclosed:\n- 10,624 BTC bought for $962.7 million at an average price of $90,615\n- Holdings at that time: 660,624 BTC [11]\nWhy it matters for Monday: Strategy\u2019s pattern of frequent, very large BTC buys means fresh filings can move the stock, especially if they reveal the pace of equity issuance required to fund purchases.\nThe central investor debate: Bitcoin exposure vs. dilution and funding costs\nHow the buys are being funded\nStrategy\u2019s SEC disclosures show that recent BTC purchases were funded using proceeds from its at-the-market (ATM) program, selling"

                "body": "Ethereum developers officially confirmed the next big 2026 upgrade name: Hegota, which will follow the planned Glamsterdam hard fork. ETH traded largely range-bound on the day of the news, as traders focused more on macro signals and BTC dominance than long-range technical plans. Still, this roadmap matters for anyone who uses Ethereum, as it shapes future fees, network speed, and the perceived weight of running or relying on the chain.\nHegota aligns with Ethereum\u2019s new twice-a-year upgrade rhythm, which already includes upcoming forks such as Pectra and Fusaka in 2025 and Glamsterdam in 2026. According to FastBull, this predictable schedule lets developers ship smaller, safer upgrades instead of giant, risky overhauls every few years.\nWhat Is the Hegota Upgrade and Why Should ETH Holders Care?\nHegota combines two sides of Ethereum\u2019s brain: the execution layer, \u201cBogota\u201d (where transactions and smart contracts run), and the consensus layer, \u201cHeze\u201d (where validators agree on the chain) \u2013 a nice continuation of the Consensus layer tradition of naming upgrades after stars. Think of it like upgrading both the engine and the steering system of the same car in one coordinated visit to the garage. According to Yellow.com, developers plan to release it in late 2026, after Glamsterdam.\nThe big decision still ahead is which feature becomes the \u201cheadline\u201d of Hegota. Developers are expected to choose in early 2026, with front-runners like Verkle Trees and state/history expiry on the table, according to FastBull. These sound technical, but they primarily address one everyday problem: Ethereum is becoming too large and too resource-intensive to store indefinitely.\nEvery transaction, NFT mint, DeFi trade, and meme coin adds to Ethereum\u2019s \u201cstate\u201d, the live database that nodes keep. Look, if you\u2019ve tried to sync a full node lately, you know it\u2019s becoming a nightmare for anyone without a dedicated server rack. Over the years, this \u201cstate bloat\u201d has made it harder and more expensive to run a full node, which risks turning Ethereum into a network that only big players can afford to secure. The Hegota discussion focuses on trimming that weight so more regular users and smaller operators can still participate.\nHaving listened to the ACDE #226 call on Thursday, the urgency for Hegota is clear. As we push toward the 180 million gas limit target by late 2026, the current Merkle Patricia tree structure simply won\u2019t hold the weight. Hegota\u2019s Verkle Tree integration is no longer a \u2018nice-to-have\u2019; it\u2019s the only way to keep solo staking viable as throughput triples.

                "body": "\u2018DeFi is dead\u2019: Maple Finance\u2019s CEO says onchain markets will swallow Wall Street\nThe Maple Finance CEO says institutions will stop distinguishing between DeFi and TradFi as private credit moves onchain, and stablecoins process $50 trillion in payments.\nWhat to know:\n- Maple Finance CEO Sid Powell argues \u201cDeFi is dead\u201d as a separate category, predicting all capital market activity will eventually settle on blockchains.\n- Tokenized private credit, not tokenized treasuries, will be the main growth engine for onchain finance, with DeFi market cap on track to reach $1 trillion.\n- Powell expects a high-profile onchain credit default and a surge in stablecoin payments to $50 trillion in 2026, driven by small businesses and neobanks seeking lower fees.\n\u201cDeFi is dead.\u201d That\u2019s how Maple Finance CEO and co-founder Sid Powell summarizes what he sees coming for crypto over the next few years.\nHowever, this doesn't mean the end of decentralized finance; rather, it is the end of treating DeFi as something separate from traditional markets.\n\u201cIn a couple of years, institutions won\u2019t distinguish between DeFi and TradFi at all,\u201d Powell explained to CoinDesk in an interview. \u201cEventually, all capital markets activity will take place onchain.\u201d\nThink of it this way: before the internet, people would buy goods and services the traditional way \u2014 by going to merchants physically. After the internet and e-commerce revolution, people are still shopping, but the majority is done with just a click or two.\nIn Powell's view, blockchains will play a similar role in the financial services sector. Onchain finance is simply the next technology layer on which global markets will settle, much like the internet changed how people shop.\nMost people and businesses are now relying more on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Alibaba to shop for their goods and services because it's an easier, efficient and sometimes cost-effective way to find the best product or value.\nPowell expects a similar shift in the legacy financial services sector, where crypto becomes the infrastructure for capital markets, with the majority of transactions clearing and settling using public ledgers rather than legacy systems. He also sees more debt capital markets adopting crypto-native structures, including BTC-backed mortgages and other asset-backed securities tied to crypto loans, as well as crypto card issuers whose receivables can be securitized and sold into the capital markets.\nOf course, a proper regulatory framework will need to be established before this pivot occurs.\nAnd who will use this new financial system? Sovereign wealth funds, pension managers, insurers and large asset managers, or \u201cthe managerial class that controls the world\u2019s financial markets,\u201d as Powell puts it, will be the primary holders of this new \u201conchain paper.\u201d\nThis is what Powell means when he says, \"DeFi is dead,\" where the blockchain technology becomes the dominant infrastructure layer, without even thinking twice that people are using a new technology to conduct their everyday financial transactions\nThe $50 trillion reason\nWhile the total overhaul could take time, signs of such change are already being felt across the system.\nTake stablecoins, for example. Following the passage of the GENIUS Act, financial giants are adopting or considering their use en masse. PayPal has launched PYUSD, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has issued euro- and dollar-pegged stablecoins via its crypto unit, and Fiserv has introduced FIUSD for use across payment networks, while Wall Street giants including Bank of America (BAC), Citi and (C) Wells Fargo (WFC) have signaled interest in following suit.\nVisa (V) and Mastercard (MA) aren\u2019t issuing coins, but are building stablecoin settlement rails that could accelerate adoption, and intensify competition with tokenized deposits and other bank-led digital money.\nThis is where Powell\u2019s most aggressive prediction comes in about the new shift in the financial system: stablecoins could process $50 trilli"

Solana is popular as a destination for token trading and internet capital markets, and the network has drawn the attention of several publicly traded firms.\nThe top Solana treasury firms have already snatched up nearly a couple billion dollars' worth of SOL. Here\u2019s a look at the top 5 publicly traded firms that are betting on Solana, based on their current holdings.\n1. Forward Industries - 6,921,432 SOL\nPublicly traded medical design firm Forward Industries currently holds the largest Solana treasury, boasting 6,921,432 SOL. Despite dropping $1.6 billion to pick up the bulk of that sum in September, as of this latest update, the firm\u2019s treasury value has plummeted to $865 million.\nThe firm\u2014propelled by financing from major crypto players like Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital\u2014raised $1.65 billion via a private investment in public equity (PIPE) to establish its treasury just days before acquiring its Solana stash.\nFueled via a mix of on-chain and open-market transactions, Forward aims to differentiate its treasury from others by participating more on-chain and providing what it says is more effective execution for its shareholders. The firm is staking all of the SOL in its treasury, generating yield for its business and shareholders. In Q4, it has so far generated around $4.6 million in staking revenue, according to a December update.\nAfter making its splashy purchase, the firm announced intentions to raise another $4 billion to purchase Solana for its treasury. It recently tokenized shares of the company on the Solana blockchain.\n2. Solana Company - 2,200,000 SOL\nPublicly traded medical device firm Helius Technologies changed its name to Solana Company as it embraced a digital asset treasury strategy centered on SOL.\nLess than a month later, it used the funds to accumulate more than 2.2 million SOL, quickly making it the second-largest publicly traded Solana treasury. Once valued around $500 million, the firm\u2019s treasury is now worth around $275 million.\nShares in the firm grew by 141% after its initial raise announcement, but retraced after it made its first purchase. Despite a gain of more than 220% in the month following its strategy shift, HSDT is still down around 99% year-to-date.\nIn Q3, the firm brought in its first revenue from staking rewards, netting $342,000. At the end of the quarter, it held $124 million in cash.\n3. DeFi Development Corp. - 2,195,926 SOL\nA real estate software firm turned Solana treasury company, DeFi Development Corporation is the second-largest publicly traded Solana treasury\u2014narrowly edging out a pair of others that sit not far below on the list.\nThe firm holds just shy of 2.2 million SOL, worth almost $275 million at today\u2019s Solana price, accumulating the amount across various purchases since establishing its treasury strategy in April.\nDeFi Development Corp. has been of the most active of the treasury firms on the list, becoming increasingly ingrained within Solana\u2019s community through its acquisition of a Solana validator company and collaborations with leading meme coins like BONK.\nIn June, it established a $5 billion equity line of credit to fuel strategic Solana purchases. In December, it publicly signaled support for a new Solana Improvement Proposal (SIMD) that would lower the network\u2019s inflation rate, producing fewer SOL tokens annually.\n4. Upexi - 2,106,989 SOL\nConsumer products firm Upexi also debuted its Solana treasury strategy in April, spiking shares of UPXI more than 300% i"

Historically, surpassing the 20-day EMA has often preceded such rallies, reinforcing the bullish case.\nNevertheless, CryptoCeek cautions that a firm rejection at the $0.50 support could push ADA back below its 20-day EMA, reigniting selling pressure and risking a drop toward lower support. The current price is $0.363.\nCardano\u2019s Hoskinson Eyes XRP Community with Bold DeFi Summit Proposal\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson has stunned the crypto world by turning his focus to the XRP community, proposing a DeFi summit at the University of Edinburgh. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, Hoskinson sparked excitement about potential cross-chain collaboration and the future of defi.\nHoskinson\u2019s proposal signals a strategic shift from single-chain ecosystems to multi-chain collaboration, aligning with a growing trend among developers. By engaging the XRP community, he highlights XRP\u2019s strengths in payments, tokenization, and DeFi, creating a stage for innovation and cross-platform partnerships.\nTherefore, XRP finds itself at a pivotal moment since Solana\u2019s recent integration underscores its growing network influence and cross-chain interoperability.\nAs Ethereum\u2019s DeFi dominance shows strain, emerging ecosystems like Cardano, Solana, and XRP-backed platforms are staking their claim, emphasizing real-world utility and broader recognition."

By November, SOL fell 32%, while the overall altcoin market decline was 21%.\nSolana Faces Structural Problems Despite Institutional Support\nSolana continues to see institutional investment, with US-based SOL ETFs gathering $636 million in assets since July, and various publicly traded companies adding over 20 million SOL to their balance sheets. About 68% of circulating supply remains staked, yielding over 6%. Yet, price signals a different message, as SOL moves towards $120 with deteriorating fundamentals.\nThere has been a steady drop in on-chain activities since August, with weekly transaction fees down to $4.5 million from $7 million, and decreases in the revenue of decentralized applications by 30%, down to $26 million per week. This contrasts with huge increases seen in Ethereum-layer 2 scaling solutions like Base and Arbitrum.\nAs the level of competition grows, the SOL whale distribution pattern indicates rising doubts about the ability to regain dominance. Investors seeking to identify the best crypto to buy today to benefit from their investments are turning to this new token.\nMutuum Finance Poises Itself to Offer an Attractive DeFi Alternative\nAs capital looks for the next big opportunity in crypto, Mutuum Finance is making waves as a DeFi crypto with promising prospects for meeting the demand for sustainable yields and cryptocurrency loans. The presale has already seen a total of $19,500,000 raised, and there are a total of 18,550 Total MUTM Holders since the presale started. The current phase, which is phase 6, is already filled to a tune of 99%, with a current price per unit at $0.035, which has appreciated by 250% from $0.01 at phase one.\nPhase 6 is already selling out quickly, and this means that the chances of investing at this price are limited. When Phase 7 begins, prices will be increasing by 20% to $0.04, compared to the Fixed MUTM launch price, which is set at $0.06. Given this pace, it can be realized that initial investors look forward to seeing a 420% growth rate after it is launched. Moving past the pricing dynamics, the factors that attract everyone to Mutuum Finance are based on several prime selling points.\nFirst, the lending and borrowing system on the Mutuum protocol is undergoing an audit, and Halborn Security is reviewing the finalized smart contracts. Second, the Mutuum team recently launched a live dashboard with a top 50 holders leaderboard and a 24-hour leaderboard, which resets every day at 00:00 UTC. With the new system, the best-performing individual each day receives a $500 MUTM reward for at least one transaction.\nThe Narrow Window for Early Action\nGiven that whales on Solana have been decreasing their holding and that on-chain activity is supporting other blockchains instead, Mutuum Finance is rising as the best crypto to buy today presently for those looking for asymmetric potential. Phase 6 is largely sold out and is the last chance for investment at $0.035 before prices rise. With increasing momentum in the presale stage, this may well be the last opportunity for investment in a cryptocurrency that is rising as the new narrative for 2025.\nFor more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance"

                "body": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is heading into the Christmas trading week with a familiar end\u2011of\u2011year mix: upbeat annual performance, a choppy December tape, and a market narrative that keeps pivoting between \u201cSanta rally\u201d optimism and late\u2011cycle caution.\nThe Dow last closed at 48,134.89 on Friday, finishing the day higher but ending the week modestly lower as investors weighed fresh inflation data, AI\u2011linked volatility, and a Federal Reserve outlook that\u2019s becoming more contested inside the central bank itself. [1]\nDow Jones today: strong year, uneven December\nIn 2025, the big picture still looks constructive. The blue\u2011chip Dow is up more than 13% year\u2011to\u2011date, according to a CBS News roundup of Wall Street\u2019s 2026 outlook published this week\u2014an advance that places the index among the best multi\u2011year runs in decades for U.S. equities. [2]\nBut the near\u2011term view is more complicated. Reuters\u2019 latest \u201cWeek Ahead\u201d market column notes that December has been softer than seasonal averages, even as major U.S. indexes remain near record levels\u2014a dynamic that\u2019s keeping both institutional money and retail traders laser\u2011focused on whether the market can squeeze out a final push into year\u2011end. [3]\nThat\u2019s where the \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d comes in.\nThe Santa rally question \u2014 and why it matters for the Dow\nHistorically, the \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d refers to the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of January, a window in which the S&P 500 has averaged gains of about 1.3% since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac data cited by Reuters. In 2025, Reuters notes that period begins Wednesday and runs through Jan. 5. [4]\nWhile the Santa rally statistic is usually quoted for the S&P 500, it often shapes sentiment across the entire U.S. stock market\u2014including the Dow\u2014because it influences positioning, \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d and risk appetite during one of the thinnest liquidity periods of the year.\nCharles Schwab\u2019s weekly trading outlook flags exactly that: the coming week is holiday\u2011shortened, trading volume is expected to be light, and that can increase volatility even if headlines are quiet. Schwab\u2019s base case leans \u201cslightly bullish,\u201d but it also warns that price action could stay choppy. [5]\nWhat moved the Dow last week: AI nerves, tech rebound, and consumer-stock whiplash\nFriday delivered a clean example of how quickly the market\u2019s tone can flip.\nReuters and the Associated Press both reported that U.S. stocks rallied into the weekend as AI\u2011linked tech names bounced, helping lift the major averages. The Dow rose about 183 points on Friday to finish at 48,134.89, while Nvidia and other chip\u2011linked stocks strengthened. [6]\nAt the same time, the Dow\u2019s defensive \u201cblue\u2011chip\u201d image can be misleading in a price\u2011weighted index. A single large move in a high\u2011priced component can swing the whole benchmark. MarketWatch recently underlined the math: each $1 move in any Dow component equals roughly 6.16 points on the index\u2014so sharp drops in stocks like Caterpillar or Nvidia can have an outsized impact on the day\u2019s headline number. [7]\nKiplinger\u2019s market recap added more context to the late\u2011week rebound: it highlighted tech strength, including a jump in Oracle on deal-related news, while also noting a sharp decline in Nike following earnings\u2014another reminder that \u201cDow stocks\u201d can diverge dramatically even when the index itself looks calm. [8]\nThe two forces shaping Dow sentiment right now\n1) The AI trade is still driving direction \u2014 but the mood is more selective\nReuters\u2019 Week Ahead analysis says two themes have recently driven equity swings: ongoing scrutiny of corporate spending tied to AI infrastructure, and shifting expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2026. It specifically notes that questions around a large Oracle data\u2011center project weighed on tech and AI\u2011related stocks during the week. [9]\nWhat\u2019s new is not that AI matters, but that investors appear to be moving from a \u201cbuy anything AI-adjacent\u201d mindset to a more selec"

                "body": "FRANKFURT \u2014 December 21, 2025. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange heads into the final stretch of the year with a familiar year\u2011end cocktail: optimism about easier monetary policy, anxiety about pricey \u201cmegatrends,\u201d and the quiet, slightly eerie market microstructure of holiday trading\u2014thin liquidity, bigger price gaps, and headlines that can move indices more than they \u201cshould.\u201d\nGoing into the weekend, European equities finished at record territory, and Germany\u2019s DAX ended Friday higher\u2014keeping the psychologically important 24,000\u2011point level in play just before the Christmas shutdown. [1]\nWhat matters now for anyone watching B\u00f6rse Frankfurt and Xetra is less \u201cwhat happened today\u201d (it\u2019s Sunday, after all) and more: what the Frankfurt market looks like when it reopens into a two\u2011day Christmas week, which data points can still surprise investors, and how the DAX index family changes and Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s strategic moves could shape flows into year\u2011end and early 2026. [2]\nWhere the Frankfurt market stands heading into Christmas week\nFriday\u2019s tone across Europe was constructive. Reuters reported the pan\u2011European STOXX 600 rose 0.4% to 587.50 and ended the week up 1.7%, while Germany\u2019s DAX was also up 0.4%. [3]\nThat upbeat finish came after a choppy mid\u2011December stretch, with investors juggling two big narratives that Frankfurt traders know well:\n- Rates tailwind: softer inflation data (especially in the U.S.) has kept expectations alive for further U.S. rate cuts, while the ECB has held rates steady\u2014supportive for equity valuations. [4]\n- Valuation nerves (especially tech/AI): markets are still sensitive to any sign that the growth implied by big\u2011ticket AI spending won\u2019t arrive fast enough. [5]\nOn levels, multiple market roundups put the DAX around the 24,280\u201324,290 area at the latest close\u2014close enough to keep \u201cyear\u2011high\u201d chatter alive, even if the next few sessions may be more about liquidity than conviction. [6]\nThe big 2025 story on B\u00f6rse Frankfurt: AI + defence + rates\nIf you need a one\u2011line summary of why German equities performed strongly this year, dpa\u2011AFX\u2019s year\u2011end weekly outlook is blunt: \u201cartificial intelligence and defence\u201d have been the boom themes, helping the DAX gain more than a fifth in 2025. [7]\nReuters made the same point from a pan\u2011European angle: defence stocks were among the drivers behind the record\u2011high STOXX 600 close, and banks have also been powerful performers. [8]\nFor Frankfurt specifically, this mix matters because it tends to concentrate leadership into a few heavyweight narratives:\n- Defence and security (a theme that has spilled into Europe\u2019s broader industrial complex)\n- AI \u201ccapex\u201d winners and enablers (software, chips, industrial automation)\n- Financials (benefiting from a still\u2011supportive rate structure and \u201cdiscount\u201d valuation arguments in Europe) [9]\nThe risk, of course, is that the same concentration makes the index more brittle if sentiment turns\u2014especially in holiday conditions.\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange trading calendar: what\u2019s open, what\u2019s closed, and why it matters\nHoliday trading is not just a scheduling footnote\u2014it\u2019s a market regime change.\nCash market: Xetra and B\u00f6rse Frankfurt non\u2011trading days (end of 2025)\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s official Trading calendar 2025 for Xetra and B\u00f6rse Frankfurt shows the key year\u2011end exceptions clearly: no trading on 24, 25, 26, and 31 December (among other public holidays earlier in the year). It also notes that 24 and 31 December are settlement days. [10]\nThe B\u00f6rse Frankfurt \u201cTrading Hours and Trading Calendar\u201d page likewise lists Christmas Eve (Dec 24) and New Year\u2019s Eve (Dec 31) among the non\u2011trading days, with settlement open when those dates don\u2019t fall on a weekend. [11]\nTrading hours: Xetra vs. the Frankfurt specialist model\nFrom Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s own trading calendar guidance:\n- Xetra: Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. CET (with auctions around the open and close). [12]\n- Frankfurt Stock Exchange specialist trading: generally 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. CET"

                "body": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide eBay with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\neBay's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Recognition must be given to the that eBay has grown EPS by 57% per year, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for eBay remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 4.4% to US$11b. That's progress.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nCheck out our latest analysis for eBay\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for eBay.\nAre eBay Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$38b company like eBay. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$102m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors."

                "body": "Date: Sunday, December 21, 2025\nON Semiconductor Corporation (onsemi) heads into a holiday-shortened trading week with two unusual forces likely to dominate price action: (1) index-driven flows tied to ON\u2019s removal from the Nasdaq-100, and (2) a steady drumbeat of strategic announcements aimed at power semiconductors for AI infrastructure, EVs, and industrial energy systems.\nAs of the latest close, ON stock finished at $55.21. [1]\nWhile fundamentals matter over time, the coming week could be shaped by liquidity (thin holiday trading), rebalancing mechanics, and headline sensitivity\u2014especially around onsemi\u2019s expanding presence in gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) power devices.\nBelow is a comprehensive week-ahead briefing (Dec. 22\u201326), including the latest news, analyst forecasts, and technical signals available as of Dec. 21, 2025.\nON stock snapshot heading into the week\n- Last close: $55.21 [2]\n- 52-week range:$31.04 \u2013 $67.95 [3]\n- Market cap (intraday estimate, widely reported): about $22\u201323B [4]\n- Notable trading feature: Friday\u2019s volume was unusually large (tens of millions of shares), consistent with index and derivatives activity heading into the Nasdaq-100 effective date and the broader \u201cquadruple witching\u201d period referenced by Nasdaq around the reconstitution timing. [5]\nThis matters because heavy volume around index events can distort short-term moves\u2014creating sharp one- or two-day swings that don\u2019t always reflect a change in business conditions.\nThe biggest near-term catalyst: ON exits the Nasdaq-100 effective Monday, Dec. 22\nThe headline most likely to affect the week-ahead tape is straightforward:\n- Nasdaq announced that ON Semiconductor will be removed from the Nasdaq-100 Index as part of the annual reconstitution, effective prior to market open on Monday, December 22, 2025. [6]\n- Reuters also reported the change and noted the effective date of Dec. 22. [7]\nWhy the Nasdaq-100 removal can move ON stock (even without \u201cnew\u201d fundamentals)\nBeing removed from a major index can trigger mechanical selling from funds that track it (directly or via derivatives). Nasdaq emphasized that the Nasdaq-100 underpins 200+ tracking products with over $600B in assets under management, including the Invesco QQQ Trust. [8]\nThat doesn\u2019t mean ON stock must fall\u2014markets often price in these changes ahead of time, and much of the forced trading can concentrate near the reconstitution window. But it does raise the odds of:\n- outsized moves early in the week, especially Monday;\n- wider bid/ask spreads in thin holiday liquidity;\n- short-lived dislocations (quick drops and rebounds) as liquidity providers and opportunistic buyers step in.\nWeek-ahead implication: If ON moves sharply on Monday, investors will be watching whether it looks like flow-driven pressure (fast, volume-heavy, then stabilizing) or a sentiment shift that persists beyond the rebalancing event.\nCompany headlines investors are digesting now\nonsemi has been active with announcements centered on next-generation power technologies. For the week ahead, these headlines function as sentiment anchors\u2014especially if the broader semiconductor group moves on AI-infrastructure narratives.\n1) $6 billion share repurchase authorization (starts Jan. 1, 2026)\nIn mid-November, onsemi announced its board authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program, scheduled to begin January 1, 2026 and expected to run over three years. [9]\nThe company also described the move as a scaling up from the prior three-year period in which it repurchased about $2.1B of stock. [10]\nWeek-ahead read-through: Even though the authorization begins after this week, buyback headlines can help frame market thinking\u2014particularly during volatility around the Nasdaq-100 removal\u2014because buybacks are often viewed as a potential demand backstop (though timing and pace are at management\u2019s discretion).\n2) GaN push accelerates: collaboration with GlobalFoundries\nonsemi and GlobalFoundries announced a collaboration"

                "body": "In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Visteon Corporation (NASDAQ:VC) shareholders, since the share price is down 22% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 87%. Furthermore, it's down 20% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.\nIf the past week is anything to go by, investor sentiment for Visteon isn't positive, so let's see if there's a mismatch between fundamentals and the share price.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nAlthough the share price is down over three years, Visteon actually managed to grow EPS by 38% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\nIt's worth taking a look at other metrics, because the EPS growth doesn't seem to match with the falling share price.\nThe modest 1.1% dividend yield is unlikely to be guiding the market view of the stock. The company has kept revenue pretty healthy over the last three years, so we doubt that explains the falling share price. We're not entirely sure why the share price is dropped, but it does seem likely investors have become less optimistic about the business.\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nVisteon is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Visteon stock, you should check out this freereport showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.\nA Different Perspective\nVisteon provided a TSR of 17% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. The silver lining is that the share price is up in the short term, which flies in the face of the annualised loss of 4% over the last five years. While 'turnarounds seldom turn' there are green shoots for Visteon. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Visteon (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Visteon might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

Tim Walz continues to take heat for his handling of the debacle.\nBy comparison to the $9 billion figure, Somalia\u2019s entire GDP was under $12 billion last year, according to the World Bank.\n\u201cThe magnitude cannot be overstated,\u201d First Assistant US Attorney Joe Thompson said Thursday of the tentacles of the fraud. \u201cWhat we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It\u2019s staggering, industrial-scale fraud.\n\u201cEvery day, we look under a rock and find a new $50 million fraud scheme.\u201d\nThe scheme saw dozens of people \u2014 the vast majority from Minnesota\u2019s Somali community \u2014 setting up businesses and non-profits that claimed to provide services such as housing, food or healthcare assistance and then billing the federally funded state programs for the non-existent services.\nThe fraud was so enormous that it went beyond the over-billing tactics typically seen in similar fraud cases and instead saw people setting up entire operations \u2014 sometimes coming from out of state \u2014 to get in on the goldrush of fraud opportunity, Thompson explained.\nCharges for six more people allegedly involved in the scheme were announced Thursday, bringing the total number of defendants up to 92.\nAmong the latest defendants were two people who engaged in what Thompson called \u201cfraud tourism\u201d by allegedly travelling from Philadelphia to set up a bogus housing aid program after spotting an opportunity to make \u201ceasy money\u201d off Minnesota\u2019s programs.\nAnthony Waddell Jefferson, 37, and Lester Brown, 53, allegedly visited Minnesota shelters and affordable housing to establish a reputation as local \u201chousing guys\u201d with an aid business, then hired a network of family members and associates to write up fake client notes and submit them to the state for reimbursement.\nIn total, they submitted $3.5 million worth of claims with the state\u2019s Housing Stability Services Program and claimed to help around 230 clients, according to prosecutors.\nAnother recently charged suspect was Abdinajib Hassan Yussuf, 27, who allegedly set up a youth autism foundation which claimed to provide therapy for children on the spectrum.\nIn reality, Yussuf allegedly paid local parents to sign their kids up for the program regardless of their mental conditions and then billed the state for fake services provided.\nYussuf\u2019s program obtained about $6 million in reimbursements, prosecutors alleged.\nAnother defendant \u2014 28-year-old Asha Farhan Hassan \u2014 allegedly participated in another autism scheme that made off with $14 million in bogus reimbursements while also pocketing just under $500,000 for participating in a separate scam preying on Minnesota\u2019s food program Feeding Our Future.\n\u201cRoughly two dozen or so Feeding Our Future defendants were getting money from autism clinics,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we learned about the autism fraud.\u201d\nThe scandal began unraveling around 2022 when Feeding Our Future came under scrutiny, but it was only in recent months that the full scope of the alleged fraud began to come into focus.\nStart your day with all you need to know\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nThanks for signing up!\nMuch of the funds were sent overseas or else were spent on luxury cars and other lavish items.\nSo far, 57 people have been convicted.\nThe scheme prompted a White House crackdown on immigration in Minnesota, with President Trump calling Somalis \u201cg"

                "body": "Japan's Nikkei jumps on weaker yen, renewed AI optimism\nBy Rocky Swift\nJapan's Nikkei share average jumped for a second day on Monday, buoyed by a weaker yen and renewed enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI) investments.\nThe Nikkei 225 Index NI225 soared 2% to 50,480.76 by the midday break, after a 1% gain on Friday. The broader Topix TOPIX rose 0.8%.\nU.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, helped in part by strong forecasts from chipmaker Micron Technology MU that re-ignited optimism around AI-related shares.\nSoftBank Group 9984, a major Japanese investor in AI, jumped 5.1%. Reuters reported on Saturday that the company was racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by year-end.\n\"Last week saw gains in U.S. shares driven by positive news related to semiconductors and AI,\" said Maki Sawada, an equities strategist at Nomura Securities. \"That momentum is also visible in today's Japanese stock market.\"\nThe Bank of Japan on Friday raised its key interest rate to a three-decade high. Japanese bond yields surged, and the yen weakened sharply, as BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda was not as hawkish about policy tightening as markets had anticipated.\n\"Normally, rising interest rates should weigh on the stock market,\" Sawada said. \"However, the rise in Japanese shares appears to be driven by expectations that economic policy measures, specifically proactive fiscal policy, will lead to an improving economy.\"\nThere were 133 advancers on the Nikkei index against 89 decliners. The largest gainers in the index were Resonac Holdings 4004, up 7.8%, followed by Mitsui Kinzoku 5706, a key supplier to the AI sector, which jumped 7.7%.\nThe largest losers by percentage in the index were NH Foods Ltd 2282, down 4.3%, followed by SHIFT 3697, which slid 4%."

Sentiment got a lift from US chip optimism after Micron issued upbeat guidance, reinforcing the idea that AI spending is still ramping up. In Japan, SoftBank shares climbed after Reuters reported it\u2019s seeking a roughly $22.5 billion funding commitment for OpenAI by year-end. Meanwhile, the BoJ pushed its policy rate to a three-decade high, but the yen still weakened as investors read Governor Kazuo Ueda as less hawkish t..\nhan feared \u2013 easing worries of an aggressive hiking path.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: AI is back in the driver\u2019s seat.\nJapan\u2019s rally shows how quickly investors will look past tighter policy when the AI story strengthens. That can keep a bid under semiconductor-linked and tech-adjacent names, especially if global demand keeps surprising to the upside. But it also raises the stakes: if earnings don\u2019t catch up to expectations, the most AI-exposed pockets of the market can swing hardest.\nZooming out: Japan is trying to hike without killing the party.\nHigher yields usually make bonds more competitive versus stocks, but Japan has had two buffers \u2013 a weaker currency and the hope that growth-friendly policies persist. A cheaper yen can boost exporters\u2019 reported profits when overseas sales are converted back into yen. The longer-term question is whether wage and inflation momentum forces the BoJ to keep tightening \u2013 and whether corporate profit growth can do more of the heavy lifting than headlines about big AI funding rounds.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
