                "body": "Gold's increase of 71% this year has far outpaced the S&P 500, which has risen by just 18%.\nNEW YORK -- Gold is having its best year since 1979.\nGold futures traded in New York have soared almost 71% this year, on pace for their best annual gain in 46 years. The last time gold had such a strong year, Jimmy Carter was president, a crisis was unfolding in the Middle East, inflation was soaring and the United States was in the midst of an energy crisis.\nToday, tariffs are distorting international trade, conflict is raging with Russia's war on Ukraine, there have been flare-ups between Israel and Iran and the US is seizing oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela. In times of uncertainty, investors turn to safe havens like gold.\nGold is considered a resilient investment, with investors expecting the yellow metal will retain its value in crisis, if inflation surges, or if currencies drop in value.\n\"Uncertainty remains a defining feature of the global economy,\" said Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council. \"In this environment, gold has become increasingly appealing as a strategic diversifier and a source of stability.\"\nFor some investors, gold's flaw is that it does not pay income like bonds. But when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as it's been doing over the past few months, bond yields tend to fall, making gold more appealing.\nGold futures traded around $2,640 a troy ounce at the start of this year. The yellow metal climbed above a record high $4,500 a troy ounce on Monday. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase expect prices to rise above $5,000 a troy ounce in 2026.\nGold's increase of 71% this year has far outpaced the S&P 500, which has risen by just 18%. In 2024, gold futures gained 27% while the S&P rose by 24%.\nExpectations for some Fed rate cuts in 2026 are supporting gold's rise. A weaker US dollar is helping boost the price, too, as it makes buying gold relatively more affordable for international investors.\nGold jewelers and people who own gold jewelry are benefiting from higher prices. And the gold rush isn't just fueled by Americans snapping up gold bars from Costco - it's countries buying gold by the ton.\nCentral banks and geopolitics\nGold's rise has been underpinned by central banks buying up more gold themselves, led by China.\nOne of the main reasons China's central bank is increasing its gold holdings is to decrease reliance on American assets like US Treasury bonds and the dollar, according to Ulf Lindahl, CEO at Currency Research Associates.\nThe shift became noticeable after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Western governments moved to freeze Russian assets denominated in US dollars, prompting governments in Russia - as well as China - to look for ways to decrease exposure to American policy decisions, Lindahl said.\n\"The current wave of central-bank buying is different precisely because it is rooted in geopolitics,\" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note. \"The freezing of sovereign reserves and the broader fragmentation of the global financial system have introduced a structural element to gold demand that is likely to persist for years.\"\nCentral banks around the globe have accumulated over 1,000 tons of gold in each of the last three years, compared with an average of 400 to 500 tons per year across the previous decade, according to the World Gold Council.\nPrecious metals shine in 2025\nGold's ascent has been followed by other precious metals such as silver, platinum and palladium.\nSilver futures have soared a whopping 146% this year, while platinum futures have gained almost 150% and palladium futures have gained 100%.\nFor investors, precious metals serve as \"a hedge against an increasingly uncertain world,\" according to Hakan Kaya, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman.\nThat trend could continue. Lindahl at Currency Research Associates said he expects gold to keep rising in 2026. With central banks increasing their gold reserves, it can leave less bullion c"

                "body": "Gold smashes past $4,500 as silver explodes above $75 in year-end rally\nGold and silver hit historic milestones Friday, capping a blistering year-end rally driven by bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts, a sliding US dollar and intensifying global tensions that sent investors scrambling for hard assets.\nGold surged past $4,500 an ounce \u2014 cementing its strongest annual performance since 1979 \u2014 while silver surpassed the $75 threshold for the first time ever.\nSpot gold touched a record $4,530.60 an ounce earlier in the session, according to market data, before easing slightly but staying firmly above the once-unthinkable $4,500 mark, Bloomberg noted.\nThe precious metal is now up roughly 73% for the year \u2014 crowning a seemingly relentless climb that accelerated sharply in the final months of 2025.\nThe rally has been powered in large part by expectations that the Federal Reserve is preparing to pivot into an easing cycle, slashing interest rates as economic momentum cools.\nLower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold, making bullion more attractive relative to bonds and cash.\nAt the same time, a weaker US dollar has amplified the move, making gold cheaper for overseas buyers and fueling fresh waves of global demand.\nSafe-haven buying has also surged amid rising geopolitical risks, with investors reacting to heightened tensions involving Venezuela, ongoing instability in the Middle East, war in Eastern Europe and recent US military strikes in Nigeria.\nExplore Top Silver IRAs\nAmerican Hartford Gold offers a diverse range of investment-grade silver products, including popular options like American Silver Eagles, Canadian Maple Leafs, and high-weight silver bars up to 100 oz. Designed for both collectors and long-term investors, these IRA-eligible silver assets provide a strategic way to diversify and protect wealth against inflation and economic uncertainty.\nGoldco is a trusted precious metals firm, helping investors place over $3 billion in gold and silver, earning an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and high marks for customer satisfaction. With offers like up to 10% in free silver on qualified accounts and expert guidance, Goldco makes it easy to protect retirement savings with physical precious metals.\nPatriot Gold Group empowers investors to \u201cget started in gold & silver\u201d through a streamlined, 3\u2011step IRA process that enables physical delivery or secure private storage of precious metals. The company also offers a No Fees for Life IRA option, works directly with clients rather than passing through multiple layers of markup, and positions itself as America\u2019s #1 Gold IRA dealer\nCentral banks have played an outsized role as well, continuing an aggressive accumulation spree that has tightened supply in the physical market.\nLed by China, India and Poland, central banks have now bought more than 1,000 metric tons of gold for a third straight year, according to industry estimates, underscoring a broad push to diversify reserves away from the dollar.\nThat steady official-sector buying has provided a powerful backstop under prices, even during brief pullbacks.\nSilver is now up an eye-popping 150% to 160% for the year, more than double gold\u2019s already historic gains and one of the most explosive runs in modern commodity-market history.\nLike gold, silver has benefited from expectations of easier monetary policy and its role as a store of value during periods of uncertainty."

Some or all links may be monetized.\nThe record inflation Americans faced in the summer of 2022 may now feel like a thing of the past. But DoubleLine Capital founder Jeffrey Gundlach \u2014 widely known as the \u201cBond King\u201d \u2014 warns that price pressures could resurface.\nMust Read\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake \u2014 here\u2019s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nNo time to lower your crippling car insurance rate? Here\u2019s how to do it within minutes \u2014 you could end up paying $29/month without a single phone call\nIn a recent CNBC interview, Gundlach pointed to what he called \u201ca remarkable divergence of views\u201d at the Federal Reserve.\nThe Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at September\u2019s meeting. But projections vary widely [2]: while the median Federal Open Market Committee member expects two more quarter-point cuts this year, one projects a full 1.25 percentage points of easing \u2014 five quarter-point cuts in total.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a little disturbing for the inflation outlook,\u201d Gundlach said. He added that if President Donald Trump replaces Fed chair Jerome Powell with someone more willing to follow his push for steeper rate cuts, the U.S. could end up \u201crunning a more inflationary policy.\u201d\nAs a result, Gundlach believes there\u2019s \u201crisk of higher inflation\u201d ahead \u2014 and he sees trouble brewing for the dollar as well.\n\u2018Anti-dollar\u2019 theme\nFew would dispute the U.S. dollar\u2019s role as the world\u2019s dominant reserve currency. Yet, 2025 has been brutal for the greenback: the U.S. Dollar Index \u2014 which measures the value of the dollar relative to a basket of major foreign currencies \u2014 tumbled 10.8% in the first half of the year, marking its worst performance since 1973, when Richard Nixon was president [3].\n\u201cI just think that the dollar is going to be continuing to decline,\u201d Gundlach said, noting a \u201cbig anti-dollar theme\u201d running through markets.\nAnd while the U.S. stock market has notched new highs lately, Gundlach remains unconvinced.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really like U.S. stocks as a dollar-based investor,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve felt that way all year and I continue to feel that way.\u201d\nThe silver lining? Gundlach also sees assets that can offer protection.\nGold\nFor Gundlach, one asset stands out.\n\u201cI still think gold serves a purpose in portfolios,\u201d he said, adding that a sizeable allocation makes sense. \u201cI still think a 25% type of weighting [in gold] in portfolios is not excessive. Because I think that is an insurance policy and it\u2019s in a winning mode because of the weaker dollar \u2014 and I believe that\u2019s going to continue.\u201d\nGiven his warning about inflation, the call is hardly surprising. Gold has long been considered a hedge against rising prices and currency weakness \u2014 unlike fiat money, it can\u2019t be created at will by central banks.\nThe metal\u2019s recent performance supports his case. Over the past 12 months, gold has jumped more than 40%. And Gundlach expects the rally to continue: \u201cI think almost certainly gold will close above $4,000 [an ounce] before the end of this year.\u201d\nAnd sure enough, it passed that milestone in October 2025.\nRead more: Warren Buffett used 8 simple money rules to turn $9,800 into a stunning $150B \u2014 start using them today to get rich (and then stay rich)\nA gold IRA is one option for building up your retirement fund with an inflation-hedging asset.\nOpening a gold IRA with the help of Goldco allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms while also providing the significant tax advantages of an IRA.\nWith a minimum purchase of $10,000, Goldco offers free shipping and access to a library of retirement resources.

                "body": "One of the big surprises of 2025 was OPEC+ abandoning efforts to prop up the price of oil.\nFor years, OPEC had been a strong market backstop, managing supply to maintain a floor under crude. However, a combination of eroding market share, resilient non-OPEC production finally forced a change in strategy and perhaps a nudge from US President Trump led to an abrupt change of strategy.\nThe shift began in the spring of 2025, when Saudi Arabia and its allies signaled they were no longer willing to shoulder the burden of production cuts while producers in the US, Guyana, and Brazil continued to hit record output levels. By mid-year, the 'price-over-volume' mantra was replaced by a more aggressive pursuit of market share, reminiscent of the 2014 price war.\nInternal tensions reached a breaking point as several member nations, notably Iraq and Kazakhstan, repeatedly overproduced their assigned quotas. Frustrated by the lack of discipline, the core leadership decided that a period of lower prices would serve as a 'reset' to force adherence to future agreements.\nOPEC may have also wanted to punish US shale players (the source of all supply growth in the past decade) for the 'drill, baby, drill' mantra.\nToday, WTI crude fell $1.61 to $56.74. That wipes out the gains on Monday/Tuesday and leaves oil flat on the week and it continues to sit close to five year lows.\nAs we move toward 2026, the question is no longer when OPEC+ will cut again, but how long they can tolerate the fiscal pain of sub-$70 oil in their quest to reassert dominance over the global energy landscape. Ultimately, the cure for low prices is low prices. US shale producers cut drilling budgets and will continue to do so. Few are making money below $60 WTI as costs have far outstripped crude prices since covid.\nMy guess is that buying crude will be one of the great trades of 2026 -- similar to how it was in late 2020. The question is 'when to buy?'. There is a school of argument that all the excess oil is already priced in and that global balances aren't as bad as they seem. I'll be sympathetic to that argument if we can get through the winter without a disorderly oil breakdown. So I believe the trade will be to buy a puke in the oil market below $40 or to wait until April when the seasonals begin to improve."

                "body": "This post reviews my method for estimating output from tight oil and shale gas plays. The basic method involves convolution which sounds complicated (pr perhaps convoluted) but is fairly simple to accomplish using a spreadsheet. It may be helpful to review my post on this from over 11 years ago at this link.\nThe two charts above show the average Permian Basin wells by year of first flow from 2010 to 2016 for both tight oil and shale gas for all horizontal wells completed in the Permian Basin, I used the well quality tab in a post by Enno Peters linked here to grab these charts. Links directly to these charts are here for first chart and here for second chart. At each of these links the data can be explored in greater detail.\nThe second pair of charts shows average Permian Basin well profiles by year of first flow from 2016 to 2023 for both tight oil and shale gas. Links to the charts are here for tight oil and here for shale gas. Note that after 2020 for tight oil and 2021 for shale gas the well profiles stop increasing and in the case of tight oil decrease after 2022. These charts are not normalized for lateral length. The average lateral length has been increasing from 2010 to 2023, after 2016 the EUR of tight oil for the average Permian tight oil well when normalized to 10 thousand lateral feet has been decreasing since 2016 at roughly 2% per year.\nConvolution\nWe start with an average well profile in our simple model, this is the average 2022 Permian Basin tight oil well profile.\nThen we have a chart representing the number of new wells added each month.\nWells are added from month 1 to month 129 in this scenario, the spreadsheet with the scenario can be downloaded here. This represents a very low price scenario, WTI under $45/b in 2025$.\nFor the shale gas output for the scenario above we use the same chart for new wells added as presented earlier, but use the shale gas well profile below.\nThe spreadsheet is here for this shale gas scenario.\nThe GOR for this scenario (in second spreadsheet) is below.\nTo create a more realistic scenario we can use three scenarios and stitch them together as we need about 300 months or more to create a realistic scenario with about 108 thousand completed wells for a low oil price scenario (WTI is $65/b or less). For tight oil the results of the three spreadsheets are combined in the first here, the second spreadsheet (convolution 2) is here, and the third spreadsheet (convolution 3) is here. For the shale gas scenario there are also three spreadsheets, one, two, and three.\nThis is the number of new wells added per month for the scenario, note that the tight oil and shale gas well profile is unchanged from the short 129 month scenario (very low price scenario). The convolution spreadsheets result in the following output for tight oil and shale gas, see chart below.\nThe tight oil scenario has a URR of 47 Gb and the shale gas scenario has a URR of 219 TCF.\nThe Chart above shows the GOR for the low price scenario presented in the previous chart, total wells completed for the scenario is 108 thousand wells. The URR for this scenario is optimistic because no degradation of new well EUR is assumed after 2021, pressure depletion has been evident since at least 2022 and probably started in 2017 (but is hidden by increasing lateral length), when we account for this by normalizing for lateral length the degradation in new well EUR begins in 2017.\nThe two previous charts show how the Average Permian well profile changed from 2012 to 2020. The tight oil well profiles for 2022 and 2023 were very similar to 2020, with 2021 about 4% higher, I assume that the 2024 average new well was similar to 2022 and 2023. For shale gas the average 2021 well has an EUR about 3.37% higher than 2020 and the 2022 and 2023 wells look very similar to 2021. I assume the 2024 well is also the same EUR as 2021-2023 average wells.\nI assume the average Permian well suffers pressure depletion which reduces new well EUR as shown in th"

                "body": "One of the big surprises of 2025 was OPEC+ abandoning efforts to prop up the price of oil.\nFor years, OPEC had been a strong market backstop, managing supply to maintain a floor under crude. However, a combination of eroding market share, resilient non-OPEC production finally forced a change in strategy and perhaps a nudge from US President Trump led to an abrupt change of strategy.\nThe shift began in the spring of 2025, when Saudi Arabia and its allies signaled they were no longer willing to shoulder the burden of production cuts while producers in the US, Guyana, and Brazil continued to hit record output levels. By mid-year, the 'price-over-volume' mantra was replaced by a more aggressive pursuit of market share, reminiscent of the 2014 price war.\nInternal tensions reached a breaking point as several member nations, notably Iraq and Kazakhstan, repeatedly overproduced their assigned quotas. Frustrated by the lack of discipline, the core leadership decided that a period of lower prices would serve as a 'reset' to force adherence to future agreements.\nOPEC may have also wanted to punish US shale players (the source of all supply growth in the past decade) for the 'drill, baby, drill' mantra.\nToday, WTI crude fell $1.61 to $56.74. That wipes out the gains on Monday/Tuesday and leaves oil flat on the week and it continues to sit close to five year lows.\nAs we move toward 2026, the question is no longer when OPEC+ will cut again, but how long they can tolerate the fiscal pain of sub-$70 oil in their quest to reassert dominance over the global energy landscape. Ultimately, the cure for low prices is low prices. US shale producers cut drilling budgets and will continue to do so. Few are making money below $60 WTI as costs have far outstripped crude prices since covid.\nMy guess is that buying crude will be one of the great trades of 2026 -- similar to how it was in late 2020. The question is 'when to buy?'. There is a school of argument that all the excess oil is already priced in and that global balances aren't as bad as they seem. I'll be sympathetic to that argument if we can get through the winter without a disorderly oil breakdown. So I believe the trade will be to buy a puke in the oil market below $40 or to wait until April when the seasonals begin to improve."

The European Central Bank, by contrast, has stayed in \u201cwait and see\u201d mode, keeping its key rate at 2.15% since July. If the Fed remains dovish through 2026 while the ECB stands pat, what does that do to the euro\u2014and where does EUR/USD realistically go next?\nEurozone growth is weak, but not falling apart\nThe Eurozone\u2019s growth engine is running slow, and some of that is structural rather than cyclical. Germany\u2019s auto sector\u2014hit by the EV transition and supply-chain disruptions\u2014has seen output fall 5%. Meanwhile, underinvestment in innovation has left parts of Europe trailing the US and China in key tech segments.\nOn top of that, trade friction is back in the frame. The Trump administration\u2019s \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d approach has raised the risk of escalation. The US is reportedly considering 10% to 20% tariffs on EU goods, a direct hit to export-heavy economies. EU exports to the US are described as falling 3%, with autos and chemicals taking the biggest damage.\nThe European Commission\u2019s autumn outlook reflects that mixed picture: it sees output growing 1.3% in 2025, 1.2% in 2026, and 1.4% in 2027. The tweak matters: 2025 was revised up versus May expectations, while 2026 was nudged down, which reads like a quiet admission that next year\u2019s growth path may be bumpier than people want to price in.\nEven within the bloc, the tempo isn\u2019t uniform. In Q3, the Eurozone expanded 0.2%, but Spain and France posted stronger prints (0.6% and 0.5%), while Germany and Italy were flat. The headline is slow growth\u2014yet the subtext is resilience: it\u2019s not a boom, but it\u2019s also not a collapse. That baseline stability is part of what keeps the euro from looking fundamentally \u201cbroken.\u201d\nRising inflation keeps the ECB\u2019s rate stance firm\nInflation is no longer sliding cleanly toward target. Eurostat\u2019s preliminary figures show Eurozone inflation at 2.2% year-on-year in November, up from 2.1% in October, staying above the ECB\u2019s 2.0% medium-term target.\nThe composition matters too: energy prices fell 0.5%, while services inflation rose 3.5%, up from 3.4% in October. Services is the sticky bit\u2014exactly the category central banks hate to see re-accelerate.\nAgainst that backdrop, on December 18, the ECB held all three key rates unchanged: the deposit facility rate at 2.00%, the main refinancing rate at 2.15%, and the marginal lending facility at 2.40%.\nWith cuts paused in the second half of 2025 and updated projections implying inflation can drift toward target over the next three years, the base case for 2026 is an ECB that largely stays put: not rushing to hike, and not seeing a compelling need to cut either.\nPresident Christine Lagarde reinforced that tone after the December meeting, describing policy as being in a \u201cgood place,\u201d essentially s"

Currently, markets are pricing in at least two rate cuts for 2026, although most people don\u2019t think anything big will happen before June.\nThe Fed themselves only see one cut next year, but with the Fed being pretty divided on things it\u2019s left people in the market feeling pretty unsure about what might happen next with US monetary policy.\nOn top of that, traders are also keeping an eye on who President Donald Trump might pick as the next Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell \u2013 any news on this could make markets get a bit more agitated and trigger a big move in the dollar either up or down.\nLooking forward, traders will keep a close eye on US economic indicators, comments from the Fed, and what\u2019s happening in politics \u2013 all of that is likely to play a big role in how the dollar does in the early months of 2026. If the markets get a bit more of a clear sense of what\u2019s going on with interest rates or who\u2019s going to be leading the Fed, we could see some pretty big short-term moves in the currency.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) is hovering around 98.09, trying to stabilise after bouncing back from that pretty low 97.74, but the overall look is still pretty corrective. It\u2019s still got that 100-EMA at 98.70 capping it and keeping upside momentum in check.\nThis latest little bounce has actually pushed the DXY back above that 23.6% Fib level at 97.98 but buying pressure is already starting to dwindle around the 38.2% zone at 98.12\u201398.24.\nUnless the DXY can get back above 98.35 then we\u2019re still looking at the risk of more sideways trading or a little dip down towards 97.74, and even deeper support at 97.55 if selling pressure kicks in again.\nGBP/USD is hanging around $1.3479, easing a bit after failing to hold onto that swing high around $1.3535.

As long as this $1.3410\u2013$1.3470 range holds, dips are likely to attract some buyers. A break below $1.3340 could open the door to something more serious.\nEUR/USD is dangling around $1.1767, easing a bit after failing to get any real momentum going near the upper boundary of its rising channel on the 2-hour chart. The pair is holding onto support around that 50-EMA at $1.1745 which is still doing a pretty good job of keeping things moving, while the 100-EMA near $1.1705 is even deeper down and should act as a bit of a buffer against a more serious sell-off.\nAs long as $1.1740 is holding, EUR/USD may just consolidate for a bit before another go at going higher.

US forces wanted to board Bella 1 near Barbados on Sunday, but the vessel instead moved back out into the Atlantic Ocean.\nThere may be some progress on a Ukraine-Russia peace deal as Ukrainian President Zelensky said he expects to meet with President Trump on Sunday in Florida.

He said, \"If we happen to be in a better or weaker position than expected, we will take appropriate action.\"\nECB Governing Council member Gediminas Simkus on Monday indicated satisfaction with the current level of interest rates, saying, \"We have inflation \u2013 headline and core \u2013 both now and in the near future, and mid-term, close to the 2% level.

The pair is holding onto support around that 50-EMA at $1.1745 which is still doing a pretty good job of keeping things moving, while the 100-EMA near $1.1705 is even deeper down and should act as a bit of a buffer against a more serious sell-off.\nAs long as $1.1740 is holding, EUR/USD may just consolidate for a bit before another go at going higher. A break below $1.1705 would suggest we will see something deeper though.\nArslan is a finance MBA and also holds an MPhil degree in behavioral finance.

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Holds the 1.35 Zone as Dollar Weakens into 2026\nSterling defends 1.34\u20131.35 while DXY caps under 98.70, gold hovers near $4,500 and rate-cut bets squeeze USD | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Holds 1.34\u20131.35 Range as Dollar Softens into 2026\nGBP/USD trades in a 1.34\u20131.35 consolidation band\nGBP/USD is trading around the mid-1.34s\u20131.35s after failing to extend above the recent swing high near 1.3535. On the short-term chart, GBP/USD sits just above the 50-EMA around 1.3470, with deeper structural support near the 100-EMA close to 1.3340. As long as the 1.3410\u20131.3470 band holds, dips toward 1.34 are being treated as buy zones, not the start of a new downtrend. The price structure from the autumn lows is still a sequence of higher lows and suggests a grind toward 1.36 rather than a breakdown back to 1.33.\nDollar index capped below 98.70 as markets price 2026 Fed cuts\nThe dollar backdrop is clearly weakening. The dollar index trades around 97.9\u201398.1 after bouncing from 97.74, but upside remains capped by the 100-EMA near 98.70. That tells you rallies in USD are being sold, not chased. Futures markets are already pricing at least two U.S. rate cuts in 2026, with the policy rate expected to move from the current 3.50\u20133.75% band toward roughly 3.00\u20133.25% next year. Short-term pricing puts the probability of a first cut by March 2026 above 75\u201385%, a clear medium-term headwind for USD and a structural positive for GBP/USD.\nFed already eased three times; labor data supports a controlled normalization\nThe U.S. central bank has cut rates three times since September, taking the federal funds range roughly 100 bps below its 2024 peak and parking it around 3.50\u20133.75%. The latest Non-Farm Payrolls report showed stronger-than-expected job creation, which briefly supported the dollar, but the market is focused on the full-year pattern: softer growth momentum, cooling labor conditions compared to early 2025, and a central bank already well into an easing cycle. The regime has shifted from \u201chigher for longer\u201d to \u201ccontrolled normalization\u201d, and that gradual erosion of USD carry is a key support for GBP/USD.\nLow volatility and equity positioning reinforce a weaker USD profile\nThe VIX index has dropped toward 11.5, near its 52-week low, compressing options premia across equities and FX. Cheap volatility is encouraging call-option buying on U.S. indices such as the S&P 500, where some houses guide toward an 8,000-point target for 2026. A backdrop of a soft-landing narrative, U.S. GDP growth around 2.1% in Q3 2025, and low volatility typically aligns with a softer dollar rather than a defensive USD bid. That combination supports upside in GBP/USD rather than a return to sub-1.33 levels.\nU.K. inflation and BoE stance keep GBP supported versus USD\nOn the U.K. leg of GBP/USD, inflation remains stickier than in the Eurozone or the U.S., with recent prints still well above the 2% target and prior data near 3.2%. Persistent price pressure forces the Bank of England to keep a hawkish bias while others talk more openly about cuts. Communication from the BoE suggests any easing cycle will be later and shallower than the Fed\u2019s. That relative stance has allowed GBP/USD to hold the 1.34\u20131.35 region despite illiquid holiday trading. The pullback from 1.3535 to the 1.3480\u20131.3500 area is a consolidation after a rally, not a structural bearish reversal.\nGBP/USD technical map: 1.3340 as line in the sand, 1.36\u20131.38 as upside zone\nTechnically, GBP/USD trades just under 1.3500, with immediate resistance near 1.3535 and then around 1.3600 if buyers regain momentum. First support is the 50-EMA at 1.3470, followed by 1.3410 and the heavier 100-EMA near 1.3340. As long as the pair holds above 1.3340, the medium-term pattern of higher lows from the autumn base remains intact and favors a retest of 1.36 and, on stronger dollar weakness, an extension toward the 1.37\u20131.38 area during 2026.\nEUR/USD and USD/JPY moves confirm a broad dollar story\nThe broader"

                "body": "Sydney \u2014 Australia\u2019s stock market is closed today, Thursday 25 December 2025, as the ASX cash market observes Christmas Day (and will also be closed on Boxing Day, Friday 26 December). The final session before the break ran on Wednesday 24 December with an early finish, setting up a four-day pause that leaves investors digesting global moves, record-setting commodities and shifting interest-rate expectations before trading resumes next week. [1]\nWith liquidity thinned across global markets on the holiday, the focus for Australian investors has moved from \u201cwhat happened today\u201d to what will matter most when the ASX reopens: bank-rate pricing, the Australian dollar\u2019s strength, and whether surging metals prices continue to support heavyweight miners into year-end. [2]\nIs the ASX open today? Holiday closure and the next trading session\nThe ASX trading calendar lists Thursday 25 December as closed (no trading day and no settlement), followed by another full-market closure on Friday 26 December. The exchange also notes that the last business day before Christmas Day (Wednesday 24 December) is an early close, and Wednesday 31 December is also scheduled to close early. [3]\nIn its Christmas Eve market coverage, ABC reported the ASX would be back next Monday, 29 December, after the holiday shutdown. [4]\nASX 200 last close: Banks eased, miners held up, week finished higher\nBecause the market is closed today, the most recent read on \u201cAustralia stock market today\u201d comes from the Christmas Eve session.\nABC\u2019s market wrap put the ASX 200 down 0.4% to 8,763 in the shortened Christmas Eve trade, while still finishing the week 1.6% higher overall. Sector performance was broadly weaker, with mining the notable exception as it stayed marginally positive amid strength in industrial metals. [5]\nThe same update highlighted the familiar pre-holiday dynamic: big banks weighed on the index, while miners benefited from commodity strength. ABC noted financials were lower on the day, with the major banks down between roughly 0.2% and 1%. [6]\nCompany-level moves also stood out in thin trading:\n- DroneShield gained after announcing a new contract.\n- Lendlease rose on a Sydney Metro development win.\n- Monash IVF fell after a consortium withdrew its bid. [7]\nAustralian dollar strengthens: Rate expectations and commodity support in focus\nOne of the biggest cross-asset signals heading into the break was the Australian dollar pushing to about 67 US cents, which ABC described as its highest level since October 2024. [8]\nThe currency strength matters for Australian equities in two ways:\n- It can pressure exporters\u2019 translated earnings, particularly for companies with significant offshore revenue bases.\n- It can coincide with \u201crisk-on\u201d commodity momentum\u2014supportive for materials\u2014while also reflecting changing views on domestic rates.\nOn the rates side, Reuters\u2019 account of the RBA\u2019s December meeting minutes said policymakers discussed conditions under which a rate rise might need to be considered in 2026, as inflation risk tilted higher after stronger readings. Reuters reported the cash rate was held at 3.60%, with markets seeing the probability of a February hike at around the mid\u201120% range. [9]\nABC also pointed to the next major domestic catalyst: December-quarter inflation data due in late January, ahead of the RBA\u2019s early-February meeting. [10]\nSeparately, Commonwealth Bank\u2019s economics team said it expects the RBA to raise rates by 0.25% in February, and outlined a scenario where the cash rate could reach 3.85% by end\u20112026 if inflation remains sticky. [11]\nCommodities drive the narrative: Record gold and copper, iron ore steady\nFor the ASX\u2014where materials and energy carry outsized weight\u2014commodity pricing has been the most important holiday-week input.\nABC\u2019s Christmas Eve snapshot showed:\n- Spot gold near record territory (around US$4,495/oz at the time of its update),\n- Iron ore around US$104/tonne, and\n- Oil broadly steady.

It was trading at 156.25, down from this month\u2019s high of 157.83. It has also formed the risky double-top pattern, pointing to more downside in the coming days.\nWeak Japanese data raises doubts for BoJ rate hikes\nThe USDJPY exchange rate was in a tight range after Japan published mixed macro data on Friday.\nA report by the statistics agency showed that the unemployment rate remained at 2.6%, while the jobs/applications ratio was unchanged at 1.18.\nAnother report showed that the Tokyo headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped from 2.7% in November to 2.0% this month.\nThe core consumer inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, moved from 2.8% to 2.3%, moving closer to the BoJ\u2019s target of 2.0%.\nMore data showed that the country\u2019s retail sales dropped from 1.6% in October to 0.6% in November, a sign that demand is falling.\nAt the same time, the country\u2019s industrial production dropped to minus 2.6% in November after expanding by 1.6% in the previous month.\nTherefore, there are signs that Japan\u2019s economy is moderating, a move that may limit the central bank\u2019s hawkish tone.\nThese numbers came a week after the BoJ delivered its final interest rate decision of the year. It hiked interest rates by 0.25% to a three-decade high of 0.75% and hinted that it will deliver more hikes in 2026 if the economic growth accelerates.\nTraders still believe that the bank will deliver either one or two more hikes in 2026 if inflation continues rising because of the recently announced stimulus package.\nFederal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2026\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve delivered the third interest rate cut in its December meeting. It moved the benchmark rate to between 3.50% and 3.75%.\nA Polymarket poll with over $1.2 million in assets, has more traders betting than the bank will deliver two cuts in 2026. 19% of the users expect the bank to cut rates three times, while 16% see four cuts.\nThe main reason to predict more cuts is that Donald Trump has pledged to appoint a Fed Chair who will be more comfortable delivering more cuts.\nHowever, the new Fed Chair will face the challenge of convincing more officials to cut rates, especially now that the recent US GDP data showed that the economy was doing well. The report showed that the economy expanded by 4.3% in the third quarter, much higher than what analysts were expecting.\nFed officials have started to deviate from the Federal Reserve officials. For example, two officials voted for leaving interest rates unchanged in the last meeting, while one voted for a 0.50% cut.\nUSDJPY forecast: technical analysis\nUSDJPY chart by TradingView\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the USDJPY exchange rate has pulled back in the past few days, moving from the year-to-date high of 157.83 to the current 156.28.\nIt has formed a double-top pattern whose neckline is at 154.42. Also, the Relative Strength Index and the Percentage Price Oscillator have formed a bearish divergence pattern.\nTherefore, the pair will likely continue falling, with the next key support level to watch being the neckline at 154.42. More downside will be confirmed if it moves below the 50-day moving average at 154.60."

                "body": "Yen Slides Back as BOJ Hike Fails to Shift Bearish Outlook\nThe bearish view on the Japanese yen is gaining traction after the Bank of Japan's latest interest rate hike failed to generate a sustained rebound, reinforcing investor skepticism that policy normalization alone can reverse the currency's structural weakness. This year, the yen has posted a gain of less than 1% against the dollar after four consecutive annual declines, as expectations for BOJ tightening and Federal Reserve rate cuts delivered a muted impact. The currency briefly strengthened beyond 140 per dollar in April, but that move faded amid uncertainty surrounding US President Donald Trump's tariff policies and rising fiscal risks in Japan, leaving the yen trading around 155.70, close to its lows for the year.\nStrategists at JPMorgan Chase JPM, BNP Paribas and other major banks continue to see downside risks building, with forecasts pointing to the dollar-yen pair potentially weakening toward 160 or beyond by the end of 2026. JPMorgan's Junya Tanase, who holds one of the most bearish projections on Wall Street at 164, argues that gradual BOJ tightening may be offset by higher rates elsewhere, keeping yield differentials wide and real rates deeply negative. Market pricing suggests the next BOJ rate hike is not fully reflected until September, even as inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target, while renewed carry trades and positioning data show leveraged funds holding their most bearish yen stance since July 2024.\nPersistent capital outflows are adding another layer of pressure. Japanese retail investors continue to channel funds into overseas assets, with net purchases of foreign stocks via investment trusts hovering near last year's decade-high 9.4 trillion, a trend that could persist into 2026. Corporate flows may prove even more durable, as Japan's outward foreign direct investment and overseas M&A activity have reached multi-year highs, according to BofA BAC Securities. While some longer-term optimism remains, including Goldman Sachs' GS view that the yen could strengthen significantly over the next decade as BOJ normalization progresses, officials' renewed warnings over excessive currency moves suggest that any intervention may focus more on smoothing volatility than reversing the broader depreciation trend in the near term."

Despite a robust U.S. GDP growth rate of 4.3%\u2014which normally would ignite a dollar rally\u2014the Greenback is languishing near five-month lows against the Canadian Dollar. The catalyst is a widening \u201cpolicy divergence.\u201d While the Federal Reserve is expected to continue a gradual easing cycle into 2026 to normalize rates, the Bank of Canada has effectively signaled that its work is done. By holding rates steady at 2.25% and even weightier discussions of future hikes to combat sticky inflation, the BoC has created a yield environment that makes the \u201cLoonie\u201d increasingly attractive. For investors, the Canadian Dollar isn\u2019t just a commodity play anymore; it is a high-yield haven in a world where U.S. rates are trending downward.\nBullion\u2019s Historic Ascent: Gold and Silver Redefine the Safe Haven\nThe year 2025 will be remembered as the era of the \u201cPrecious Metal Renaissance.\u201d Gold has surged over 70% year-to-date, marking its most explosive performance since 1979 and shattering over 50 record highs. This isn\u2019t merely a technical rally; it is a fundamental shift driven by a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of geopolitical instability and currency debasement fears. From the naval blockades in South America to the persistent frictions in Eastern Europe, capital is fleeing traditional fiat currencies for the permanence of bullion. Silver has been even more dramatic, breaching the $70 mark for the first time as it benefits from a dual-threat of investment FOMO and a massive industrial supply squeeze fueled by the AI infrastructure boom. While holiday profit-taking has seen prices pull back slightly from their absolute peaks, the underlying structure remains firmly bullish. As central banks continue to diversify their reserves away from the dollar, $4,500 Gold is no longer a ceiling, but the new floor for 2026.\nResilience and Risk: Navigating the 2026 Economic Outlook\nBeneath the quiet, holiday-thinned surface of the current markets lies a complex outlook for the coming year. The global economy enters 2026 having tested its \u201csolidity\u201d against high interest rates and trade tensions, yet it remains surprisingly resilient. Major institutions are forecasting double-digit gains for global equities, buoyed by a \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d dynamic in the AI sector and a stabilizing trade environment where all-out tariff wars have largely been avoided. However, this optimism is tempered by the reality of \u201csticky\u201d inflation and a cooling labor market. For the savvy investor, the strategy for the first half of 2026 appears to be one of cautious transition. We are moving from a world of aggressive central bank intervention into a \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d stabilization period where fiscal health and corporate earnings, rather than just cheap credit, will be the primary drivers of value.\nTop upcoming economic events:\n1. 12/28/2025 \u2013 BoJ Summary of Opinions\nThis report provides a concise summary of the Bank of Japan\u2019s latest monetary policy meeting. It is crucial for investors looking to gauge whether the BoJ is leaning toward further interest rate hikes or maintaining its accommodative stance.

                "body": "Bitcoin halving is a major event in the crypto world. It is a pre-programmed occurrence that reduces mining rewards and the amount of Bitcoin in circulation. It is embedded into Bitcoin\u2019s protocol and occurs approximately every four years or after every 210,000 blocks are mined.\nThese events exist to control the supply of new bitcoins and potentially lead to increased value. Given that Bitcoin is the most dominant asset in the crypto space, these halving events could affect miners, traders, and investors alike.\nTherefore, to be successful in the crypto space, it is important to know the details of major events that can impact token prices and other factors. Which is why this article provides a comprehensive guide to Bitcoin halving events and why they matter. It also explains how halving affects miners, blockchain projects, and investors. Let\u2019s dive in!\nWhat Is Bitcoin Halving?\nBitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that halves mining reward when miners add new blocks to the blockchain. Bitcoin has a permanent maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC. This fixed limit is a core feature that prevents inflation and increases its potential value over time.\nTo introduce more Bitcoin into circulation, miners use high-performing machines to solve cryptographic puzzles. Through this, new Bitcoin is created as rewards for miners who validate Bitcoin transactions and add blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain.\nBitcoin halving events occur approximately every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks are mined, to control the supply of new bitcoins and enforce the 21 million total cap. The Bitcoin network automatically halves this reward and updates the cycle. There have been four halving events so far and they include:\n- First (2012): Reduced reward from 50 to 25 Bitcoin per block.\n- Second (2016): From 25 to 12.5 BTC per block.\n- Third (2020): From 12.5 to 6.25 BTC.\n- Fourth (2024): From 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\nSince halving events occur every 4 years, the next halving is expected in around 2028. This upcoming event will reduce Bitcoin mining rewards from 3.125 BTC to 1.5625 BTC.\nWhy Does Bitcoin Halving Happen?\nBitcoin halving occurs to enforce Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. It is achieved by progressively reducing the rate of new bitcoin issuance. The halving events were coded by Satoshi Nakamoto to mimic the scarcity of precious metals like gold.\nThe primary goal is to control supply and prevent inflation by reducing the available BTC. By halving block rewards, BTC developers have ensured a gradual distribution over about 140 years until all Bitcoins are mined.\nThis mechanism promotes Bitcoin as a deflationary asset, potentially increasing value. And, encouraging users to invest in Bitcoin before halving events by taking advantage of Bitcoin price spikes.\nHow Do Bitcoin Halving Work?\nBitcoin halving is implemented as a pre-programmed rule in the token\u2019s protocol. It automatically reduces the block reward for miners by 50% every 210,000 blocks. For new BTCs to be created, miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles.\nWhen they solve these puzzles, they validate transactions and add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain. During this process, the successful miner receives the current block reward in newly minted Bitcoin plus transaction fees.\nSince the halving process is pre-programmed, the Bitcoin network tracks block height. Upon reaching multiples of 210,000, it automatically halves the subsidy (from 50 BTC initially to 25, then 12.5, and so on).\nHistory of Bitcoin Halving Events\nBitcoin halvings have occurred four times since the token\u2019s launch. Each reducing the block reward by half at predetermined block heights.\nBitcoin halvings began with the network\u2019s genesis in 2009. At the time, miners received 50 Bitcoins per block, with the reward halving every 210,000 blocks to cap maximum supply. Here is the breakdown of last Bitcoin halving dates:\nFirst Halving (2012): Bitcoin adoption\nOn November 28, 2012, at block 210,000, "

The order aims to democratize alternative asset access for 401(k) participants nationwide.\nThe Aug. 7 executive order directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to facilitate alternative asset access for participant-directed retirement plans. This could benefit approximately 90 million Americans currently restricted from such investments.\nRepresentatives Ann Wagner, Frank Lucas, Warren Davidson, and five other committee members signed the bipartisan letter. They encouraged swift SEC assistance to implement necessary regulation and guidance changes.\nThe executive order specifically notes consideration of accredited investor and qualified purchaser status modifications. Current regulations limit alternative asset access to high-net-worth individuals meeting specific income or asset thresholds.\nLawmakers requested SEC review of bipartisan legislation advancing in the 119th Congress concerning accredited investor definitions. They expressed hope that these actions will help millions of Americans secure dignified retirement outcomes.\nThe order establishes a policy that every American preparing for retirement should access funds including alternative assets. Plan fiduciaries must determine that such access provides appropriate opportunities to enhance risk-adjusted returns.\nAlternative assets typically include private equity, hedge funds, real estate investment trusts, and commodities. These investments have historically been available primarily to institutional and high-net-worth investors.\nCommittee members emphasized the importance of providing retirement savers with broader investment choices to build long-term wealth."

(NYSE American: BMNR) closed at $28.31, down about 3.6% on the day, with roughly 32.7 million shares traded.\nThe broader U.S. market finished the holiday-thinned session nearly flat to slightly lower, with investors watching the seasonal \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d window amid light volumes and year-end positioning. [1]\nWith U.S. equities now shut for the weekend, the next catalyst-driven move in BMNR stock may come less from the equity tape and more from crypto prices, fresh corporate updates, and growing investor focus on an upcoming shareholder vote that could materially reshape BitMine\u2019s capital flexibility.\nWhy BMNR is in the spotlight: a crypto treasury strategy scaled to \u201cmega-cap\u201d size\nBitMine has increasingly been treated by the market as a public-equity proxy for Ethereum exposure\u2014similar in concept to how some investors use corporate treasuries as a route to gain crypto-linked beta.\nIn its most recent holdings update, BitMine reported crypto + cash + \u201cmoonshots\u201d holdings totaling $13.2 billion, including 4,066,062 ETH valued using a $2,991 ETH reference price (Coinbase), plus 193 BTC, a roughly $32 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS), and $1.0 billion in cash (as of Dec. 21 at 3:00 p.m. ET). [2]\nThe company said its ETH position equals about 3.37% of the estimated ETH supply (120.7 million), and chairman Thomas \u201cTom\u201d Lee of Fundstrat highlighted that BitMine added 98,852 ETH in the prior week, framing the pace of accumulation as a milestone toward what the firm calls the \u201calchemy of 5%.\u201d [3]\nThat \u201c5%\u201d ambition also shows up repeatedly in the company\u2019s disclosures, alongside an effort to expand beyond mining into digital asset ecosystem services and disciplined digital asset treasury management. [4]\nStock snapshot: extreme volatility, heavy liquidity, and a valuation tied to crypto holdings\nEven after its pullback, BMNR remains one of the market\u2019s most volatile crypto-linked equities.\nKey metrics as of Friday\u2019s close show:\n- Price: $28.31\n- After-hours print shown near: $28.10 [5]\n- 52-week range: $3.20 to $161.00 [6]\n- Market cap: about $12.06 billion [7]\n- Price-to-book (P/B): about 0.79 [8]\nBitMine has also emphasized the stock\u2019s trading activity. In a recent company release citing Fundstrat data, BMNR was described as trading roughly $1.7 billion in average daily dollar volume (5-day average as of Dec. 19, 2025), ranking #66 among U.S.-listed stocks in that window. [9]\nThat liquidity matters because the market debate around crypto-treasury equities often hinges on whether companies can raise capital accretively (above NAV) to grow crypto per share\u2014or whether premiums compress and capital raises become dilutive.\nThe next major catalyst: Jan. 15 shareholder meeting and a proposal to boost authorized shares to 50 billion\nA defining near-term event for BMNR investors is BitMine\u2019s Annual Meeting, scheduled for Jan. 15, 2026 at the Wynn Las Vegas. [10]\nAmong the proposals, one is drawing the most attention:\nBitMine is asking shareholders to approve an amendment increasing authorized common shares from 500,000,000 to 50,000,000,000. [11]\nWhat the company says the change is for\nIn its proxy statement, BitMine says additional authorization would give the company flexibility to pursue strategic transactions and equity capital raises as needs arise. It also notes it already has an at-the-market (ATM) offering program in place. [12]\nWhat investors should understand about dilution risk\nThe proxy statement also explicitly warns that issuing additional shares could dilute EPS and existing holders\u2019 equity/voting power, and could pressure the share price. It further notes that while the amendment is \u201cnot intended\u201d as an anti-takeover device, additional shares could be used in ways that delay or deter a change of control. [13]\nShare count context: dilution has already been substantial\nThe scale of the authorization request stands out"

The milestone represents a significant jump from $149.5 billion recorded just one month earlier.\nUSDT maintains its dominant position with $87.8 billion in supply on the Ethereum network. USDC follows as the second-largest stablecoin with $48 billion in circulation on the platform.\nMarket analysts view the record figures as evidence of strengthening institutional confidence in DeFi protocols. Nick Ruck from LVRG Research highlighted how the expansion reflects deepening trust in Ethereum's foundational capabilities.\nThe surge stems primarily from increased adoption of USDC and USDT among institutional players. This institutional influx could potentially drive higher Ethereum prices as ecosystem demand accelerates.\nMeanwhile, USDT's overall market capitalization exceeded $170 billion during weekend trading. The stablecoin reached $170.3 billion by early Monday morning, according to market data.\nIndustry experts suggest this liquidity growth provides crucial support during market volatility periods. The robust stablecoin foundation enables better DeFi activity absorption during macroeconomic downturns."

That\u2019s Pump.fun, and its native PUMP token has captured the attention of the entire cryptocurrency community. As Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem experiences unprecedented growth, investors are asking one crucial question: Can PUMP lead this explosive revolution? Our comprehensive Pump.fun price prediction for 2026-2030 examines whether this token has what it takes to become a cornerstone of Solana\u2019s decentralized finance future.\nWhat is Pump.fun and Why Does It Matter for Solana DeFi?\nPump.fun emerged as a groundbreaking platform that simplified meme coin creation on the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional token launch methods that required technical expertise and significant capital, Pump.fun democratized the process, allowing anyone to create and launch tokens with minimal barriers. This innovation tapped into the explosive growth of meme coins while leveraging Solana\u2019s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure.\nThe platform\u2019s success stems from several key features:\n- Simplified token creation process requiring no coding knowledge\n- Integration with Solana\u2019s fast and affordable transaction network\n- Built-in bonding curve mechanism for fair launches\n- Community-driven approach to meme coin discovery\nAs Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, platforms like Pump.fun play a crucial role in onboarding new users and driving network activity. The PUMP token serves as the governance and utility token within this ecosystem, creating a direct correlation between platform success and token value.\nPUMP Token Fundamentals: Understanding the Value Proposition\nBefore diving into our Pump.fun price prediction, it\u2019s essential to understand what drives the token\u2019s value. The PUMP token operates within a carefully designed ecosystem with multiple utility functions:\nThe tokenomics model includes mechanisms to balance supply and demand, with a portion of transaction fees being burned to create deflationary pressure. This careful design positions PUMP as more than just another meme token\u2014it\u2019s a fundamental piece of infrastructure within Solana\u2019s growing DeFi landscape.\nSolana DeFi Growth: The Rising Tide That Lifts All Boats\nSolana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem has experienced remarkable growth, with total value locked (TVL) increasing dramatically over recent years. This expansion creates a favorable environment for platforms like Pump.fun to thrive. Several factors contribute to Solana\u2019s DeFi success:\n- Superior transaction speed and lower costs compared to Ethereum\n- Growing developer activity and project innovation\n- Increasing institutional interest and investment\n- Strong community support and network effects\nAs Solana continues to capture market share from competing blockchains, platforms built on its infrastructure stand to benefit significantly. Pump.fun\u2019s position as a leading meme coin creation platform gives it unique exposure to retail interest and viral trends within the ecosystem.\nPump.fun Price Prediction 2026: The Short-Term Outlook\nLooking ahead to 2026, several factors will influence PUMP\u2019s price trajectory. Our analysis considers both technical indicators and fundamental developments:\nKey drivers for 2026 include:\n- Platform adoption rates and user growth metrics\n- Solana network performance and DeFi TVL expansion\n- Regulatory developments affecting meme coins and DeFi platforms\n- Competitive landscape and platform innovation\nBased on current growth patterns and assuming continued Solana ecosystem expansion, we project that PUMP could establish stronger support levels while testing new resistance zones. The token\u2019s performance will closely track both platform-specific metrics and broader Solana DeFi trends.\n2027-2028: Mid-T"

                "body": "Solana Price Prediction: Spot ETF Story Gets Messy After Filing Moves-Can SOL Hold Narrative Strength, and Does Pepeto Offer Cleaner Upside?\nMarket Context as ETF Headlines Cloud Solana StoryCrypto market news today sees new uncertainty around Solana after ETF-relevant filing updates cause confusion about timelines and expectations for approval. These developments have cooled the momentum and have forced traders to re-evaluate near-term upside.\nThis discussion opens with Pepeto (https://pepeto.io) because when large-cap narratives become unclear, capital often looks for earlier-stage setups with cleaner entry mechanics and asymmetric potential.\nETF ambiguity does nothing to eliminate Solana's long-term thesis, but it can delay price discovery. Markets have often paused when there is clarification with respect to the regulatory clarity, especially for the assets that are already at huge valuations.\nSolana Price and Market Cap Live From CoinMarketCap\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Solana is trading at around $125.71 with a live market cap of around $70.99 billion. This makes SOL one of the elite large-cap cryptocurrencies where the price action becomes more of a reflection of narrative sentiment, liquidity, and general risk appetite than early growth discovery.\nAt this valuation level, Solana can still provide upside, but percentage expansion is of course more constrained relative to the earlier phases of the lifecycle.\nWhat ETF Uncertainty Means for SOL Price Action\nThe ETF speculation is one of the major sentiment drivers for large-cap altcoins. When filings are changed or timelines are extended, a wait-and-see approach is often taken by traders. This usually leads to range-bound price action even with constructive network usage and ecosystem activity.\nFor Solana, this environment is able to suppress momentum until a more obvious catalyst becomes evident. These pauses often steer speculative capital towards alternatives with more defined near-term narratives.\nSolana Price Prediction and Realistic Price Upside Range\nIf the clarity of ETF improves and more risk appetites are incurred, Solana can realistically aim for reaching the $150 to $210 range in the next cycle phase. This is based on the assumption of stabilization in the macro markets and resurgence in confidence in altcoin exposure.\nFrom a multi-billion dollar valuation base, Solana is not likely to provide extreme multiples. It is still better for an ecosystem strength play rather than for high-torque speciation.\nWhy Traders Look for Alternatives on Narrative Lulls\nWhen large-cap stories get stagnant, traders often try and look for opportunities where upside is not contingent on regulatory headlines or institutional timing. Early-stage projects can reprice based on execution, adoption, and community momentum, and not ETFs. This behavior is typical during the phases of accumulation when the capital positions are in advance of visible rotation.\nPepeto as the Early Entry Alternative\nPepeto (https://pepeto.io) is positioned as a cleaner early-stage alternative for traders seeking asymmetric upside. Built on the Ethereum mainnet, it blends meme culture with execution, framed as \"PEPE + Technology + Optimization.\"\nIts ecosystem includes PepetoSwap as a zero-fee swap layer, Pepeto Bridge (https://pepeto.io/#bridge) for cross-chain liquidity movement, and Pepeto Exchange as a verified meme exchange where all swap, exchange, and trade volume routes through Pepeto. This design is about capturing trading activity irrespective of ETF headlines on bigger assets.\nPepeto Presale Metrics and Asymmetry Setup\nPepeto operates with a fixed supply of 420 trillion tokens and offers staking APY around 216% during presale (https://pepeto.io/en/staking) . By staking, longer holding behavior is encouraged, and early circulating supply pressure can be reduced.\nThe project features the following highlights: audits by SolidProof (https://pepeto.io/assets/documents/audit-solidproof.pdf) and Coinsult (h"

                "body": "NEW YORK (as of 5:02 p.m. ET, Friday, Dec. 26, 2025) \u2014 U.S. markets are closed for the day, with the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s core trading session running from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET. [1]\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) finished Friday\u2019s post-Christmas session down 20.19 points (\u20110.04%) at 48,710.97, barely changed but still hovering close to all-time highs after a strong year-end run. The broader market also drifted: the S&P 500 slipped 2.11 points (\u20110.03%) to 6,929.94, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 20.21 points (\u20110.09%) to 23,593.10. [2]\nEven with Friday\u2019s pause, the week stayed constructive for U.S. equities. Over the holiday-shortened week, the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq posted gains of roughly 1.4%, 1.2%, and 1.2%, respectively \u2014 a reminder that the path higher into year-end has been steady even when the daily tape looks sleepy. [3]\nWhy the Dow barely moved: thin trading, fewer catalysts, \u201ccatching our breath\u201d\nFriday\u2019s market action had a familiar late-December signature: light volume and low conviction.\nReuters described the session as \u201clight-volume\u201d and nearly unchanged, noting that the market had snapped a five-session winning streak but still logged weekly gains. Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick framed it as a breather after a strong run, saying the market was essentially \u201ccatching our breath\u201d following the holiday and recent rally. [4]\nThe Associated Press added color on why liquidity felt so thin: many institutional players have largely wrapped up positioning for the year, leaving trading activity muted versus normal conditions. [5]\nFor Dow investors, that matters because the DJIA can look deceptively calm \u2014 until a low-liquidity day amplifies an outsized move in a handful of high-impact components. With fewer \u201creal money\u201d flows, price action can be driven by smaller order imbalances, short-term traders, and year-end portfolio adjustments.\nThe \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d is underway \u2014 and the calendar still matters\nSeasonality is back in the conversation on Wall Street because the market has entered the so\u2011called \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d window \u2014 commonly defined as the last five trading days of the year plus the first two of the new year. Reuters noted that the period began Wednesday and runs through Jan. 5, and that investors often watch it as a sentiment signal heading into the next year. [6]\nThis seasonal setup is arriving with a crucial caveat: year-end conditions are often headline-sensitive and liquidity-constrained. In other words, \u201cSanta\u201d can deliver\u2026 but the tape can also exaggerate reactions to surprises.\nMacro backdrop: rates steady, precious metals surge, oil slides\nWhile the Dow is a blue-chip equity benchmark, it\u2019s still reacting to the same cross\u2011asset forces shaping broader risk appetite:\n- Treasury yields: The 10-year yield was around 4.13% late Friday, little changed from midweek levels. [7]\n- Precious metals: Gold and silver continued to draw attention after hitting fresh highs in late December, with miners among notable winners in parts of the market. [8]\n- Oil: U.S. crude prices were lower on the day, reflecting continued volatility in energy markets into year-end. [9]\n- Crypto and the dollar: Bitcoin was trading around the high\u2011$80,000s and the U.S. dollar index was slightly higher in late-day readings cited by Investopedia. [10]\nFor the Dow, these inputs matter because the index blends cyclicals (industrials, financials, energy exposure via components) with defensive and growth-leaning mega-caps. When yields rise, the market often revisits valuation assumptions. When commodities spike, inflation and margin narratives can reappear. And when the dollar moves, multinationals feel it in translation and competitiveness.\nDow at 48,710: the 50,000 milestone is no longer a thought experiment\nAt 48,710.97, the Dow is within striking distance of 50,000 \u2014 a psychologically important threshold for retail sentiment and for institutional year-end commentary.

                "body": "As the final bells of 2025 ring across the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) stands at a historic crossroads. After a year defined by a resilient \"soft landing\" and a strategic rotation into \"old economy\" value stocks, the 30-stock benchmark is hovering near its all-time high of 48,731.16, reached just two days ago during a spirited \"Santa Claus Rally.\" As of the market close on December 26, 2025, the index sits at 48,710.97, representing a robust 15% year-to-date gain and setting the stage for a high-stakes psychological battle at the 50,000-point threshold in the coming year.\nThe immediate implications of this performance are twofold: while the index has successfully weathered the headwinds of high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, its technical profile suggests it may be \"priced for perfection.\" With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) pushing above 70, the market is signaling an overbought condition that could lead to a volatile \"January Effect\" as investors rebalance portfolios. However, the underlying shift from speculative growth toward blue-chip stability suggests that the Dow may be better positioned than its tech-heavy counterparts to navigate the evolving monetary landscape of 2026.\nA Record-Breaking Year: The Technical Journey to 48,000\nThe trajectory of the Dow Jones Industrial Average throughout 2025 has been a masterclass in trend persistence. Following a period of consolidation in the first quarter, the index entered a well-defined ascending channel that has guided it higher for nine consecutive months. The timeline of this ascent was punctuated by a pivotal breakout in late October, when the index cleared the 45,000 resistance level on the back of stronger-than-expected corporate earnings and a stabilizing labor market. This move turned former resistance into a structural floor, providing the necessary leverage for the year-end surge.\nKey stakeholders, including institutional asset managers and retail \"buy-and-hold\" investors, have largely ignored the bearish calls for a recession, focusing instead on the Federal Reserve\u2019s gradual easing cycle. The Fed's decision to bring rates down to a 3.50%\u20133.75% range by December 2025 acted as a potent catalyst, lowering the cost of capital for the capital-intensive industrial and manufacturing firms that anchor the Dow. Initial market reactions to the recent record high on December 24 were overwhelmingly positive, though volume was characteristically thin due to the holiday season.\nTechnically, the index is currently supported by its 6-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near 47,050, which has served as a reliable \"buy the dip\" zone throughout the latter half of the year. However, a slight bearish divergence in the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator suggests that while prices are making new highs, the momentum behind those moves is beginning to wane. This technical nuance indicates that the \"easy money\" phase of the rally may be concluding, shifting the burden of proof to 2026 earnings reports.\nThe Component Tug-of-War: Winners and Losers in the 2025 Index\nThe price-weighted nature of the Dow means that a handful of high-priced stocks significantly influenced the index's 2025 performance. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) emerged as a steady pillar of strength, gaining approximately 15.8% for the year. Despite a cooling period in the second half of 2025 where shares consolidated around the $488 mark, Microsoft\u2019s dominance in AI infrastructure provided the fundamental \"ballast\" the index needed during periods of broader market volatility. Similarly, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) overcame a shaky start to the year, rallying 15% to trade near $273 by late December, driven by the successful integration of its \"Apple Intelligence Pro\" subscription model.\nConversely, the year was not without its casualties. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), traditionally a defensive powerhouse, was the single largest drag on the Dow in 2025."

                "body": "Stock markets on both sides of the pond have enjoyed a stellar year, with the FTSE 100 rising 19.5 per cent and the S&P 500 gaining 18 per cent. However, some stocks and sectors have seemed less loved by investors than others. Among them are some housebuilders and water companies, but also the drinks company Diageo and Legal & General, the financial services firm. Could it finally be their year to shine?\nLegal & General (Patrick Hosking)\nShares in the pensions and investments group have bobbed around but showed no lasting progress in ten years. Maybe the planned gusher of dividends and share buybacks over the next three years will at last help to boost investor sentiment.\nThe chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es is aiming to hand \u00a35 billion back over the next three years, starting with \u00a31.2 billion in 2026. That is a massive step up from the \u00a3500 million of 2025 and \u00a3200 million in 2024. The sheer weight of buying orders will at least help put a floor under the stock price at worst.\nL&G could easily enjoy a bit of rerating anyway. It\u2019s the biggest player in pension risk transfer deals, taking over legacy pension liabilities from the likes of Boots and Ford. And its overlooked defined contribution pensions business is starting to look promising too: the company handles workplace pensions for blue chip employers including Tesco, JP Morgan, PwC and EY. This is a source of revenues that will automatically grow with every year of pension contributions.\nThe shares currently yield a thumping 8.7 per cent, which is going to look even more attractive if UK interest rates continue to fall.\nPersimmon (Tom Howard)\nExpectations are growing that Labour, in need of some political victories as it reaches the halfway point of its parliamentary term, must bring back Help to Buy, or a version of it, next year if it is to make good on its promise of building 1.5 million new homes by the end of 2029.\nIf that happens, Persimmon looks best placed to benefit. On average, its houses sell for \u00a3284,000 \u2014 lower than the other volume housebuilders \u2014 and about a third of its sales are to first-timers. At the height of Help to Buy, that proportion was closer to half.\nCheaper mortgage rates, looser lending rules and an end to the pre-budget uncertainty means the wider market should improve in 2026 regardless. To get ahead of this expected uptick, at a time when others\u2019 site numbers are falling, Persimmon is opening more.\nLondon and the southeast are widely viewed as the toughest housebuilding markets, given their high average prices. But Persimmon has next to nothing inside the M25 and has much more exposure to northern regions, where sales rates have been stronger.\nCladding costs are a big issue for all the housebuilders, but in contrast to most of its peers, Persimmon has surveyed all its affected buildings and work is under way at almost all of them. Given that, few expect it will have to top up its \u00a3208 million fire safety again.\nDiageo (Emma Powell)\nPessimism towards Diageo among investors is at its highest level in more than a decade. The shares trade at just over 13 times forward earnings, about the lowest level since the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.\nThe challenges are well known: flatlining sales, the structural fall in alcohol consumption among consumers and an over-leveraged balance sheet.\nHowever, the current valuation gives little credit to the turnaround potential of the drinks group under \u201cdrastic\u201d Dave Lewis, the former Tesco boss who will take over as the surprise new chief executive of Diageo in the new year, or the enduring value of some of its brands.\nLewis is thought to be considering taking the offering lower down the premium price ladder, which could help to revive sales.\nGetting the balance sheet back on an even keel could prove another catalyst. The FTSE 100 constituent has more than 200 brands, only 13 of which generate annual sales of more than $1 billion. This means there could be plenty of opportunity to unlock value w"

                "body": "2025 was such a strong year for the FTSE 100 that even our American cousins have taken notice. I\u2019ve seen a flurry of headlines on US investment sites noting that UK stocks have outperformed Wall Street, predicting more to come in 2026.\nThat\u2019s certainly the view of JP Morgan, which sees the UK\u2019s blue-chip index rising by as much as 10% over the year ahead. When it made that call, the FTSE 100 stood at 9,897. A 10% gain from there would lift it to 10,887, pretty close to 11,000.\nPredictions are fun, but should be taken lightly. Anything can happen. Still, that shouldn\u2019t stop people buying shares. Short-term volatility is the price investors pay for the superior long-term returns from equities.\nIt\u2019s the long run that matters, and here are three FTSE 100 shares that have struggled recently but look interesting as a result.\nBarratt Redrow shares to rebound?\nThe first is Barratt Redrow (LSE: BTRW). Like the rest of the housebuilding sector, it\u2019s had a torrid time as high inflation, elevated mortgage rates and rising materials and labour costs squeeze margins from all sides.\nThe shares are down 14% over the last year and 43% over five. That\u2019s brutal, but typical for housebuilders right now. Today, Barratt Redrow trades on a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.8 and offers a tempting dividend yield of 4.77%.\nInterest rates are falling, with talk of sub-3% mortgages returning, which could revive demand. 2026 may still prove bumpy, as recession risks linger, but I think it has serious comeback potential over the next few years.\nMarks & Spencer stock volatility\nI sadly missed the great Marks & Spencer Group (LSE: MKS) share price recovery that saw it rocket back into the FTSE 100. Since then, it\u2019s been volatile, with the shares down almost 15% over the last year.\nThe real blow was the cyberattack in April, which slashed first-half profits by 55% at a cost of \u00a3136m, although the company has since lodged a \u00a3100m insurance claim. Like other retailers, it\u2019s also grappling with higher employer\u2019s National Insurance and minimum wage hikes.\nIts P/E has now slipped to a modest 10.4, although the dividend yield remains modest at 1.1%. Plans to open 500 new food stores over the coming years should drive growth, especially if the economy improves. And its clothing arm is improving but still needs a bit of a lift. Worth considering, but not without risk.\nCroda still waiting to recover\nFinally, Croda International (LSE: CRDA). It\u2019s had another sticky year, with the shares down 16%, and a painful 55% over five years.\nCroda makes speciality chemicals used in beauty, agriculture and life sciences. Demand surged during the pandemic as customers stockpiled, then slumped as inventories were run down. That process is still under way, but there are signs that sales volumes are now recovering.\nIt\u2019s the priciest of the three, on a P/E of 19.6, although the dividend yield has climbed to almost 4%. The underlying business remains solid and feels due a revival. Will it come in 2026? We\u2019ll see.\nI think all three are worth considering although Barratt Redrow is my favourite here. There\u2019s plenty more value lurking in the FTSE 100, and investors should do their research and dig it out."

Indeed, Donald Trump has pressured NATO members to boost their spending to 5% of the GDP, a move that will benefit the bloc\u2019s defence contractors.\nRheinmetall\u2019s revenue jumped by 20% in the third quarter to \u20ac75 billion, with its backlog soaring to over 64 billion euros. Therefore, the stock surge is mostly because analysts expect that the company will become a major challenger to its American rivals like RTX and Lockheed Martin.\nSiemens Energy stock soared amid power demand\nSiemens Energy share price jumped by 140% this year, making it one of the best-performing companies in the DAX Index. It has now jumped by over 333% in the last three years, marking a strong turnaround for a company that was about to collapse a few years ago.\nSiemens Energy\u2019s stock price mirrored the performance of GE Vernova, its biggest rival in the energy equipment industry. The companies are benefiting from the ongoing energy demand because of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom.\nThis boom has led to more demand, with its annual revenue soaring by 17% to over \u20ac59 billion. Most notably, Siemens Gamesa, its wind business, returned to growth, with its revenue rising by 30% to \u20ac9.32 billion.\nCommerzbank shares jumped amid acquisition hopes\nCommerzbank stock price jumped by 126% this year for two main reasons. First, the rally mirrored the performance of other European banks like Lloyds, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and Deutsche Bank. Indeed, Deutsche Bank stock jumped by 100% and was the fourth best performer.\nSecond, the stock did well, and hopes remained that Commerzbank will make a bid for the company, potentially in the coming year. An acquisition would help to boost the performance of the stock as the company will need to pay a premium.\nBayer stock jumped as its crop science division improved\nBayer was the fifth-best performing company in the DAX Index as it jumped by 86% this year. This surge happened as the embattled company published several encouraging financial results, helped by its pharmaceutical and crop science businesses.\nThese numbers helped to boost its forward guidance, with its revenue expected to be between \u20ac46 billion and \u20ac48 billion.\nMost recently, the company said that its crop science business strengthened, which helped it to offset the performance of its consumer business.\nThe other top gainers in the DAX Index were companies like RWE, Fresenius, Deutsche Post, Continental, and Allianz.\nOn the other hand, the top laggards in the index were companies like Symrise, Adidas, Beiersdorf, Zalando, and Vonovia.\nThe post DAX Index\u2019s best and worst performers in 2025 appeared first on Invezz\nDAX Index\u2019s best and worst performers in 2025\nShare:\nThe DAX Index had a strong performance in 2025 as it jumped by 22%, which mirrored the growth of other global indices like the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones indices.

After hitting record highs above \u20ac2,000 in early October, the stock is now trading around the mid\u2011\u20ac1,400s \u2013 a drop of roughly 28% \u2013 as peace\u2011talk headlines and profit\u2011taking trigger a brutal sell\u2011off across European defence names. [1]\nAt the same time, Rheinmetall\u2019s fundamentals look stronger than ever: record sales, a \u20ac64 billion backlog and aggressive expansion of ammunition and air\u2011defence capacity. [2] Analysts still see substantial upside, but short\u2011term technicals have turned clearly bearish and volatility is high. [3]\nThis article looks at the latest price action, fresh news as of 2 December 2025, current forecasts and the key risks around Rheinmetall AG stock for medium\u2011 and long\u2011term investors.\nRheinmetall share price on 2 December 2025\nAs of Tuesday morning, 2 December 2025, Rheinmetall AG (ISIN DE0007030009, WKN 703000, ticker RHM) is changing hands on German exchanges at roughly \u20ac1,450\u20131,460 per share. Quotes from Xetra and other venues show: [4]\n- Last trade around \u20ac1,452\u20131,461, up slightly versus Monday\u2019s close of \u20ac1,448\n- Day range so far roughly \u20ac1,435\u20131,465\n- 52\u2011week range from about \u20ac593 to just over \u20ac2,000\nThat means the stock is still down almost 28% from its 52\u2011week high, even after a modest intraday rebound. [5]\nA number of German market commentaries talk about the share \u201ccrashing\u201d or \u201cfalling under the wheels\u201d as it slid to around \u20ac1,447.50 at the start of the week, with sentiment dominated by headlines rather than company news. [6]\nWhy Rheinmetall is falling now\n1. Peace\u2011talk headlines and sector\u2011wide sell\u2011off\nRheinmetall is being hit by a macro narrative rather than company\u2011specific bad news. On 24 November, Reuters reported that European defence stocks fell to four\u2011month lows as investors reacted to news of a \u201crefined peace framework\u201d discussed at U.S.\u2013Ukraine talks in Geneva. Rheinmetall dropped about 4% that day, alongside other major European arms makers. [7]\nThe logic in the market is simple (and somewhat simplistic):\nPeace talks \u2192 less war risk \u2192 less urgency for ammunition and weapons \u2192 time to take profits in defence stocks.\nAnalysts at Morningstar, quoted in the same Reuters piece, argue the reaction is \u201coverstated\u201d, stressing that European rearmament is driven by structural budget increases and that defence plans are unlikely to reverse even in the event of a ceasefire. [8]\n2. Profit\u2011taking after a massive multi\u2011year rally\nRheinmetall has been one of Europe\u2019s most explosive post\u20112022 winners. A recent MarketScreener/Citigroup commentary notes that: [9]\n- Rheinmetall shares are still up around 130% since the end of 2024, and\n- roughly 1,600% since the start of 2022,\n- even after falling nearly 30% from all\u2011time highs above \u20ac2,000.\nCitigroup points out that the broader European defence sector has corrected roughly 20\u201340% from October peaks, but views this more as an \u201centry opportunity\u201d than the end of the story for defence stocks. [10]\n3. Short\u2011term technical damage\nTechnical analysts have turned notably cautious:\n- StockInvest.us classifies Rheinmetall as a \u201csell candidate\u201d since 21 November, noting a \u201315.9% drop over the last 10 trading days and expecting, based on its model, a potential further \u201316.9% decline over the next three months, with a 90% probability band between roughly \u20ac1,176\u20131,445. [11]\n- The stock trades in the lower part of a wide falling trend and is oversold on RSI\u201114 (24), which can precede bounces but also signals elevated risk. [12]\n- A German XTB analysis highlights a clearly bearish chart: the share is below major moving averages (SMA 20/50/200), with possible downside targets around \u20ac1,374 or even \u20ac1,236 if it cannot regain its 200\u2011day line. [13]\nIn short: the stock is in a technical downtrend, even if long\u2011term fundamentals remain robust.\nFundamentals: record growth and a \u20ac64 billion backlog\nRheinmetall\u2019s latest official numbers are from its Q3 2025 financial"

                "body": "Investors are looking for the US stock market to end 2025 on a high note next week, with equities at record peaks and nearing further bullish milestones to close out another strong year.\nMajor US indexes were on course to end December higher after stocks shook off turbulence earlier in the month driven by weakness in technology shares over worries tied to spending on artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 posted a record close on Wednesday, ahead of the Christmas holiday on Thursday, and was about 1% from reaching the 7,000 level for the first time. The benchmark index was on track for its eighth straight month of gains, which would be its longest monthly winning streak since 2017-2018.\n\"Momentum is certainly on the side of the bulls,\" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. \"Barring any exogenous event, the path of least resistance for stocks, I think, is higher.\"\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent meeting highlight the market events in the holiday-shortened week ahead, while year-end portfolio adjustments could cause some volatility at a time when light trading volumes can exaggerate asset price moves.\nHeading into the new year, investors are highly focused on when the Fed might further cut interest rates. The US central bank, which balances goals of contained inflation and full employment, lowered its benchmark rate by 75 basis points over its last three meetings of 2025 to the current level of 3.50%-3.75%.\nBut the Fed's most recent vote at its December 9-10 meeting to lower rates by a quarter percentage point was divided, while policymakers also gave widely different projections about rates in the coming year. The minutes for that meeting, due to be released on Tuesday of next week, may be \"illuminating to hear what some of the arguments were around the table,\" said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede.\n\"Handicapping how many rate cuts we're going to get next year is a big thing markets are focused on right now,\" Reynolds said. \"We'll just get a little bit more information on that next week.\" Investors are also waiting for President Donald Trump to nominate a Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, and any inkling of Trump's decision could sway markets in the coming week.\nWith just a handful of trading sessions left in 2025, the S&P 500 was up nearly 18% for the year, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite up 22%.\nHowever, the tech sector, which has been the main driver of the more than three-year-old bull market, has struggled in recent weeks, while other areas of the market have shined. Despite rebounding this week, the S&P 500 tech sector has declined more than 3% since the start of November. Over that time, areas such as financials, transports, healthcare and small caps have posted solid gains.\nThe market moves indicate some rotation into areas where valuations are more moderate, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\"There are more investors that are buying in to the narrative that the economy is on pretty solid footing right now,\" Saglimbene said. \"And it has weathered a lot of potential roadblocks this year that might not be such roadblocks next year.\" Shanghai's stock benchmark reversed earlier losses and ended higher for the eighth consecutive session on Friday, booking the longest winning streak since April.\nChinese equities also booked their best week in two months, and analysts expect the upward trend to continue, aided by a strengthening yuan.\nAt the close, the benchmark Shanghai Composite index was up 0.1%, while the blue-chip CSI300 index advanced 0.32%.\nFor the week, the SSEC rose 1.88%, and the CSI300 jumped 1.95%. Both indexes recorded their biggest weekly rises since late October.\nPrivate fund manager Rabbit Fund expects China stocks to zig-zag higher as the economy slowly recovers. Analysts also expect the market to benefit from a strengthening "

                "body": "Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gained 1.96% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.03% the five prior. That brings MSFT\u2019s year-to-date gain to 16.59%, including a nearly 38% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, 2025, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts\u2019 expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts\u2019 expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, 2025, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision in May fire 6,000 employees \u2014 or 3% of its workforce \u2014 signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft\nMicrosoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft\u2019s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market\u2019s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon\u2018s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform\u2019s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company\nMicrosoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company\u2019s capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft\u2019s cloud infrastructure growth.\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft\u2019s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft\u2019s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda\u2019s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft\u2019s AI and cloud momentum.\nMicrosoft As a Stock\nBroadly, 34 Wall Street analysts\u2019 remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \u201cBuy\u201d rating, two assigning it a \u201cHold\u201d rating and "

                "body": "Walmart Inc. shares (ticker: WMT) were changing hands around $111.74 in late trading on Friday evening, Dec. 26, 2025 (New York time), up about 0.12% from the prior close after a light-volume post-Christmas session. Trading volume for the day was roughly 9.0 million shares, reflecting the thinner liquidity typical of the year-end stretch.\nThe broader market backdrop was muted: U.S. stocks finished slightly lower in a subdued session, snapping a short winning streak but staying close to record territory during the \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d window that investors often watch at year-end. [1]\nFor Walmart stock, the near-term story is less about one quiet day of trading\u2014and more about a packed set of catalysts: a major CEO succession, a historic exchange move to Nasdaq, a raised fiscal-year outlook, and investor focus on Walmart\u2019s e-commerce, advertising, and automation flywheel heading into 2026.\nWhy Walmart stock is in focus going into year-end\nWalmart has increasingly traded like a hybrid of defensive retail and technology-enabled consumer infrastructure. The company\u2019s scale in groceries and everyday essentials can help during uneven consumer spending, while its delivery network, marketplace, and advertising business can add higher-margin growth levers over time. Reuters highlighted how Walmart has been leaning into faster delivery and expanding higher-margin lines such as advertising as it modernizes its operating model. [2]\nThat mix matters in a market environment where investors are simultaneously weighing:\n- year-end positioning and liquidity effects, [3]\n- expectations for future rate cuts and growth-stock leadership in the indices, [4]\n- and whether consumer demand remains resilient into 2026.\nThe biggest Walmart headlines investors are tracking right now\n1) CEO transition: John Furner to take over in February 2026\nOne of the most important fundamental storylines for Walmart stock is leadership continuity.\nWalmart disclosed that Doug McMillon will retire as CEO on Jan. 31, 2026, and John Furner\u2014the head of Walmart U.S.\u2014will become CEO effective Feb. 1, 2026. [5]\nWall Street\u2019s early reaction has been nuanced: not because investors doubt the bench, but because McMillon is widely viewed as a transformational leader. In Reuters coverage, Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett said the change could create anxiety given McMillon\u2019s record, while other analysts framed it as standard succession planning. [6]\nReuters also compiled reactions from multiple firms, including:\n- Steven Shemesh (RBC Capital Markets), who described the announcement as normal succession planning and emphasized Walmart\u2019s leadership depth, [7]\n- Scot Ciccarelli (Truist Securities), who pointed to the scale of the transformation under McMillon and argued Furner\u2019s job is to keep executing the existing plan. [8]\nWalmart\u2019s board chair Greg Penner said Furner is the right leader for the next chapter, citing his experience across segments and results leading Walmart U.S. during a period of rapid change. [9]\nWhat it means for WMT investors: CEO transitions can temporarily increase headline sensitivity, but the current messaging from both the company and multiple analysts is that this is a planned handoff with a deep internal bench. [10]\n2) Nasdaq switch: a historic exchange move, with \u201ctech-forward\u201d messaging\nWalmart\u2019s move from the NYSE to Nasdaq is not just symbolic\u2014it\u2019s being marketed as part of the company\u2019s evolution.\nReuters reported Walmart shifted its listing to Nasdaq on Dec. 9, calling it the largest-ever exchange transfer on record and describing it as a win for Nasdaq in the long-running rivalry between the exchanges. [11]\nWalmart CFO John David Rainey tied the move to Walmart\u2019s \u201cpeople-led, tech-powered\u201d strategy and an operating model increasingly shaped by automation and AI, according to Reuters reporting. [12]\nOne investor-facing implication raised in Reuters coverage: Brian Jacobsen of Annex Wealth Management noted that it\u2019s \u201cincredible to think\u201d Walmart could pote"

                "body": "After announcing weak earnings, Tantech Holdings Ltd's (NASDAQ:TANH) stock was strong. Despite the strength in the stock, we feel that investors should be cautious about some numbers in the earnings.\nOne essential aspect of assessing earnings quality is to look at how much a company is diluting shareholders. In fact, Tantech Holdings increased the number of shares on issue by 2,843% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares. That means its earnings are split among a greater number of shares. To celebrate net income while ignoring dilution is like rejoicing because you have a single slice of a larger pizza, but ignoring the fact that the pizza is now cut into many more slices. Check out Tantech Holdings' historical EPS growth by clicking on this link.\nA Look At The Impact Of Tantech Holdings' Dilution On Its Earnings Per Share (EPS)\nAs you can see above, Tantech Holdings has been growing its net income over the last few years, with an annualized gain of 1,644% over three years. But on the other hand, earnings per share actually fell by 79% per year. Net profit actually dropped by 27% in the last year. Unfortunately for shareholders, though, the earnings per share result was even worse, declining 92%. Therefore, one can observe that the dilution is having a fairly profound effect on shareholder returns.\nIn the long term, if Tantech Holdings' earnings per share can increase, then the share price should too. But on the other hand, we'd be far less excited to learn profit (but not EPS) was improving. For the ordinary retail shareholder, EPS is a great measure to check your hypothetical \"share\" of the company's profit.\nAlongside that dilution, it's also important to note that Tantech Holdings' profit was boosted by unusual items worth US$3.5m in the last twelve months. We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable. We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature. Which is hardly surprising, given the name. We can see that Tantech Holdings' positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to June 2025. As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be.\nOur Take On Tantech Holdings' Profit Performance\nTo sum it all up, Tantech Holdings got a nice boost to profit from unusual items; without that, its statutory results would have looked worse. And furthermore, it went and issued plenty of new shares, ensuring that each shareholder (who did not tip more money in) now owns a smaller proportion of the company. On reflection, the above-mentioned factors give us the strong impression that Tantech Holdings'underlying earnings power is not as good as it might seem, based on the statutory profit numbers. Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. Be aware that Tantech Holdings is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis and 2 of those are concerning...\nOur examination of Tantech Holdings has focussed on certain factors that can make its earnings look better than they are. And, on that basis, we are somewhat skeptical. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Tantech Holdings might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "Nikkei 225 closed at 50,750.39, gaining 0.68%. The broader Topix rose to a record high. The Nikkei 225 rally is largely driven by the gains in the tech sector, less-than-expected inflation data, and the announcement of massive government budget spending. Nikkei 225 recorded a weekly gain of 2.5%. The technology sector added 52.79% to the day\u2019s price change, followed by consumer goods.\nThe top gainers include Sapporo Holdings Ltd., Disco Corp, DeNA Co. Ltd., Ibiden Co. Ltd., and Nintendo Co. Ltd. Sapporo Holdings closed at 8,271, with 2.49% up. The Disco Corp. and DeNA Co. Ltd. closed the trading session at 48,870, 2.41% up, and 2,618, 2.39% up, respectively. SoftBank Corp is a major tech stock that registered gains.\nSumitomo Electric Industries Ltd, Mitsui Kinzoku Co. Ltd, Fujikura Ltd., and Furukawa Electric Co. Ltd. are major losers. The Sumitomo Electric Industries closed at 6,255.00, down by 4.36%. Mitsui Kinzoku Co. Ltd. and Fujikura Ltd. closed at 17,325.00, ending 3.00% lower, and closed at 17,160.00, 2.61% down, respectively.\nLower Than Expected CPI Data and Massive Budget Spending Announcement\nThe consumer price index (CPI) data released showed a 2.3% year-over-year increase, lower than expected. Besides, inflation is down from 2.8% in November. The easing of inflationary pressure supported the stock market rally.\nThe Japanese government approved a massive budget of 122.3 trillion yen ($782 billion) for the fiscal year from April 2026. The budget includes 9 trillion for defense, and the country is ramping up its spending in the sector. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi commented on the fiscal policy in the past week, \u201cWhat Japan needs right now is not the undermining of our strength as a nation through excessive austerity fiscal policies, but rather the bolstering of our national strength through proactive fiscal policies.\u201d\nThe softer-than-expected CPI data and government spending added renewed momentum to the Nikkei 225. Moreover, the anticipation of reducing issuance of super-long bonds next year increased their demand but reduced the yield from a record high. The government bonds had earlier reached a 26-year record yield.\nYen is Weakening Against the Dollar\nThe yen continued to weaken today. At the time of writing, 1 USD is equivalent to 156.3520. A weakening yen is proving to be beneficial for Japan\u2019s major export companies like SoftBank Group and Nintendo. A weakening yen makes their goods more competitive abroad.\nOne of the key reasons for the strengthening dollar compared to the yen is the change in monetary policies in the U.S. and Japan. While the Federal Reserve reduced the interest rates on December 10, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced an interest hike of 0.75% on December 18. The hike is a 30-year high, making the borrowing costlier and threatening the yen carry trade. Yet, the BOJ has yet to give a clear policy direction for future monetary policy, prompting many traders to sell yen.\nAs for other Asian markets, the SSE Composite Index closed at 3,963.68, gaining 0.10%, and the Hang Seng closed at 25,818.93, 0.17% higher."

Picture taken with slow shutter speed. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon.\nThe Japanese yen softened against the greenback on Friday as investors remained on watch for potential intervention to shore up the currency, while the dollar dipped slightly against the euro in thin trading volumes.\nThe yen has remained on the back foot despite a Bank of Japan interest rate hike last week, on concerns about expansive fiscal policy in the country. Japan's government on Friday proposed record spending for next fiscal year while curbing debt issuance, underscoring Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's challenge in boosting the economy while inflation remains above the central bank's target.\nData on Friday also showed that core consumer inflation in Japan's capital slowed in December on moderating cost pressure for food but stayed above the central bank's 2% target, firming the case for further interest rate hikes. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Thursday the nation's underlying inflation is accelerating gradually and steadily approaching the central bank's 2% target, reiterating the central bank's readiness to continue raising interest rates.\nThe yen has come off its recent lows, however, as Japanese officials warn about potential intervention. Japan has a free hand in dealing with excessive moves in the yen, Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said on Tuesday, issuing the strongest warning to date on Tokyo's readiness to intervene in the currency market to arrest sharp declines in the currency.\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar was last up 0.42% on the day at 156.44. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.02% to 97.96, with the euro up 0.04% at $1.1782.\nSterling weakened 0.14% to $1.3504.\nThe greenback has weakened this year as investors price in further Federal Reserve rate cuts while other central banks are expected to hold rates steady.\nFed officials are balancing a weakening labor market against concerns about inflation that continues to run above the central bank\u2019s 2% annual target.\nFed funds futures traders are pricing in between two and three 25 basis point cuts next year, with the first possible in March.\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 0.50% to $88,288.\n(Reporting by Karen Brettell, Editing by Louise Heavens)"
