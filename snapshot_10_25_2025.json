                "body": "Gold prices and inflation: What every investor should know now\nGold investors are experiencing some serious whiplash right now. Earlier this week, prices crashed from the latest record-high of above $4,300 per ounce, dipping all the way down to about $4,000 per ounce \u2014 a $300 drop that vaporized much of the gains accumulated over months. Then, almost just as quickly, the price of gold bounced back, climbing toward $4,136 per ounce on Thursday before dropping again on Friday morning. That ongoing price volatility is, in turn, having a big impact on a lot of investors right now.\nBehind this volatility sits a tug-of-war between conflicting market dynamics. A mix of Federal Rate cuts and future rate cut expectations, along with a weaker dollar and a resilient stock market, is having an impact on the price of gold, and perhaps not in the way investors expected. Inflation also just hit 3% in September, the highest level since January, showing troubling signs of persistence. In other words, the market is essentially trying to figure out which force matters most, and is repricing gold by the hour as it sorts through the confusion.\nWhen it comes to figuring out today's gold market, though, inflation, in particular, could be key. Historically, investors have turned to gold as an inflation hedge, a safe-haven during uncertainty and a portfolio diversifier, but the relationship between gold and inflation isn't as straightforward as you may expect.\nFind out how you can start adding gold to your investment portfolio now.\nGold prices and inflation: What investors should know now\nBefore you make any decisions about adding gold to your portfolio or dumping what you already own, here's what the data actually tells us about how these two forces interact:\nGold and inflation don't always move together\nGold is often called an inflation hedge, but that doesn't mean it always protects you from rising prices. In some periods, gold has gone up alongside inflation, but in others, it's barely moved or even dropped. That's because gold prices depend on a mix of factors, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, central bank decisions, global demand and investor sentiment. In other words, it's influenced by a lot more than just inflation, though that does play a significant role.\nFor new investors, this means it's risky to rely on gold alone to protect your money from inflation. Instead, think of it as one piece of a bigger picture. It's something that can help balance your portfolio when the economy is unpredictable, but not a guaranteed safeguard.\nExplore your gold investing options and find the right fit today.\nFuture inflationary issues could push gold's price higher\nGold prices hit record levels this year before slipping recently. For long-term investors, that kind of pullback can be an opportunity. If inflation ticks up again or interest rates drop further over time, history suggests gold prices could climb once more.\nFor example, in past periods when inflation surprised to the upside, gold prices quickly rebounded after dips, often reaching new highs as investors sought safety from the impact. The same could happen again if future inflation data comes in hotter than expected or if the Fed signals more rate cuts ahead.\nStill, remember that gold's short-term price swings can be sharp. If you're new to investing, don't go all-in at once. Consider dollar-cost averaging, which essentially means buying small, consistent amounts over time, to smooth out the price fluctuations.\nInflation reiterates why gold should not dominate your portfolio\nEven if you're optimistic about gold's future, this precious metal shouldn't make up the bulk of your investments. Instead, think of it as a tool to diversify, meaning it's a way to spread risk across different types of assets.\nWhen inflation rises, stocks and bonds sometimes fall at the same time. Gold can move differently, helping to balance things out. But because it doesn't generate income, most experts suggest kee"

Out of the total exported refined products, 1 million bpd comprises diesel.\nThere are already clear signs of buyers looking for alternative grades.\n\u201cThis is evident when looking at the Brent-Dubai spread, which has collapsed since the sanctions\u2019 announcement (driven by strength in the Dubai benchmark),\u201d Patterson said.\nThis year, China has been the primary purchaser of Russian crude oil, importing an average of 2 million bpd through both pipelines and vessels, according to ING\u2019s estimates.\nIndia\u2019s imports of Russian crude have also been significant, averaging over 1.5 million bpd during the same period.\nThe oil market\u2019s primary attention will be on the significant volumes of oil directed towards China and India, Patterson said.\nReports indicate that Indian r"

                "body": "China\u2019s temporary pullback from seaborne Russian crude is not a retreat. It is risk management in real time, a reminder that scale buys choices and policy discipline pays. State refiners are pausing to run compliance checks after new U.S. sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, while pipeline flows continue, independent refiners reassess, and Beijing widens its sourcing net across West Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the process, China is re-pricing freight, deepening market infrastructure, and accelerating the shift to domestic offshore output and electrified demand. For investors, this is a portfolio moment.\nFresh U.S. measures targeting Rosneft and Lukoil froze assets and restricted counterparties, raising the risk profile around seaborne Russian cargoes. China imported roughly 1.4 million barrels per day of Russian oil this year, but about 900,000 bpd comes via pipeline under long-term agreements that are expected to continue. The near-term pause is concentrated in state firms\u2019 waterborne purchases, historically in the 250,000 to 500,000 bpd range, while private \u201cteapots\u201d are likely to resume after assessing impacts. India is also set to slow purchases as secondary sanctions pressure banks across Asia. The immediate market effect: higher global prices and tighter spot availability. China\u2019s response underscores a core strength\u2014policy capacity to rebalance flows quickly without compromising energy security.\nThe distinction between pipeline and seaborne is central. Physical infrastructure into Northeast China gives buyers optionality and continuity that ship-to-ship logistics cannot match under sanctions risk. That stabilizer allows Chinese refiners to negotiate supply elsewhere from a position of strength, not scramble. Expect more Middle East medium sours and West African light sweets in near-month slates as procurement desks arbitrage quality and freight. Several suppliers have reportedly paused sales to a sanctioned Shandong refiner, while private complexes with scale will lean into diversified sourcing. Net effect: China retains purchasing leverage while Russia hunts new homes for displaced barrels.\nTanker markets reacted fast. Very-large crude carrier daily rates on Middle East-to-China routes jumped over 100 percent week-on-week in the immediate aftermath of sanctions, reflecting longer voyages, reroutes, and premium risk pricing. That is revenue tailwind for Chinese oil shippers with modern fleets and scrubber-fitted tonnage. Onshore, Shanghai\u2019s INE crude contract and domestic risk tools are designed for moments like this\u2014when policy and market architecture give local players hedging capacity and price discovery closer to home. More long-term contracts will price off a China-centric benchmark as liquidity migrates east with the barrels.\nThe sanctions shock reinforces Beijing\u2019s two-track energy strategy. First, diversify physical oil supply with longer-tenor deals across West Asia, Africa, and Latin America while protecting pipeline inflows from Russia. Second, compress oil\u2019s share in final energy through faster electrification of transport and industry. The latter is already deflationary for oil demand growth: EV penetration is scaling across China and emerging export markets; battery costs are falling; and grid-scale renewables keep hitting new capacity milestones.

                "body": "EUR/USD is set to end the week with a 0.21% loss but stays above 1.16 for the third consecutive day. US inflation data missed estimates but remains below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. S&P Global reports suggest economic strength with growth in manufacturing and services PMIs in October.\nKey Economic Influences\nThe University of Michigan indicates growing consumer pessimism and potential for rising prices amid a prolonged US government shutdown. The US Dollar Index rose slightly to 98.94. US CPI rose 3.0% year-over-year, while core CPI saw a marginal decrease from the previous month.\nOctober US business activity showed resilience, with manufacturing and services PMIs rising. Consumer sentiment declined slightly with inflation expectations showing minimal change. The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points soon.\nEUR/USD\u2019s technical outlook remains neutral with support at 1.1600 and resistance aligning with the 20- and 100-day SMAs. The Euro accounted for 31% of all forex transactions in 2022. The European Central Bank maintains price stability through interest rate adjustments.\nKey economic indicators, including GDP and Trade Balance, can influence the Euro, with strong data benefiting the currency. Positive trade balances strengthen currencies by increasing demand for exports.\nTrading Strategy Considerations\nWith the EUR/USD trading in a tight range above 1.16, we see a market caught between conflicting signals from the United States. While weak inflation data supports the case for a Federal Reserve rate cut, surprisingly strong business activity PMIs suggest underlying economic strength. This uncertainty creates a challenging environment, as the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool now shows an 88% probability of a rate cut in November, a conviction the economic data doesn\u2019t fully support.\nThe ongoing US government shutdown, now in its fourth week, and a new trade investigation into China add significant political risk. A preliminary report from the Congressional Budget Office on October 23, 2025, estimated the shutdown is shaving approximately $2 billion per week off Q4 GDP growth, which could force the Fed\u2019s hand regardless of other data. For traders, this means we should anticipate sudden spikes in volatility tied to news out of Washington D.C.\nAcross the Atlantic, the situation is also mixed, with improving European PMI data suggesting economic recovery is taking hold. Eurostat data released on October 22, 2025, showed Eurozone industrial production rose 0.8% month-over-month, providing a tailwind for the Euro. However, Moody\u2019s negative outlook for France reminds us of the persistent sovereign debt challenges that plagued the region in years past, capping the Euro\u2019s potential.\nGiven the consolidation between key support at 1.1600 and resistance near 1.1660, we should consider strategies that profit from this lack of movement. Selling an iron condor, with short call options above 1.1750 and short put options below 1.1550 for December expiration, could be an effective way to collect premium. This strategy will benefit as long as the currency pair remains within this expected range over the coming weeks.\nHowever, we must also prepare for a potential breakout driven by a political event or a surprise from the Fed. Implied volatility on EUR/USD options has remained low, with the Cboe EuroCurrency Volatility Index (EVZ) hovering near 6.5%, below its three-month average of 8.0%. This makes buying long straddles or strangles an inexpensive way to hedge against, or profit from, a sharp move in either direction.\nUltimately, the market is betting heavily on the Fed cutting rates, which should weigh on the US Dollar. A simple way to position for this outcome is through buying EUR/USD call spreads, which offers a defined-risk way to target a move toward the 1.1800 level. This is a bet that the Fed\u2019s dovish stance, rather than the resilient PMI data, will be the dominant driver for the dollar in the final quarter of 2025."

After that, S&P Global showed that the economy shows signs of strength as manufacturing and services flash PMIs, expanded in October.\nMeanwhile, the University of Michigan (UoM) closed the docket for the day amid the US government shutdown reaching its twentieth fourth day, revealing that US consumers are growing slightly pessimistic, while estimating that prices could continue to rise.\nOf late, the Greenback trimmed some of its gains as the Trump administration launched a trade investigation whether China complied with a limited trade agreement reached in 20202 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, revealed Bloomberg.\nIn Europe, HCOB Flash Purchasing Managers Indices (PMIs) in October, improved from 49.8 to 50, and from 51.3 to 52.6, respectively.

The core CPI \u2014 which excludes food and energy \u2014 increased 3.0% year-over-year, down a tenth from the previous month.\n- US business activity accelerated in October, marking the second-fastest pace so far this year, according to preliminary \u201cflash\u201d PMI data from S&P Global. The report also highlighted the strongest increase in new business seen in 2025 to date, underscoring continued resilience in private-sector output. The S&P Global Manufacturing PMI rose to 52.2 in October from 52.0 in September, signaling continued expansion in the sector. The Services PMI climbed to 55.2 from 54.2, marking a three-month high and underscoring solid momentum in business activity.\n- The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index was revised down to 53.6 in October from the preliminary reading of 55.0, missing expectations of 55.1. One-year inflation expectations eased slightly to 4.6% from 4.7% in September, while the five-year outlook edged higher to 3.9% from 3.7%.\n- The US central bank is expected to cut rates 25 basis points to the 3.75% - 4% range, with traders already pricing an additional 0.25% reduction for the December meeting.\nTechnical outlook: EUR/USD consolidates, but slightly bullish\nEUR/USD\u2019s technical outlook has modestly improved but remains neutral as the pair trades beneath the confluence of the 20-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) at 1.1653 and 1.1658, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below the neutral 50 mark, suggesting growing bearish momentum.\nImmediate support is seen at 1.1600, followed by 1.1550 and 1.1500. A clear break below this zone would expose the August 1 cycle low around 1.1391. On the upside, resist"

                "body": "S&P Global PMI Data\nDespite positive UK indicators, GBP struggles to gain momentum, as expectations of a Bank of England rate cut linger. The swaps market indicates a 25% chance of a November rate cut. In contrast, US inflation data was softer, with CPI rising 0.3% in September, supporting Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations.\nUS S&P Global PMI data showed robust private sector activity, with Composite PMI at 54.8, aiding USD recovery. GBP/USD remained nearly unchanged, with British Pound showing significant strength against the Canadian Dollar.\nThe British economy is showing surprising strength, with both retail sales and business activity beating expectations. This creates a difficult situation, as the Bank of England is still expected to cut interest rates. This tug-of-war between strong data and rate cut expectations is keeping GBP/USD pinned around the 1.3325 level.\nMarket Expectations\nWe see the market pricing in 50 basis points of BoE rate cuts over the next year, but we should be cautious. Looking back, UK inflation was very stubborn throughout 2024, and the BoE may be hesitant to cut rates too quickly despite the recent drop to 3%. Traders could consider options that profit if the Bank of England holds rates steady at its November meeting, which would go against current market odds.\nOn the other side of the pair, softer US inflation data supports the case for Federal Reserve rate cuts, a trend we first saw emerge back in late 2023 when the Fed began signaling its policy pivot. However, strong US business activity, with the Composite PMI rising to 54.8, is keeping the US Dollar supported for now. This stalemate between the two economies is containing the currency pair in a narrow range.\nWith conflicting data from both sides, GBP/USD is likely to remain range-bound in the short term. One-month implied volatility for the pair has recently fallen to 6.8%, which is low compared to the levels we saw throughout most of 2024. This suggests that now could be an opportune time to buy long-dated options, such as straddles, to position for a breakout.\nThe main events to watch are the upcoming central bank meetings in early November. Any surprise from either the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve could easily break the current deadlock. Therefore, we believe the best approach is to trade the coming volatility itself, rather than betting on a specific direction for the pound."

This came even after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s comments that he would meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia to de-escalate the renewed trade tensions over rare earth metals and software.\nMeanwhile, the failure to end the budget deadlock between the Democrats and Republicans for the fourth consecutive week also weighed on investors\u2019 sentiment.\nToward midweek, tensions eased on the US-China trade front as Trump touted a fair deal with China during his meeting with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping in South Korea on October 30.\nHowever, the relief to markets was only short-lived as risk-off flows returned after Trump imposed sanctions on Russian oil companies and accused the Russians of a lack of commitment toward ending the war in Ukraine.\nMarkets also digested the disappointing earnings reports from US tech giants. Tesla reported below forecast profits, while Netflix tumbled on a grim outlook.\n\u201cApple shares fell 1.6% after the tech giant was hit with a complaint to EU antitrust regulators by two civil rights groups on Wednesday,\u201d per Reuters.\nOn the UK-side of the story, the Pound Sterling extended losses after softer inflation data for September boosted bets for a BoE rate cut in December.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed on Wednesday, consumer inflation held steady at 3.8% last month, defying the expected 4% growth.\n\u201cTraders rushed to price a 75% chance of the BoE cutting rates by its December meeting - up sharply from a 46% probability before the data was published - although those odds eased back to 61% on Thursday,\u201d according to Reuters.\nOn Friday, the ONS reported that UK Retail Sales unexpectedly rose 0.5% over the month in September, marking a fourth consecutive monthly increase. Meanwhile, the headline S&P Global Flash UK Composite PMI registered 51.1 in October, up from 50.1 in September and above the 50.6 expected. The Pound Sterling found little inspiration from the upbeat data but failed to stage a decisive rebound.\nHeading into the weekend, GBP/USD remained near the lower limit of its weekly range as investors assessed mixed macroeconomic data releases from the US. Annual inflation, as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index, edged higher to 3% in September from 2.9% in August. This reading came in below the market expectation of 3.1%. On a positive note, S&P Global Composite PMI improved to 54.8 in October's flash estimate from 53.9 in September.\nEyes on the Fed verdict and potential US data releases\nMarkets are expecting that the budget deadlock between Democrats and Republicans could end anytime soon, paving the way for the release of a string of delayed US economic data in the upcoming week.\nIn case the government funding is restored, the September US Nonfarm Payrolls reports will be published and will hog the limelight alongside the Fed\u2019s October 28-29 monetary p"

The Services PMI jumped to 55.2, while the Manufacturing PMI edged up to 52.2.\nHowever, not all indicators pointed to strength. The University of Michigan (UoM) survey painted a weaker picture of household confidence. The Consumer Sentiment Index was revised down to 53.6 in October\u2019s final reading from 55.0 initially, while the Consumer Expectations Index slipped to 50.3 from 51.2. Inflation expectations were mixed, with the 1-year outlook steady at 4.6% and the 5-year measure rising to 3.9% from 3.7%.\nFrom a technical view, AUD/USD is moving sideways in a tight 0.6480\u20130.6520 range after a recent Head-and-Shoulders breakdown on the daily chart. The pair trades below the 21-day, 50-day, and 100-day moving averages, showing a slight bearish tilt. The RSI near 45 reflects a neutral tone, indicating that momentum remains balanced between buyers and sellers.\nOn the downside, immediate support lies at 0.6480, and a break below this area could pave the way toward 0.6450, followed by the August 22 low near 0.6415. On the upside, resistance is seen around 0.6535, and a daily close above 0.6560 could neutralize the bearish setup, opening the door toward 0.6600 in the near term.\nEconomic Indicator\nRBA Trimmed Mean CPI (YoY)\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on a quarterly basis, measures the changes in the price of a fixed basket of goods and services acquired by household consumers The YoY reading compares prices in the reference quarter to the same quarter a year earlier. The trimmed mean, which is a measure of underlying inflation, is calculated as the weighted average of the central 70% of the quarterly price change distribution of all CPI components in order to smooth the data from the more-volatile components.Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the Australian Dollar (AUD), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Wed Oct 29, 2025 00:30\nFrequency: Quarterly\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: 2.7%\nSource: Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThe quarterly"

                "body": "China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) plans to implement key investment projects and enhance government investment structures. Emphasis will be on boosting domestic demand and allocating more resources to improve people\u2019s livelihoods, while curbing local market protectionism.\nThe AUD/USD pair is observed to have dipped by 0.04%, last trading at 0.6510. Factors influencing the Australian Dollar include interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), iron ore prices, and the economic health of China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner.\nImpact of China\u2019s Demand\nThe RBA affects the AUD through interest rate adjustments aiming for a stable inflation rate of 2-3%. High interest rates support the AUD, while low rates typically weaken it.\nChina\u2019s demand for Australian exports influences the AUD, with strong Chinese economic performance boosting demand for the currency. Iron ore, Australia\u2019s top export worth $118 billion, impacts the AUD, rising when iron ore prices increase and vice versa.\nAustralia\u2019s Trade Balance also affects the AUD\u2019s value, with a positive balance generally strengthening the currency. A positive Trade Balance occurs when exports surpass imports, enhancing currency value through increased foreign demand.\nChina\u2019s announcement to boost government investment is a significant signal for the coming weeks. We should view this as a clear precursor to increased demand for industrial commodities. This policy shift directly supports a more positive outlook for the Australian dollar.\nImpact on Iron Ore Prices\nThis move doesn\u2019t come in a vacuum, as we\u2019ve seen recent data showing China\u2019s Caixin Manufacturing PMI dipping to 49.5 in September 2025. The stimulus is a direct response to that weakness and softer-than-expected Q3 GDP growth. The current AUD/USD level around 0.6510 might not yet reflect the full potential of this spending.\nAustralia\u2019s fortunes are closely tied to iron ore, its biggest export to China. With prices for 62% Fe iron ore recently hovering near $105 per tonne, this planned infrastructure spending is set to create a strong tailwind. Derivative traders should consider long positions in iron ore futures, anticipating a price recovery driven by renewed demand.\nWe remember the significant commodity booms following China\u2019s large-scale stimulus efforts after the 2008 financial crisis and again during the 2021 recovery. Those periods saw substantial rallies in both iron ore and the AUD. This new announcement hints at a similar, though perhaps smaller-scale, pattern emerging.\nConsidering the Reserve Bank of Australia is holding rates steady amid persistent inflation, the AUD has a solid foundation. Buying AUD/USD call options with expirations in the next few months could be a viable strategy to capture the upside. This allows traders to benefit from a potential rally while limiting downside risk."

Investors remain cautious ahead of the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) later in the day, and the anticipated speech by Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Michele Bullock on Monday.\nSigns of easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may provide some mild support to the Australian Dollar (AUD), which is often viewed as a proxy for China.

Discussions could range from the resumption of soybean purchases by China to nuclear arms control issues.\nAttention now turns to the release of the US CPI for September, expected to show a 3.1% annual increase, up from 2.9% in August. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is also projected to rise by 3.1% YoY. A stronger-than-expected reading could revive fears of tariff-driven inflation and temporarily support the US Dollar (USD), lowering prospects of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in December, while a softer outcome would reinforce them.\nIn this context, volatility in AUD/USD remains limited as investors await new macroeconomic catalysts to guide their positions.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

Note that this slope now converges on the October high-close and the monthly high at 153.08/27. A break/ daily close above this threshold is needed to fuel the next leg of the advance with subsequent resistance objectives eyed at the 1.618% extension of the September rally at 153.83 and the 78.6% retracement of the 2025 yearly range at 154.82. The next major technical consideration is eyed at the November high-close / 1.618% extension of the April advance at 156.26/29- look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nInitial support rests at 151.63/95- a region defined by the 61.8% retracement and the 2022/2023 swing highs. Near-term bullish invalidation remains with the 100% extension April rally / August high at 150.88/92. Note that the lower parallel converges on this threshold early next week and a break / daily close below would be needed to suggest a more significant high is in place / a larger reversal is underway. Subsequent support seen at the September high-close at 149.81 and the December low /May high at 148.65.\nBottom line: The USD/JPY is trading just below resistance at the monthly highs ahead of major event risk next week.

Stay nimble into the releases and watch the weekly closes for guidance.

The move consolidates one of the dollar\u2019s strongest runs this quarter, with the pair trading just below multi-month highs at 152.80\u2013153.10, reflecting diverging policy trajectories between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.\nU.S. Economic Data Reinforces Dollar Momentum\nThe dollar\u2019s latest advance came as the S&P Global Composite PMI jumped to 54.8 in October from 53.9, signaling the strongest U.S. private-sector expansion in three months. Services PMI climbed to 55.2, and Manufacturing PMI edged up to 52.2, both beating expectations. The data reaffirmed underlying U.S. economic resilience, helping offset softer Consumer Price Index (CPI) readings. Headline CPI rose 0.3% MoM, slightly below the 0.4% forecast, while annual inflation moderated to 3.0%, down from 3.1% expectations. The core CPI printed at 0.2% MoM, suggesting stable underlying price pressures.\nThis combination of strong business activity and easing inflation reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue its gradual rate-cut trajectory. Markets now price in a 25 basis-point cut at the October 29\u201330 FOMC meeting, with another likely in December, bringing total 2025 cuts to 75 bps. Despite the softer CPI, the PMI rebound suggests the U.S. economy can absorb lower rates without triggering a slowdown, keeping Treasury yields elevated and sustaining dollar demand.\nJapanese Yen Under Pressure Amid Fiscal Expansion and Policy Stagnation\nIn Japan, the yen\u2019s persistent weakness remains tied to fiscal and policy divergence. Headline and core Japanese CPI rose to 2.9% YoY in September, accelerating from 2.7% in August and marking the first uptick since May. Yet the Bank of Japan (BoJ) continues to maintain an ultra-loose stance, reluctant to raise rates as fiscal pressures mount. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s newly announced \u00a513.7 trillion ($92.19 billion) stimulus package \u2014 exceeding last year\u2019s proposal \u2014 aims to cushion households and boost small business activity through fuel tax cuts, subsidies, and local grants. While the measures seek to counter inflation\u2019s impact, they risk further yen depreciation as they expand Japan\u2019s debt load and dilute real yield advantage against the U.S. dollar.\nFinance Minister Katayama acknowledged the potential need for new government bond issuance to fund the package, a move that underscores fiscal prioritization over currency stability. Market participants now expect the USD/JPY cross to remain supported above 151.60, as Japanese authorities are seen tolerating further weakness to protect domestic growth momentum.\nRead More\n-\nSCHG ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHG) Climbs to $32.75 as AI and Tech Giants Propel New Growth Wave\n24.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nRipple XRP ETFs (XRPR, XRPI) Rally as XRP Price Hits $2.48 and Assets Surpass $100 Million\n24.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - (NG=F) Steadies at $3.32 as EU LNG Ban, Falling U.S. Output, and Winter Demand Fuel Bullish Setup\n24.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Forecast - Sterling Slides for Sixth Day to 1.3320 as Fed-BoE Policy Gap Widens and Traders Brace for U.S. CPI\n24.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Picture: Double-Top Resistance Near 153.10\nTechnically, USD/JPY trades just below a significant resistance zone at 153.08\u2013153.27, the October high and the up"

UST bond yields are lower but the reaction has been contained given the market was already fully priced for a rate cut from the FOMC next Wednesday. In addition, while services inflation slowed, mostly due to a notable slowdown in rents, (OER specifically), there were also signs of tariff-related inflation pressures in the goods sector. After the FOMC on Wednesday, the BoJ will announce its policy decision on Thursday and given the new political leadership team under PM Takaichi, the BoJ will refrain from hiking. How much clarity on policy may leave it difficult for BoJ Governor Ueda to offer much explicit guidance. Today\u2019s PM Takaichi gave a speech in the Diet outlining the policy focuses for the new government. Increased fiscal spending and additional JGB issuance appears likely although there was no mention of a sales tax cut which has helped alleviate fiscal concerns and limit further yen selling at these elevated levels in USD/JPY.\nMIXED PERFORMANCE FOR US DOLLAR AS YEN UNDERPERFORMS AGAIN\nSource: Bloomberg, 13.45 BST, 24th October 2025 (Weekly % Change vs. USD)\nTrade Ideas:\nWe are maintaining long EUR/GBP and short CAD/CHF trade ideas.\nJPY Flows: Balance of payments: :\nThe Balance of Payments data for August revealed a shrinking goods and services trade deficit and bond flow data revealed modest net flows into the US and Europe.\nFX Correlation Heatmaps:\nOur cross-asset correlation heatmap indicates weakening G10 FX correlations with US rates while the strongest correlation for USD/JPY is now crude oil. Clearly, the latest US sanctions on Russian oil companies that lifted crude oil prices is a negative development for the yen. Brent is up over 8% this week with the yen lagging in the G10 FX performance table.\nFX Views\nJPY: Takaichi\u2019s speech, JGBs & a key week ahead\nThe post-Takaichi leadership victory high of 153.27 for USD/JPY is back in sight again and a breach of this level would take us to levels we haven\u2019t seen since February of this year, making a test of the 155-level all the more likely over the coming trading sessions. Following today\u2019s speech in the Diet by PM Takaichi, which we assess below, and the CPI data in the US, next week will be a key week for USD/JPY with the visit to Japan of President Trump from Monday through to Wednesday which will then be followed by the FOMC policy announcement on Wednesday evening and the BoJ policy announcement on Thursday. President Trump will meet Emperor Naruhito at the Imperial Palace on Monday which will be followed on Tuesday by a summit meeting and lunch with PM Takaichi. The US-Japan security alliance, Indo-Pacific strategy, and trade and trade agreements are the topics for discussion. Trump will have other visits including a tour of a US navy base and will depart on Wednesday for South Korea. Security and economic cooperation will likely dominate discussions and in that context, the new administration in Tokyo would probably prefer this first meeting not to be accompanied by a backdrop of extended depreciation of the yen.\nPM Takaichi today gave a speech to the Diet outlining the policy agenda ahead. Takaichi outlined the basic policy steps to strengthen the economy. Measures against rising prices; crisis management investment via the creation of a \u2018Japan Growth Strategy Council\u2019; food and energy security; disaster prevention measures; health and medical security; diplomacy and security; and amending the constitution were the main topics presented in the speech. The yen did weaken modestly during the speech \u2013 the intra-day high in USD/JPY (153.06) today was just after the details of the speech were released and the focus was on the aim to \u201cincrease tax revenue without raising tax rates\u201d which would \u201crestrain the growth rate of debt within the growth rate of the economy\u201d.

For the week, the currency was up 0.1%, helped by hotter-than-expected domestic inflation data.\nPrime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada stands ready to resume trade talks with the United States that President Donald Trump halted over an anti-tariff advertisement issued by Ontario's provincial government.\n\"The trade headline reinforces the pessimism around CAD and its fundamental backdrop is still pretty weak, so I think people are still happy to buy USD-CAD on dips until the growth side in Canada looks better,\" said Erik Nelson, a macro strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in London.\nSpeculators have raised bearish bets on the Canadian dollar to the highest level since April, according to the latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which was produced before the federal government shutdown. (1090741NNET)\n\"I don't think inflation alone is going to help the loonie,\" Nelson said. \"We still think the Bank of Canada is going to cut next week.\"\nThe Bank of Canada will reduce its target for the overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.25% on October 29 to support a weak economy, according to a Reuters poll.\nThe U.S. dollar DXY edged lower against a basket of major currencies after U.S. inflation data kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut rates again next week.\nCanadian bond yields moved lower across the curve, with the 10-year (CA10YT=RR) down 1.8 basis points at 3.085%."

                "body": "The USD/CAD exchange rate holds steady above 1.4000 following softer-than-expected US inflation data. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.3% month-on-month in September, marginally below the anticipated 0.4%.\nThe annual inflation rate rose to 3% from 2.9%, slightly under the forecasted 3.1%. Core inflation eased to 0.2% monthly and 3% year-on-year. These figures are beneath market expectations, reinforcing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December.\nThe Us Dollar Influence\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) declines by 0.12% to 98.80 as the market anticipates monetary easing. Despite this, the subdued Canadian Dollar causes the USD/CAD rate to stay above the 1.4000 threshold.\nThe soft US Dollar combines with the pressure on the Canadian Dollar to maintain the firm position of USD/CAD. Key factors such as Federal Reserve guidance and oil price trends could influence the pair\u2019s direction.\nThe table reflects a 0.05% decrease in the USD against the CAD, indicating the USD\u2019s relative stability. Other currency changes include USD\u2019s 0.12% dip against the JPY and 0.18% against the GBP.\nThe softer US inflation figures have cemented expectations for Federal Reserve easing. We see markets are now pricing in a near 100% chance of a rate cut next week, with CME\u2019s FedWatch tool showing a 75% probability of another cut in December. This outlook generally points to a weaker US Dollar ahead.\nCanadian Dollar Headwinds\nHowever, the Canadian dollar is facing its own headwinds, which is keeping the USD/CAD pair above the 1.4000 level. WTI crude oil prices have struggled to hold gains, recently dipping below $80 per barrel and weighing on the commodity-linked currency. The Bank of Canada has also signaled a more cautious stance on its own policy, limiting the CAD\u2019s appeal.\nFor derivative traders, this creates significant uncertainty, which suggests volatility may be underpriced. Buying long-dated straddles or strangles on USD/CAD could be a prudent way to position for a larger move, whether it breaks higher or reverses sharply. This strategy profits from a significant price swing in either direction before the options expire.\nIf we believe the Fed\u2019s dovish pivot will eventually dominate, buying USD/CAD put options offers a defined-risk way to bet on a decline. This allows traders to capitalize on a move back below 1.4000 while limiting potential losses to the premium paid. Consider puts with expirations after the Fed\u2019s December meeting to capture that potential catalyst.\nWe have seen similar situations before, such as during the 2022-2023 hiking cycle when central bank policies diverged globally. The currency that ultimately weakened was the one with the more dovish central bank, regardless of broader trends. Right now, the tug-of-war between the Fed and the Bank of Canada is the main event to watch."

Prices Face Rare Red October, Testing \u201cUptober\u201d Legacy\nOctober is shaping up as one of Bitcoin\u2019s weakest in years, threatening the cryptocurrency\u2019s reputation for strong autumn rallies. After an early surge to new highs, BTCUSD has struggled, retreating to a range between $105,825 and $115,403. If current trends persist, Bitcoin could post its first negative October since 2018.\nDigital assets meet tradfi in London at the fmls25\nEarly Gains Fade, Market Shows Strain\nBitcoin\u2019s historically bullish October, dubbed \u201cUptober\u201d by traders, has seen its momentum stall. Data from CoinGlass shows BTC is currently 2.77% below its monthly opening price, with only a 4% decline needed to cement its worst performance in more than a decade. By comparison, September saw a more than 5.16% increase.\nIn the past five years, 2021 recorded the strongest monthly returns for October at 39% amid a booming market when prices surged to nearly $70K.

With two weeks remaining, the final outcome for Bitcoin in October remains open, balancing between seasonal expectations and macroeconomic headwinds.\nFrom another fundamental perspective: historically, Bitcoin\u2019s price rallies followed halving events, which cut block rewards in half and created sharp supply shocks that fueled bull markets, according to Bitcoin Magazine.\nBitcoin Magazine@BitcoinMagazineOct 24, 20255% of capital rotation from Gold to Bitcoin can send the BTC price to $242,391\nBullish \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/dHv2K36teo\nHowever, the current cycle has unfolded differently: after the most recent halving, Bitcoin spent five months in sideways consolidation rather than seeing an immediate post-halving surge.

                "body": "BlockDAG Combines Bitcoin's Security & Ethereum's Smart Power: Traders Secure $0.0015 BDAG Ahead of AMA\nFor years, the crypto community faced a dilemma: should they choose Bitcoin, the ultimate secure store of value, or Ethereum, the leading network for decentralized applications? Bitcoin excelled in trust and security but lacked utility, while Ethereum offered flexibility and smart contract potential but faced scalability and cost challenges. This divide shaped much of the market's evolution.\nYet, BlockDAG (BDAG) enters with a powerful proposition: merging both advantages into one ecosystem. It eliminates the need to choose between stability and usability. With a blend of Proof-of-Work (PoW) security and advanced smart contract capabilities, BlockDAG offers an asset that not only stores value securely but also drives real utility. It stands as a unified model where functionality meets dependability.\nFor years, Bitcoin symbolized unmatched digital security, earning the title of \"digital gold.\" Its PoW consensus has proven resilient, protecting its network from attacks for over a decade. However, while it's the most trusted asset for long-term storage, Bitcoin remains limited in its ability to host complex decentralized applications or DeFi protocols.\nEthereum, on the other hand, revolutionized the blockchain space with its smart contracts and became the backbone for DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications. Yet, it often faces high gas fees, slower transaction speeds, and concerns over its security after transitioning away from PoW. This forced many to choose between unwavering security and broader functionality, a compromise BlockDAG aims to end.\nAt its core, BlockDAG's design rests on the robust Proof-of-Work (PoW) framework, the same trusted system that powers Bitcoin. This ensures that the BDAG network inherits a high level of decentralization, transparency, and protection against attacks. BDAG is created as a dependable asset offering long-term reliability and trustworthiness, maintaining the essence of digital gold while expanding its potential.\nBut the project doesn't stop at security. This PoW foundation serves as a launchpad for broader use cases. It fortifies the network's resilience and decentralization, giving BDAG holders peace of mind while enabling an ecosystem designed for practical, everyday use. In BlockDAG's approach, security is not the destination; it's the cornerstone for expansion.\nBlockDAG goes beyond being a secure network; it's also fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), unlocking immense potential for decentralized applications. This compatibility transforms BlockDAG into a versatile environment for DeFi, Web3, and gaming development.\nDevelopers can seamlessly transfer or build dApps from Ethereum onto BlockDAG. It supports complex smart contracts for finance, metaverse, and other decentralized systems. Users can mint new assets, participate in staking or lending, and explore decentralized trading.\nThis integration turns BDAG into a usable and functional asset within a growing digital ecosystem, merging the best traits of both store of value and operational utility.\nThis Friday, October 24, at 3 PM UTC, BlockDAG will host an exclusive Binance AMA, marking one of its most pivotal moments. The event promises vital insights into its roadmap, ecosystem expansion, and upcoming Keynote 4: The Launch Note before the much-awaited GENESIS DAY.\nBlockDAG's ecosystem continues to surge, with over 27 billion coins sold and $430M+ raised in presale funding. Currently in Batch 31, BDAG is priced at $0.0304, though it's still available for a limited time at a special $0.0015 through the TGE code. With momentum building and major announcements ahead, this AMA could accelerate the project's next growth wave. Early holders are moving quickly before the next dashboard update and price revision.\nBlockDAG's architecture erases the traditional divide between security and functionality. It introduces a hybrid as"

Ethereum remains the clear number-two by market capitalization after Bitcoin, with CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko reporting ETH's dominant position among smart-contract platforms.This report frames an evidence-based Ethereum Price Prediction and ETH outlook 2025, while introducing Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) as a rising token that seeks to capture attention through novel tokenomics and marketing. Bloomberg, CoinDesk, and Reuters coverage of on-chain trends and regulatory moves informs the analysis.\nOur methodology blends on-chain metrics-transaction volume, active addresses, and total value locked-with macro indicators like interest rates and dollar strength, plus network fundamentals such as EIP-1559 burn rates and staking ratios from Ethereum 2.0. We also examine tokenomics for Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER https://bitcoinhyper.com) and sentiment signals to deliver a balanced crypto market forecast and an ETH vs HYPER comparison for U.S. investors.\nThe target audience includes retail and institutional crypto investors, financial journalists, and U.S.-based market participants seeking a clear Ethereum price forecast 2025 and actionable insights on whether HYPER can materially challenge ETH's market share.\nMarket Overview: Current State of Ethereum and Bitcoin Hyper\nEthereum headlines the crypto market with steady liquidity across Binance, Coinbase Pro, and Kraken. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko show ETH trading inside a defined range with strong 24-hour volume and a high crypto market cap relative to most altcoins. Order books on major exchanges reflect deep bids near key support levels and ample ask-side liquidity during intraday rallies.\nFor on-chain context, ETH on-chain metrics highlight average daily active addresses and transaction throughput that rose after the merge. Gas fee trends have settled from peak levels, while staking participation on the Beacon Chain sits at a notable percentage of total supply. EIP-1559 burn totals continue to reduce net issuance, and total value locked across Uniswap, Aave, and MakerDAO remains central to Ethereum's DeFi utility according to DeFiLlama and Dune Analytics.\nRecent fundamentals shaping ETH price action include the shift to Proof-of-Stake, planned protocol upgrades that target sharding and layer-2 integrations, and heightened institutional interest from firms such as Grayscale and BlackRock. Regulatory signals from the SEC and macro data points like CPI prints and Federal Reserve policy moves have correlated with short-term swings across the broader crypto market cap.\nBitcoin Hyper (HYPER https://bitcoinhyper.com) launched with clear tokenomics and market listings that accelerated early liquidity. Project documentation and CoinMarketCap entries identify the token standard, initial distribution outline, circulating supply, and any supply cap. Exchange announcements and DEX listings provide an early read on HYPER market metrics and spot liquidity depth.\nHYPER on-chain metrics reveal daily active addresses, smart contract interactions, and developer activity visible on GitHub. The token's use cases - ranging from payments to governance - and any built-in incentives or burns are driving initial ecosystem growth. Presence in DeFi and partnerships help gauge real utility and adoption rates.\nDerivatives flow and sentiment signals show how traders price risk for both ETH and HYPER. Open interest on ETH futures and options at CME and major crypto venues, perpetual swap funding rates, and whale transfers all feed into short-term ETH price action. Social analytics from Santiment and LunarCrush reflect retail momentum, while Glassnode and IntoTheBlock provide on-chain flows and concentration metrics.\nRegulatory risk remains a major variable for U.S. investors.

                "body": "Solana (SOL) has finally flipped bullish after weeks of consolidation, with traders eyeing a rebound toward the $200 mark as buying momentum strengthens across major exchanges. Whale accumulation and renewed developer activity on the Solana network have boosted sentiment, fueling expectations of a sustained uptrend heading into Q4. However, while SOL\u2019s recovery signals renewed market confidence, retail investors are increasingly turning their attention toward a new DeFi altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the best cryptocurrency to invest in today.\nCurrently priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has raised more than $17.8 million. Investors have less time remaining since the phase is already over 70% sold out. As Solana continues its climb, Mutuum Finance is the best crypto to buy for investors aiming to capture early-stage growth potential before the next bull-run peaks.\nSolana (SOL) Price Forecast: Bulls Eyeing a Return to the $250 Mark\nSolana (SOL) is gaining strength once again as bulls gather momentum at its current support levels. According to analysts, if Solana is able to hold this critical base and keep pushing to the upside, a breakout can easily retest the $240\u2013$250 resistance level in the next sessions. The chart suggests that the said bullish beauty may be awakening once more, beckoning a possible return of the upper uptrend. As traders closely monitor Solana\u2019s next clear direction, investor attention is also increasingly focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gradually gaining market attention in anticipation of 2025\u2019s predicted rally. Many consider MUTM the best cryptocurrency to invest today due to its early-stage growth potential.\nMutuum Finance Presale Phase 6\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is skyrocketing in presale stage 6 powered by strong investor demand. This phase is now almost sold out, and the $0.035 token presents a good buy-in opportunity before Phase 7 starts and prices go higher. The rally reflects investors\u2019 confidence, making MUTM the best crypto to buy for those looking to enter early in the DeFi market.\nOver 17,380 investors have bought more than $17.8 million worth of MUTM tokens. The massive turnout is indicative of increasing global interest in Mutuum Finance\u2019s decentralized platform, strong fundamentals, and long-term growth prospects. Its performance has many labeling MUTM the best cryptocurrency to invest today for early adopters seeking high upside.\nEarn Passive Income as a Supplier\nAs a supplier on the platform, you can lock crypto assets, including USDT, into the liquidity pool and receive passive income in the form of the annual percentage yield (APY). The APY is also subject to market demand in a bid to have your returns match up to prevailing trends in the crypto market. Taking the example of an average APY of 10%, a $50,000 deposit has the potential to earn $5,000 in passive income within one year. It is a convenient and easy manner of putting your crypto assets to work without selling or trading them actively.\nBorrow Funds Without Selling Your Assets\nFor borrowers, the platform provides a flexible way of attaining liquidity without having to sell your current assets. For example, if you have ETH but need money for other investments or personal use, you can borrow USDT using your ETH as collateral. Loans have no repayment schedule. They earn interest according to an APY based on market demand. This structure enables borrowers to keep ownership of their underlying assets while gaining access to the capital they require.\nMutuum Finance has garnered more than $17.8 million from over 17,380 investors, and with more than 70% of Phase 6 now sold, $0.035 tokens are selling out quickly. Early adopters can take advantage of its dual-lending P2C and P2P ecosystem, generate passive income, and enjoy flexible borrowing, while positioning for early-stage growth in front of the next bull run. Don\u2019t wait. Go to the official Mutuum Finance platform now and buy your tokens before Phase 6 e"

The program is designed to solve one of the most significant challenges facing crypto startups: the high expense and complexity of bootstrapping deep trading liquidity.\nUnder the new grant, Saros will commit its native $SAROS token to match the tokens contributed by partner projects, creating instant, deep liquidity pools. This allows projects to establish robust trading markets for their tokens simply by utilizing idle assets from their treasury, rather than spending capital on accumulating stablecoins (like USDC) or costly liquidity incentives to attract users.\nThe importance of this program is already evident. The existing BONK/SAROS pool on the platform regularly demonstrates superior volume per dollar of Total Value Locked (TVL) compared to its equivalent stablecoin pair BONK/USDC, showcasing the efficiency and arbitrage opportunities created by pairing assets with the actively traded $SAROS token.\n\"The Saros Liquidity Grant Program solves a big problem for projects with tokens,\" said Lynn Nguyen, CEO of Saros. \"When combined with Solana\u2019s aggregator-led swap routing, it means they no longer need to commit cash or incentives to bootstrap deep liquidity pools. This approach creates deep, high-efficiency liquidity pools at a zero-cost basis for our partners, which is a massive unlock for ecosystem development.\"\nNguyen, who brings a wealth of experience from top-tier institutions including FTX US, Alameda Research, Falcon X, Cube Exchange, and traditional finance (TradFi) hedge funds, is positioning Saros to become the core liquidity provider for the Solana network.\nThe program is already attracting a strong roster of participants, with initial partners including BONK (Social layer and community meme on Solana); PORTALS (the Roblox of Web3); and K (the native utility and governance token of Sidekick Labs).\nReflecting on the liquidity grant, Sidekick Labs said that the \u201cpartnership with Saros allows us to explore new liquidity models that align with our LiveFi vision \u2014 connecting real-time engagement with decentralized trading\nSaros is also reserving a total of seven-figures of grant liquidity for projects launching tokens on Solana through its partners Wormhole and Metaplex. With Wormhole, grants will be made available to projects bringing their tokens from other blockchains - making them tradable on Solana for the first time. Similarly, projects undergoing token generation events (TGEs) using Metaplex Genesis launch infrastructure will also qualify to apply for Saros liquidity grants.\nThe aim of the grant program is to directly increase overall liquidity and through this, trading experience for these tokens throughout the Solana ecosystem. Projects interested in applying for the program can contact the Saros team at hi(@)saros.xyz\nAbout Saros\nSaros is a Solana-based DEX and liquidity infrastructure connecting traders, LPs, and builders. Powered by the $SAROS token, it enhances capital efficiency through its Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) and Liquidity Book architecture, offering concentrated liquidity, surge pricing, and near zero-slippage swaps. Complementing its DLMM, the Saros AMM also provides deep liquid markets, combining to create one of the most efficient trading venues on Solana. Dedicated to Web3\u2019s most liquid assets, Saros empowers tokenized projects to launch, grow, and thrive - combining cutting-edge tech with backing from Solana Ventures, Hashed, Spartan, and Arche Fund to drive long-term capital for"

After weeks of choppy trading within a falling channel, SOL is hovering around $190, constrained by lower highs and weak rebounds.\nA breakout above $195, however, could decisively shift momentum, neutralizing bearish pressure and signaling a potential midterm trend reversal.\nNotably, Solana\u2019s recovery efforts continue to falter, underscoring bears\u2019 control as price action grinds within a falling channel. Each rebound is weaker than the last, confirming persistent selling pressure.\nAccording to Lingrid, only a decisive breakout above key resistance would signal a meaningful shift in momentum back toward the bulls.\nNevertheless, reclaiming $195 isn\u2019t just a technical milestone; it\u2019s the key to making Solana\u2019s mid-term structure bullish.\nAs a result, a strong close above this liquidity-packed resistance could squeeze short-sellers and clear a path toward $205\u2013$220, or even to the highs of $250.\nHong Kong Approves First Solana Spot ETF, Expanding Asia\u2019s Crypto Investment Frontier\nHong Kong continues to lead in digital asset innovation, granting regulatory approval for Asia\u2019s first Solana spot ETF\nIssued by China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC), the launch marks a major milestone in the region\u2019s institutional adoption of crypto and underscores Solana\u2019s rising prominence in regulated markets.\nThe Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) granted the approval, reinforcing the city\u2019s push to become a leading global center for regulated digital asset markets.\nBy expanding beyond existing Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, Hong Kong strengthens its position as Asia\u2019s most forward-thinking crypto jurisdiction.\nTherefore, Solana\u2019s addition reflects mounting demand for blockchain exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. With fast transactions, low fees, and a thriving developer base, Solana has become a leading hub for DeFi, tokenization, and emerging Web3 sectors such as gaming.\nAs a result, ChinaAMC\u2019s new product offers regulated, spot-backed access to SOL, giving investors a streamlined way to tap into the network\u2019s growth without the complexities of crypto custody."

                "body": "FTSE 100 Today: London Stocks Rise on Strong Retail Data and Economic Optimism\nThe FTSE 100 opened higher on Friday as better-than-expected UK retail sales lifted investor mood across London. The boost came after fresh data showed retail volumes rising, which reinforced hopes that consumer demand remains resilient.\nGains in consumer goods, banking, and energy stocks helped push the index up, while talk of a possible pause in interest rate rises by the Bank of England added to the optimism.\nWhat is driving the renewed confidence in London\u2019s stock market today? stronger spending data and calmer inflation signals.\nFTSE 100 Rises as Retail Sales Beat Expectations\nUK retail sales surprised economists by rising more than forecast, showing that shoppers kept spending despite price pressure. Retail volumes grew month on month, above the market consensus.\nThat news sent fellow investors back into consumer-facing stocks, lifting major retailers listed on the FTSE 100. The index gained as companies like Tesco, Marks & Spencer, and Next reacted positively to the data. The stronger retail print also reduced near-term recession fears and improved earnings visibility for many blue chips.\nWhy are strong retail numbers so important for the FTSE 100? Strong retail spending drives revenue for large UK-listed retailers and signals resilience in the wider economy. When consumers spend, company sales and profits tend to follow, and that supports stock prices.\nEconomic Optimism Lifts Market Sentiment\nBeyond retail, a string of better-than-expected macro readings has lifted market sentiment. Inflation readings have shown signs of easing in recent weeks, and energy prices have settled.\nThat mix gave traders more comfort that the Bank of England might pause tightening, or at least move more slowly on future hikes. Morningstar and market briefs noted a more upbeat tone across London markets as investors priced in a calmer policy path. The shift helped the FTSE 100 hold gains into the midday session.\nSector Moves Driving the FTSE 100 Rally\nThe day\u2019s advance in the FTSE 100 was broad-based, but retail and consumer staples led the charge. Banks and insurers also rose, as stable inflation supports lending growth and reduces pressure on margins. Energy majors such as BP and Shell benefited from steady oil prices and stronger commodity demand.\nAccording to trading desks, buying was heaviest in cyclical names that benefit directly from consumer spending. AI Stock research tools tracking sentiment showed growing interest in cyclical and value-oriented sectors, as investors rotated away from defensive positions.\nGlobal Market Context Supports London Stocks\nEuropean markets mirrored London\u2019s gains, with the DAX and CAC also trading higher on the same data beat. Asian markets were mixed overnight, but global sentiment improved on easing inflation signs in major economies.\nThe international backdrop matters for the FTSE 100 because many index members earn large parts of their revenues overseas. When global growth looks steadier and commodity prices remain stable, London-listed exporters and resource firms see demand improve. That global stability helped lift the FTSE 100 today.\nBank of England Policy Outlook and Market Impact\nTraders are watching the Bank of England closely. Better retail data and softer inflation increase the odds that the BoE will pause on further rate hikes. If the central bank signals a more patient approach, it typically helps equities by lowering the expected path of rates.\nAI Stock Analysis from market platforms suggested that investor positioning has shifted to expect slower tightening, increasing demand for yield-sensitive stocks like real estate and financials. That change in expectations has been a key driver of the FTSE 100\u2019s move higher this week.\nCurrency and Commodity Moves Supporting the Rally\nThe British pound held steady against the dollar, which helped reduce volatility for companies that trade in multiple currencies.

That run was fueled by optimism over slower UK inflation and encouraging corporate results, even as ongoing tensions between China and the US simmered in the background. Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 is set for its sharpest weekly gain since June after fresh inflation data strengthened bets that the Bank of England could cut rates as soon as December. Retailers got a lift as UK retail sales rose for the fourth straight month, with technology and jewelry sales especially firm. Bank shares surged, driven by NatWest, which hit a near twenty-year high after delivering a 30% jump in quarterly profit and raising targets for 2025. WH Smith and London Stock Exchange Group impressed, too, following analyst upgrades and solid earnings. Not all stocks joined the party, though \u2013 precious metal miners lagged as gold prices posted their first weekly drop in ten weeks.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Optimism brightens London\u2019s outlook.\nInvestor enthusiasm around slowing inflation is fueling hopes of lower rates and stronger consumer spending, boosting London\u2019s markets. Standout performances from NatWest, WH Smith, and London Stock Exchange Group have helped power the rally, while a dip in gold has weighed on precious metal miners \u2013 showing that sector rotation is in full swing. Traders are watching closely for US inflation data and government funding news, both of which could shape the next moves from central banks on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks may be ready to shift course.\nDecelerating UK inflation and better vibes on China-US trade signal that economic headwinds might be easing, opening the door for major central banks to change their stance on interest rates. If the Bank of England pivots before the US Federal Reserve, it could move currencies and valuations, especially for global companies. Markets everywhere will be tuned into next week\u2019s US inflation numbers and congressional budget talks, given their far-reaching impact.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 17 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 9 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped 1.2%.\nThe September inflation data released on Friday morning came in cooler than expected. The headline Consumer Price Index rose 3% on an annual basis, the highest level since May but softer than forecasts for a 3.1% gain. Month-over-month, prices rose 0.3%, a slight cooling from August's reading and also below expectations.\nThe report was delayed by more than a week due to the ongoing government shutdown, and was the first major economic release since the closure began, giving investors a long-awaited pulse check on the economy.\nThe CPI data did little to shake the near-unanimous investor confidence in a coming rate cut from the Fed next week \u2014 and more beyond that. Around 99% of bets are on a quarter-point cut next week, while some 96% of traders expect another slash in December.\nMeanwhile, President Trump injected fresh uncertainty into trade negotiations with key US partners, announcing Friday he would cancel trade talks with Canada. Trump cited a Canadian advertisement against his signature tariffs plan which features the voice of former President Ronald Reagan.\nIn corporates, Intel (INTC) shares pared significant gains after the chip giant reported third-quarter revenue that topped Wall Street estimates.\n\"We believe we're well-positioned to play a more significant role in AI,\" Intel's head of investor relations John Pitzer said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER21 updates\nInes Ferr\u00e9\nStock notch new highs, Dow closes above 47,000 for first time ever mild inflation data fuels bets of Fed rate cuts\nStocks closed at record highs on Friday as investors saw the latest inflation print released before the bell as an encouraging sign that the Federal Reserve is going to cut rates next week.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 1%, or over 460 points, to close above the 47,000 mark for the first time. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 1% to top a record level of 6,800, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped 1.2% also to an all-time high close.\nFed officials will meet next week to decide on the direction of interest rates. Wall Street widely anticipates a rate cut after September's inflation print came in milder than expected.\nOn the earnings front, Ford (F) rose 13% on the heels of a better-than-expected earnings print, while Intel (INTC) pared early gains following its quarterly release, but still ended the session in green territory.\nInes Ferr\u00e9\nPorsche reports downbeat YTD results, forward guidance as it recalibrates its EV, China strategy\nFord (F) rallied as high as 13% on Friday afternoon after the carmaker posted better-than-expected earnings.\nThe company outpaced third quarter estimates with adjusted earnings per share figures of $0.45 (vs. expectations of $0.36) and revenue of $47.185 billion versus expectations of $43.7 billion.\nInes Ferr\u00e9\nGold slips to cap volatile week\nGold (GC=F) retreated less than 1% on Friday to cap a volatile week.\nFutures for the precious metal fluctuated between positive and negative territory, hovering near $4,122 per troy ounce on Friday afternoon.\nGold plunged 5.5% from record levels on Tuesday, but was able to recover some of those losses to close out the week down more than 1.5%.\nInes Ferr\u00e9\nFed proposes publishing detailed models for stress tests of nation's largest banks\nTarget (TGT) shares were little changed Friday as the company announced layoffs, climbing fractionally in midday trading relative to the major gauges' gains of 1% or higher.\nCrypto stocks spiked in midday trading Friday as cooler-than-expected inflation data further solidified investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting and beyond.\nRobinhood (HO"

Kennedy Jr.\u2019s actress wife, Cheryl Hines, has explained why it was so easy to stand by her man during his sexting scandal with then-New York Magazine star writer Olivia Nuzzi.\n\u201cI think you always have to consider the source, right? So that\u2019s where I start,\u201d Hines told \u201cThe Katie Miller Podcast\u201d in a cutting putdown of Nuzzi, who lost her job and her fiance over the scandal.\n\u201cAnd then it ends with a conversation with Bobby,\u201d she said of her husband of 11 years, according to a sneak peek of the chat obtained by the Politico Playbook.\nThe \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d actress said last year\u2019s scandal \u2014 which Nuzzi always admitted was digital, never physical \u2014 was part of the noise she expected as her husband ran for the White House.\n\u201cBobby had been running for president and it was a \u2014 an exhausting year-and-a-half of headlines and rumors and articles and chaos,\u201d the actress recalled.\n\u201cAnd at that time, I thought \u2018OK, this is more chaos and more rumors.\u2019 And, um, it was a lot,\u201d Hines said.\nShe also questioned Nuzzi\u2019s motives in dredging it all up again for a memoir expected by the end of the year.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know this person. Don\u2019t know their intentions,\u201d Hines said of the writer, who is now at Vanity Fair.\n\u201cI could guess, but I won\u2019t. But you can if you want.\u201d\nEarlier this week, an insider told the Post that the rumored affair left Hines in \u201ca state of shock and distress\u201d \u2014 but that she \u201ceventually and emphatically believed, without reservation, Bobby\u2019s denial.\u201d\nKennedy has also downplayed the relationship, and said through his spokesperson that he only met Nuzzi once for an interview at her request, which spawned a \u201chit piece\u201d about him.\nHines, meanwhile, has been promoting her own memoir, \u201cUnscripted,\u201d which is out November 11."

The rotary wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is 4.8 meters long, 1.9 meter high and 0.9 meter wide. It can fly at a maximum speed of 120 knots (cruising speed 55 knots). Size apart, the true difference compared to the S-100 system is the payload capacity. Indeed the S-300 is able to carry up to 340 Kg (fuel including) and its maximum take-off weight can reach 660 Kg. This is basically three times more compared the S-100 can carry. With a 50 Kg payload, the S-300 can fly up to 24 hours (4 hours with 250 Kg).\nThe launch customer of the S-300 will be South Korea: Schiebel signed in 2024 a contract with Hanwha Systems for the supply of the S-300 for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions for the Republic of Korea (ROK) Navy and Marine Corps.\nA poster display by Hanwha Systems at ADEX 2025 read: \u201cThe [S-300] Shipborne Unmanned Aerial System will be deployed to the Navy and Marine Corps in 2028, performing missions to detect early signs of hostility or provocations by enemy or neighboring states using both EO/IR cameras and SAR\u201d.\nThe ROK Navy has been a Schiebel customer for over 10 years, regularly carrying out maritime ISR operations with its Camcopter S-100 fleet. The changing geo-political situation and North Korean threat call for an expansion of their unmanned aerial systems (UAS) fleet, adding larger and heavier UAS with greater capability.\nIn addition, the S-300 UAS has been selected for the SEACURE (Seabed and anti-submarine warfare capability through unmanned feature for Europe) European defense project.\nNaval News understands the S-300 will soon begin a test flight campaign in Southern France."

Following the election of Sanae Takaichi as prime minister this week and the formation of a coalition between her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the reform-oriented Japan Innovation Party (Ishin), market participants are hopeful that a growth-friendly agenda will be implemented.\nstock index is up by around 25 percent since the start of the year and, at almost 50,000 points, is close to its record high.The optimism stems from market speculation that Takaichi will launch \u201c[2] It involved increasing the country's money supply, boosting government spending and implementing reforms to make the Japanese economy more competitive. At the time The Economist, a newspaper, described the programme as a \u201cmix of , government spending and a growth strategy designed to jolt the economy out of the suspended animation that has gripped it for more than two decades.\u201d[3]\n2.0.\u201d This term is synonymous with the economic policy of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, introduced in 2012 when he came to power for the second time.It is precisely these expectations \u2014 namely\nstimulus, a supportive , and increased pressure for reform \u2014 that are currently igniting market hopes. Some experts warn that much of the optimism has already been factored in. But the combination of political stability and a growth-oriented agenda could provide important support for economic development and the markets.The Japanese stock rally is, however, not solely based on politics and policy momentum. Structural forces are reinforcing the upswing, including the return of foreign investors, corporate governance reforms and near-record stock buybacks by Japanese firms.[4]These developments may signal a cultural shift away from the long-standing Japanese tendency to hoard cash. At the start of the year, the Tokyo Stock Exchange urged domestic companies to use capital more efficiently, thereby encouraging buybacks and higher .[5]\nMarket structure is also an important driver of the current momentum. While tech stocks are becoming increasingly volatile, industrial and financial stocks have pulled the indices up, benefiting from rising\nand the prospect of fiscal support. The broader has also risen, buoyed by electronics and banking stocks. are also coming more into focus as they are particularly affected by the Tokyo Stock Exchange's call to use capital more efficiently and need to adjust their capital structure accordingly. Therefore, the rally is much broader than the Nikkei-oriented headlines suggest.\u201cThe Bank of Japan's monetary policy remains an important hinge,\u201d says Lucas Brauner, Japan economist at DWS. \u201cAfter exiting negative interest rate policy, further interest rate hikes are likely, although we currently expect them to be somewhat delayed due to the political transition phase and planned stimulus measures.\u201d These delays should allow the markets sufficient time to absorb fiscal stimulus and soften the transition to higher\nyields, thereby safe"

It printed a fresh all-time intraday high of 49,970 on 21 October 2025, on the backdrop of the newly appointed Japanese Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s plan for implementing an expansionary stimulus package that is likely to be more than 13.9 trillion yen that centered on measures to counter inflation, investment in growth industries, and national security.\nHowever, the Japanese stock market appears to have already priced in expectations of an aggressive expansionary fiscal policy, as hinted in Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s previous speeches. The Japan 225 CFD Index has since declined by 3.4% from its all-time high on 21 October 2025, hitting an intraday low of 48,415 on Thursday, 23 October 2025.\nThis raises an important question, is the medium-term uptrend that has been in place since April 2025 at risk of reversing, given the potential for rising longer-term Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields amid concerns over a widening fiscal deficit from Takaichi\u2019s policy stance?\nFundamental, flow, and momentum factors are still supportive for a further potential progression of the ongoing medium-term uptrend phase for the Japan 225 CFD Index. Let\u2019s examine each of them.\nNikkei 225 forward earnings growth has picked up\nFig. 1: Nikkei 225 forward 12-month forward EPS growth as of 23 Oct 2025 (Source: MacroMicro)\nThe forward 12-month earnings per share (EPS) growth for the component stocks of the Nikkei 225 in aggregate has started to improve after a slowdown in the past 11 months. The forward EPS growth of the Nikkei 225 has recently increased to 9.3% year-on-year in October 2025 from 7% in September 2025 (see Fig.1).\nThis earnings growth uptick suggests that more sell-side analysts have raised earnings projections for the Nikkei 225 for Q3 earnings results that may propel the Nikkei 225 higher.\nNet foreign inflows into the Japanese stock market have increased significantly\nFig. 2: Net purchases of Tokyo & Nagoya stock exchanges as of 17 Oct 2025 (Source: MacroMicro)\nThe 52-week average of net purchases of Japanese equities listed on the Tokyo and Nagoya stock exchanges has jumped by a significant amount from 6.2 billion in the week of 8 August 2025 to 81.5 billion as of 17 October 2025 (see Fig. 2).\nWe shall focus on the short-term (1 to 3 days) trajectory, key elements, and key levels to watch on the Japan 225 CFD Index from a technical analysis/momentum perspective.\nPreferred trend bias (1-3 days) \u2013 Oscillating within minor & medium-term ascending channels\nFig. 3: Japan 225 CFD Index minor trend as of 24 Oct 2025 (Source: MacroMicro)\nMaintain bullish bias with 48,845/48,440 as key short-term pivotal support for the Japan 225 CFD Index.
