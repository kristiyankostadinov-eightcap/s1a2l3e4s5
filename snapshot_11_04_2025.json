US gold futures for December and spot gold both pulled back this week, since a stronger dollar makes the metal pricier for buyers in other currencies. The Fed just issued its second rate cut of the year, but Chair Jerome Powell signaled another cut isn\u2019t guaranteed\u2014pulling down market expectations sharply. CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool now sees just a 65% chance of a December cut, down from over 90%. Plus, a US government shutdown is delaying key labor data, putting extra focus on upcoming business and private jobs reports. After a 53% year-to-date surge, gold has now fallen more than 8% from its October peak, and the recent cooling of US\u2013China tariff tensions has dialed back demand for the safe-haven metal.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A stronger dollar keeps gold under pressure.\nWhen the US dollar rallies, commodities like gold tend to struggle\u2014and recent sessions have seen declines across gold and other precious metals. Big institutional players and analysts are closely watching upcoming private payroll and economic reports for a spark that could help gold bounce back. But without a clear shift from the Fed or softer economic data, the metal may stay in the doldrums for now.\nThe bigger picture: Global currents put gold in the spotlight.\nA thaw in US\u2013China trade tensions and softer geopolitical risks have cooled the rush to safe-haven assets like gold. While Fed policy uncertainty and delayed economic data make the outlook cloudy, gold\u2019s wild swings this year show how quickly global forces can change the narrative. It\u2019s a reminder that gold acts as both hedge and economic signal\u2014reflecting the crosswinds shaping global markets.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nRosa Leo \u2022 4 days ago\nResearch\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 12 hours ago\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 17 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "source": "India Today",
                "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/bitcoin-hedging-inflation-parallel-gold-correlation-expert-view-common-difference-2813077-2025-11-04",
                "body": "Does bitcoin hedge against inflation the way gold does?\nFor centuries, gold has been that safe haven, protecting wealth against inflation and systemic shocks. Lately, Bitcoin has joined that category, emerging as an alternative for investors looking to hedge against uncertainty in an increasingly digital world.\nOver the past few months, we have seen both economic and political uncertainty across the globe. With this, equity indices have come under pressure.Yet, amid this volatility, two assets stand tall: Gold and Bitcoin.\nIn times of uncertainty, investors naturally move away from riskier assets such as equities and seek the safety of assets that can preserve value. For centuries, gold has been that safe haven, protecting wealth against inflation and systemic shocks. Lately, Bitcoin has joined that category, emerging as an alternative for investors looking to hedge against uncertainty in an increasingly digital world.\nPARALLELS BETWEEN GOLD AND BITCOIN\nAt first glance, the two may seem worlds apart, one is physical, the other digital. Yet their core traits are very similar.\nFirstly, both assets are limited in supply and independent of government control. Their value doesn\u2019t rely on corporate profits or economic cycles but on the belief that they will hold purchasing power over time.\nGold\u2019s scarcity is natural, it is rare, difficult to mine, and yields diminish over time. Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity, meanwhile, is algorithmic. Its supply is permanently capped at 21 million coins. Over 19.94 million Bitcoins are already in circulation. And it is designed in such a way that mining new coins becomes harder every four years. Both are resource-intensive: mining gold requires physical energy and machinery, while mining Bitcoin requires computing power and electricity. In both cases, scarcity is earned through work, cost, and time.\nSecondly, both assets derive value from trust. Gold has earned its reputation over millennia as a store of value and reserve asset. Central banks continue to accumulate it to hedge against currency risk. Bitcoin, born in 2009 after the Global Financial Crisis, is younger, but built on similar principles. It offers transparency, independence, and decentralisation, traits that echo gold\u2019s role in a world increasingly sceptical of central authority.\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price has been more volatile, its long-term ambition mirrors gold\u2019s: to be a reliable store of value. Institutional participation and the rise of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have helped stabilise and legitimise it. Interestingly, BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, launched less than two years ago, has already outpaced two decades of growth in gold ETFs, a sign of how rapidly Bitcoin is being adopted as a mainstream asset.\nThirdly, both gold and Bitcoin tend to rise when confidence in fiat currencies falls. They act as protection against currency debasement, when excessive money printing erodes value. However, both hedge best against \u201cbad inflation\u201d caused by poor policy decisions, rather than \u201cgood inflation\u201d driven by healthy economic expansion.\nCORELATION BETWEEN GOLD AND BITCOIN\nSince 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with gold has held steady between +0.5 and +0.6, the strongest sustained alignment in its history according to the data of Glassnode. This steady co-movement marks a structural shift in market perception. Investors are viewing Bitcoin as a macro hedge against inflation, currency debasement, and financial instability.\nIn essence, Bitcoin now behaves like a high-beta version of gold. More volatile? Yes, but directionally aligned. When gold rises on fears of inflation or geopolitical tension, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, albeit with larger swings.\nOf course, there are moments when the two diverge, Bitcoin responding to crypto-native events, gold reacting to central bank demand, but macro factors almost always bring them back into sync.\nWhile gold delivered strong returns of 694% over five years, it came with a high volatility of 215.6%, resulting in a risk-"

These are the levels that matter on the technical charts into the weekly / monthly open.\nEuro Price Chart \u2013 EUR/USD 240min\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; EUR/USD on TradingView\nNotes: Euro is trading at a key support zone into the start of the month at 1.1505/14- a region defined by the 100% extension of the September decline and the April high-day close (HDC). Note that the median-line converges on this threshold over the next few days and the immediate focus is on possible inflection off this zone.\nInitial resistance is eyed at 1.1542 with near-term bearish invalidation now lowered to the Fed reversal close at 1.1601. A break below / close below this key pivot zone would threaten resumption of the September downtrend with subsequent support seen at the 88.6% retracement of the August advance at 1.1452 and the May HDC / August low at 1.1386/92- look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nBottom line: Euro is testing downtrend support into the start of the week- a good zone to reduce short-exposure / lower protective stops. Rallies should be limited to the upper parallel IF price is heading lower on this stretch with a close below 1.15 needed to fuel the next leg of this decline. Keep in mind we get an update on the U.S. labor markets on Wednesday with the ADP employment report on tap. Stay nimble into the release and watch the weekly close here for guidance. Review my latest Euro Weekly Forecast for a closer look at the longer-term EUR/USD technical trade levels.\nCanadian Dollar Price Chart \u2013 USD/CAD Daily\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; USD/CAD on TradingView\nNotes: USD/CAD rallied more than 1.3% off the October lows with the post-Fed breakout approaching the October high at 1.4080 into the start of the week. The immediate focus is on today\u2019s close with respect to the October HDC at 1.4045 for guidance. Support rests at the median-line which converges on the 2022 swing high / 50% retracement at 1.3678/82 with broader bullish invalidation at the 200-day moving average at 1.3947.\nBottom line: A V-shaped recovery off the October lows is now approaching multi-month highs. From a trading standpoint, losses would need to be limited to the median-line IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a close above 1.4080 needed to fuel the next leg of the advance. Subsequent resistance is eyed at the 100% extension of the June rally near 1.4111- look for a larger reaction there IF reached. Keep in mind we get the releases of the Canadian employment report on Friday with consensus estimates calling for a contraction of 20K jobs in October.

And an abundance of oil has the effect of pushing prices down.\nThis can be a double-edged sword for Texas, because while that usually means energy can go cheaper, that also means people in the industry, including thousands who work in the Texas oil fields and in the service industries that support energy production, are at risk of losing jobs.\nThose fears of an oil glut help explain a move by OPEC yesterday that was both highly anticipated and, according to our go-to industry analyst Matt Smith, something of a surprise, too.\nSmith is lead energy analyst at Kpler. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.\nThis transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:\nTexas Standard: OPEC met over the weekend and although they decided to raise production in December, they\u2019ve paused their increases for Q1 of next year.\nWhy is this? Could you say more about it? I presume it has to do with trying to manage that feared glut.\nMatt Smith: Yeah, that\u2019s exactly the case. And so this glut isn\u2019t quite here yet. We\u2019re not quite seeing it play out in terms of rising inventories. But what we do have is a lot of supply coming to market and it\u2019s actually coming from OPEC themselves.\nSo we\u2019ve seen Saudi Arabia exporting a lot more crude in recent months. That is a kind of seasonal trend, but there\u2019s a lot coming from them, from UAE, these different Middle East countries.\nBut this is coming at a time when there\u2019s a lot of supply coming from non-OPEC, which they don\u2019t have control over. So that\u2019s increasing production from Brazil, from Guyana, from Norway, from Canada. The list kind of goes on.\nTheir concern is that this is going to overwhelm the market. So they\u2019ve said, okay, we\u2019ll increase a little bit for December. Then we\u2019ll hit pause and kind of wait and see.\nInteresting. Well, prices, one would expect, to have reacted to this news. What do you see?\nNot much. So we\u2019re selling off slightly, but you know, you can interpret this both ways, right? You can spin it as being supportive for prices because they\u2019re holding supply off the market, but then you could view it as bearish, you know? Just because they are reacting, and so perhaps things are going to get much worse.\nBut generally, this is just a very much a wait-and-see market right now. There is this expected glut. We\u2019re seeing a lot of oil going onto the market. Until we start to see that showing up in inventories, I think everyone\u2019s kind of very skeptical about it.\nWell, President Trump had a much-discussed meeting last week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping and noticed that Wall Street seemed to react rather sharply to that news. Of course, with earnings reports from Amazon, we were seeing that stock really take off.\nHow was that meeting affecting oil markets? Or are we still looking at a lack of direction there?\nThere is still that lack of direction. And I think it should be the case for broader markets as well, in that there was progress made at this meeting, but it wasn\u2019t anything too revelationary, right?\nSo, there were kind of a number of agreements or concessions made by either side. And so, China has had its tariffs reduced a little bit, and they\u2019ve made commitments to the U.S. in return there. But this is tentative progress. This isn\u2019t any kind of full resolution by any means there.\n\u00bb GET MORE NEWS FROM AROUND THE STATE: Sign up for Texas Standard\u2019s weekly newsletters\nOf course, we are headed into a big travel season for the U.S. and much of the world with the holidays approaching. What about prices at the pump? What does all this add up to there?\nWell, we\u2019re continuing to hang around this $3 a gallon level on the national average. For Texas, the average is $2.55. Seasonally, we should be seeing it moving lower from here on out as long as oil prices kind of hold around this level.\nSo it\u2019s very much a good thing, right, that we\u2019re seeing low price at the pump. But again, there\u2019s the flip side"

So they\u2019ve said, okay, we\u2019ll increase a little bit for December. Then we\u2019ll hit pause and kind of wait and see.\nInteresting. Well, prices, one would expect, to have reacted to this news. What do you see?\nNot much. So we\u2019re selling off slightly, but you know, you can interpret this both ways, right? You can spin it as being supportive for prices because they\u2019re holding supply off the market, but then you could view it as bearish, you know? Just because they are reacting, and so perhaps things are going to get much worse.\nBut generally, this is just a very much a wait-and-see market right now. There is this expected glut. We\u2019re seeing a lot of oil going onto the market. Until we start to see that showing up in inventories, I think everyone\u2019s kind of very skeptical about it.\nWell, President Trump had a much-discussed meeting last week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping and noticed that Wall Street seemed to react rather sharply to that news. Of course, with earnings reports from Amazon, we were seeing that stock really take off.\nHow was that meeting affecting oil markets? Or are we still looking at a lack of direction there?\nThere is still that lack of direction. And I think it should be the case for broader markets as well, in that there was progress made at this meeting, but it wasn\u2019t anything too revelationary, right?\nSo, there were kind of a number of agreements or concessions made by either side. And so, China has had its tariffs reduced a little bit, and they\u2019ve made commitments to the U.S. in return there. But this is tentative progress. This isn\u2019t any kind of full resolution by any means there.\n\u00bb GET MORE NEWS FROM AROUND THE STATE: Sign up for Texas Standard\u2019s weekly newsletters\nOf course, we are headed into a big travel season for the U.S. and much of the world with the holidays approaching. What about prices at the pump? What does all this add up to there?\nWell, we\u2019re continuing to hang around this $3 a gallon level on the national average. For Texas, the average is $2.55. Seasonally, we should be seeing it moving lower from here on out as long as oil prices kind of hold around this level.\nSo it\u2019s very much a good thing, right, that we\u2019re seeing low price at the pump. But again, there\u2019s the flip side"

                "body": "OPEC+ just agreed to boost oil production for another month. Luckily for U.S. shale, they also decided to pause the hikes, which would help the shale industry dodge the bullet of WTI of $50. This is good news for an impressively resilient industry, because its resilience seems to taper out around $50 per barrel.\nThis weekend, the OPEC+ group said it would add another 137,000 barrels daily to global supply. That was bearish news after an extended streak of monthly hikes. Yet the producer cartel also said it planned to suspend the hikes next year for three months. It is now time for investment bank commodity teams to revise their price assumptions and for shale operators to breathe a sigh of relief-they may have avoided having to see their output shrink by 700,000 barrels daily by the end of 2026.\nIt is no secret that shale oil in the United States has a higher breakeven price than conventional wells in Saudi Arabia. Yet, not all wells are created equal, and some can make money at less than $60 per barrel while others need $70 per barrel and more to break even. Not only this, but costs in the shale patch have been rising, as reported by the Dallas Fed in its quarterly energy survey. Even so, shale production continues growing, hitting another all-time high of 13.7 million barrels daily in August, according to new data from the Energy Information Administration.\nA lot of this is thanks to efficiency improvements, energy market analytics firm Kpler said in a report on oil prices and their effect on the U.S. shale industry. The report noted the adverse effect of tariffs, OPEC+ output hikes, and President Trump's ambition to keep prices at the pump low. It then went on to point out that despite these, U.S. shale production has continued growing even with a lower rig count, thanks to drilling efficiencies and an ample supply of drilled but uncompleted wells.\nHowever, things are about to change if prices remain where they are or go lower, as some analysts expect. Currently at $61 per barrel, if West Texas Intermediate falls lower, it would start hurting shale, Kpler said, forecasting a 700,000-bpd drop in output by the end of 2026 if the benchmark falls to $50 per barrel and stays there for long enough.\nEven at $60 per barrel, the price of U.S. crude is affecting activity. According to Kpler, the drilled but uncompleted well inventory in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken basins has shrunk by between 25% and 30% since the start of the year, to 280 and 310, respectively, as of September. \"This downward trend is unsustainable, unless drilling ramps back up - a scenario that is unlikely under the current price environment,\" Kpler analyst Johannes Raubal wrote in the report. What's more, he added, a smaller inventory of DUCs makes shale producers less nimble in their response to international price fluctuations.\nRelated: ExxonMobil Threatens To Leave EU Over Sustainability Rules\nThis is not the best of news, especially with the predictions of even lower international prices due to what many see as a sizable supply overhang. Indeed, Goldman Sachs said back in August it expected oil prices to dip below $60 per barrel next year on the back of that overhang, coming mainly from non-OPEC producers, led by the United States. Non-OPEC supply is actually the chief reason for the glut predictions across analytical outlets, including the International Energy Agency. Yet Kpler expects supply growth among non-OPEC oil producers to peak next year, relieving some of the price pressure. If it peaks before WTI falls to $50-if it ever does, that is-a production squeeze would be avoided. Yet if that growth everyone points to when predicting a glut takes longer to peak, WTI may indeed fall below sustainable production growth levels, even for Big Oil, which often enjoys much lower breakeven prices than independents.\n\"Although majors and large independents can operate below $50/bbl, this price level would enforce cautious activity for most,\" Rauball wrote.

                "body": "Itai Smidt | Nov 03, 2025 01:51PM ET\nThe EUR/USD pair is under renewed selling pressure, trading near 1.1520, just above a three-month low of 1.1500, as the U.S. dollar (DXY) holds firm around 99.78 ahead of the ISM Manufacturing PMI release. The euro has been unable to regain momentum after a series of technical breakdowns through 1.1550 and 1.1530, confirming bearish dominance for a third consecutive week. The EUR/USD opened the session at 1.1558, slipped to an intraday low of 1.1511, and remains capped by resistance near 1.1560, reflecting weak recovery attempts amid persistent demand for the greenback.\nThe strength of the U.S. dollar follows Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s signal that the latest 25-basis-point rate cut could be the last for 2025. That statement slashed market expectations for another cut in December from 90% to 71%, anchoring Treasury yields and sustaining dollar demand. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield trades near 4.31%, and the short end remains elevated around 4.55%, limiting any upside for the euro. Fed policymakers have stressed that monetary easing will only resume if economic indicators show meaningful weakness, a stance that\u2019s compressing risk appetite across global FX markets.\nAt the same time, the Eurozone\u2019s economic stagnation continues to weigh on sentiment. Manufacturing PMIs across the bloc remain below 50, signaling contraction despite marginal stabilization. Germany\u2019s factory PMI stood at 49.6, Italy at 49.3, and France at 48.3, highlighting uneven recovery momentum. Political noise in France and the Netherlands has further eroded investor confidence, while ECB policymakers remain divided on whether to ease policy in early 2026. Dovish members argue that slowing growth could justify pre-emptive rate reductions, but sticky service inflation\u2014still above 3% year-on-year\u2014keeps hawks firmly opposed. The central bank\u2019s medium-term forecasts now see inflation at 1.7% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027, maintaining pressure for a cautious approach.\nTechnically, the EUR/USD remains bearish. The pair trades below its 50-day EMA at 1.1600 and 200-day EMA at 1.1649, a clear sign that rallies are being sold into. Momentum indicators confirm weakness: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits near 34, bordering oversold territory but without signs of a confirmed reversal. The 1.1500 level acts as critical support; a daily close below it could expose 1.1475, 1.1440, and even 1.1420 as next downside targets. On the flip side, bulls need a decisive breakout above 1.1580\u20131.1615 to shift short-term sentiment and open the door toward 1.1670\u20131.1700, where the 200-EMA stands as the primary barrier.\nMarket structure shows the pair locked within a descending channel that\u2019s been intact since mid-September. Sellers continue to control price action, with lower highs and lower lows defining the trend. The break below 1.1550 last week triggered an acceleration of bearish momentum confirmed by expanding volume and a crossover on short-term moving averages. Unless EUR/USD reclaims 1.1610, technical sentiment will remain negative into mid-November.\nOn the U.S. side, the ISM Manufacturing PMI\u2014forecast at 49.4 compared to 49.1 prior\u2014and ISM Prices Paid\u2014expected at 62.4 versus 61.9\u2014could determine the dollar\u2019s near-term direction. A stronger-than-expected PMI print would reinforce the Fed\u2019s cautious tone and extend dollar gains, potentially forcing EUR/USD toward 1.1470. Conversely, any downside surprise might temporarily weaken the dollar, allowing a rebound toward 1.1580. Traders are also eyeing upcoming FOMC speeches for signals about the Fed\u2019s interpretation of economic data amid rising uncertainty over the U.S. government shutdown, which economists warn could shave up to 0.3% from Q4 GDP if prolonged.\nFrom a macro-funding perspective, tight money-market conditions continue to favor the dollar. The U.S. Treasury\u2019s ongoing effort to rebuild its cash reserves after the debt-ceiling standoff has absorbed global liquidity, driving short-term ra"

The confirmation that Eurozone manufacturing activity improved to a standstill in October has failed to provide any significant support to the pair, and the focus shifts now to the US manufacturing activity figures.\nThe pair remains on its back foot since the Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman, Jerome Powell, played down market expectations that the bank would lower borrowing costs further in December, after the monetary policy meeting last week. Powell's comments have curbed investors' appetite for risk, triggering a US Dollar rally that has extended into the start of the current week.\nIn Europe, October's HCOB Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index confirmed the preliminary estimations, pointing to a slight improvement in the sector's activity, to a level of 50.0 from 49.8 in September. These figures come shortly after the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and European Central Bank's Monetary Committee member Joachim Nagel affirmed on Monday that economic data is not diverging from the central bank's projections, but that all options remain open for the next meeting.\nApart from the Final US S&P and the US ISM Manufacturing PMIs, due later in the day, Fed officials Mary Daly and Lisa Cook are expected to take the stage during the US trading session and might provide further insight into the bank's monetary policy plans.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today.

Traders remain cautious, balancing the risk of a potential BoE rate reduction against the resilience of the dollar, which continues to benefit from robust U.S. data and safe-haven inflows.\nFed Stance and U.S. Data Reinforce Dollar Strength\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s recent remarks dismissing the need for near-term easing have helped solidify the dollar\u2019s rebound. Despite slowing ISM manufacturing data, which printed at 48.7 for October versus 49.1 previously, investors remain confident the Fed will hold rates steady until at least March 2026. Supporting the Greenback\u2019s strength are rising U.S. Treasury yields, with the 10-year note trading around 4.31%, and a government shutdown now entering day 33, fueling uncertainty but also reinforcing the perception of U.S. fiscal resilience. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% in September, pushing the annual inflation rate to 3%, below the 3.1% forecast but still well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. This combination of sticky inflation and resilient growth has discouraged bets on further rate cuts, limiting any sustainable Pound recovery.\nBoE Policy and U.K. Fiscal Headwinds Limit Sterling Recovery\nIn the United Kingdom, expectations for a 25-basis-point BoE rate cut have risen sharply, with money markets pricing roughly a 33% probability of a reduction to 3.75%. The move comes amid persistently weak productivity, mounting fiscal strain, and subdued consumer confidence. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to trim its productivity forecast by 0.3%, potentially worsening the national budget deficit by over \u00a320 billion by 2030. Current finances already show a \u00a322 billion shortfall, amplifying pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to raise taxes or expand borrowing in the November budget. This fiscal backdrop continues to act as a ceiling for any Pound gains, particularly as investors anticipate tighter liquidity conditions ahead of year-end.\nTechnical Picture: 1.3100 Support and 1.3170 Resistance Define Near-Term Battle Zone\nFrom a technical standpoint, GBP/USD is consolidating between 1.3110 and 1.3170, with repeated failures to break above the 1.3170 resistance keeping momentum bearish. A slide below 1.3100 could expose the 1.3000 handle, last seen in April, while a rebound above 1.3170 would open the door to 1.3225, where the 50-day moving average currently sits. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral around 45, indicating space for either direction but no strong reversal signal yet. According to UOB, the current rebound from oversold levels signals near-term consolidation rather than a trend reversal. The pair remains vulnerable as long as it trades below 1.3250, the key pivot separating correction from recovery.\nDiverging Inflation Paths Between the U.S. and U.K.\nThe policy divergence between Washington and London continues to dictate currency flows. The latest data show U.K. inflation at 3.5%, still well above the BoE\u2019s 2% target, forcing the central bank into a defensive stance despite slowing growth. Conversely, U.S. inflation at 2.8% is closer to normalization, allowing the Fed to maintain a hawkish hold without triggering market panic. T"

                "body": "The US dollar index traded within three points of the 100 handle on Monday, closing at a six-month high. I outlined 100 as a potential upside target for bulls a few weeks back, and if momentum turns lower from here, it could mark wave C of a flat ABC correction. Still, this remains a pivotal area for both bulls and bears, with the ISM Non-Manufacturing and ADP reports setting the stage for a highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) release on Friday.\nIncoming data will shape Federal Reserve (Fed) policy expectations for December, following the relatively hawkish cut delivered last week. Fed funds futures currently imply a 67.3% chance of a cut \u2014 still reflecting confidence in further easing but well down from the ~90% probability priced in ahead of last week\u2019s FOMC meeting. How upcoming US data lands will directly influence the dollar\u2019s direction through traders\u2019 confidence in that December cut.\nView related analysis:\n- US Dollar Eyes Breakout as EUR/USD, GBP/USD Probe Support, USD/JPY Rallies\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: RBA, US ISM and ADP In Focus\n- Gold Shows Tentative Signs Of Stability, Options Hint At Mild Recovery\n- ASX 200 Morning Market Outlook: Bulls Eye Rebound, RBA Up next\n- ASX 200 Morning Market Outlook: Bearish Reversal Pattern For October\nUS Dollar Index (DXY) Technical Analysis\nThe daily chart shows a small shooting star candle forming just below the 100 handle. While textbooks often suggest this could mark a meaningful swing high, caution is warranted given key upcoming US economic events \u2014 meaning some wriggle room around the 100 handle should be factored in this week. However, with the daily RSI (2) overbought for a third day, a minor pullback could be due.\nThat said, with both the weekly and daily RSI (14) confirming the rally \u2014 and neither timeframe overbought \u2014 I suspect the US dollar index may still try to reach 101 before wave C completes. A weak NFP report, however, could quickly see Fed cut expectations repriced and send the dollar lower.\nFor now, I\u2019m looking for a minor pullback on the daily chart, which could support the Australian dollar \u2014 particularly if the RBA delivers a relatively hawkish hold.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView U.S. Dollar Index Futures\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nYield Spreads and Options Positioning Signal Limited Downside for the Aussie\nThe correlation between Australian yields and options positioning suggests the pullback for the Aussie could be limited. The 2-year yield continues to trend higher, and the AU-US 2-year yield spread has also climbed sharply ahead of AUD/USD. While the 1-day implied volatility for AUD/USD has risen to a three-day high, both the 1-week and 1-month implied volatility levels remain subdued. Furthermore, risk reversals indicate that call demand (bullish bets) continues to hold firm against put demand (bearish bets).\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nRickshaw Doji Hints at Waning Bearish Momentum in AUD/USD\nThe Australian dollar closed lower for a fourth day, though the rickshaw man doji suggests bearish momentum is waning. Monday\u2019s low held above the September low, highlighting tentative support. With a shooting star candle forming on the US dollar index and the potential for the RBA to deliver a hawkish hold, my bias is for AUD/USD to stage a near-term bounce while the US dollar undergoes a minor pullback.\nHowever, given my broader bias for the US dollar to push higher before wave C completes, any recovery in the Aussie may prove limited after the initial rebound.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/USD\nKey Economic Events for Traders (AEDT / GMT+11)\n06:00 USD Fed Governor Cook Speaks, Loan Officer Survey (S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, USD/JPY)\n11:30 JPY au Jibun Bank Manufacturing PMI (Oct) (USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, Nikkei 225)\n14:30 AUD RBA Interest Rate Decision & Statement (Nov) (AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, ASX 200)\n15:30 AUD RBA Monetary Policy Statement (AUD/USD, AUD"

Let\u2019s now examine the various macro and technical factors that may impact the movement of the AUD/USD.\nRBA may turn less dovish in November and December\nFig. 1: Australia Q3 2025 core CPI, Sep 2025 monthly CPI & RBA cash rate as of 4 Nov 2025 (Source: TradingView)\nThe Australian central bank (RBA) has cut its policy cash rate three times by 25 basis points each so far in 2025, in February, May, and August. Lowering the cash rate from a 13-year high of 4.35% in January 2025 to its current level of 3.6%.\nAfter nearly three years of easing price pressures, Australia\u2019s inflation trend appears to be turning higher again. Core CPI accelerated to 3.5% year-on-year in Q3 2025 from 2.7% in the previous quarter, while the monthly CPI indicator climbed to 3.5% in September from 3.1% in August (see Fig. 1).\nThe hotter-than-expected data, coupled with easing U.S.\u2013China trade tensions following last week\u2019s economic accord in South Korea, could prompt the Reserve Bank of Australia to hit pause on its rate-cut cycle at today's, 4 November, and December monetary policy meetings.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Australian dollar may find renewed support as widening rate differentials work in its favour.\nGrowth in Australia\u2019s services sector has picked up\nFig. 2: Australia Manufacturing & Services PMIs as of Oct 2025 (Source: MacroMicro)\nAustralia\u2019s services sector is the dominant part of the Australian economy, accounting for close to 60% of annual GDP, which includes key industries such as health, education, and finance.\nThe latest S&P Global Services PMI, a forward-looking gauge of business activity, rose to 53.1 in October 2025 from 52.4 in September, signalling a faster pace of expansion (see Fig. 2).\nStronger export demand for services helped offset continued softness in manufacturing. This improvement in the services sector reduces the urgency for further RBA rate cuts, reinforcing expectations that policymakers may pause easing in the coming months.\nLet\u2019s now focus on the latest technical analysis elements, short-term trajectory (1 to 3 days), and short-term key levels to watch for AUD/USD.\nPreferred trend bias (1-3 days) \u2013 Potential push up above 20-day moving average\nFig. 3: AUD/USD minor trend as of 4 Nov 2025 (Source: TradingView)\nBullish bias above 0.6530/0.6515 key short-term pivotal support (also the gap formed on Monday, 27 October), and a clearance above 0.6560 (also the 50-day moving average) may trigger a short-term push up to see the next intermediate resistances coming in at 0.6595 and 0.6620/0.6630 (see Fig. 3).\nKey elements\n- The recent weakness of the AUD/USD seen on Friday, 31 October, and Monday, 3 November, has managed to find support at the 20-day moving average and the lower boundary of a minor ascending channel from the 14 October 2025 low.\n- The hourly RSI momentum indicator of the AUD/USD has continued to hover above its ascending trendline suppo"

                "body": "Japanese Yen bears turn cautious as intervention fears offset BoJ rate hike uncertainty\n- The Japanese Yen attracts some intraday buyers amid intervention fears and bets for an imminent BoJ rate hike.\n- The uncertainty over the timing of the next BoJ rate hike and a positive risk tone might cap gains for the JPY.\n- The Fed\u2019s hawkish tilt lifts the USD to a three-month high and could further lend support to the USD/JPY pair.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) builds on its steady intraday recovery from the lowest level since February 12, touched against a broadly firmer US Dollar (USD) during the Asian session on Tuesday. Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda dropped hawkish hints last week and signaled the possibility of a rate hike in December or January next year. Furthermore, speculations that authorities might intervene to stem further weakness in the domestic currency offer some support to the JPY.\nAny meaningful JPY appreciation, however, seems elusive amid the uncertainty over the timing of the next BoJ rate hike, fueled by expectations that Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will pursue aggressive fiscal spending plans. This, along with receding safe-haven demand, might cap the JPY. The USD, on the other hand, has climbed to a fresh high since early August on the back of the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) hawkish tilt and could help limit further losses for the USD/JPY pair.\nJapanese Yen draws some support from intervention fears; BoJ uncertainty could cap gains\n- The Bank of Japan remains reluctant to commit to further interest rate hikes amid Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's pro-stimulus stance, keeping the Japanese Yen depressed against a bullish US Dollar through the Asian session on Tuesday.\n- Meanwhile, data released last Friday showed that the core Consumer Price Index in Tokyo \u2013 Japan's capital city \u2013 has stayed above the BoJ's 2% target for three-and-a-half-years. This, in turn, backs the case for further policy tightening by the central bank.\n- Moreover, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said last week that the likelihood of its baseline scenario materialising has heightened and reiterated that the central bank will continue to raise the policy rate if the economy and prices move in line with the forecast.\n- Adding to this, the risk of currency intervention from Japanese authorities could limit deeper JPY losses, though sustained US Dollar buying remains supportive of the bid tone surrounding the USD/JPY pair, near its highest level since February.\n- Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week pushed back against market expectations for a further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting and assisted the USD Index (DXY) to build on a one-week-old uptrend, pushing it to a three-month top.\n- The US government shutdown will hit the 35-day mark on Tuesday night and is poised to become the longest on record, previously set in 2019, as Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress remain deadlocked on the funding bill.\n- Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he is optimistic about ending the government shutdown this week, and that the upper chamber would vote for the 14th time on the Republican-backed and House-passed funding bill later this Tuesday.\n- Investors now seem worried that a prolonged government closure could cause economic damage, which, in turn, warrants caution before positioning for an extension of the USD appreciating move and further gains for the USD/JPY pair.\nUSD/JPY is more likely to attract dip-buyers near the 153.30-153.25 resistance breakpoint\nFrom a technical perspective, last week's breakout through the 153.25-153.30 hurdle and a subsequent strength beyond the 154.00 mark was seen as a key trigger for the USD/JPY bulls. Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart are holding comfortably in positive territory and are still away from being in the overbought zone. This, in turn, backs the case for a move beyond the 154.75-154.80 intermediate hurdle, towards reclaiming the 155.00 psychological mark."

The dollar\u2019s climb from 151.50 to 154.45 reflects renewed confidence in the U.S. economy after ISM Manufacturing PMI data showed the eighth straight month of contraction at 48.7, but with resilience in new orders and prices paid at 58, reinforcing sticky inflation concerns. This keeps the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish tone alive despite the latest 25-basis-point cut, which Chair Jerome Powell described as a \u201ccautious recalibration,\u201d not the start of an easing cycle. Markets have repriced sharply \u2014 the CME FedWatch Tool now shows only 65% odds of a December rate cut, down from 94% a week ago, helping the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) hold near 99.83.\nPolicy Divergence Widens as Japan\u2019s 13.9 Trillion Yen Stimulus Weakens the Yen\nThe Japanese yen (JPY) remains pinned near multi-month lows as new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi finalizes a record 13.9 trillion yen ($92 billion) fiscal package to support households and counter inflation pressures. The stimulus, aimed at boosting consumption and offsetting energy costs, undermines near-term rate-hike expectations at the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which left its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.50% for a fifth consecutive meeting. Although Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated readiness to tighten if wage growth strengthens, markets remain skeptical \u2014 pricing only a 50% probability of a 25-bps hike in December. The widening policy gap with the Fed continues to pressure the yen, as traders sell into every rebound.\nTokyo Inflation and Wages: The BoJ\u2019s Tightrope Between Growth and Credibility\nTokyo\u2019s inflation readings reinforced the BoJ\u2019s dilemma. The city\u2019s headline CPI rose to 2.8% in October from 2.5% in September, while \u201ccore-core\u201d inflation (excluding food and energy) also climbed to 2.8%, suggesting underlying price stickiness. Yet Ueda\u2019s cautious tone signaled patience \u2014 he said the BoJ must \u201ctake a little longer\u201d to gauge how U.S. tariffs and Japan\u2019s slower wage negotiations affect consumption. Average cash earnings data due November 6 are pivotal; a rebound could reignite expectations of a December hike, while weak wage growth would validate the BoJ\u2019s dovish bias. Markets understand that unless wage momentum accelerates, tightening risks choking fragile demand.\nFed Resilience and U.S. Data Keep Dollar Bulls in Control\nThe U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance stems from relative strength in labor and manufacturing data. Despite ISM weakness, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI improved to 52.5, indicating stabilization. Treasury yields remain elevated \u2014 the 10-year yield hovers at 4.31%, sustaining the dollar\u2019s advantage against low-yielding currencies. Fed officials Lisa Cook and Mary Daly reiterated that inflation remains above target and policy should stay \u201crestrictive,\u201d a clear contrast to the BoJ\u2019s patience. That divergence sustains the USD/JPY rally, particularly as Japanese investors continue favoring U.S. Treasuries for higher returns.\nTechnical Setup: Triangle Pattern Confirms 154\u2013155 Range Expansion\nTechnically, USD/JPY has formed a narrow consolidation triangle above 154.00, typically a continuation pattern that favors further gains. The pair\u2019s RSI at 63 reflects healthy bullish momentum, while MACD nears a bullish crossover on the daily chart. The upper boundary of the pattern lies near 154.45, the October 30 high, followed by the February 13 peak at 154.85 and a 127.2% Fibonacci extension target at 155.30. Immediate supports rest at 153.65 and 153.00\u2013153.25, where previous resistance flipped to demand. A decisive break"

At the time of writing, USD/JPY is little changed around 154.18, hovering near its eight-and-a-half-month highs as traders digest the latest US manufacturing data.\nThe Greenback\u2019s recent rally lost momentum after the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that US factory activity contracted for the eighth straight month in October. The Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7, below expectations of 49.5, signaling persistent weakness in output and new orders. Sub-indices showed Production dropping to 48.2 and Employment rising modestly to 46, while Prices Paid eased to 58.\nA separate report from S&P Global offered a slightly brighter picture, with the final US Manufacturing PMI improving to 52.5 in October from 52 in September.\nFollowing the data, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against a basket of six major currencies, is drifting lower, trading around 99.83, paring early gains after briefly touching 99.99 earlier in the day.\nDespite the mild pullback, the Greenback remains broadly supported by the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) hawkish tilt following last week\u2019s 25-basis-point rate cut. Traders have scaled back expectations for further easing, with the CME FedWatch tool showing the odds of a December rate cut around 65%, down sharply from 94% a week earlier.\nIn Japan, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) left interest rates unchanged at 0.50% for the fifth consecutive meeting last week. Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated that the central bank needs to see clearer evidence of sustained wage growth before considering further policy adjustments, adding that the BoJ wants to \u201ctake a little longer to see how US tariff impacts would affect the Japanese economy.\u201d\nLooking ahead, traders will focus on private-sector data for near-term guidance as the ongoing United States (US) government shutdown continues to delay major official releases. The JOLTS Job Openings on Tuesday and the ADP Employment Change on Wednesday will serve as key proxies for labor market conditions.\nIn Japan, the Jibun Bank Manufacturing PMI for October, due Tuesday, will shed light on factory activity, followed by the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes on Wednesday.\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI\u2019m a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and commodities market."

                "body": "Canadian Dollar faces fresh weakness as Loonie falters further\n- The Canadian Dollar slid into a third straight down day against the US Dollar on Monday.\n- Loonie flows continue to find next to no support as Loonie bears remain in control.\n- BoC\u2019s matched rate cut with Fed\u2019s interest rate cut last week provided little support for Loonie markets.\nThe Canadian Dollar (USD) caught an extended bout of market weakness on Monday, sinking for a third straight trading day against the US Dollar (USD) and falling back into recent lows, driving the USD/CAD pair back into the 1.4050 region.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) trimmed interest rates by another 25 basis points last week, matching the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) quarter-point rate trim. With the Canadian Dollar\u2019s interest rate differential with the US Dollar moving in lockstep, the Loonie is poised to neither gain nor lose from central bank moves, keeping Loonie traders locked in on an economy that is grappling with trade war fallout. The Canadian economy also relies heavily on Crude Oil market activity, and stubbornly low barrel prices are doing the Loonie no favors.\nDaily digest market movers: Canadian Dollar falls further as BoC matches Fed rate moves\n- The Canadian Dollar fell for a third straight session against the US Dollar, declining another 0.3%.\n- USD/CAD has risen back into the 1.4050 zone, and is poised to take a fresh run at seven-month highs as the Loonie continues to slump against the Greenback.\n- The Canadian Dollar has lost ground against the US Dollar for three of the last four straight calendar months.\n- Standard & Poor\u2019s Canadian Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) showed that although overall business conditions have improved in October, overall expectations remain on the contractionary side, and business operators continue to expect deteriorating conditions moving forward as trade war tariffs continue to bite at the outside edges of the Canadian economy.\n- BoC Governor Tiff Macklem noted on Monday that despite ongoing slack in the Canadian labor market and the need for ongoing stimulus from monetary policy effects, the bulk of US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs continue to be paid for by American businesses and consumers.\nCanadian Dollar price forecast\nUSD/CAD has seen a positive shift in momentum on daily candlesticks, bringing a sense of optimism after months of steady consolidation and a gentle recovery from the June lows near 1.3350. Recently, price action has broken above both the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), which are commonly seen as positive signs indicating a potential trend reversal. The 50-day EMA is in the processing of completing a 'golden cross' above the 200-day EMA, adding further weight to odds of a bullish continuation after new exhaustion points. The latest candles reflect strong buying interest following a brief dip to the 1.3850 support level, showing that buyers are eager to step in during dips.\nBids are now testing the resistance zone between 1.4050 and 1.4100, a level that has historically capped rallies since August. A solid daily close above this range could pave the way for a move toward the 1.4300 level, while a failure to break through could lead to a retest of the 1.3900\u20131.3850 support area for confirmation. The RSI is around 60, indicating there\u2019s still room for additional gains before it becomes overbought. In the near term, traders will be watching to see if momentum can hold above 1.4050 to confirm a breakout, or if rejection at this level hints at a continued range-bound movement.\nUSD/CAD daily chart\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports.

Investors tend to favour the higher-yielding currency.\nLast week, the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate to a three-year low of 2.25% to support the economy which has been badly hampered by the U.S.-led trade war.\nThe downturn in Canada\u2019s manufacturing sector eased in October as output and new orders declined at a slower pace. The S&P Global Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index rose to 49.6 last month from 47.7 in September, posting its highest level since January.\nThe U.S. dollar extended its recent gains against a basket of major currencies on doubts about prospects of another Federal Reserve rate cut this year.\nThe price of oil, one of Canada\u2019s major exports, was down 0.2% at $60.84 a barrel as the market balanced the latest OPEC+ supply increase with the group\u2019s plans to pause output increases in the first quarter of 2026.\nCanadian bond yields moved higher across the curve, with the 10-year up 3.1 basis points at 3.152%.\nAnalysts expect Canada\u2019s budget, due on Tuesday, to show the fiscal deficit widening."

The yield gap between Canadian and US two-year government bonds has jumped to 119 basis points\u2014up sharply from 92 in August\u2014making the US dollar more attractive. This difference is now a key factor guiding CAD\u2013USD exchange rates, according to Klarity FX. At the same time, the Bank of Canada\u2019s recent rate cut to a three-year low of 2.25% is a direct response to persistent economic sluggishness, illustrated by an October manufacturing PMI stuck in contraction territory at 49.6. Add in falling oil prices and expectations of an even bigger government budget deficit, and the loonie is feeling the pinch from multiple sides.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency moves signal shifting confidence.\nThe US dollar is soaking up investor demand as higher rates and uncertainty send capital its way. Canada\u2019s softer rates and talk of larger deficits give global investors little incentive to stick with the loonie, speeding up capital flows toward US assets and leaving Canadian markets out in the cold.\nThe bigger picture: Yield spreads and budgets move the needle globally.\nDiverging US and Canadian policies are starting to reshape both currency trends and the flow of global investment. With Canada potentially ramping up deficit spending to fight slow growth, investors may want greater returns to offset the added risk.

At the time of writing, GBP/JPY trades around 202.41, easing slightly from the intraday high of 202.79.\nFrom a technical perspective, the pair bounced last week after testing a critical confluence zone near the 200.00 psychological handle, which aligns with the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a horizontal support that previously acted as resistance. This area continues to act as a key floor for the cross, keeping the broader uptrend intact.\nHowever, the 21-day SMA at 202.81 is capping immediate upside attempts, acting as a near-term barrier for bulls. A decisive break above this dynamic resistance could open the door toward 204.00, followed by the 205.00 area, which marks both the year-to-date high and the highest level since July 2024.\nOn the downside, a sustained move below the 200.00 confluence support would expose the pair to renewed bearish pressure, with the next target seen at the October 3 high near 198.87, also coinciding with an unfilled bullish gap from October 6. A daily close below that region could reinforce downside momentum, exposing the next support around 197.50.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 53, reflecting a neutral bias as the pair consolidates within its broader bullish structure.\nBoE FAQs\nThe Bank of England (BoE) decides monetary policy for the United Kingdom. Its primary goal is to achieve \u2018price stability\u2019, or a steady inflation rate of 2%. Its tool for achieving this is via the adjustment of base lending rates. The BoE sets the rate at which it lends to commercial banks and banks lend to each other, determining the level of interest rates in the economy overall. This also impacts the value of the Pound Sterling (GBP).\nWhen inflation is above the Bank of England\u2019s target it responds by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is positive for the Pound Sterling because higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls below target, it is a sign economic growth is slowing, and the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit in the hope businesses will borrow to invest in growth-generating projects \u2013 a negative for the Pound Sterling.\nIn extreme situations, the Bank of England can enact a policy called Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the BoE substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. QE is a last resort policy when lowering interest rates will not achieve the necessary result. The process of QE involves the BoE printing money to buy assets \u2013 usually government or AAA-rated corporate bonds \u2013 from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Pound Sterling.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE, enacted when the economy is strengthening and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the Bank of England (BoE) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to encourage them to lend; in QT, the BoE stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive for the Pound Sterling.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "One of Ethereum\u2019s leading DeFi protocols, Balancer, which also functions as an established automated market maker (AMM) on the network, suffered a significant exploit today (November 3), resulting in losses exceeding $70M.\nOn-chain data shows that multiple Balancer liquidity pools were drained in rapid succession, with the stolen tokens quickly transferred to a newly created wallet controlled by the attacker.\nWhat we Know About the Balancer Hack So Far\nThe attack targeted Balancer\u2019s V2 vaults and liquidity pools, exploiting a vulnerability in smart contract interactions. Preliminary analysis from on-chain investigators points to a maliciously deployed contract that manipulated Vault calls during pool initialization.\nImproper authorization and callback handling allowed the attacker to bypass safeguards. This enabled unauthorized swaps or balance manipulations across interconnected pools, resulting in the rapid depletion of assets.\nThe exploiter initiated a series of transactions starting with a key Ethereum mainnet transaction (0xd155207261712c35fa3d472ed1e51bfcd816e616dd4f517fa5959836f5b48569), which funneled assets to a new wallet under their control. Funds were then consolidated, likely for laundering via mixers or bridges.\nBalancer\u2019s composable design, where pools interact heavily, amplified the flaw. Similar issues have plagued AMMs before, often tied to how they handle deflationary tokens or pool rebalancing.\nFull forensic details are still emerging, with auditors like PeckShield and Nansen involved. There is no evidence of a private key compromise; this was a pure smart contract exploit.\nThe swift execution of the transfers suggests the attacker had a deep understanding of Balancer\u2019s smart contracts, potentially exploiting a flaw in how the platform handles swaps or manages pool balances.\nDISCOVER: The 12+ Hottest Crypto Presales to Buy Right Now\nBalancer Reacts, Community on Edge\nAt the time of writing, Balancer has posted just one update, confirming the hack and assuring the community an investigation is underway. The DeFi protocols post on X reads:\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of a potential exploit impacting Balancer v2 pools. Our engineering and security teams are investigating with high priority. We\u2019ll share verified updates and next steps as soon as we have more information.\u201d\nThe lack of communication has fueled uncertainty within the DeFi community, as users scramble to understand the scope and cause of the breach.\nBlockchain analysts have advised traders to refrain from interacting with Balancer pools until further information is released, warning that additional vulnerabilities may still be present."

                "body": "In This Article\nToday, we\u2019re breaking down CoinGecko\u2019s 2025 Q1 Crypto Industry Report and summarizing its key insights for 99Bitcoins readers.\nThe third quarter of 2025 marked a turning point for the crypto market, becoming a period of stabilization, maturity, and cautious optimism. After the volatility of early 2025, digital assets found firmer ground, with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering close to all-time-high territory, Ethereum (ETC) strengthening its ecosystem through liquid staking and real-world asset (RWA) integration, and selected altcoins proving that fundamentals are back in focus.\nAccording to CoinGecko\u2019s Q3 2025 Crypto Industry Report, the total crypto market capitalization fluctuated between $2.5 trillion and $2.9 trillion, signaling steady consolidation after earlier peaks and pullbacks. Institutional participation continued to rise, ETF inflows leveled off rather than reversed, and developers continued to build, especially across DeFi, tokenization, and gaming. Let\u2019s break down what these trends reveal about where the market stands today and what might be coming next!\nCrypto Market Analysis Q3 2025: Summary\nThe third quarter of 2025 brought a mix of consolidation, cautious optimism, and emerging opportunities across the crypto industry. While Bitcoin continued to hold its ground after a volatile first half of the year, Ethereum and several altcoin sectors showed resilience amid shifting investor sentiment. According to CoinGecko\u2019s Q3 2025 Crypto Industry Report, the total market capitalization fluctuated between $2.5 trillion and $2.9 trillion, reflecting a period of relative stability after earlier highs and corrections.\nKey Takeaways\n- BTC traded mostly between $68K\u2013$70K as long-term holders locked away supply and ETF inflows stabilized, signaling a more mature, institution-driven market.\n- ETH staking surpassed the mark of 32 million, while renewed decentralized finance (DeFi) and RWA activity pushed average gas fees higher but underscored growing on-chain utility.\n- Solana, Avalanche, and Base benefited from ecosystem expansion, while speculative meme tokens like DOGE and PEPE cooled, contributing under 2% of total volume.\n- Liquid staking and tokenized treasuries pushed DeFi TVL to about $115 billion, with Base emerging as a serious Layer-2 contender.\n- Trading volume rose 12% quarter-over-quarter as developers shifted from hype-driven drops to utility-based NFTs and cross-platform integration.\n- Binance retained a ~45% market share but faced headwinds, while Coinbase grew through ETF exposure and derivatives; decentralized exchanges captured 22% of total trading, their strongest share since 2022.\n- Crypto fundamentals, liquidity, and institutional engagement are strengthening, setting the stage for Q4 catalysts like ETF inflows, RWA tokenization, and macro policy shifts.\nTotal Crypto Market Capitalization in Q3 2025\nQ3 2025 is in the books, but why is analyzing it important? Because understanding how the market evolved this quarter can help you navigate what comes next. From shifting capital flows to changing investor behavior, the trends bring to the surface where the market\u2019s strength and potential risks may lie heading into the next quarter.\nThe broader crypto market entered Q3 2025 with renewed momentum, and the data show it clearly: total market capitalization rose by around +16.4% (ca. $563.6 billion) to finish the quarter at about $4.0 trillion, taking the industry back to levels last seen in late 2021.\nThat growth comes with nuances. While price action played a role, the uptick in average daily trading volume (up to ~$155 billion, +43.8% QoQ) signals that participation is ramping back up after weakness earlier in the year. At the same time, the market\u2019s volatility has dampened: annualized volatility for the total crypto cap fell from ~44.6% in Q2 to ~35.6% in Q3, suggesting that as the market matures, we will be seeing less extreme swings.\nCrucially, the structure of where the money went is shifting.

                "body": "Solana is often hailed as one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in the world, and it usually turns quite a few heads when it sets a new all-time high. Known for its scalability, low transaction costs, and thriving ecosystem of decentralized applications, the Solana network evolved into one of the most formidable contenders in the blockchain space.\nSolana\u2019s Latest All-Time High\nSolana climbed to a record price of around $293 on Jan. 19 of 2025, which helped solidify its position as one of the most valuable digital assets in circulation. This rally pushed its market cap past many established competitors, and currently makes it the 6th largest crypto by market cap.\nSOL\u2019s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap)\nThe surge came amid heightened optimism across the market, when traders and institutions showed renewed interest in high-performance layer-1 platforms. At its peak, Solana\u2019s daily trading volume spiked dramatically as investors rushed to gain exposure, while the total value locked (TVL) in its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem also reached multi-month highs.\nWhat Drove Solana to New Heights\n1. Explosive Ecosystem Growth\nOne of the main catalysts behind Solana\u2019s price rally has been the exponential growth of its ecosystem. Over the past few months, Solana has seen a sharp rise in network activity across multiple sectors \u2014 decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, and payments. Protocols built on Solana like Jupiter, MarginFi, and Kamino have recorded record user engagement and trading volumes, while NFT marketplaces have witnessed renewed enthusiasm thanks to new collections and better liquidity.\nSolana DEX Jupiter\u2019s TVL increase\nSolana\u2019s ultra-fast and low-cost transaction capability has made it the go-to choice for developers and users seeking efficiency. The network\u2019s average transaction cost is still a fraction of a cent, which makes it ideal for applications that require high-frequency or micro-transactions, such as blockchain-based gaming and social apps.\n2. Institutional and ETF Momentum\nAnother major driver behind the new all-time high has been a surge in institutional interest. Solana\u2019s recent entry into the world of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and the approval of spot Solana ETFs in certain regions have opened the door for larger pools of capital to gain exposure. This development has been viewed as a turning point for Solana, as institutional investors often represent long-term capital rather than speculative inflows.\nAdditionally, several crypto funds have publicly disclosed significant Solana allocations, which sheds some light on the asset\u2019s growing reputation as a \u201cblue-chip\u201d blockchain. This validation from traditional finance helped propel confidence and demand for SOL in both retail and professional markets.\n3. Broader Market Momentum\nThe timing of Solana\u2019s rally also coincided with a broader resurgence in the crypto market. Bitcoin and Ethereum were both trending upward after Dolnald Trump\u2019s inauguration, creating a favorable macro environment for risk assets. In bull cycles, high-performance blockchains like Solana often outperform as investors seek assets with strong narratives, innovative ecosystems, and room for growth.\nMoreover, market sentiment around Solana has improved dramatically compared to prior years, when network congestion and downtime temporarily tarnished its reputation. The network\u2019s latest upgrades stabilized performance and reduced outages, which restored confidence among developers and users.\n4. Developer Activity and Innovation\nBeyond price action, Solana\u2019s fundamentals continue to strengthen. Developer participation on the network has reached record levels, with thousands of active builders contributing to new projects. The ecosystem\u2019s open-source tooling and developer support programs have accelerated innovation, particularly in areas such as on-chain order books, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), and AI-integrated dApps"

                "body": "Solana price sits around $184 as traders weigh short-term pullbacks against strong long-term growth signals. The network\u2019s steady ecosystem expansion continues to strengthen investor confidence, keeping analysts focused on their bullish Solana price prediction targets. While the $200 resistance has held firm, market sentiment and on-chain data still point toward another upward push.\nThere is a new altcoin called Remittix (RTX) that is gaining the attention of traders. Remittix has secured a BitMart listing after the project raised $20 million, followed by an LBank listing after $22 million, with a third exchange listing currently in preparation.\nSolana Price Prediction: Bulls Hold Firm Above Key Support\nSolana price recently failed to break the $205 barrier, which has caused a short-term correction that pulled it below $198 and $195. Yet, the bulls have guarded the support extended by the $188\u2013$192 zone, not allowing it to turn further negative. A bearish descending channel has been set on the hourly chart, and resistance is near $200, which remains the key level to reclaim.\nAccording to analysts, this setup reflects a normal cooling phase within a broader bullish structure. The Solana price prediction is still optimistic as long as the buyers retain more than $188. The immediate obstacle will be at $198 and then, $205.\nAny confirmed breakout of the levels may see a short-term opening in the $220 or even $225. Although the RSI has not exceeded 50, which is a signal of neutral momentum, the increase in the spot interest and constant inflows in staking indicate that a new wave will soon follow.\nRemittix (RTX): A Payments-Focused Token\nWhile Solana leads this smart-contract layer-1 rally, payments-focused projects like Remittix are showing growth in the real-world utility space. As on-chain adoption accelerates, many traders see Remittix as a strong complement to Solana for diversified crypto portfolios, balancing growth potential with tangible utility.\nRemittix has sold over 682 million tokens, raised more than $27.8 million, and its token is priced at $0.1166. The project also features a 15% USDT referral paid daily and a $250,000 giveaway to reward community participation.\nSome key reasons Remittix is gaining attention\n- Users can send crypto to real bank accounts in over thirty countries within minutes.\n- The platform powers real payments volume instead of speculative trading.\n- CertiK verification reinforces security and investor trust.\n- Global payout rails are already integrated and expanding across new regions.\nThe Path Forward For Solana\nThe next few sessions will likely decide whether Solana can reclaim the $200 mark or retest the $188 floor. Holding the higher range keeps the bullish Solana price prediction alive, especially as ecosystem data and institutional interest continue to rise.\nAs Solana strengthens its network position and new capital enters, paired with utility projects like Remittix expanding alongside. This Q4 could be where both tokens redefine what sustainable growth looks like in crypto.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\n$250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

Among them, Blazpay ($BLAZ), Bitcoin (BTC), and Solana (SOL) are emerging as the best crypto coins to buy for those seeking sustainable growth and next-generation functionality.As AI and blockchain technologies converge, Blazpay's upcoming AI Crypto Presale stands out as a unique opportunity for Web3 users seeking long-term, utility-driven potential. Currently Blazpay in Phase 3 of its best crypto presale at a price of $0.0094, Blazpay has already sold 154.43 million tokens out of 201.89 million, raising over $1.12 million a remarkable 76.5% completion rate that reflects growing confidence in the platform's DeFi ecosystem.\nWhile Bitcoin continues to dominate institutional interest and Solana powers the Web3 creator economy, Blazpay's AI-driven DeFi framework is introducing an entirely new level of interoperability, automation, and user engagement. Its ongoing AI Crypto Presale has drawn global attention for blending smart automation with practical DeFi utilities.\nBlazpay ($BLAZ): The AI-Driven DeFi Revolution\nBlazpay ($BLAZ) represents the evolution of decentralized finance, a platform designed for both individuals and businesses to manage trading, payments, and multi-chain portfolios effortlessly.\nBlazpay is rapidly positioning itself as the top crypto presale of 2025, currently available at just $0.0094 in Phase 3 a rare low-entry gateway in today's fast-moving crypto market. Unlike typical presales, Blazpay integrates six powerful utilities including multichain SDK access, AI-driven automation, gamified rewards, NFT marketplace support, perpetual trading, and a robust developer ecosystem. This makes it far more than a token; it's an AI-powered DeFi infrastructure designed for the next evolution of decentralized finance.\nWith 800,000+ active users, over 3 million transactions, and $200,000+ in distributed rewards, Blazpay ($BLAZ) has already proven real-world traction. It's not just another presale, it's a comprehensive, utility-first platform redefining how users and businesses engage with DeFi.\nGamified Rewards and B2B API/SDK\nBlazpay introduces interactive incentives that make DeFi participation rewarding. Through its Gamified Rewards system, users can earn points and bonuses by engaging in activities such as liquidity provision, referrals, and staking. This approach transforms what's often a complex DeFi experience into an accessible, enjoyable ecosystem boosting engagement and community loyalty.\nBlazpay's B2B API/SDK offers developers and businesses a plug-and-play toolkit to embed multi-chain DeFi functionality directly into their applications. This feature allows any fintech, Web3 startup, or enterprise to integrate trading, transfers, and DeFi tools into their existing platforms, a capability that sets Blazpay apart from other AI Crypto Presale projects.\nTogether, these utilities highlight why Blazpay is not just another presale, it's building the infrastructure for the AI-powered future of decentralized finance.\n$2000 Investment Scenario\nAt the current presale rate of $0.0094, a $2,000 investment secures \u2248 212,766 BLAZ tokens. If the token lists at $0.075 (8\u00d7) post-launch, that position grows to $15,957.\nAt $0.15 (16\u00d7), returns would exceed $31,914, and at $0.225 (24\u00d7) a realistic projection given current traction the same $2,000 could rise to $47,872. This kind of asymmetric growth separates early-stage AI + DeFi projects like Blazpay from legacy assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose massive market caps limit upside potential.\nPrice Prediction - Analysts Eye $0.05 - $0.15 Range Post-Listing\nAnalysts project Blazpay ($BLAZ) to debut between $0.05 and $0.15 in its initial trading phase, driven by strong fundamentals such as real-world utility, limited token supply, and seamless cross-chain int"

Instead, investors will have to make do with alternate sources, like payroll provider ADP's monthly private-sector jobs report.\nInvestors are watching the labor market closely to gauge the likelihood that the Federal Reserve follows up last week's interest rate cut with another reduction at its final meeting of the year in December.

Hims & Hers Health saw its stock price climb nearly 3% as investors positioned themselves ahead of the telehealth company\u2019s earnings report. Market watchers expect earnings of 10 cents per share on revenue of $581.38 million, highlighting the continued growth in digital healthcare services.\nHealthcare and manufacturing stocks gain momentum\nThe healthcare and manufacturing sectors are also drawing significant investor interest, with two additional companies making notable moves:\n4. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings faced some challenges, declining slightly after reporting quarterly results that missed analyst expectations. The aerospace manufacturer reported sales of $1.585 billion, falling short of the anticipated $1.923 billion consensus estimate.\n5. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company maintained steady performance ahead of its earnings announcement. Analysts anticipate the tire manufacturer will report earnings of 15 cents per share on revenue of $1.09 billion, indicating stable demand in the automotive sector.\nWhat this means for everyday investors\nMarket analysts are painting an increasingly optimistic picture of the current investment environment. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Research, argues that recent market performance demonstrates genuine underlying strength rather than narrow concentration in a few large companies.\nThe equal-weight versions of major indices hitting all-time highs simultaneously suggests that the average stock is performing well, not just technology giants. This broad-based participation indicates a healthier, more sustainable market trend that could benefit diverse investment portfolios.\nInterest rate expectations continue to influence market sentiment, with traders pricing in a 69.3% probability that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates during its December meeting. Current Treasury bond yields show the 10-year at 4.08% and the "

                "body": "- Market Rebound: Germany\u2019s DAX index jumped over 1% on Monday (Nov 3) to around 24,200 intraday, led by strong rallies in automobile and banking shares [1] [2]. This follows a 0.68% drop last Friday when construction, insurance, and telecom stocks dragged the market down [3].\n- Seasonal Optimism: Analysts cite classic year-end seasonal tailwinds for stocks \u2013 historically a strong Q4 pattern \u2013 as a key driver of optimism. \u201cYear-end rallies are indeed common,\u201d notes Deutsche B\u00f6rse, with October-November typically yielding positive returns on average [4] [5].\n- Expert Forecasts: Several market experts predict further gains. Bernd Meyer of Berenberg expects a \u201crelatively strong year-end\u201d for equities given Fed rate cuts, solid data, and earnings beats [6]. Technical chartists even say a DAX breakout is near: if stability holds, \u201c25,000 points is quickly possible\u201d, according to analyst Christoph Geyer [7].\n- Easing Headwinds: Global risks that weighed on sentiment are abating. A recent U.S.-China trade truce has eased supply fears \u2013 crucial for export-heavy Germany [8] \u2013 and the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s late-October rate cut has bolstered risk appetite (though further cuts are less certain) [9]. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s latest manufacturing PMI ticked up to 49.6, still contracting but slightly improved [10].\n- Caution Remains: Not everyone is euphoric. Some strategists warn about over-exuberance in high-flying tech/AI stocks, pointing to bubble risks. \u201cCritics warn of an investment bubble\u2026 the advent of AI will bring disruptive effects, separating winners from losers,\u201d cautions Ulrich Stephan of Deutsche Bank [11]. Additionally, Germany\u2019s economy remains fragile \u2013 \u201cpersistently disappointing\u201d data have made investors skeptical that the new government can revive growth sustainably [12].\nRecent Market Moves: From Dip to Rally\nAfter a soft close to October, German equities have quickly flipped the script in early November. Last Friday, the DAX index fell 0.68% to around 23,958 [13] as several sectors slumped. Losses in construction, insurance, and telecom stocks led the decline [14], pulling the blue-chip index down and ending the week on a cautious note. Defensives like consumer staples offered little relief, and even stalwart names such as Allianz and Adidas slid over 2% [15]. One bright spot was industrial firm Kion Group, which surged nearly 7% to a three-year high amid positive earnings, but overall declining stocks far outnumbered advancers on the Frankfurt exchange [16] [17].\nBy Monday morning (Nov 3), however, sentiment had dramatically improved. The DAX opened just above 24,000 points [18] and continued climbing through midday, up roughly 1.1% to 24,227 in early afternoon trade [19]. This robust intraday rally was fueled by a rebound in cyclical sectors that had lagged. Investors seemed eager to buy the dip from last week, heartened by fresh signals of easing global risks and supportive seasonal trends. The result was a broad-based advance that put the index back within sight of its record highs, erasing the prior session\u2019s losses and then some.\nYear-End Tailwinds Fuel Optimism\nA major factor behind the DAX\u2019s reversal is the classic \u201cyear-end rally\u201d phenomenon. Seasonal patterns favor equity gains late in the year, and 2025 appears to be following suit. \u201cSeasonal tailwinds should not be underestimated either,\u201d says Bernd Meyer, Chief Investment Strategist at Berenberg, noting that historically the final quarter (especially October-November) delivers strong returns for both European and U.S. stocks [20]. With the calendar turning to November, many investors anticipate this positive seasonal bias to kick in \u2013 a self-fulfilling optimism that can drive markets higher.\nMultiple analysts are also pointing to a confluence of supportive factors aligning for equities right now. According to Meyer, the macroeconomic backdrop is turning more stock-friendly: \u201cThe combination of Fed rate cuts, solid economic data, and positive corporate earnin"

Commodity markets like Brent crude oil traded around $64-65 per barrel amidst concerns over supply and geopolitical factors.\nYear-to-date, the market remains strong with gains fueled primarily by the technology sector and AI investments.

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%. A strong earnings report from tech giant Amazon (AMZN) helped propel the major indexes to gains last Friday, capping off a winning week and month for stocks.\nIt's set to be another busy week of earnings; Software maker Palantir (PLTR) reported a better-than-expected quarter after the bell Monday. Investors will be hoping big tech's massive investments in artificial intelligence are a boon to sales at chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM), both of which are slated to report later in the week.\nInvestors would normally be getting vital updates on the labor market this week, which has softened more than economists expected this year, but most economic data will continue to be delayed as the U.S. government shutdown stretches into a second month. Instead, investors will have to make do with alternate sources, like payroll provider ADP's monthly private-sector jobs report.\nInvestors are watching the labor market closely to gauge the likelihood that the Federal Reserve follows up last week's interest rate cut with another reduction at its final meeting of the year in December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week warned another cut is \"not a foregone conclusion,\" but it remains the most likely outcome according to Wall Street.\nTech stocks got a boost Monday after Microsoft (MSFT) struck a $10 billion cloud computing deal with Australia-based neocloud IREN (IREN), shares of which jumped more than 12%. Microsoft shares dipped 0.2%, while Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips Microsoft will be gaining access to with the IREN deal, rose 2%.

Tesla (TSLA) gained more than 2%, while Alphabet (GOOG) rose 1%. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) slid 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively.\nIn other corporate news, consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark (KMB) agreed to buy Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) in a deal valued at more than $40 billion. Kenvue shares popped 12%, while Kimberly-Clark dropped more than 14%. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) ticked down 0.4% after the conglomerate on Saturday reported a more than 30% increase in operating profit, driven by strong insurance underwriting results. The report was Berkshire's last with legendary investor Warren Buffett as CEO.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on all kinds of consumer loans, ticked up to 4.11% from 4.08% at Friday's close. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $4,015 an ounce, while West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, inched up 0.1% to $61 a barrel.\nCryptocurrencies slid, with Bitcoin trading at about $106,800 in the early evening, down from a high of more than $111,000 over the weekend. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, rose 0.1% to 99.9.\nNotable S&P 500 Movers on Monday\nAdvancers:\n- IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX) shares jumped 15%, the best performance on the S&P 500 today, after the pet health specialist reported better-than-expected third quarter sales and profit.

                "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. -- When Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. takes the field at AT&T Stadium on Monday night against the Dallas Cowboys, his dad will be sitting at home, 1,500 miles away in Philadelphia, watching on TV.\nThat will be a struggle for the Hall of Fame wide receiver.\nAny time Marvin Harrison Sr. turns on his son's games, he sees an NFL that looks vastly different from the sport he left in 2008 after playing 13 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts. He sees a quarterback primarily in the shotgun, his son being moved around the field from wideout to the slot and back again, and motions from every direction.\nHe also sees a Cardinals offense that's struggled to produce yards and points as it has slogged to a 2-5 record, heading into \"Monday Night Football\" on a five-game losing streak.\n\"It's very hard for me to watch the Cardinals' offense,\" Harrison Sr. told ESPN. \"And you can quote me on that.\"\nA season and a half into his son's NFL career, the elder Harrison has been forced to grapple with being a former player who's the father of a current player. The balance needed to navigate that isn't always easy to find. Harrison Sr. can't help but watch his son's games with the critical eye of a former player, and he wants, desperately, to help his son, to tell him what to do, to try to fix Arizona's issues. But Harrison Jr. is an adult, a well-compensated professional, a fourth pick, and Harrison Sr. knows it's his time to sit on the sideline, watch and try to enjoy his oldest son's professional career.\nBut it's hard. The 53-year-old Harrison Sr. is aware of how he sounds.\n\"The style of offense that I am accustomed to, that I'm used to watching as a professional eye, as a wide receiver ... I just can't relate to watching that [current] offense, that style of offense,\" Harrison Sr. said. \"Basically, I can't relate to what goes on there.\n\"I think that's just peacefully put, without pointing fingers or anything. It's just me. I'm giving you the professional eye. I can't relate to it. It don't add up to me. I can't deal with it.\"\nThose words aren't new to his son.\nHarrison Jr. has heard his dad's concerns and complaints dating back to last season. But Harrison Sr. walks a tightrope when he brings up football with his son, a rare occurrence these days. He stays away from talking about the day-to-day, not wanting to be an armchair quarterback from across the country because he's not there, in the meetings, and he doesn't understand the intricacies of the Cardinals' scheme like he did the Peyton Manning-led offense in Indianapolis.\n\"I don't get into what goes on the field and the things that I see,\" Harrison Sr. said. \"I just leave it alone. I don't even bother bringing it up no more.\"\nThat might be wise, considering the Cardinals' struggles, especially in the passing game. They're 23rd in passing yards per game at 199.9, 26th in passing yards per play at 5.78 and quarterback Kyler Murray is 24th in QBR at 44.1. Murray is ranked 29th in yards per attempt, 31st in yards per dropback and 33rd in yards per attempt while throwing six touchdowns and three picks in five starts.\nJacoby Brissett will start a third straight game in place of Murray (foot) on Monday, but it's possible Murray will see some action.\nHarrison Jr. averages 56.6 receiving yards per game and has 40 targets over seven games, which is 54th, and he has just two touchdown catches. ESPN's receiver score ranks him as the NFL's 48th-best receiver -- a notable improvement from 2024, when he ranked 93rd.\nHe is second on the Cardinals in targets and receiving yards per game behind tight end Trey McBride (66 targets, 60.1 yards per game).\nWhen father and son talk on the phone, whether that's a couple of days in a row or if weeks pass between calls, they typically stick to discussing Harrison Jr.'s younger brother, Jett, a high school sophomore at St. Joseph's Prep School in Philadelphia who is in line to be the next great Harrison receiver. Or they don't talk about f"

                "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A jury was selected Monday in the trial of former Justice Department employee Sean Dunn, also known as the \u201csandwich guy,\u201d months after he went viral for throwing a salami sub at a Customs and Border Protection agent in Washington, D.C., at close range.\nProsecutors hit Dunn with a misdemeanor assault charge in August. That came a day after U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro\u2019s office failed to persuade a grand jury to indict Dunn on felony charges \u2014 a sub-optimal result for prosecutors.\nDunn pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charge in September. The case is proceeding after a judge rejected the government\u2019s motion to delay the trial because of a disagreement over jury instructions.\nJury selection was completed Monday in open court, but U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols used technology, including a white noise machine, to block members of the public and the media from hearing the questions posed to potential jurors and their responses.\nDunn's attorneys argued that the judge's use of the device was a violation of their client's right to have a public trial, and that jury selection should start over. Nichols denied the motion, calling it \"drastic.\"\nOpening statements are scheduled to begin Tuesday morning.\nDunn\u2019s lawyers have claimed the case is \u201cselective and vindictive prosecution,\u201d arguing he was singled out for prosecution \u201cnot because of the nature of his alleged conduct \u2014 throwing a soft object that caused no injury \u2014 but because his outspoken, viral critique of the current administration\u2019s policing and immigration policies made him a political target.\u201d\nFederal prosecutors opposed Dunn\u2019s lawyers\u2019 motion to dismiss the charge, writing that Dunn was \u201crecorded throwing a sandwich at a federal officer at point-blank range.\u201d\nA video of Dunn throwing the meat sandwich at federal officers quickly ricocheted around the internet as Washingtonians pushed back against President Donald Trump\u2019s move to deploy federal officers and National Guard troops in the nation\u2019s capital.\nSince then, \u201csandwich guy\u201d has become a bread-and-butter part of D.C.\u2019s resistance to the president. Dunn\u2019s throw was depicted in stickers, murals and even Halloween costumes.\nThe sandwich incident took place around the same time National Guard troops began arriving in the capital as part of Trump\u2019s efforts to fight crime. The administration also deployed additional federal agents into the city, who set up police checkpoints and made immigration arrests, sparking backlash from residents who argued the moves were an overreach.\nThe August incident captured on video shows Dunn yelling at officers in the U Street Corridor, a popular nightlife area.\n\u201cF--- you!\u201d Dunn said. \u201cYou f---ing fascists! Why are you here? I don\u2019t want you in my city!\u201d\nAfter throwing the sub, Dunn was chased and arrested by officers, who later released him. Later, he was charged with felony assault on law enforcement, although the grand jury declined to indict him. The White House appeared to relish Dunn's arrest, posting a dramatic edited video of the moment.\nFollowing the incident, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Dunn had been fired from the Justice Department, where he had worked as a paralegal."
