Which ones are rising the fastest?\nThe Gold Rally Through a Global Lens\nThis chart indexes gold prices in major currencies, revealing how broadly the metal\u2019s surge has played out worldwide. Even in regions with relatively resilient currencies (such as the euro and Swiss franc) gold has posted solid double-digit gains, underscoring the strength of the underlying move.\nThe rally has been even more dramatic in countries where currencies have faced greater pressure. In the U.S., for example, gold prices rose more dramatically than in other countries. This divergence highlights how local currency performance can amplify or dampen gold\u2019s returns, even when the underlying global price is moving in tandem.\nThe Role of Currency and Monetary Policy\nThese differences point to a key dynamic for investors: gold\u2019s performance is tightly linked to foreign exchange. When a currency weakens, the local price of gold tends to rise more quickly, effectively delivering an FX-driven boost to returns. Conversely, in markets with stronger currencies, gold can still perform well, but gains are typically more muted.\nLooking ahead, expectations for global rate cuts could play a pivotal role in shaping gold\u2019s next phase. Easing monetary policy often weighs on currencies while improving gold\u2019s relative appeal as a store of value. As central banks move at different speeds, shifts in currency strength may become just as important as movements in the U.S. dollar gold price itself.\nWhat This Means Going Forward\nAs 2026 starts, gold\u2019s global performance will likely hinge on the interplay between currency moves and monetary policy, not just the metal\u2019s price in dollar terms.\nNote: Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n-\nMarkets5 days ago\nTrump Trade Shake-Up: Which Countries Are Winning Vs.

                "url": "https://www.theweek.in/theweek/business/2026/01/17/should-you-invest-in-silver-now-why-analysts-are-urging-caution.html",
                "body": "In 2025, precious metals massively outperformed equities. While gold gained more than 75 per cent, it was silver that outshined everything else, surging more than 170 per cent, and the rally has continued unabated in 2026. Continued geopolitical tensions and trade-related uncertainties, fuelled by the US administration\u2019s levy of steep tariffs on imports from many countries, led to strong investor demand for precious metals. However, silver\u2019s performance was boosted by dual tailwinds. First, the rising investment appetite amid global uncertainties, and second, industrial use cases driving demand.\nThese factors drove silver prices from around $29 an ounce at the start of 2025 to more than $80 at the end of the year. On January 12, 2026, silver hit a new all-time high of $84.50. In the domestic market, it went up to Rs2.63 lakh per kilo before retreating to around Rs2.62 lakh. At the start of 2025, it was priced at Rs93,500. Demand for silver has been rising over the past few years as it is used in solar panels, electric vehicles, semiconductors and data centres, among other areas. However, silver supply has not kept pace with this increasing demand.\nSilver demand rose by around 24 per cent, from 929 million ounces in 2020 to an estimated 1,148 million ounces in 2025, according to The Silver Institute. In contrast, silver supply during the same period rose by only around 6 per cent, from 974 million ounces to an estimated 1,031 million ounces. Starting this year, China announced tighter control over silver exports, which further drove prices up. China has not imposed a blanket ban on the export of silver; but, under tighter controls, only 44 companies are allowed to export silver in 2026 and 2027. This is one of several measures China has taken over the past two years to curb exports of minerals it deems critical for its industries.\nThe structural supply tightness underpinned the silver rally, with global silver demand exceeding supply for the fifth consecutive year, said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Industrial demand was the second highest on record, driven by solar photovoltaics, electrification, electric vehicles, grid infrastructure and emerging technology applications. James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC, said that silver prices were \u201cfundamentally overvalued\u201d. He expected demand conditions to remain volatile \u201cwith likely upside spikes until near-term tightness is alleviated\u201d. HSBC\u2019s average price forecast for 2026 stands at $68.25, falling to $57 in 2027.\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are accumulating at a robust pace and may continue to do so, feels Steel. But, \u201cindustrial demand is weakening as price-related resistance lowers purchases,\u201d he noted. He also pointed to rising recycling levels, as high prices, as well as greater electronic, environmental and other recovery efforts boost supply.\nThe supply and demand mismatch drove up prices, which in turn fuelled investment demand for silver. In the domestic market, the combined assets under management of gold and silver ETFs topped Rs2 lakh crore in December, up from around Rs57,000 crore at the beginning of 2025. Those who had invested at the start of the year would now be sitting on massive gains. However, it may not be wise to think that silver will continue to go up and deliver similar astronomical returns going ahead.\nHistorically, there have been several instances where silver rallies have been followed by a crash. In fact, silver made hardly any gains for years. It surged to around $40 an ounce in 1980 but then slumped back to $10. Silver topped $50 an ounce in 2011, but that rally, too, fizzled out. It was only in 2025 that it crossed those levels again. One must ask: is this time different, considering the strong industrial use cases driving demand?\nAccording to Motilal Oswal, gold and silver are expected to retain their strategic relevance in early 2026, supported by continued investor demand, limited mine supply growth and relatively"

                "body": "Crude oil prices are in retreat after rising on the possibility of U.S. strikes on Iran. Before the retreat, however, Brent crude and WTI had jumped to the highest in months, countering bearish forecasts for the year-and tearing traders between geopolitics and fundamentals.\nIn fundamentals, the majority of observers and forecasters are unanimous that the supply of crude oil is substantially higher than demand. In fact, Goldman Sachs recently revised its price predictions for 2026, saying it now expected Brent crude to go even lower after shedding about a fifth of its value last year.\n\"Rising global oil stocks and our forecast of a 2.3mb/d surplus in 2026 suggest that rebalancing the market likely requires lower oil prices in 2026 to slow down non-OPEC supply growth and support solid demand growth, barring large supply disruptions or OPEC production cuts,\" Goldman said earlier this week-even though protests in Iran were already making headlines and pushing the benchmarks higher.\nOn the other hand, the effective takeover by the United States of Venezuela's oil industry has had an understandably bearish effect on prices. This week, a Washington official told media that the U.S. has sold the first batch of Venezuelan crude for $500 million, and more sales would follow. In terms of fundamentals, this strengthens the case for a bearish mood. However, statements by oil industry executives urging caution about the possibility of a quick turnaround in Venezuelan oil production have had a restraining effect on that mood.\nMeanwhile, drone strikes on three tankers in the Black Sea fueled a new bout of supply disruption concern, to add to expectations of possible disruption in Iranian oil flows abroad. A Reuters report cited an unnamed source as saying Kazakhstan had suffered a 35% drop in its oil output over the first two weeks of January because of attacks that also included strikes on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium by Ukrainian forces. Kazakhstan has called on the United States and the European Union to help secure oil transport in the Black Sea.\nSpeaking of the European Union, reports emerged this week saying Brussels was planning a further cut in its price cap for Russian oil in a bid to reduce Russia's oil revenues by tying Western insurance coverage to the price cap. The new level of the price cap will be set at $44.10 per barrel from next month. So far, the price caps have failed to cause much pain to the Russian budget, but the EU considers them a working mechanism to hurt Russia's economy in a bid to make it withdraw from Ukraine.\nPerhaps the most bullish development for oil from the past few days was the signal, from President Donald Trump, that he was not excluding the possibility of a military strike against Iran. That signal, however, has been quite quickly replaced by observations by the U.S. president that the Iranian government was easing its crackdown on the protesters, reducing the likelihood of a military strike. That's when oil's retreat began and continues today, in evidence that the glut narrative holds sway over the oil market.\nExpectations of further growth in oil production remain dominant on that market, with forecasters such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency both predicting further supply growth, even as OPEC pauses its unwinding of production cuts implemented back in 2022 to prop up prices. Even so, shale drillers are signaling they would not be happy with WTI closer to $50 than to $60, and production growth is slowing. Indeed, the EIA forecast in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook that U.S. oil production will flatten this year, even inch down and extend that decline into 2027.\nThis has been ignored by the oil market so far, even though U.S. oil production has been the main driver behind bearish market predictions thanks to its fast and significant growth. That growth is now gone but everyone seems to be ignoring the fact in the firm belief there is already to"

Prior to this decline, both Brent and WTI crude reached their highest levels in several months, defying earlier pessimistic outlooks for the year and leaving traders caught between geopolitical tensions and underlying market fundamentals.\nMost analysts agree that the global supply of crude oil currently outpaces demand. Reflecting this, Goldman Sachs has recently lowered its price projections for 2026, anticipating even weaker Brent prices after last year\u2019s significant losses.\nAccording to Goldman, \u201cWith global oil inventories rising and a projected surplus of 2.3 million barrels per day in 2026, the market may need lower prices to slow non-OPEC supply growth and encourage stronger demand, unless major supply disruptions or OPEC cuts occur.\u201d This outlook persisted even as unrest in Iran was making headlines and temporarily boosting prices.\nThe United States\u2019 increasing involvement in Venezuela\u2019s oil sector has also weighed on prices. This week, U.S. officials confirmed the sale of an initial shipment of Venezuelan crude for $500 million, with further sales expected. While this development supports a bearish sentiment, industry leaders have cautioned that a rapid recovery in Venezuelan output is unlikely, tempering the market\u2019s reaction.\nRecent drone attacks on tankers in the Black Sea have reignited concerns about supply interruptions, adding to worries over possible disruptions in Iranian exports. Reports indicate that Kazakhstan\u2019s oil production dropped by 35% in the first half of January due to these attacks, which also targeted the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. In response, Kazakhstan has appealed to the U.S. and EU for assistance in safeguarding Black Sea oil shipments.\nThe European Union is reportedly preparing to further lower its price cap on Russian oil, aiming to reduce Moscow\u2019s energy revenues by linking Western insurance coverage to the cap. The new limit will be set at $44.10 per barrel starting next month. Although these measures have yet to significantly impact Russia\u2019s budget, the EU views them as a tool to pressure Russia economically amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nOne of the most bullish signals for oil in recent days came from former President Donald Trump, who suggested that military action against Iran was still on the table. However, this stance was quickly softened as the U.S. president noted a reduction in Iran\u2019s crackdown on protesters, making a strike less likely and prompting the recent price retreat\u2014reinforcing the prevailing narrative of oversupply.\nExpectations for continued growth in oil output remain strong, with both the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency forecasting further increases, even as OPEC maintains its production cuts from 2022. Nevertheless, U.S. shale producers have indicated dissatisfaction with WTI prices near $50, and the pace of production growth is slowing. The EIA\u2019s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook predicts that U.S. oil production will plateau this year and could decline through 2027.\nDespite this, the market seems to be overlooking the slowdown in U.S. output, focusing instead on the perception of a global oil surplus. Supporting this view, data from Kpler cited by the media shows that crude oil stored on tankers reached 1.3 billion barrels in December\u2014the highest since the pandemic lockdowns of 2020.\nReuters\u2019 Ron Bousso observed that a quarter of this seaborne oil comes from sanctioned countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. While these barrels take longer to find buyers, they eventually do, suggesting that tanker inventories may not accurately reflect a physical glut. Meanwhile, Chinese import figures reveal record-breaking oil purchases in both December and throughout 2025. Forecasting oil prices remains highly unpredictable, and the current environment is especially volatile as competing narratives shape"

                "body": "Colorado oilmen may play key role in Trump\u2019s Venezuelan oil takeover plan\nWhen President Donald Trump summoned oil executives to the White House recently to push for major investment in Venezuela, an interesting sprinkling of smaller independent companies from Denver was invited along with the big names of American oil. One of those was Raisa Energy, which is based in Denver and Cairo and led by Luis Rodriguez, who is from Venezuela himself. Raisa has about 25 employees in Denver now.\nAlso invited was Tallgrass Energy, a company that specializes in building pipeline and terminals in areas including the Rocky Mountains and Oklahoma, and Aspect Holdings, which lists former U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as an independent director, as reported by Axios news. Both are also headquartered in Denver.\nPolitical connections may account for the invitations more than expertise, since Denver is the home turf of Secretary of Energy Chris Wright.\nBut firms like Raisa and Tallgrass also represent a new wave of smaller, faster-moving energy firms looking to capitalize on new opportunities in underdeveloped oil fields all over the world.\nAs an independent, Raisa offers lower costs compared to majors, making them attractive for faster development of lighter oil or shale.\nAnd Venezuela is in dire need of upgraded infrastructure to produce more oil, which is why Tallgrass probably was invited.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have as much capital as an Exxon, Chevron or ConocoPhillips, but independents are known to move much faster. Their cost structure is lower, so they can drill wells much cheaper than the majors,\u201d a longtime oil industry executive told Reuters.\nAnd in an uber-transactional administration like Trump\u2019s, they may have the fastest route into Caracas, thanks to Wright.\nRaisa is \u201ca non-operating partner that is just investing in different projects. And they\u2019re doing it in different places,\u201d said Luis Zerpa, a petroleum engineering professor at the Colorado School of Mines who has worked in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry. \u201cIf Venezuela starts opening and they\u2019re activating the industry, they can provide funding for capital for some of the projects, because they have several people from Venezuela working in the company.\u201d\nAnd CEO Rodriguez also has expertise in working in Venezuela and the fields, Zerpa added. \u201cAnd they can do the evaluation of the asset sets and select which assets they would like to contribute to and participate in,\u201d Zerpa said. \u201cIt is expected that there is going to be a lot of investment needed for reactivating the industry in Venezuela.\u201d\nSome prospective investors told The Washington Post that the economic opportunity for American firms in Venezuela right now could be the greatest windfall since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nVenezuela has the world\u2019s largest proven oil basin, but Venezuela needs a ton of new infrastructure to extract it profitably, such as new pipelines, better roads and seaports, which American firms could turbocharge. Analysts say Venezuela\u2019s production could easily be boosted by several hundred thousand barrels per day within the next 10 years with better infrastructure.\nZerpa thinks Venezuela sees the possible entrance of American firms into the market as a win-win. \u201cThere has been a decline in the industry,\u201d Zerpa said. \u201cWe have seen a decline in production.\u201d Money was diverted from the industry by former socialist President Hugo Chavez to pay for his revolution and other revolutions throughout Central and South America, not to grow the industry. \u201cIt was not coming back to the industry,\u201d Zerpa said.\nOil was politicized under Chavez, in other words, a trend that got even worse under Nicolas Maduro, the president who succeeded Chavez who was just ousted by Trump.\n\u201cUnder Hugo Chavez, the industry was producing about 3 million barrels a day, with plans to grow to 7,\u201d Zerpa added. \u201cBut now it is only producing about 1 million barrels.\u201d\nThe question for American investors, above all, is it safe to go in? Can Venezuela"

                "body": "Oil prices have recently pulled back after a surge driven by concerns over potential U.S. military action against Iran. Prior to this decline, both Brent and WTI crude reached their highest levels in several months, defying earlier pessimistic outlooks for the year and leaving traders caught between geopolitical tensions and underlying market fundamentals.\nMost analysts agree that the global supply of crude oil currently outpaces demand. Reflecting this, Goldman Sachs has recently lowered its price projections for 2026, anticipating even weaker Brent prices after last year\u2019s significant losses.\nAccording to Goldman, \u201cWith global oil inventories rising and a projected surplus of 2.3 million barrels per day in 2026, the market may need lower prices to slow non-OPEC supply growth and encourage stronger demand, unless major supply disruptions or OPEC cuts occur.\u201d This outlook persisted even as unrest in Iran was making headlines and temporarily boosting prices.\nThe United States\u2019 increasing involvement in Venezuela\u2019s oil sector has also weighed on prices. This week, U.S. officials confirmed the sale of an initial shipment of Venezuelan crude for $500 million, with further sales expected. While this development supports a bearish sentiment, industry leaders have cautioned that a rapid recovery in Venezuelan output is unlikely, tempering the market\u2019s reaction.\nRecent drone attacks on tankers in the Black Sea have reignited concerns about supply interruptions, adding to worries over possible disruptions in Iranian exports. Reports indicate that Kazakhstan\u2019s oil production dropped by 35% in the first half of January due to these attacks, which also targeted the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. In response, Kazakhstan has appealed to the U.S. and EU for assistance in safeguarding Black Sea oil shipments.\nThe European Union is reportedly preparing to further lower its price cap on Russian oil, aiming to reduce Moscow\u2019s energy revenues by linking Western insurance coverage to the cap. The new limit will be set at $44.10 per barrel starting next month. Although these measures have yet to significantly impact Russia\u2019s budget, the EU views them as a tool to pressure Russia economically amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nOne of the most bullish signals for oil in recent days came from former President Donald Trump, who suggested that military action against Iran was still on the table. However, this stance was quickly softened as the U.S. president noted a reduction in Iran\u2019s crackdown on protesters, making a strike less likely and prompting the recent price retreat\u2014reinforcing the prevailing narrative of oversupply.\nExpectations for continued growth in oil output remain strong, with both the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency forecasting further increases, even as OPEC maintains its production cuts from 2022. Nevertheless, U.S. shale producers have indicated dissatisfaction with WTI prices near $50, and the pace of production growth is slowing. The EIA\u2019s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook predicts that U.S. oil production will plateau this year and could decline through 2027.\nDespite this, the market seems to be overlooking the slowdown in U.S. output, focusing instead on the perception of a global oil surplus. Supporting this view, data from Kpler cited by the media shows that crude oil stored on tankers reached 1.3 billion barrels in December\u2014the highest since the pandemic lockdowns of 2020.\nReuters\u2019 Ron Bousso observed that a quarter of this seaborne oil comes from sanctioned countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. While these barrels take longer to find buyers, they eventually do, suggesting that tanker inventories may not accurately reflect a physical glut. Meanwhile, Chinese import figures reveal record-breaking oil purchases in both December and throughout 2025. Forecasting oil prices remains highly unpredictable, and the current environment is especially volatile as competing narratives shape"

Until that structure is either broken through or successfully defended, EUR/USD is expected to continue drifting lower. The chart shows weakness unfolding in stages, with only brief pullbacks expected. As long as price stays below recent swing highs, the bearish outlook stays intact.\n\u2b24 This matters for the broader market because EUR/USD often reflects shifting sentiment and directional conviction across major currencies.

The pressure is coming almost entirely from the USD side. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is sitting around 99.38, up 0.03% on the day and pressing a 99.25\u201399.50 resistance band after a clean upside sequence from late December. At the same time, the US 10-year yield has climbed to roughly 4.219%, almost 5 bps higher on the day and at levels not seen since September 2025. On the policy side, Fed funds sit around 3.75%, and rate-path probabilities show more than a 65% chance that the Federal Reserve keeps rates unchanged over the next three meetings through April 2026, with only about 43 bps of easing priced for the rest of 2026. That mix\u2014DXY near 99.5, 10-year yields above 4.2%, and a Fed priced as \u201con hold\u201d\u2014is exactly the environment where EUR/USD tends to grind lower rather than stage durable rallies.\nUS data pulse driving USD bid: jobs, inflation and production\nThe bid in USD is backed by specific numbers, not just narrative. Headline CPI is running at about 2.7% YoY, essentially unchanged from November, while PPI has accelerated to 3.0% YoY from 2.8%, signaling that pipeline price pressures are not disappearing. On the labor side, Initial Jobless Claims have dropped from 207k to 198k, and the Unemployment Rate has edged down to 4.4%, just below the Fed\u2019s own 4.5% projection. Nonfarm payrolls were described as solid, even if they slightly undershot forecasts. Industrial activity is also not collapsing: US Industrial Production rose 0.4% MoM in December versus expectations around 0.1%, reinforcing the idea that growth remains resilient. Put together, that data cluster explains why markets have cut back aggressive Fed-cut scenarios and why DXY is attempting to break higher from the 98.0\u201399.5 band. For EUR/USD, a macro backdrop where US inflation is 2.7\u20133.0%, unemployment 4.4%, and industrial output growing 0.4% is not one where the dollar typically softens meaningfully.\nEurozone side of EUR/USD: German HICP at 2.0% and ECB cut risk\nOn the EUR side, the tone is much softer. Germany\u2019s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose 0.2% MoM in December after a \u22120.5% fall in November, but the headline YoY rate dropped to 2.0% from 2.6%. That is exactly the ECB\u2019s target, and it confirms the broader Eurozone inflation deceleration, with the bloc\u2019s headline rate recently around 2.4%. At the same time, late-2025 business surveys showed manufacturing still in contraction, and growth momentum across the Euro Area remains fragile. The combination of German HICP at 2.0%, Eurozone inflation sliding, and weak manufacturing sets up the ECB to lean more dovish than the Fed. Market commentary is already talking about earlier ECB easing while the Fed stays neutral. That policy divergence is structurally negative for EUR/USD, because it anchors rate spreads and capital flows in favor of the USD, especially while US 10-year yields sit above 4.2% and the DXY creeps toward 100.00.\nShort-term tape for EUR/USD: defending 1.1580\u20131.1600, but bounces are sold\nPrice action in EUR/USD reflects this macro imbalance. The pair has already printed a year-to-date low at 1.1593, briefly slipping below 1.1600 before bouncing, but every rebound has been faded. Spot now sits almost exactly on the key 1.1580\u20131.1600 support band flagged by multiple desks. One analysis describes the weekly tone as a \u201ccon"

The Claimant Count numbers will give us an idea of how the job market is doing, and the Retail Sales and CPI numbers will be crucial for setting expectations for Bank of England rates. Markets will pay close attention to inflation data, especially for signs that prices are easing. Flash PMIs will give us a timely snapshot of business activity in key sectors later this week.\nOn the US side, investors are now looking at GDP, Core PCE, and Flash PMIs. The Fed still likes Core PCE as an inflation measure, and an unexpected rise could support the view that prices will remain high for a long time. GDP data will help us determine whether the recent strength is widespread or is slowing.\nIn general, GBP/USD is sliding lower unless UK data clearly beats expectations and US inflation signals weaken. The dollar is still in charge for now, especially given the world\u2019s greater uncertainty.\nGBP/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Make or Break at 100-MA\nGBP/USD is consolidating after a rejection from the 1.3550-1.3600 resistance zone, suggesting bullish momentum is fading. The price is below both the 20- and 50-day MA, which are flattening. This supports a neutral to mildly bearish bias. RSI is moving toward the middle line, indicating the market is consolidating rather than continuing its trend.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about tips for forex traders?

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Stuck Near 1.3380 As Strong US Data And DXY 99.5 Block A Break Above 1.3405\nSterling trades around 1.3380 under the 1.3405 200-day SMA as 2.7% US CPI, 3.0% PPI, 198K claims and a DXY move toward 99.5 slash Fed-cut bets, while markets still expect two BoE cuts in 2026 and wait for UK CPI and US Core PCE to decide the next leg | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Around 1.3380: Dollar Repricing Fed Cuts Versus Sterling Trying To Hold The Range\nUS Data, DXY Near 99.5 And The Policy Gap Behind GBP/USD\nThe key reason GBP/USD is parked around 1.3380 is the shift in expectations around the Federal Reserve, not domestic UK news. US inflation is sticky: headline CPI is running near 2.7% year-on-year, unchanged from the prior month, while PPI has accelerated to roughly 3.0% from 2.8%. The labor market adds to that story, with the latest Nonfarm Payrolls print showing around 215,000 new jobs versus expectations near 180,000, and unemployment at 4.4%, just under the Fed\u2019s 4.5% projection. Weekly jobless claims fell from 207,000 to 198,000, signaling fewer Americans filing for benefits. This mix of steady inflation and resilient employment has forced the market to scale back how much easing it expects from the Fed in 2026. Where traders recently priced around 60 basis points of cuts, they now see closer to 44 basis points for the year. That repricing pushed the US Dollar Index (DXY) higher again, back toward the 99.40\u201399.50 zone, with the major resistance band still sitting around 100.00\u2013100.20. In that environment, every attempt by GBP/USD to extend above 1.34 smacks into a firmer dollar.\nSterling Fundamentals: UK Growth Surprise Versus BoE Cut Expectations In GBP/USD\nOn the UK side, the backdrop is mixed but not catastrophic for GBP. Output for November 2025 came in stronger than expected, giving the British economy a modest upside surprise. That has allowed the Pound to outperform the EUR on some crosses. However, rate expectations dominate. Money markets still price at least two 25 bps cuts from the Bank of England during 2026, with implied odds near 90% for a first move by May. So while the UK data is not collapsing, the BoE is still treated as a central bank that will ease, whereas the Fed is being repriced toward fewer and later cuts. That relative policy path outweighs the growth surprise, which is why GBP can gain on the Euro yet fail to gain on the US Dollar.\nSpot Behavior: GBP/USD Capped Below 1.3405 And Anchored Around 1.3380\nRecent price action in GBP/USD is straightforward. During the latest North American session, the pair printed a high near 1.3413 before sliding back to roughly 1.3380. That leaves spot trading just under the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at 1.3405, a key trend filter for many participants. On the downside, the pair has been probing the same floor repeatedly, with a four-week low near 1.3360 and a broader support band between approximately 1.3353 and 1.3371. Each bounce from that area has been sold as soon as 1.3400\u20131.3410 comes into view. In practice, the market is treating 1.34 as a ceiling while the 1.3350\u20131.3370 region acts as a near-term floor, leaving GBP/USD boxed in a tight range below its 200-day average.\nRead More\n-\nSMH ETF Around $400: AI Memory Boom, Nvidia Pipeline And CHIPS Act Push ETF Toward $550\u2013$577\n17.01.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs XRPI And XRPR Draw $56.8M Weekly Inflows As XRP Stalls Around $2.08\n17.01.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas (NG=F) Hovers Near $3.01 As 45% Correction Meets $2.95\u2013$2.89 Support Zone\n17.01.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - USDJPY=X Around 158.00: Intervention Warnings And Election Moves Clash With A Wide Rate Gap\n17.01.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Structure In GBP/USD: Broken Trendline, Falling Wedge And Key Levels\nTechnically, GBP/USD has shifted from a constructive bias to a more cautious one.

                "body": "Equities Forecast for Next Week: SPX, Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000\nIndices Forecast\nDon\u2019t look now but the equity rally is broadening as small cap stocks, which couldn\u2019t quite keep pace with AI and large caps in general have very much led the way so far in early-2026 trade. Russell 2000 futures are up more than 7.8% so far through the first couple weeks of the year, and this compares to just over 1% in the Nasdaq and 1.4% in S&P 500 futures. That\u2019s not necessarily bad news, as it could be illustrative of a hunt for value as markets price-in fiscal stimulus set to come online this year from President Trump\u2019s Big Beautiful Bill. But the fact that high-flying AI stocks that have been such a large focal point for most of the past three years are losing favor is something that could, potentially, become notable before too long.\nAt this stage, however, that is highly speculative as all that we\u2019ve seen from buyers is continued support and a response to pullbacks. Another showed this week in the S&P 500, and this keeps bulls in-control of near-term price action. But, it does highlight a possible source of fragility that could soon come into play down-the-road if the shoe drops on inflation and pushes the Fed away from 2026 rate cuts.\nAs I looked at in the 2026 forecast for equities, there\u2019s no sign yet that buyers are ready to relinquish the reigns and with a potent combination of President Trump pushing fiscal stimulus (and pumping markets via social media) to go along with a Federal Reserve that seems almost afraid to move out of tune from what the President wants, there remains an open backdrop for continued strength in equities.\nThe challenge at this point is strategy, as chasing fresh highs and just hoping it works out could be a lackluster way of approaching the matter. Pullbacks, however, with shows of support, similar to what showed last week or, bigger picture, back in April of last year, could be a much more attractive way to go about it. Unfortunately, for that, patience is required, and that\u2019s seemingly the challenge point for many traders.\nRussell 2000\nSmall cap stocks were largely left behind when equity rallies kicked into gear in 2023, and to a lesser degree, in 2024. It was the 2460 level that the Russell 2000 just could not take out and that held two different resistance tests in 2021 and then three years later in 2024.\nFor last year, there was about three months of struggle at that price until buyers ultimately prevailed, finally beginning to take control in late-2025 trade which has led into the sizable rally so far to start this year.\nAt this point, price has already pushed up to the 127.2% Fibonacci extension of last year\u2019s pullback and this is a tough area to chase, highlighting a couple of key spots of support to look for pullbacks.\nRussell 2000 Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nRussell 2000 Structure\nFrom the daily chart there\u2019s two different spots of prior resistance that stand out as higher-low support potential, with 2605 nearby and 2556 just below that, with each functioning as an \u2018s1\u2019 and \u2018s2,\u2019 respectively. For \u2018s3,\u2019 it\u2019s the same resistance that was such a big deal for the past five years, spanning from 2460 up to around the 2500 level which was the last higher-low before the current breakout.\nA pullback to that \u2018s3\u2019 zone can keep the door open for bulls, but if we see failure there, that\u2019s when the broader breakout is going to look as though it had also failed. But, as the old saying goes, it\u2019s support until it\u2019s not.\nRussell 2000 Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nSPX\nThe shorter-term problem that shows in the Russell above has a much larger role in the S&P 500 below, as prices have only continued to grind into a tighter and tighter range with a long-term ascending wedge building. These are bearish reversal formations and it was the underside of support that was in-play last week to help hold the lows.\nThese formations are i"

On the upside, above 0.6765 will resume the whole rise from 0.5913 and target 61.8% projection of 0.5913 to 0.6706 from 0.6420 at 0.6910. However, considering bearish divergence condition in 4H MACD, firm break of 0.6659 will confirm short term topping, and bring deeper correction back to 55 D EMA (now at 0.6627) and below.\nIn the bigger picture, current development argues that rise from 0.5913 (2024 low) is reversing whole down trend from 0.8006 (2021 high). Further rally should be seen to 61.8% retracement of 0.8006 to 0.5913 at 0.7206. This will remain the favored case as long as 0.6420 support holds, even in case of deep pullback.\nIn the long term picture, rise from 0.5913 is tentatively seen as the third leg of the pattern from 0.5506 (2020 low). Sustained trading above 55 M EMA (now at 0.6711) will solidify this medium term bullish case. It\u2019s still early to judge if this is an impulsive or corrective pattern. But in either case, firm break of 0.6941 will open up further rise back to 0.8006. However, rejection by the 55 M EMA will retain bearishness and bring another fall through 0.5913."

The pair briefly pushed above 159.00 and then faded, ending the week roughly 0.4% lower as Japanese officials escalated warnings and markets priced a higher probability of direct intervention. On the Dollar side, fundamentals remain strong: weekly Initial Jobless Claims have dropped to 198,000, the lowest since November, Retail Sales are up 0.6% month-on-month, and futures now discount only around 45 basis points of Fed cuts for 2026. The US Dollar Index sits near 99.30, a monthly high, but the heat map shows the Dollar down around 0.41% versus the Yen on the day, even as it holds gains against currencies like AUD and CAD. That combination\u2014solid US data, a firm DXY near 99.30, but USD/JPY slipping back to 158.00\u2014underlines that this pair is being driven less by marginal US surprises and more by a deliberate policy and political shift in Tokyo.\nJapan\u2019s Yield Curve And Reflation Push As The Main Driver Of USD/JPY\nThe clearest structural anchor for USD/JPY now sits in the Japanese bond market. Correlation analysis over the past fortnight and quarter shows coefficients above 0.80 between USD/JPY and Japan\u2019s 2s10s curve, meaning the spread between ten-year and two-year JGB yields is dominating direction. The curve has steepened as markets price a reflation strategy under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is prepared to finance growth and inflation with more government debt issuance. Two-year JGB yields have moved above roughly 1.20%, while the ten-year threatens to break through 2.20%, levels that would have been unthinkable in the negative-rate era. Rising yields at the long end imply expectations that inflation will erode the Yen\u2019s purchasing power over time, and that the Bank of Japan will eventually need to tighten further. At the same time, the move higher in short-dated yields confirms that the old \u201cpermanent zero\u201d narrative on Japanese rates is gone. This structural shift is one reason USD/JPY has stayed elevated all the way into the high 150s, even when US data have been mixed.\nFed Pricing, DXY Near 99.30 And The Dollar Side Of The USD/JPY Equation\nOn the US side, USD/JPY remains backed by a wide policy gap. The federal funds rate stands near 3.5%, while the BoJ policy rate is only 0.75%, leaving a spread of around 275 basis points in favor of the Dollar. Futures markets now price fewer than two full 25-basis-point cuts from the Fed in 2026, roughly 45 basis points, compared with much more aggressive easing expectations late last year. That hawkish repricing has helped push the DXY back toward the 99.30 area, a monthly high, and the daily strength of the Dollar versus currencies such as AUD, CAD and NZD confirms that the Dollar story is not weak. However, the same daily performance table shows the Yen outperforming almost every G10 peer: USD/JPY is down roughly 0.4% on the day while USD gains or holds flat elsewhere. In other words, the Dollar is not the problem for USD/JPY bulls; Japan is.\nMacro Calendar: Inflation Week, Davos Signals And A Low-Drama BoJ Decision\nThe coming week brings a heavy macro calendar, but most of the scheduled events are more relevant for broad risk sentiment than for the core USD/JPY trend.

                "body": "USD/JPY extended its winning streak to three weeks in the week ending January 16. Strong US economic data sank bets on a March Fed rate cut, increasing demand for the US dollar. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s plans for a snap election and fiscal spending weighed on demand for the yen.\nThe USD/JPY pair briefly fell to a January 12 low of 157.515 before rising to a January 14 high of 159.453. A pullback from the mid-week high, amid intervention jitters, left USD/JPY up 0.09% to 158.066 at Friday\u2019s close.\nDespite the USD/JPY gains, rising bets on multiple BoJ rate hikes support a bearish short- to medium-term price outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, we examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nIn the week ahead, several Japanese economic indicators will influence sentiment toward the BoJ policy stance. Key indicators include machinery orders, trade data, inflation figures, and private sector PMIs.\nGiven the BoJ\u2019s focus on the effect of US tariffs on external demand and price trends, the trade and inflation figures are likely to be key to the bearish price outlook.\nStronger-than-expected inflation and robust demand for Japanese goods would raise expectations of a second-quarter BoJ rate hike.\nWhile the upcoming economic data will influence demand for the yen, the Bank of Japan\u2019s monetary policy decision will be the main event for the week. Economists expect the BoJ to keep interest rates at 0.75% on Friday, January 23. However, the BoJ\u2019s concerns about a weaker yen pushing import prices higher may bring forward plans to tighten monetary policy.\nSignals for an April rate hike and a cut to purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) would boost demand for the yen. The prospects of narrower US-Japan rate differentials would likely send USD/JPY lower, supporting the bearish outlook.\nThe BoJ\u2019s Quarterly Outlook Report will give insights into policymakers\u2019 views on the economy and prices. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda previously hinted at further rate hikes if the economy and prices aligned with the Bank\u2019s forecasts.\nRobin Brooks, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, commented on the yen\u2019s weakness and JGB purchases, stating:\n\u201cJapan\u2019s Yen devaluation will get worse before it gets better. Best way to see that is current threats to intervene in the Yen to stop its fall, which illustrates the scale of denial in Japan. Such intervention can\u2019t work as long as BoJ is buying JGBs\u2026\u201d\nAnother key announcement could be the Bank of Japan\u2019s neutral rate, neither accommodative nor restrictive. A hawkish neutral rate (potentially 1.5% \u2013 2%) would signal multiple BoJ rate hikes, sending USD/JPY sharply lower. Importantly, a higher neutral rate and surging Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields could trigger a yen carry trade unwind. An unwind would mirror price trends in mid-2024, when the BoJ cut JGB purchases and raised rates.\nFollow real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nWhile the BoJ\u2019s policy stance remains key, political developments are likely to continue influencing demand for the yen.\nThis month, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi hinted at a snap election, sending USD/JPY to the January 14 high of 159.453. Uncertainty about the election result and concerns about Takaichi\u2019s fiscal spending plans weighed on demand for the yen.\nFor context, USD/JPY has gained 7.2% since Takaichi won the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race. Takaichi\u2019s support for loose monetary policy and fiscal spending weakened the yen.\nDespite the political headwinds for the yen, a more hawkish BoJ policy stance would support the cautiously bearish short-term and positive medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nAs markets consider the BoJ\u2019s policy outlook and Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s election plans, US economic data will influence demand for the US dollar.\nThe weekly ADP employment and jobless claims figures will give insights into the labor mar"

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president expects credit card providers to adhere to the 10% cap, but did not specify any penalties for noncompliance.\n\u201cI can\u2019t outline any particular consequences at this time, but this is both an expectation and a firm demand from the president,\u201d Leavitt said on Friday.\nResearch conducted during Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign suggested that capping credit card interest rates at 10% could save Americans approximately $100 billion in annual interest payments. While the credit card industry would experience significant losses, the research indicated it would remain profitable, though rewards programs and perks might be reduced. The administration has highlighted these findings on official White House social media channels.\nBanking industry lobbyists have spent the past week trying to decipher the White House\u2019s next steps, but remain uninformed. Although both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have introduced bills to cap interest rates in recent years, Republican leaders in Congress have shown little enthusiasm for advancing such legislation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted after the 2008 financial crisis, specifically bars at least one federal banking regulator from imposing interest rate limits on loans.\nIn the absence of new laws or executive orders, Trump may rely on public and political pressure to push the credit card industry to comply, a tactic he has used with other sectors. For instance, he previously called on pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices, resulting in some companies pledging to do so. He also urged technology and chip manufacturers, including Apple, to expand domestic production, leading to new commitments for U.S.-based manufacturing.\nMajor financial institutions are reluctant to enter into open conflict with the White House, especially since the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory policies have largely benefited them. The \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d signed into law in July, introduced another round of tax cuts, and deregulation has encouraged increased dealmaking, boosting investment banking profits.\nBanking executives and lobbyists have responded to the proposed cap in two ways: they have opposed the cap while also expressing willingness to collaborate with the administration.\nDuring a press call on Tuesday, Jeffrey Barnum, Chief Financial Officer of JPMorgan, signaled that the industry would use all available resources to resist the administration\u2019s efforts to impose a cap. JPMorgan, one of the largest credit card issuers in the country, manages $239.4 billion in card balances and partners with major brands like United Airlines and Amazon. The bank also recently acquired the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs.\nCitigroup\u2019s CFO Mark Mason told reporters on Wednesday that the proposed cap \u201cis not something we could or would support,\u201d arguing it would limit consumer access to credit and negatively impact the economy. However, Mason acknowledged the importance of affordability and expressed interest in working with the administration to find solutions.\nTrump has also backed legislation in Congress that could reduce the fees banks collect from merchants when customers use credit cards.\nSome companies are not waiting for further action from the administration. Fintech firm Bilt recently introduced a new line of credit cards, promising to limit interest rates to 10% on new purchases for the first year. While this is essentially a promotional offer similar t"

Strong US economic data sank bets on a March Fed rate cut, increasing demand for the US dollar. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s plans for a snap election and fiscal spending weighed on demand for the yen.\nThe USD/JPY pair briefly fell to a January 12 low of 157.515 before rising to a January 14 high of 159.453. A pullback from the mid-week high, amid intervention jitters, left USD/JPY up 0.09% to 158.066 at Friday\u2019s close.\nDespite the USD/JPY gains, rising bets on multiple BoJ rate hikes support a bearish short- to medium-term price outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, we examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nIn the week ahead, several Japanese economic indicators will influence sentiment toward the BoJ policy stance.

Economists expect the BoJ to keep interest rates at 0.75% on Friday, January 23. However, the BoJ\u2019s concerns about a weaker yen pushing import prices higher may bring forward plans to tighten monetary policy.\nSignals for an April rate hike and a cut to purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) would boost demand for the yen. The prospects of narrower US-Japan rate differentials would likely send USD/JPY lower, supporting the bearish outlook.\nThe BoJ\u2019s Quarterly Outlook Report will give insights into policymakers\u2019 views on the economy and prices. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda previously hinted at further rate hikes if the economy and prices aligned with the Bank\u2019s forecasts.\nRobin Brooks, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, commented on the yen\u2019s weakness and JGB purchases, stating:\n\u201cJapan\u2019s Yen devaluation will get worse before it gets better.

Importantly, a higher neutral rate and surging Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields could trigger a yen carry trade unwind. An unwind would mirror price trends in mid-2024, when the BoJ cut JGB purchases and raised rates.\nFollow real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nWhile the BoJ\u2019s policy stance remains key, political developments are likely to continue influencing demand for the yen.\nThis month, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi hinted at a snap election, sending USD/JPY to the January 14 high of 159.453.

On the downside, below 1.3883 minor support will turn intraday bias neutral first.\nIn the bigger picture, price actions from 1.4791 are seen as a corrective pattern to the whole up trend from 1.2005 (2021 low). Deeper fall could be seen as the pattern extends, and break of 1.3538 will target 61.8% retracement of 1.2005 to 1.4791 at 1.3069.

However, considering bearish divergence condition M MACD, sustained trading below 55 M EMA will argue that the up trend has completed with five waves up to 1.4791, and turn medium term outlook bearish for correction to 38.2% retracement of 0.9056 to 1.4791 at 1.2600."

                "body": "- The GBP/USD weekly forecast edges down, as the pair closed the week below 1.3400 amid upbeat US data and risk-off sentiment.\n- Markets await key data from both sides to gauge a fresh directional move.\n- Technically, the price is leaning to the downside, eyeing 1.3200 if downside pressure sustains.\nGBP/USD closed last week on the defensive below 1.3400, paring weekly gains despite a mildly positive data surprise from the UK. The release of UK GDP m/m showed modest growth, but the data failed to trigger sustained buying interest in sterling.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about crypto signals? Check our detailed guide-\nMarkets mainly interpreted the improvement as technical rather than structural, which aligns with the assumption that UK growth is sluggish when money is tight. GBP bulls were uncertain; therefore, the rising momentum faded.\nThe dollar has better fundamentals in the US. Producer Price Index, Retail Sales, and Initial Jobless Claims all exceeded expectations, indicating a healthy US economy. These disclosures lowered expectations that the Fed would cut rates soon, raising Treasury yields and strengthening the dollar.\nA defensive bid for the dollar followed increased geopolitical concerns over Iran, which made people less risk-taking. This accelerated GBP/USD\u2019s decline at week\u2019s end.\nGBP/USD Key Events Next Week\nThe next week will be full of important UK data releases that could set the pound\u2019s course in the near future. The Claimant Count numbers will give us an idea of how the job market is doing, and the Retail Sales and CPI numbers will be crucial for setting expectations for Bank of England rates. Markets will pay close attention to inflation data, especially for signs that prices are easing. Flash PMIs will give us a timely snapshot of business activity in key sectors later this week.\nOn the US side, investors are now looking at GDP, Core PCE, and Flash PMIs. The Fed still likes Core PCE as an inflation measure, and an unexpected rise could support the view that prices will remain high for a long time. GDP data will help us determine whether the recent strength is widespread or is slowing.\nIn general, GBP/USD is sliding lower unless UK data clearly beats expectations and US inflation signals weaken. The dollar is still in charge for now, especially given the world\u2019s greater uncertainty.\nGBP/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Make or Break at 100-MA\nGBP/USD is consolidating after a rejection from the 1.3550-1.3600 resistance zone, suggesting bullish momentum is fading. The price is below both the 20- and 50-day MA, which are flattening. This supports a neutral to mildly bearish bias. RSI is moving toward the middle line, indicating the market is consolidating rather than continuing its trend.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about tips for forex traders? Check our detailed guide-\nThe 100-day MA near 1.3360 is a key support level. If the market closes below this level every day, it will open up to 1.3250-1.3200. On the upside, 1.3450-1.3500 is immediate resistance, followed by 1.3600. If the price breaks through this level, it will gain momentum toward 1.3750.\nLooking to trade forex now?

Since they invest in the same thing, you almost need to split hairs to find a differentiator.\nWith Bitcoin ETFs, it all comes down to cost.\n10 stocks we like better than Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust \u203a\nIt's been a tumultuous year for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which ultimately produced a lot of volatility but nothing in the way of returns. After such a strong multiyear rally, a year \"off\" to digest gains and stabilize a bit is probably a good thing. But as we move forward into 2026, it's time to revisit the investment case again.\nBitcoin has, in my opinion, gone from alternative asset class to necessary portfolio allocation. In the same way we talk about stocks, bonds, gold, and real estate in a diversified portfolio, we should be adding Bitcoin to the discussion. Based on how the crypto market has evolved and the tailwinds of decentralization and AI development behind it, now's the time to look at building up Bitcoin positions again.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWith nearly a dozen different Bitcoin ETFs to choose from all essentially doing the same thing, the differentiator is cost. All invest in spot Bitcoin, so it makes sense to choose the one that lets you do it the cheapest.\nThe most popular Bitcoin ETF by a wide margin is the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT) with more than $70 billion in assets under management. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, it's certainly a defensible choice. For my money, the one I'd load up on is the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (NYSEMKT: BTC). It's got the lowest expense ratio in the group at just 0.15%. Plus, it's more than liquid enough that you don't get dinged on spreads when trading it.\nIt may not necessarily be the most popular Bitcoin ETF, but it will probably be the one producing the best returns over the long term.\nAdvertisement\nShould you buy stock in Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

                "body": "The Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) $98K breakout just changed the market structure. Bitcoin broke above $95,000 resistance and briefly touched $98,000 this week after spending weeks stuck in a tight range. The move puts all eyes on the $94,500 to $96,000 zone\u2014what was resistance is now the line that separates continuation from consolidation.\nBullish catalysts are also aligning: Bitcoin ETF inflows have surged past $1.7 billion in the past week, exchange balances keep falling toward multi-year lows, and momentum indicators are rebuilding. The question now is whether Bitcoin can hold strength above $95,000 or needs to pause before another leg higher. How this plays out shapes expectations for a potential run toward $100,000.\nBitcoin Breaks Two-Week $95K Resistance, Briefly Touches $98K\nBitcoin finally punched through a ceiling that had rejected it for two weeks. The breakout above $94,500 triggered a fast push toward $98,000 on January 14, with spot buyers stepping in near $94,000 and forcing shorts to cover. Volume expanded during the move\u2014and this looked like conviction rather than a thin liquidity spike.\nThe structure of the breakout matters. The Bitcoin price printed higher highs above the previous $97,000 cap while momentum cooled into neutral territory instead of flashing exhaustion. That combination suggests sellers are getting absorbed rather than buyers chasing late.\nFor now, sellers have lost control around key levels. If follow-through buying holds, this move reshapes short-term structure and keeps upside momentum intact.\nWhy the $94,500 to $96,000 Support Determines the Path to $100K\nThe market has drawn a clear line. The $94,500 to $96,000 zone flipped from repeated rejection area into a base where buyers are actively defending. This range overlaps with heavy volume accumulation and short-term holder cost levels\u2014price points that often act as make-or-break zones for trend continuation.\nHolding here keeps the Bitcoin $98K breakout structure intact and preserves the path toward $100,000. Each successful retest of this zone chips away at nearby sell pressure and builds confidence among spot buyers. When the Bitcoin price holds above a former ceiling, it signals acceptance of higher valuations.\nThe structural dynamics mirror what we\u2019ve seen in previous Bitcoin cycle breakouts. Losing this level changes things quickly. A break below $94,500 opens the door to deeper liquidity near $90,000 and $88,000, shifting the picture from extension back to consolidation.\nWhat Drove Bitcoin Out of the $90K to $95K Consolidation Range\nBitcoin\u2019s escape from the $90,000 to $95,000 consolidation range came from steady spot demand, not leverage-fueled speculation. Large ETF inflows flipped market structure as institutions absorbed available supply. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust led the way, pulling in more than $648 million in a single day on January 15\u2014and that demand removed the sell pressure that had capped the Bitcoin price for weeks.\nExchange balances kept falling at the same time. Holders moved coins into long-term storage, reducing liquidity on trading platforms. Supply on exchanges has dropped to roughly 1.8 million BTC\u2014the lowest since 2017, according to CryptoQuant and Glassnode data. Fewer coins sitting on exchanges means the Bitcoin price moves easier once buying picks up.\nMacro sentiment helped too. Cooling inflation data and stable funding rates eased risk concerns. As confidence improved, capital flowed back into crypto and pushed Bitcoin through the $95K resistance break with conviction rather than a short-lived squeeze.\nTom Lee\u2019s January ATH Prediction Gains Traction Near $96K\nTom Lee\u2019s call for Bitcoin to clear its previous all-time high of $126,000 is looking more credible after this breakout. With price stabilizing near $96,000, the math behind a push toward $126,000 looks less aggressive than it did two weeks ago.\nLee told CNBC on January 6 that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high by the end of January 2026.

With assets under management now standing at roughly $2.64 billion, the latest flow represents about 0.26% of the fund\u2019s AUM, suggesting investors are adding selectively rather than rushing in en masse.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading around $95,188.23. Despite that elevated price level, bitcoin has shed roughly 11.0% over the past three months, underscoring the choppy consolidation phase that has followed its previous rallies. Short-term signals are more constructive, however, with the one-day technical outlook flashing a cautious positive bias at Buy.\nThe combination of negative three-month performance and fresh ETF inflows suggests that some investors view the recent pullback as an opportunity rather than a warning sign. BITO\u2019s latest intake, while small in percentage terms, may reflect a rotation toward regulated, exchange-listed vehicles as market participants navigate volatility and uncertainty around future policy and macro data. If bitcoin stabilizes or resumes an uptrend, the fund\u2019s ability to attract incremental capital on downswings could prove an important barometer of risk appetite in the broader digital-asset complex.\nFor a more detailed analysis and real-time sentiment trends, check the live cryptocurrency prices here."

Instead of swinging tools, modern investors stake to participate in network security and, in turn, share in yield.\nFrom modest balances to seven-figure treasuries, pooled validators remove heavy upfront requirements. By joining a collective, you skip running your own hardware and still gain exposure to validator activity through shared stake.\nNewcomers with 0.1 ETH and whales alike convert idle balances into passive flow. If you want a quick tour of standout options, the following pools illustrate where staking can scale over the coming years.\nTop Ethereum Staking Pools for Liquid Staking\nLeading Ethereum pools make it simple to stake, increase liquidity, and plug into DeFi. They streamline participation, align with best practices, and optimize returns for a broad spectrum of users.\nOrigin Ether\nOrigin Ether has built a reputation for steady, long-horizon rewards and lets you contribute any amount of ETH. The OETH pool runs on open code, has undergone extensive audits, and offers a live bug bounty; it also meshes neatly with major DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems.\nInstead of friction, you get a smooth path to stake and receive OETH, a liquid token mirroring your position. Features such as an Automated Redemption Manager and integrated yield strategies with external protocols aim to lift performance. The design prioritizes implementation quality, client diversity, trustless mechanics, and permissionless node participation.\nStakeWise\nStakeWise focuses on making ETH participation rewarding and approachable. Nearly 78,000 users have entrusted roughly 311.75k ETH, and over 25k ETH in cumulative rewards has been distributed. Your position is represented by osETH, a liquid staking token that reflects growth as earnings accrue.\nYou can stake any ETH amount and unstake whenever you choose, benefiting from non-custodial control. Audits from firms like SigmaPrime and Halborn bolster confidence. The protocol\u2019s pool is permissionless, open-source, backed by bug bounties, and architected for resilient execution and consensus.\nRocket Pool\nRocket Pool operates as a decentralized ETH staking protocol where you can begin from about 0.01 ETH and exit without a lockup. The indicative APR sits near two and a half percent, with more than 648,000 ETH staked, 4,005+ node operators, and coverage across 151-plus regions.\nRewards flow through rETH, a liquid representation that you can swap when needed. Governance is handled by a network DAO using RPL, while audits, an open codebase, and permissionless node onboarding support decentralization. Emphasis on client and consensus diversity further strengthens resilience.\nLido\nLido is widely recognized for simplifying Ethereum participation, offering an open framework for decentralized stake. Third-party audits and continuous code reviews reinforce security; industry trackers rank it as the largest ETH staking venue.\nWith stETH, a liquid token that credits rewards daily, users gain flexibility across DeFi while keeping funds productive. A broad set of professional node operators improves execution and consensus diversity.\nLido assesses a 10% fee on earned yield, split between operators and the DAO treasury. Users holding stETH have historically seen an APR around 3.6%, and the protocol has distributed rewards totaling roughly $950 million.\nStafi\nStafi leans into AI-driven automation to make staking more accessible and efficient for every type of participant. The approach helps users act on insights and streamline decisions without deep technical overhead.\nStarting from 0.01 ETH, participants can use friendly browser GUIs. The protocol is open-source, independently reviewed, and issues rETH as a liquid reward token. With strong client and consensus diversity plus a bug bounty, Stafi underscores reliability and security.\nB"

SOL has formed an ascending wedge since the start of the month, a pattern that often precedes a pullback.\nDespite strong investor participation, the setup suggests a potential dip that could undermine recent bullish efforts.\nSolana Holders Counter Each Other\nOn-chain activity shows strong network growth. Since the beginning of the month, the number of addresses conducting transactions on Solana has surged sharply. At its peak, more than 8 million new addresses joined the network within a single 24-hour period.\nSponsoredThis increase signals substantial demand for SOL. New addresses typically bring fresh capital, boosting liquidity and network usage. Such growth reflects Solana\u2019s expanding ecosystem appeal, driven by DeFi activity, memecoins, and high-throughput applications attracting new participants.\nWant more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya\u2019s Daily Crypto Newsletter here.\nDespite rising network adoption, macro momentum tells a different story. Exchange position change data indicates existing holders are exerting a stronger influence on price action. Buying pressure from long-term participants has weakened, offsetting the impact of new capital inflows.\nAs buying momentum fades, selling pressure is beginning to dominate. This shift suggests that established SOL holders are reducing exposure or preparing to sell. When legacy supply outweighs new demand, price weakness often follows, increasing the probability of a breakdown from the current structure.\nSOL Price Is Looking at a Correction\nSolana price trades near $144 at the time of writing, moving within an ascending wedge formed over recent days. This bearish continuation pattern projects a potential 9.5% decline, placing the downside target near $129 if the structure resolves lower.\nThe projected drop aligns with weakening momentum indicators. A confirmed breakdown would likely push SOL toward $136 initially. Losing that support would expose the $130 level, where buyers may attempt to stabilize the price amid broader market caution.\nStill, the bearish scenario is not guaranteed. If investor sentiment improves and selling pressure eases, SOL could rebound from the wedge\u2019s lower trend line. A move above $146 would signal renewed strength. Further upside could carry Solana toward $151, invalidating the bearish outlook."

This growth will enable the currency of attention economy to access the high liquidity and low-cost environment in Solana, leaving behind its former monopoly of the Ethereum-based Base network.\nThe shift arrives when SocialFi platforms grow more interested in finding the means to avoid the unpleasant experience of high gas fees and slow settlement time. This landing on Solana places Zora in a position to manage the large number of micro-transactions users need to make in order to trade/buy composer coins or tip their content.\nTable of Contents\nAnother Chapter of Creator Assets\nThe switch to Solana was not a token bridge. The team is making use of what they refer to as NEAR Intents so that they make it easier to the end-user. In contrast to struggling with the classical cross-chain bridges, which can be a nightmare to non-technical users, this design makes swops one-click. In effect you can transfer ZORA to a Phantom or Solflare wallet without waiting time or the associated complicated procedures.\nIt is an obvious retail market competition. Over the past year, Solana has experienced a huge influx of active users, and Zora is eager to ensure that the latter could be able to trade content-backed tokens as easily as meme coins. The fundamental architectural design of the protocol entails converting all social media posts into tradeable assets, and that needs the chain that does not shut its eyes at several thousands transactions per second.\nRead More: Base\u2013Solana Bridge Goes Live with Chainlink CCIP, Unlocking Massive Cross-Chain Liquidity\nLiquidity and Market Positioning\nThe Solana launch comes after the Zora treasury has aggressively liquidity-built over time. At the end of last year, the project put millions in liquidity pools to stabilize the trading environment of the token. The next logical step of that strategy is to bring the asset to Solana to offer the secondary venue of price discovery and make the token available to a community with a high level of on-chain activity.\nSpeed and Technical Infrastructure\nThe architecture of Solana fits quite well the task that Zora is attempting. Since the Zora platform generates a new liquidity pool each time a single post or creator coin is issued, the proliferation of the pools will become arduous on slower networks. The fee of interacting with such pools is insignificant on Solana, which is essential in a platform in which a like or a share could be a financial operation.\nThe protocol has experienced a substantial volume on its original Base integration with more than 1.7 million creator coins minted by the conclusion of 2025. Nevertheless, the Solana migration implies that the team is not satisfied with remaining in the ecosystem supported by Coinbase. They are following the users wherever they are the most active.\nRead More: Morgan Stanley Files First-Ever Bitcoin and Solana ETFs, Opening Wall Street\u2019s Gates to Crypto\nThe success of such a move will probably be determined by the success with which the Solana community embraces the idea of content coins as it is in the case of Zora. Although the chain is known as being highly speculative in energy, Zora is placing a bet that users will desire to invest such capital in creators and to bet on the trendiness of digital media.\nThe token ZORA itself remains the main utility asset of the ecosystem."

                "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks edged a bit lower on Wall Street Friday as the first week of corporate earnings season ended with markets trading near record levels.\nThe wobbly day for stocks closed out a week of similar movements for major indexes amid profit reports from banks and updates on inflation.\nThe S&P 500 fell 4.46 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,940.01. It is sitting just below its record, which was set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 83.11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 49,359.33. The Nasdaq composite fell 14.63 points, or 0.1 percent, to 23,515.39. Each index notched weekly losses.\nSmaller company stocks fared better. The Russell 2000 eked out a 0.1 percent, while also notching a 2 percent gain for the week.\nTechnology stocks were the strongest forces behind the market's moves throughout most of the day. Several big technology stocks made strong gains and helped offset losses elsewhere.\nBroadcom rose 2.5 percent and Micron Technology rose 7.8 percent. The semiconductor companies are among several Big Tech companies with outsized valuations that often push the market higher or lower.\nA handful of regional U.S. banks reported their earnings following mixed reports from their larger peers. Pittsburgh's PNC jumped 3.8 percent after it beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter targets, but Regions Financial fell 2.6 percent after reporting results that missed forecasts.\nOutside of the banking sector, transport company J.B. Hunt Transport Services fell 1 percent after reporting mixed quarterly financial results.\nThe latest round of earnings updates from companies could help give Wall Street a better sense of how consumers are spending their money and how businesses are operating amid economic concerns brought on by inflation and tariffs. Results from the technology sector are being scrutinized by investors trying to figure out whether the high stock prices fueled by the craze around artificial intelligence are justified.\n\"Despite the strong start to 2026, we would not be surprised if markets experience volatility in the coming weeks as fourth quarter earnings progress and the threat of escalating geopolitical tensions remains,\" wrote Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, in a note to investors.\nWall Street will have a broader mix of earnings to review next week, coming from airlines, industrial companies, and technology companies. United Airlines, 3M, and Intel are all scheduled to release their quarterly earnings results next week.\nCrude oil prices rose after dropping sharply on Thursday. The price of U.S. crude oil rose 0.4 percent to $59.44 and the price of Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.6 percent to $64.13. Oil prices have been volatile amid widespread protests in Iran against that country's leadership and President Donald Trump's warnings that the U.S. \"will come to their rescue.\"\nGold prices, which have also been volatile this week, fell. Prices for the precious metal, often viewed as a safe haven amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty, fell 0.6 percent, but are still up more than 5 percent so far in January.\nTreasury yields moved higher in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23 percent from 4.17 percent late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, rose to 3.60 percent from 3.57 percent late Thursday.\nThe Fed's next policy meeting on interest rates is in two weeks, and Wall Street is betting that it will maintain its current benchmark interest rate. The central bank is trying to balance a slowing jobs market with stubbornly high inflation. Updates on inflation this week showed that prices remain above the Fed's 2 percent goal.\nThe U.S. central bank will get one more update on inflation next week when the government releases the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE. It is the Fed's preferred measure for inflation.\nEuropean markets fell, and markets"

It set a new all-time record reaching 10,046 points before dropping back and closing the day at 9951.\nDespite much talk of high stock valuations in the US over the past year, the London index outperformed the major American indexes in 2025.\nShares in British brands such as Currys and Next rose steeply alongside gains for precious metal miners, defence and financial services companies.\nThe FTSE 100 tracks the performance of the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nA big rise is good news for investors, including anyone with a pension or other savings that are invested in the stock market, but is not a direct measure of the UK economy's performance.\nMany of the constituent companies have large overseas operations as well as a UK presence, and around three quarters of the revenues of the FTSE 100 firms is generated abroad.\nIn 2025 rising gold and silver prices boosted firms such as Rio Tinto, while increased global defence spending lifted contractors including Babcock and Rolls-Royce - amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.\nThe British benchmark index set a new all-time intraday record as trading resumed after the new year holiday, rising more than 1% within the first hour to reach 10,046 points - up 115 from its previous level, before falling back below the threshold.\nThe brief episode of trade above 10,000 followed twelve months of staggered rises.\nSusannah Streeter, an independent financial commentator, said the 10,000-point marker was \"a psychologically important milestone\" and showed London's blue-chip index was \"back in favour\" with investors.\n\"Concerns continue to swirl about the super-high valuation of US tech sector,\" she said, making the UK market more appealing.\nAdvertisement\nDan Coatsworth, head of markets at investment platform AJ Bell, said crossing the 10,000-point was a New Year's gift for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who has been calling for more investment in the UK share market to boost economic growth.\n\"She has been banging the drum about the merits of investing over parking cash in the bank.\n\"The FTSE 100's achievements just go to show what's possible when buying UK shares,\" he said.\nWhile London-quoted companies were sometimes considered \"old and boring\", the mix of industries, including mining and banking, appealed to investors seeking stability during uncertain times, he said.\n\"Investors often seek solace in companies whose goods and services should be in demand no matter what's happening in the world.\n\"For example, we all need to pay insurance or water bills, or those in the habit are still likely to buy cigarettes or vapes, and the FTSE 100 has plenty of companies playing on these themes on offer.\"\nGreggs set to raise prices again in response to cost pressures, says CEO\nGuinness maker appoints former Tesco boss to stem flagging sales\nThe chancellor said the FTSE's break-through was \"a vote of confidence in Britain's economy and a strong start to 2026\".\nThe FTSE index, which is dominated by large international companies, closed 2025 at 9,931, after repeatedly hitting record highs during the year.\nAlthough it is often seen as a measure of Britain's corporate strength, the FTSE 100 largely reflects global business activity because most of its companies earn a significant share of their revenues overseas rather than from the UK economy.\nIts rise follows a global trend, which has seen stock markets surge over the expectation that artificial intelligence (AI) will boost company earnings.\nHowever, some experts have warned that if high hopes for AI are not realised, or do not appear quickly enough, that enthusiasm could evaporate \u2013 an"

Some people put off getting into the stock market for years \u2013 or even forever \u2013 as they keep waiting for what they hope will be the right moment.\nI understand that. Successful investing involves buying something for less than it ultimately turns out to be worth. So it makes sense not to want to overpay.\nBut the signals can be confusing. On one hand, the economy is lacklustre. Set against that though, we have already seen the blue-chip FTSE 100 index of leading British shares hit a new all-time high this month.\nMarket timing can be problematic\nI think it can be helpful to step back from the question and ask exactly what the \u201cright time\u201d for someone to start investing might look like?\nSome of that will be personal to them. Does their financial situation give them enough leeway to start buying shares, even if only on a small scale? Have they decided why they want to invest and set some goals?\nAlso, have they taken time to learn at least the basics of important concepts like how to value shares and how to diversify a portfolio to help reduce risk?\nBut there is a more general point too. There may not be a single \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cworst\u201d time to start investing. To some extent, it depends on what investments someone makes.\nLots of people try to time the market by guessing what they think will happen next. But that can only ever be a guess.\nChoosing individual shares\nWhen I say that the right time to start investing depends on what investments someone makes, that is partly because shares do not move as a mass bloc. Even when the overall market may seem expensive, there may still be some individual bargain shares. Conversely, even after a market crash, some shares can still be overpriced.\nThat helps explain why I like to buy individual shares (as part of a diversified portfolio), instead of an index tracker.\nOne share to consider\nAt the moment, one share I think investors should consider is FTSE 100 asset manager M&G (LSE: MNG). The market for asset management is large and likely to stay that way over the long term. The sums involved mean that even fairly modest commissions can soon add up.\nWith its strong brand, deep experience and customer base in the millions across several dozen markets, M&G has proven it has the ability to generate cash on a meaningful scale.\nThat allows it to fund a juicy dividend. The current yield is already 6.9% \u2014 well over double the FTSE 100 average \u2014 and the company\u2019s stated aim is to keep increasing its dividend per share annually."

But investors should already be thinking about the next milestone \u2013 and the stocks that will take it there.\nRolls-Royce has been one of the index\u2019s top performers since the end of the pandemic. And I think I can see a stock that might have similar potential going forward.\nInforma\nOne stock I have high expectations for is Informa (LSE:INF). The stock has been steady over the last 10 years, but the underlying business has been through a really interesting transition.\nAfter a series of acquisitions, the company has grown into a global leader in the trade show and conference industry. And this is a business with extremely attractive unit economics.\nInforma\u2019s key assets are intangible \u2013 they\u2019re things like trademarks, brands, and intellectual property. The important thing here is that they don\u2019t need repairs, upgrades, or maintenance.\nThat means the company\u2019s capital requirements are relatively low. As a result, it can use the majority of the cash it generates to support growth, pay dividends, or fund share buybacks.\nA company in transition\nInforma\u2019s revenues have tripled over the last 10 years, but its earnings per share are largely unchanged. That\u2019s not a positive sign, but there\u2019s more to this than meets the eye.\nThe main reason for this is the fact that the company\u2019s share count is much higher than it was a decade ago. Issuing shares to fund acquisitions is one cause of this, but there\u2019s a bigger reason.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic caused severe disruption to Informa\u2019s business. And while it\u2019s (hopefully) unlikely to be repeated, the prospect of a global recession remains an ongoing risk for the firm.\nDemand, however, has recovered sharply. As a result, the company is now bigger and stronger than it was 10 years ago and it\u2019s started bringing its share count back down through buybacks.\nThe next Rolls-Royce?\nRolls-Royce has been the FTSE 100\u2019s top-performing stock since the end of the pandemic. But I think that a lot of what has driven the company\u2019s success also applies to Informa.\nA strong recovery in travel demand led to higher cash flows. This allowed Rolls-Royce to bring down its debt and lower its share count, which caused profits to rise even further.\nInforma looks to me like it\u2019s in a similar position. Trade shows have recovered strongly and this could be the engine that drives some outstanding returns for investors over the next few years.\nThe two companies aren\u2019t identical \u2013 and Tufan Erginbigi\u00e7 has been a big part of Rolls-Royce\u2019s success. But I think the stock market might be overlooking some important similarities.\nOutlook\nInforma has spent the last decade making moves to turn itself into a powerhouse in the trade show industry. But it isn\u2019t yet showing up in the company\u2019s earnings per share.\nIt won\u2019t happen overnight, but I expect this to change in the next 10 years. And if it does, the share price could move a lot higher over the next 10 years.\nThat\u2019s why I own the stock in my portfolio and why it\u2019s on the list of shares I\u2019m keeping an eye on at the moment. It\u2019s not the most famous FTSE 100 name, but that doesn\u2019t bother me at all."

That trend is now reversing.\nIn 2026, indexes tracking Germany\u2019s small and mid-sized firms are outpacing both the flagship DAX and the broader Stoxx 600, continuing momentum that began last year.\nAmong the ten best-performing stocks in the MDAX over the past year, eight have seen their value more than double. Thyssenkrupp AG, an engineering firm, soared by 235%, while defense contractor Renk Group AG jumped 180%.\nThis marks a significant shift from the post-pandemic period, when investors favored large corporations. From 2021 to 2024, smaller companies generally lagged, especially after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nThe current resurgence is fueled by an improving economy\u2014Germany\u2019s GDP grew in 2025 after two years of decline\u2014and expectations of increased government spending on defense and infrastructure.\nMathieu Racheter, who leads equity strategy at Julius Baer, anticipates that German small and mid-sized companies will draw more investor interest this year as fiscal stimulus spreads through the economy, benefiting firms with a domestic focus.\nWhile defense companies have been in the spotlight due to Europe\u2019s increased military budgets, the rally is spreading. Over the past six months, companies like Verbio SE (biofuels), Schaeffler AG (auto parts), and Hochtief AG (construction) have all seen their shares more than double.\nEconomists expect Germany\u2019s growth to accelerate in 2026 and beyond, as businesses adapt to tariffs and construction and manufacturing rebound.\nAdditionally, a massive \u20ac500 billion infrastructure program and higher defense spending could inject over \u20ac1 trillion into the economy, according to Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil.\nHowever, some investors remain cautious about whether these funds will be used effectively. Concerns persist that money might be diverted to fill budget gaps or fund subsidies, rather than being invested in new projects, especially given Germany\u2019s challenges with outdated infrastructure and slow internet.\nTom Ackermans, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International, warns that global instability could disrupt the current rally. \u201cThere are many possible outcomes for the German market in 2026,\u201d he notes, adding that geopolitical risks could have a greater impact on returns than usual.\nDespite these uncertainties, the environment remains favorable for German small and mid-cap stocks to continue outperforming. Government spending is likely to benefit these companies more, as large DAX firms earn only about 20% of their revenue within Germany, compared to 33% for MDAX constituents.\nValuations for these stocks also remain attractive. The MDAX\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio is near its lowest point relative to the DAX since 2009, suggesting further room for gains. Both indexes are projected to achieve double-digit earnings growth, according to Deutsche Bank AG.\nUlrich Urbahn, head of multi-asset strategy and research at Berenberg, believes German equities remain appealing, with the MDAX offering the best exposure to the country\u2019s market.\n\u00a92026 Bloomberg L.P."

While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\nHow Fast Is Automatic Data Processing Growing?\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Automatic Data Processing has grown EPS by 12% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of Automatic Data Processing's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Automatic Data Processing maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 7.1% to US$21b. That's a real positive.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nView our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Automatic Data Processing's future profits.\nAre Automatic Data Processing Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$105b company like Automatic Data Processing. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Holding US$89m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders."

                "body": "- United States\n- /\n- Capital Markets\n- /\n- NasdaqGM:RILY\nAssessing BRC Group Holdings (RILY) Valuation After Earnings Turnaround And Nasdaq Compliance Return\nReviewed by Simply Wall St\nBRC Group Holdings (RILY) is back in focus after reporting third quarter 2025 earnings that shifted from a net loss a year ago to substantial net income, along with lower net debt and restored Nasdaq compliance.\nSee our latest analysis for BRC Group Holdings.\nThat earnings swing and return to Nasdaq compliance have gone hand in hand with sharp share price moves, including a 98% 1 month share price return and a 71.62% year to date share price return, even as the 3 year total shareholder return of 74.66% and 5 year total shareholder return of 71.82% still point to a much tougher longer term picture.\nIf this kind of turnaround story has your attention, it could be a good moment to broaden your radar and check out fast growing stocks with high insider ownership.\nWith the share price already up sharply and the stock trading at what appears to be a meaningful discount to some intrinsic estimates, investors may need to consider whether BRC Group Holdings is still underappreciated or if the market is already pricing in a substantial degree of potential improvement.\nPrice to Sales of 0.3x: Is it justified?\nOn a simple revenue lens, BRC Group Holdings trades on a P/S of 0.3x, which, at a US$8.89 share price, sits far below peers and the wider Capital Markets industry.\nThe P/S ratio compares the company\u2019s market value with its revenue, so a lower figure can signal that investors are placing a relatively modest value on each dollar of current sales. For a diversified financial services group that is currently unprofitable, this type of multiple often becomes a reference point when earnings based metrics are difficult to use.\nAgainst that backdrop, RILY\u2019s 0.3x P/S stands starkly against the US Capital Markets industry average of 4.2x and the peer average of 15.6x. This suggests the market is valuing its revenue at a steep discount to both its sector and closer comparables. There is also insufficient data to calculate a Price to Sales fair ratio, so there is no regression based level to compare this discount to.\nSee what the numbers say about this price \u2014 find out in our valuation breakdown.\nResult: Price to Sales of 0.3x (UNDERVALUED)\nHowever, you still have to weigh ongoing net losses of US$89.615 million, as well as the complexity of six very different business segments that can pull results in competing directions.\nFind out about the key risks to this BRC Group Holdings narrative.\nAnother View: What Does The SWS DCF Model Say?\nThere is also our DCF model, which estimates fair value for BRC Group Holdings at US$20.62 per share compared with the current US$8.89 price. From that perspective, the stock screens as significantly undervalued. The key question is whether you think the underlying cash flow assumptions are realistic enough for your comfort.\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day (check out BRC Group Holdings for example). We show the entire calculation in full.

Kennedy Jr. was just a few weeks into his new job as health secretary in March 2025 when he unveiled a dramatic plan to remake the Department of Health and Human Services.\nKennedy quickly determined that the size and structure of his agency \u2014 which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes for Health \u2014 was \"incomprehensible.\" He said it was bloated and that explained why federal health officials had failed to improve Americans' health.\n\"We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments and agencies while preserving their core functions,\" he said in a social media video. Those \"core functions\" would be preserved, he explained, \"by merging them into a new organization called the Administration for a Healthy America or AHA.\"\nThe name plays off of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" slogan.\nWeeks into the second year of the second Trump term, many staff and departments of HHS have been eliminated in chaotic cuts handed down on April 1, 2025, but the Administration for a Healthy America does not yet exist.\nThere's no public information about when AHA might be created, and very little about what staff and programs it would include.\nNot a normal process\nThe most recent public document from HHS about AHA was a budget request published in June. It says that the new agency will \"focus on areas including primary care, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, mental and behavioral health, and workforce development.\"\nThose programs are spread out across health agencies, including at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and several centers at CDC.\nCongress didn't include any money for AHA in the latest HHS funding bill. Staffers on committees with jurisdiction over HHS tell NPR there have not even been meetings with Kennedy's staff to help secure support for new funding or authorization to stand up the new agency in the future.\nInstead, political appointees at HHS are holding secretive planning meetings about AHA, according to seven current and former employees at federal health agencies who spoke to NPR.\nHHS would not answer NPR's questions for this story, but in a statement said that planning for AHA was still underway.\nBehind the scenes, rushed and secretive meetings\nAt CDC in Atlanta, a senior official describes a constant demand for information about budgets, staff and public health work. It's not even clear who is asking for the data or what they plan to do with it, they say, but they understand it is related to AHA planning.\n\"All that you're told is that 'they' are asking for this information and they want it now \u2014 or they wanted it yesterday.\" The official asked NPR not to use their name because of fears of professional retribution for speaking publicly without authorization. \"'They' can refer to a small circle of people around Kennedy that he trusts, who are either unnamed, or you'll receive a different name each time, so you're never really quite sure where the ask is coming from.\"\nA different senior official at HHS, who also asked that NPR not to use their name for fear of professional retribution, echoed that description of political appointees connected to Kennedy holding \"constant meetings in secret about what this new AHA is supposed to look like, but they don't share with anyone in the civil service.\" The source adds there are rumors that Kennedy's team is \"going to stand up AHA in the next few months, like in the spring.\"\nThere's no public information about who is in charge of planning to create the agency, and HHS did not make anyone available to interview for this story.\n\"What does this mean?\"\nDr. Karen Hacker says the process o"

County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman called the incident \u201cunacceptable\u201d in an office-wide memo sent out on Friday evening.\n\u201cA member of our Office was wrongfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I can thankfully report that, shortly after, our employee was released and is safe,\u201d Hochman wrote. \u201cThis incident is unacceptable. Our employee is a dedicated public servant who serves the people of Los Angeles County with professionalism and integrity. This troubling situation caused great distress to our colleague, our co-worker\u2019s family, and our entire Office family.\u201d\nThe reason for the person\u2019s detention was not immediately clear. A spokesman for Hochman declined to comment further and referred questions to ICE. Representatives for ICE did not respond to inquiries from The Times. .\nTwo law enforcement officials with knowledge of the incident, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to talk candidly, said the employee was not a prosecutor. The employee was also not engaged in protest activity, the officials said.\nIn the e-mail, Hochman said he personally reached out to federal authorities on Friday to make them aware of the situation and \u201curge them to be more respectful of the rights of those who reside in our community and ensure this wrongful conduct does not occur again.\u201d\nIn the months since ICE and Border Patrol agents began carrying out President Trump\u2019s sweeping immigration raids in U.S. cities, civil liberties groups have repeatedly sued the Department of Justice alleging agents are making stops based on race rather than reasonable suspicion.\nAfter ICE and Border Patrol agents spent months raiding car washes and Home Depot parking lots around L.A. County, a federal judge in October found sufficient evidence that agents were violating the 4th Amendment by relying on the race, language and vocation of targeted individuals to form \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d for arrest.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union recently lodged a lawsuit against federal authorities on similar grounds over their behavior during chaotic and tense raids in Minneapolis. The Trump administration has maintained it is conducting tightly targeted operations and only going after the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d but data show many of those arrested in Los Angeles during the raids had no criminal record."

You have a beloved icon, with 40-plus years of heritage, and you have to make a modern version that doesn't lose the charm. You could end up with the equivalent of\u2014to pick an example at random\u2014hiring Mark Wahlberg to take over from Michael Caine in a rebooted The Italian Job.\nBut cue up the Self-Preservation Society theme song, because they somehow managed to pull it off. If you've driven one similar to this 2003 Cooper S on Bring a Trailer (which, like Car and Driver, is part of Hearst Autos), you know these cars offer outsize charisma, rascally cornering performance, and enough cheeky fun to blow the bloody doors off nearly anything else.\nFor Sale Near You\nSee all results for 2003 Mini Cooper for sale near 85032\nThese Minis are not without their reliability issues, but this one is in nearly new condition, with just 3600 miles on the odometer. And, despite the low mileage, it appears that the longtime owner kept up with maintenance.\nLater, the hot Minis got a turbocharged engine, but the shrill of this car's supercharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder is part of the experience. Output is reasonable at 163 horsepower and 155 pound-feet of torque, and you get a six-speed Getrag manual gearbox to make the most of it.\nThe OG Mini has become pretty collectible, but those cars are also extremely basic and have about as much crash protection as a motorcycle. This reboot is thoroughly modern in terms of safety equipment, airbags, stability control, and so on, but it still offers a much more direct driving experience than you'd get out of the current Mini range. Today's Minis are much bigger and more complex, but this car sits right in its own little sweet spot.\nThe silver and black exterior and interior are not the most exciting colors Mini offered but should wear well as the years go by. Find a specialist mechanic, keep up on the maintenance, and enjoy one of the best turn-of-the-millennium driving experiences out there.\nThe auction ends on January 21.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Skip the lot.

                "body": "Tokyo Stock Exchange Today, January 17: Nikkei Slips on Politics\nTokyo Stock Exchange today opened weaker as political headlines pressured risk appetite and prompted fresh profit-taking. Reports of a new party formation added uncertainty, even as chip-linked names stayed supported by TSMC\u2019s upbeat guidance. With the Bank of Japan meeting on Jan 22\u201323 approaching, traders focused on yen swings and exporter-sensitive shares. Sector breadth was mixed, with defensives attracting interest. We expect tight intraday ranges before policy clarity. Below, we break down key drivers, the Nikkei 225 today, and a practical Japan stocks outlook for the week.\nMarket Snapshot and Political Risk\nTalk of a new party formation raised concerns about policy stability and fiscal priorities, leading investors to trim exposure. Political uncertainty often reduces risk-taking and lifts cash balances. Local desks cited a faster switch to defensives and selective buying in quality growth. For context on the politics-driven pullback, see recent coverage on continued declines and policy worries source.\nHigh valuations in winners invited profit-taking, especially after a strong multi-week run. Traders booked gains into morning strength, then sold rallies. Flows favored liquid large caps and ETFs for quick exposure cuts. The cautious tone follows a prior session of broad selling, where profit-taking dominated, as highlighted by market wraps earlier this week source.\nSemiconductors, Financials, and Cyclicals\nSemiconductor shares outperformed as investors leaned on a strong demand outlook from TSMC\u2019s guidance. That helped domestic equipment makers and select materials names. The chip cycle narrative remains constructive, with AI servers and advanced nodes driving orders. Pullbacks were shallow compared with the broader market, which kept index losses in check on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.\nBanks traded unevenly as traders weighed margin benefits against slower loan growth risk. Machinery and autos saw two-way flows tied to currency moves and global demand signals. Investors preferred balance sheet strength and steady dividends in cyclicals. Rotation stayed fast, with buyers prioritizing firms showing pricing power and credible cost control rather than broad beta exposure.\nYen Moves and the Bank of Japan\nA softer yen typically boosts exporters\u2019 profits when overseas earnings translate back into yen. A firmer currency pressures margins and can hit sentiment for autos, tech hardware, and precision tools. Traders watched daily USD/JPY moves to adjust hedges. Currency-sensitive names led intraday swings, underscoring why yen direction remains central on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.\nThe Bank of Japan meeting is the key near-term catalyst. Markets will listen for guidance on inflation dynamics, wage trends, and bond-buying plans. Even small wording shifts can move yields, the yen, and equity risk appetite. Positioning stayed light into the event, with many investors waiting for clarity before adding to cyclical or financial exposures.\nJapan Stocks Outlook and Strategy\nWe favor a barbell: quality growth in chips and software beneficiaries, plus defensives in healthcare, staples, and utilities. Domestic demand names with steady cash flows and reliable dividends can buffer volatility. Shareholder returns matter, so watch for firms with consistent buybacks and rising payouts. Liquidity remains a plus in uncertain tapes.\nConsider staggered entries and clear stop levels, given headline risk and policy sensitivity. Keep some cash for post-BoJ opportunities if volatility widens. Currency exposure should be hedged where possible. For traders, focus on relative strength and avoid crowded laggards.
