                "body": "Gold and silver surged to record highs as the U.S. Dollar Index broke long-term support, driving demand for safe-haven assets ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision.\nGold (XAUUSD) price set new record highs above $5,225 amid a weakening of U.S. dollar (USD) and continuing uncertainty. The weakness in the US dollar resulted in an increase in demand for dollar priced assets and strengthened the position of gold as a store of value. Moreover, the continued geopolitical tensions increased market volatility and demand for safe havens. The market is now looking for the Federal Reserve decision which may introduce further volatility in the precious metals sector.\nThe decline in USD is further supported by comments from President Trump, which weighed on USD and helped fuel the move in precious metals. The dollar index dropped to its lowest level in years, which eases financial conditions for gold. The threats of trade and political pressure added to the market risk. That mix continued to favor hard assets over paper ones.\nSimilarly, the silver (XAG) price moved higher with the gold market, supported by same macro forces. A lower dollar and fears of inflation were good for silver as monetary and industrial metal.\nThe market attention is now focused on the Fed\u2019s message. A firm policy stance may continue to put pressure on the U.S. dollar and support precious metals. Any hawkish tone could slow the rally. But there is still strong underlying demand. With data on confidence worsening and risks unsolved, gold and silver keep drawing in defensive flows.\nThe gold price surged above $5,200 and marked a new record level within the parabolic trend. The price continues to trend higher within an extremely overbought region, as seen by the RSI. However, price shows no signs of reversal as the U.S. dollar weakens.\nThis continued strength in the gold market indicates that 2026 might be another record year of the decade for gold. The price is trading toward the $5,400 level. However, any correction toward $5,000 may be seen a buying opportunity for short-term traders.\nThe short-term price action shows that the gold price is overextended above $5,000, as seen by the RSI. The RSI is also not rising above the 80 level and is showing a divergence. This indicates that the price may correct lower in the short term.\nHowever, the strong bullish momentum does not show signs of correction. A break above $5,500 in the short term will indicate that the gold price is moving toward $6,000. However, any correction below $5,000 will indicate that the price may correct lower towards $4,800.\nThe daily chart for the silver price shows an overextension above $100, which indicates that market is entering overbought mode. When the price moves into this mode, it usually marks a short-term top and corrects sharply lower.\nHowever, the longer-term and short-term price action indicates further upside in the short term. Any correction back toward the $60 to $80 region will indicate a strong buying opportunity for traders.\nThe 4-hour chart for spot silver shows that silver broke above the $100 region and retraced back to hit $100, attracting new buying interest. The price is again trending to break above the $117 region. A break above $117 indicates further upside toward $150 in the short term.\nAs long as the $100 support in spot silver holds, the market may enter and may target new milestones in the short term.\nThe overextension in the gold and silver market is due to the extreme pressure on the U.S. Dollar Index. The U.S. Dollar Index has broken long-term support at 96, which indicates that index is heading toward 90.\nAs the U.S. Dollar Index trades toward 90, the gold and silver markets may further trend higher. However, the daily chart for U.S. Dollar Index shows that the index has approached the oversold region. Therefore, any rebound from current levels may occur. However, this rebound will likely be limited and indicate further downside in the index.\nThe 4-hour chart fo"

Capital is moving, and markets rarely move without a reason.\nCurrency markets reacted to speculation over potential coordinated US-Japan action to support the yen, alongside renewed concerns about fiscal uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The result has been a rotation away from the dollar and toward hard assets that sit outside political systems.\nInvestors are voting with capital.\nGold crossing $5,000 and the dollar weakening simultaneously signal a reassessment of US political credibility as a macro variable. Political stability is no longer an abstract concept for markets. It is a line item in asset allocation models.\nThe yen\u2019s jump toward \u00a5153 per dollar, driven by expectations of coordinated intervention, added pressure on the greenback. At the same time, renewed concerns about a potential US government shutdown and persistent geopolitical flashpoints have compounded the dollar\u2019s weakness.\nFor decades, the dollar strengthened during periods of uncertainty. That assumption is now under review.\nPolicy unpredictability, fiscal pressures, and geopolitical shocks are pushing investors to diversify reserves and portfolios away from dollar concentration. Capital allocators are no longer comfortable with single-currency dependence in a world defined by fragmented politics and competing economic blocs.\nGold\u2019s rally reflects demand for assets that sit beyond policy frameworks.\nUnlike currencies and sovereign bonds, gold carries no counterparty risk and no fiscal risk. It does not depend on a central bank\u2019s credibility, a government\u2019s budget discipline, or a political system\u2019s stability. When investors question policy coherence, gold becomes a preferred hedge.\nGold is evolving from a tail-risk hedge into a core macro asset.\nCentral banks have accumulated gold at record levels, and private investors are following. This pattern reflects a broader transition toward a multipolar reserve structure, where no single currency enjoys unquestioned dominance.\nSpeculation that Washington could tolerate or even encourage a weaker dollar to support exports and industrial policy adds another layer of complexity.\nIf policymakers lean toward currency weakness as an economic lever, volatility rises across foreign exchange, commodities, and equities. Currency policy becomes an extension of industrial strategy, and investors must adjust portfolios to account for state-driven market outcomes.\nThe broader trend is a gradual shift from dollar unipolarity toward a diversified reserve system.\nTrade settlement in local currencies, rising gold accumulation by central banks, and the growth of regional financial arrangements all point toward a multipolar currency environment. The dollar remains dominant, yet dominance is more contested and more politicized than at any point in recent decades.\nInvestors are hedging against concentration risk in a multipolar monetary system.\nFor markets, the implications are significant.\nA structurally weaker dollar would support commodities and many emerging markets while increasing volatility in currency and fixed income markets. Portfolio construction becomes more complex when reserve assumptions are no longer stable.\nEquities tied to defense, energy infrastructure, AI and tech supply chains, and industrial policy themes could attract sustained interest as governments reshape economic strategy. Fiscal expansion, security spending, and supply-chain restructuring are becoming structural features of the global economy.\nThe next decade will reward portfolios built for fragmentation.\nGeopolitics no longer sits in the background of market analysis. It drives asset allocation decisions, currency strategies, and capital flows in re"

Wrong. Just an hour or so ago we had the US President trash talk the dollar:\nThe dollar got smashed (further). See pic, above.\nMore from that article, in summary:\nSpeaking at an event hosted by Bruegel, Georgieva said the Fund is strengthening its capacity to model \u201cunthinkable\u201d events, including the possibility of a run on dollar assets, as part of its ongoing risk analysis. While stopping short of predicting such an outcome, she confirmed the IMF is examining a broad range of stress scenarios.\nHer remarks come amid mounting investor concern triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, repeated attacks on Federal Reserve independence, and broader rule-of-law worries. Since Trump\u2019s return to the White House in January 2025, the US dollar has fallen more than 9% against a basket of major currencies and nearly 12% versus the euro.\nSafe-haven doubts have driven strong inflows into gold, with prices hitting a record $5,100 per ounce. Georgieva noted that longer-term diversification trends are also at work, with the dollar\u2019s share of global FX reserves declining from 72% in 2001 to just under 57% today, while the BRICS bloc has actively pursued de-dollarisation.\nShe argued that greater issuance of joint EU debt could help create an alternative safe asset, though acknowledged strong political resistance. Despite current pressures, Georgieva stressed the dollar\u2019s reserve status remains underpinned by the depth and liquidity of US capital markets."

                "body": "Silver breaks $100 per ounce record: 3 reasons to get invested right now\nConjecture surrounding the potential for the price of silver to surpass $100 per ounce this month is no longer speculative as the metal now sits at $111.36, a price chart from American Hartford Gold showed Tuesday morning. The new price marks yet another record for the metal, the latest in a series investors have encountered over the past year. For reference, the price of silver per ounce on January 27, 2025, was just $30.20. That makes today's price almost 270% higher.\nAt the same time, you shouldn't just rush to invest in any asset because the price is on the upswing, even if the asset is growing the way silver has over the past year. Instead, true investing success will often come to those who take an informed and strategic approach. Fortunately, there are multiple compelling reasons why it could be advantageous to add silver to your portfolio right now. Below, we'll detail three worth knowing, specifically, right now.\nExplore your top silver and gold investing options here.\n3 reasons why you should get invested in silver now\nNot sure if now is the right time to add silver to your portfolio? Here are three reasons why it may be:\nThe price will likely rise further\nThe remarkable growth silver has experienced isn't likely to stop or reverse course, and if forecasts are accurate, the price is likely to rise even further. And for some investors, that could mean pushing it out of reach, perhaps permanently. It's important to remember that silver prices can be volatile in the short term, but over an extended period, they tend to only rise (hence the reason why it's a reliable portfolio diversifier and hedge against inflation).\nIn other words, today's \"high\" silver price of $111 per ounce could become tomorrow's \"low\" one. So be careful with how you time your investment, as waiting for the perfect time to act could backfire \u2026 and you'll lose the protections the metal offers your portfolio in the interim, too.\nGet started with silver online today.\nYour portfolio could use the protection silver offers\nInflation is much lower than it was \u2026 but it remains sticky. Stock market returns, meanwhile, can be uneven and unpredictable. And interest rates, while cut multiple times in the final months of 2025, appear to be frozen for now (and higher than many borrowers would prefer). In this climate, it makes sense to add portfolio protectors like gold and silver. Thanks to the metal's ability to maintain and even rise in value during such periods, the addition of either can help offset the economic impacts felt by other items.\nAt the same time, the temptation to overinvest in silver and gold now, with the price at record highs, should also be avoided. Because both operate better as income protectors versus income producers, experts recommend limiting the precious metal portion of your portfolio to a maximum of 10%.\nIt's easier than ever to get invested\nIf it feels like precious metal investing is ubiquitous now, it's understandable because it is. Not only can you invest in silver via the normal channels of jewelers, pawnshops and investing companies, but you can also explore your options via big retailers now, too.\nWith stores like Costco and Walmart now offering physical silver options, you have more ways than ever to get invested. And you can often do so online, from the comfort of your own home. Familiarize yourself with costs and markups, though, to avoid overpaying. And remember that the $111 per ounce is for pure silver, which you often won't be investing in unless buying silver bars or coins, specifically.\nThe bottom line\nAt over $100 per ounce now, it's an exciting time to get invested in silver. But a rising price isn't the only reason to get started now. Just don't make perfect timing your goal here, either. If you need the portfolio protections silver offers, have a safe and trusted way to secure the metal and want to get started before the price grows fully ou"

                "body": "Is silver a good investment? Pros, cons and what to know\n- Investors buy silver as a hedge against inflation, for portfolio diversification, or as a tangible asset.\n- Silver's price is influenced by industrial demand, mining supply, economic uncertainty, and interest rates.\n- Compared to gold, silver is less expensive but more volatile, offering both higher risk and potential reward.\nInvestors buy silver for all sorts of reasons. Some want protection when markets drop. Others worry about inflation eating away at their savings. But recent price headlines won\u2019t tell you if the precious metal belongs in your portfolio.\nSo, should you invest in silver? Understanding what moves silver prices and how it compares to other investments can help you make that decision.\nHow is silver used as an investment?\nSilver serves as an investment in different ways, depending on what you\u2019re trying to accomplish.\n\u201cHolding physical silver (e.g., coins and bars) is one way of preserving long-term value,\u201d says Brandon Aversano, the CEO of The Alloy Market, a precious metals buyer in Newtown, Pennsylvania.\nIn that situation, you decide where to keep it and have direct access, though that also means handling security on your own.\nSome investors prefer paper silver through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Silver ETFs give you price exposure without the hassles of storage or insurance.\nBrett Elliott, the director of marketing at precious metals dealer American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX), notes that popular ETFs are easy to trade and generally cost less to buy and sell. This works well for investors with shorter timelines.\nSilver\u2019s role extends beyond investment, though. Manufacturers use the metal in electronics, medical equipment and solar panels. That industrial demand affects supply and pricing differently than for purely monetary metals like gold. When both investors and manufacturers compete for the same limited supply, prices tend to climb.\nWhat drives the price of silver?\nSilver prices respond to several forces that often overlap:\n- Supply and mining production: Prices climb when mines can\u2019t produce enough silver to meet demand. Buyers end up competing for a limited supply, which drives up costs.\n- Industrial consumption: \u201cThe increasing use of silver in industrial contexts directly impacts consumption,\u201d Aversano explains. The more manufacturers need, the less investors can get their hands on.\n- Economic uncertainty and investor sentiment: Silver gets popular when inflation picks up or the economy looks shaky. Investors treat it as a safe place to park money during uncertain times, which drives demand higher.\n- Interest rates: When rates rise, yield-bearing investments become more attractive, putting downward pressure on silver prices. Lower rates have the opposite effect.\nPotential benefits of investing in silver\nSilver offers potential benefits for investors, though none are guaranteed:\n- Lower entry cost: \u201cCompared to gold, silver can be less expensive,\u201d Aversano says. This makes it easier for new investors to get started with precious metals.\n- Portfolio diversification: Steve Azoury, a Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) and the owner of Azoury Financial in Troy, Michigan, notes that silver is \u201ca real asset independent of political and government policies.\u201d It can help spread risk across different asset types.\n- Tangible asset appeal: Because physical silver exists outside the financial system, it appeals to investors who want direct control over their holdings.\n- Possible hedge characteristics: \u201cSilver can serve as a partial hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations, though it\u2019s not used as a hedging vehicle as often as gold,\u201d Aversano points out.\nRisks and drawbacks of investing in silver\nWhile silver has its pros, it also comes with risks:\n- Price volatility: \u201cIf silver demand decreases, it can send the price flying down quickly,\u201d warns Azoury. Investors entering the market now should be prepared for volatility, as current condi"

The next Federal Reserve policy meeting begins on Tuesday, January 27, and concludes on Wednesday, January 28. The Federal Open Market Committee will announce its interest rate decision, followed by a press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This meeting is crucial for the US stock market, gold price, and silver price because investors are looking for signals on future interest rate cuts. Any hint of a rate pause or easing can support stock market sentiment and increase demand for gold and silver, as lower interest rates reduce returns on bonds and strengthen interest in safe-haven assets.\nWhen is next Federal Reserve policy meeting?\nThe next Federal Reserve policy meeting will begin on Tuesday, January 27, and conclude on Wednesday, January 28. The Federal Open Market Committee will review economic data, inflation trends, and labor market conditions before announcing its interest rate decision.

This is the first scheduled Federal Reserve policy meeting of 2026 and sets the tone for future rate decisions.\nWhy is it crucial for US stock market, gold and silver price rise?\nThe Federal Reserve policy meeting is crucial for the US stock market, gold price, and silver price because interest rate signals influence investor behavior. A pause in rate cuts can stabilize stock markets, while any hint of future easing can support equity gains. Gold and silver prices often rise when investors expect lower interest rates, as borrowing costs fall and demand for safe-haven assets increases during economic and political uncertainty.\nWhen is the next Federal Reserve policy meeting?\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting begins on Tuesday, January 27, and ends Wednesday, January 28.

After January, the next meeting is in March.\nMeetings marked with projections include updated economic forecasts.\nWhy this Fed meeting matters for markets?\nMarkets expect the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate cuts. The benchmark rate stands at 3.5% to 3.75% after three cuts in late 2025. The labor market has stabilized, unemployment is at 4.4%, and consumer spending remains firm. CME Group data shows a 97% chance rates remain unchanged.\nImpact on US stock market\nUS stock market investors are watching Powell\u2019s guidance. A pause supports equity stability, while hints of future cuts could lift stocks. Traders now see only a 16% chance of a March rate cut. Any shift in tone could change market pricing.\nWhy gold and silver prices are rising?\nGold prices crossed $5,000 per ounce and reached a record $5,110.50. Silver rose above $107 per ounce and is up over 50% this year. Investors are buying gold and silver due to uncertainty, rate expectations, and geopolitical risks.

Crude oil inventories increased by 3.04 million barrels in the week prior.\nInventories in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) keep climbing week after week. The Department of Energy (DoE) reported that crude oil inventories in the SPR rose by 500,000 barrels to 415 million barrels in the week ending January 23.

This is 255,000 bpd more than this same time last year.\nAt 3:53 pm ET, Brent crude was trading up on the day at $67.33 (+2.65%). Brent is now roughly $2 per barrel up from this time last week on US supply concerns due to the severe weather that took some crude production offline. WTI was also trading up on the day, by $1.63 (+2.69%) at $62.26.\nGasoline inventories also fell this week, losing 415,000 barrels in the week ending January 23. In the week prior, gasoline inventories grew by 6.2 million barrels. As of last week, gasoline inventories were 5% above the five-year average for this time of year, according to the latest EIA data.\nDistillate inventories grew in the reporting period by 2 million barrels, after falling by 33,000 barrels in the week prior.

The major pair retraces from a five-year high amid renewed US Dollar (USD) demand. All eyes will be on the US Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision on Wednesday.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he will announce his pick for the new Fed Chair soon, adding that interest rates will fall with the US central bank under new leadership. Traders worry that the Fed would lose its independence after the appointment of a Trump candidate as Fed Chairman. This, in turn, could weigh on the Greenback and act as a tailwind for the major pair.\nMarkets are currently anticipating the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later in the day, with expectations that rates will remain unchanged in the current range of 3.50% to 3.75%. Traders will closely monitor the press conference for any guidance regarding future rate cuts.\nOn the Euro\u2019s front, European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers are in no hurry to adjust interest rates as inflation is hovering near the target. Officials did not discuss raising or cutting rates at the December meeting, emphasizing a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach. Expectations for further rate reductions this year have largely vanished due to a mixed economic picture.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone\u2019s economy.\nAnother significant data release for the E"

Traders were cautious as the U.S. central bank\u2019s latest two-day policy meeting kicked off.\nThe Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged, with economic growth showing signs of strength and unemployment still relatively low, and the central bank is likely to stay on hold until it has more clarity on the world\u2019s largest economy.\nThe dollar has seen a marked fall this month due to factors ranging from concerns over the Fed\u2019s independence to trade and geopolitical decisions by President Donald Trump.\n\"While I am not in the de-dollarization camp there is definitely a diversification away from the greenback in part due to policy unpredictability coming out of Washington,\" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, noted on X (formerly Twitter).\nCurrency intervention watch\nThe yen has also remained in focus in forex markets, having fallen sharply in the prior two sessions after Reuters reported that the New York Fed had conducted rate checks on the currency pair, possibly signaling that U.S. and Japanese authorities may be preparing to intervene.\nSpeculation over such intervention was also stoked after Japanese Prime Minister Takaichi warned against excessive volatility in the yen.\nThe yen has also been pressured by a dire selloff in Japanese government bonds sparked by concerns over stretched fiscal spending under Takaichi.\n\"The yen peaked in the months leading up to the 2012 \u2019Abenomics\u2019 election. After that, Japan kept policy ultra-easy\u2014through QQE, negative rates and later yield-curve control,\" Deutsche Bank\u2019s Jim Reid said.\n\"After 2021, as U.S. yields surged and energy import costs rose, the yen weakened sharply as the BoJ was seen as \u2019behind the curve.\u2019 With real yields still deeply negative in Japan, downward pressure persisted until last Friday\u2019s \u2019rate-check\u2019 episode,\" he added.\nEuro adds to gains\nEUR/USD was flat at 1.2041 on Tuesday, hitting that level for the first time since mid-2021, as investors shunned the dollar.\n\u201cLike other FX pairs, EUR/USD has some lively technical chart patterns this week. There is a downside gap to 1.1834 which should now act as support if EUR/USD is preparing to break above range highs at 1.1910/20. At present, we think those highs can hold and that EUR/USD can end the quarter somewhere near 1.17,\u201d said ING.\nGBP/USD edged 0.1% lower to 1.3828.\n\u201cSterling\u2019s outperformance this week may well be down to the fact that asset managers were very short GBP/USD positions, which have been left exposed by this week\u2019s dollar sell-off,\u201d said ING.\nElsewhere, USD/KRW slipped 1% to 1,431.95, with the South Korean showing some weakness as U.S. President Donald Trump said he will hike tariffs on certain imports from the country to 25%, citing a delay in Seoul\u2019s enactment of a trade deal with Washington.\nAUD/USD and NZD/USD were both little changed at 0.7007 and 0.6040, respectively.\nPeter Nurse contributed to this article\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

Chairman Powell took the unprecedented step of issuing a weekend video address asserting that the threat was \u201ca consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\u201d\nWith the Fed seemingly on hold for at least the next couple months, this represents a prime opportunity for President Trump to undermine Powell around the central bank\u2019s meeting and nominate a successor, a move that Trump had previous vowed to do by the end of January. By formally making Powell a \u201clame duck\u201d Chairman, Trump could steal some of the thunder back from the central bank and prompt forward-looking markets to price in lower interest rates in the latter half of the year.\nFor markets, the obvious question is, \u201cWho will Trump nominate?\u201d After months of mixed messaging, it looks like the tides are shifting against current NEC Director Kevin Hassett (who Trump has hinted he wants to remain in his current role given his effectiveness in the media). Blackrock\u2019s Head of Fixed Income Rick Reider apparently had a strong interview with the President earlier making him the current favorite in betting markets, though former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller are also seen as strong contenders:\nSource: Polymarket\nBroadly speaking, traders would view Reider and Waller as more neutral candidates that would be more likely to protect the independence of the institution (read: higher interest rates and lower inflation long term), whereas vocal Fed-critic Warsh and Kevin Hassett are perceived as more likely to kowtow to Trump\u2019s preference for lower interest rates. If either of the latter two candidates is nominated, traders may look to sell the US dollar and bonds in favor of risk assets.\nOne way or another, market volatility around this week\u2019s Fed meeting is unlikely to be driven by the current interest rate decisions and outlook and more by the leadership of the central bank once Powell steps down in May.\nUS Dollar Technical Analysis \u2013 EUR/USD Daily Chart\nSource: StoneX, TradingView\nTurning our attention to the charts, the world\u2019s most widely-traded currency pair is on the verge of a breakout to 4.5-year highs around 1.1920 a"

                "body": "GBP/USD soars amid Greenback collapse, breaches four-year highs\n- GBP/USD gained over one percent on Tuesday as the US Dollar\u2019s woes continue.\n- The UK side of the economic data docket remains thin, keeping macro in the driver\u2019s seat.\n- The Fed\u2019s upcoming rate call is expected to be a snooze unless rate rhetoric shifts.\nGBP/USD is well on its way to a second straight week of strong gains as the US Dollar (USD) gives up the ghost on the back of ongoing trade war rhetoric undercutting the Greenback\u2019s strength. The Pound Sterling is on pace to close in the green for a third straight month against the US Dollar, as the pace of Cable gains continues to pick up the pace and hit multi-year highs.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) is set to announce its first rate decision of the year on Wednesday, with no change expected. Investor focus will be on forward guidance, particularly signals around the timing of potential rate cuts. Futures markets currently price in two quarter-point cuts by the end of 2026.\nRecent announcements of further intentional trade frictions from US President Donald Trump have done the Greenback no favours as of late. Donald Trump\u2019s latest batch of tariff threats targeting key EU members as well as the UK over ownership of Greenland have largely fallen on deaf ears. Despite Trump\u2019s ambiguous claims that things are \u201cprogressing on Greenland\u201d, there appears to be little evidence that European nations are currently poised to back down from counter-tariff measures should the need arise.\nGBP/USD price forecast\nCable is knocking into its highest bids in 51 months, or a little over four years, and the pair has broken through key technical levels that hampered the Pound\u2019s mid-2025 bull run. Bidders are back, stronger than ever with a steadily-weakening US Dollar in tow. However, 1.4000 remains a key technical hurdle for a bullish continuation, and several months of firm gains followed by a one-sided decline is something of a pattern that GBP/USD traders should be used to by now.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference betwee"

                "body": "The Pound Sterling gains strength against the US Dollar during Tuesday\u2019s North American session. The trade tariffs escalation causes the Dollar to weaken, pushing GBP/USD to trade at 1.3776, up 0.76%.\nThe pair reaches new six-month highs due to the Dollar\u2019s broad-based decline. GBP/USD is trading around 1.3739, marking an increase of nearly 0.42% for the day.\nGBP Against Dollar Struggles\nDespite its rise, the GBP/USD pair struggles to sustain its position beyond the 1.3700 mark. It briefly dips during the European session but remains stable above the mid-1.3600s.\nWe are seeing the pound push to six-month highs against the dollar, driven by escalating trade tariff concerns that are weighing on the US currency. With the Federal Reserve\u2019s first meeting of the year just ahead, this trend may have more room to run. The immediate focus is on whether GBP/USD can decisively hold gains above the 1.3700 level.\nThis move isn\u2019t just about dollar weakness; the pound has its own fundamental strength. Looking back at the data from late 2025, we saw UK core inflation remain stubbornly high, with the Q4 consumer price index coming in at 3.1%, well above the Bank of England\u2019s target. This has kept expectations alive that the BoE will be slower to cut rates than the Fed, providing a supportive tailwind for sterling.\nThe combination of trade uncertainty and the upcoming Fed decision is pushing up volatility expectations. One-month implied volatility for GBP/USD options has risen to its highest level since the market jitters we observed in the third quarter of 2025. This makes buying options more expensive, but it also means there are larger premiums available for those willing to sell them.\nRisk and Strategy Considerations\nGiven the upward momentum, we should consider strategies that benefit from a continued rise but also manage risk due to high volatility. Bull call spreads with February expirations, perhaps buying the 1.3800 strike and selling the 1.3950 strike, could be an effective way to target further gains. This approach defines our risk while cheapening the cost of entry compared to an outright long call position.\nFor those of us who believe the downside is limited, the elevated premiums make selling cash-secured puts an attractive income-generating strategy. Considering the pair has found support in the mid-1.3600s, selling a put with a strike around 1.3600 could allow us to collect premium while the market decides its next major move. This benefits directly from the current high implied volatility.\nWe must remain cautious, however, as we saw a similar setup during the trade disputes of 2019 where dollar weakness quickly reversed following a surprisingly firm Fed statement. A hawkish tone from the Fed to counter inflationary pressures from tariffs could halt this rally abruptly. Therefore, maintaining defined-risk positions heading into the central bank meeting is the most prudent course of action."

                "body": "The Pound to US Dollar exchange rate (GBP/USD) hovered near a four-month peak on Tuesday, supported by ongoing weakness in the US Dollar, although a lack of fresh data kept volatility contained.\nAt the time of writing, GBP/USD was trading at $1.3701, moving sideways just shy of the previous session\u2019s four-month high.\nThe US Dollar (USD) remained under pressure, extending recent losses after a heavy selloff earlier in the week dragged the currency to multi-month lows.\nSentiment towards the Greenback has deteriorated amid growing unease over both foreign policy and domestic political strains. While President Donald Trump stepped back from threatening new tariffs on Europe, markets were unsettled by fresh warnings aimed at Canada, with Trump suggesting 100% tariffs could be imposed if Ottawa pursues a trade agreement with China.\nAt home, the mood darkened further following public outrage over the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by immigration agents in Minneapolis. The incident reignited fears of political gridlock, with some Democrats withdrawing support for funding the Department of Homeland Security, raising the prospect of another government shutdown.\nWith tensions simmering on multiple fronts, investors have grown increasingly cautious about holding US Dollar exposure. Although USD briefly stabilised after Trump attempted to cool the situation in Minneapolis, the currency struggled to attract sustained buying interest.\nThe Pound (GBP), meanwhile, found it difficult to extend gains, with a quiet UK data calendar leaving Sterling short of clear direction.\nSave on Your GBP/USD Transfer\nGet better rates and lower fees on your next international money transfer.\nCompare TorFX with top UK banks in seconds and see how much you could save.\nPolitical developments also weighed on sentiment. Reports of renewed friction within the governing Labour Party surfaced after allies of Prime Minister Keir Starmer moved to block Andy Burnham from standing in a forthcoming by-election. The move fuelled speculation it was designed to head off a potential leadership challenge, adding another layer of uncertainty that appeared to cap demand for the Pound.\nGBP/USD Forecast: Fed Leadership Decision Looms\nLooking ahead, markets are bracing for an announcement from President Donald Trump on his preferred candidate to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve, with the nomination expected before the end of the month.\nGiven Trump\u2019s repeated criticism of Powell\u2019s policy stance, investors anticipate a more dovish nominee when Powell\u2019s term expires in May. Such an outcome could undermine confidence in the US Dollar and place USD under renewed pressure.\nWith little in the way of UK economic data scheduled, movement in the Pound is likely to remain closely tied to shifts in global risk appetite and developments surrounding US monetary policy.\nLike this piece?

A more hawkish tone could keep supporting the aussie, while pressuring sectors that rely on cheap funding, like property and highly leveraged companies. The flip side is that if the RBA signals it\u2019s near done, the currency\u2019s rally can fade quickly as yield differentials narrow.\nZooming out: Not every central bank is on the same schedule.\nAfter a year of \u201cwho cuts first\u201d debates, Australia is starting to look like an outlier \u2013 at least temporarily.

                "body": "BOJ and Fed Divergence Reshapes the Dollar Yen Outlook\nBy: Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist\nCurrency markets are adjusting rapidly as policy expectations between the world\u2019s two most influential central banks begin to diverge. As of late January 2026, USD/JPY has pulled sharply from recent highs, reflecting growing sensitivity to central bank signaling rather than simple yield differentials. The move follows rising speculation around Bank of Japan normalization alongside an approaching pivot point for the Federal Reserve. These dynamics are reshaping risk positioning across global foreign exchange markets.\nMichael Boutros, Senior Market Analyst at FOREX.com, has tracked dollar yen cycles through multiple intervention episodes and policy transitions. His technical and macro-focused approach places particular emphasis on how central bank divergence alters carry trade behavior and short-term market stability.\nKey Themes\nUSD/JPY weakness reflects shifting expectations as the Bank of Japan considers tighter policy while the Federal Reserve remains restrictive.\nIntervention risk has re-entered the market narrative following reports of BOJ rate checks and coordination discussions.\nBank of Japan Policy Signals Pressure the Yen Carry Trade\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s evolving stance is introducing a new layer of risk into USD/JPY positioning. Boutros notes that \u201cwe were seeing a rate check from the BOJ to see what rates they would get if they wanted to intervene the markets\u201d, highlighting renewed concern over direct or coordinated action. As Japanese officials signal closer monitoring of FX conditions, traders are becoming more cautious with leveraged yen-funded positions. Consequently, even without outright intervention, the threat alone is sufficient to destabilize carry trade flows.\nFederal Reserve Rate Expectations Shift Dollar Support\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s policy outlook is also reshaping the dollar yen trajectory by narrowing forward yield expectations. Boutros emphasizes that \u201cthe first interest rate cut isn\u2019t really priced in until June\u201d, reinforcing that the immediate impact lies in guidance rather than action. With markets focusing on commentary rather than rate changes, USD/JPY has become increasingly reactive to perceived policy tone. As a result, divergence between Federal Reserve patience and Bank of Japan normalization creates a more volatile and technically sensitive environment.\nSign up for the latest Market Outlook Reports\nFrom detailed guides on how to trade major assets to quarterly market outlooks and special reports, we offer FREE access to the articles you need to successfully implement \"global macro\" style trading!\n--- Written by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gu\u00e9tin, StoneX TV Producer\n--- Expert: Michael Boutros, Senior Market Analyst, FOREX.com\nCurrencies\nThe subsidiaries of StoneX Group Inc. provide financial products and services, including, but not limited to, physical commodities, securities, clearing, global payments, risk management, asset management, foreign exchange, and exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives.

                "body": "On Tuesday, January 27, USD/JPY took its second plunge in three sessions, sliding below 153 for the first time since November 7.\nSpeculation about a coordinated Japanese and US move to bolster the yen has sent USD/JPY down from Friday\u2019s high of 159.225 to Tuesday\u2019s low of 152.092.\nUS President Trump added to the selling momentum after supporting the US dollar\u2019s recent slump.\nOn Wednesday, January 29, Fed Chair Powell will take center stage. With the markets expecting the Fed to stand pat on policy, Powell\u2019s comments will be key for the US dollar and USD/JPY trends.\nNevertheless, the USD/JPY pair\u2019s drop below 153 aligns with the bearish short- to medium-term outlook.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nOn January 28, the Bank of Japan released its Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes from its December gathering.\nThe Minutes highlighted optimism amongst policymakers that it was increasingly likely that the Bank would achieve its economic and price targets. Concerns about the US economy and the effect of Trump\u2019s tariff policies also abated. The stance on tariffs raised expectations that wages would rise steadily in 2026.\nThe Bank of Japan raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December, signaling further rate hikes if the economy and prices moved in line with projections. In January, the BoJ maintained interest rates at 0.75%, but raised its GDP and CPI forecasts, suggesting multiple rate hikes in 2026.\nNotably, USD/JPY advanced following the BoJ\u2019s rate hike, but plunged in reaction to the Bank\u2019s Quarterly Outlook Report, which coincided with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s warning of yen interventions.\nWarnings of yen interventions have coincided with a sharply weaker US Dollar, contributing to the USD/JPY pair\u2019s plunge below 153. The US Dollar Index has tumbled 2.56% to 95.405 in January, its lowest since February 2022.\nOn January 27, US President Trump accelerated the US Dollar\u2019s sell-off. The Kobeissi Letter reported:\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize what Trump just said: For 12+ months, the US Dollar has been on a sharp decline, falling 10% in 2025 in its worst year since 2017. Minutes ago, for the first time, President Trump commented on the decline in the USD: \u201cThe value of the Dollar is great,\u201d Trump said.\u201d This immediately sent the US Dollar another 1% lower, to its lowest level since February 2022. Why? It\u2019s a clear signal that President Trump is willing to tolerate a weaker Dollar to push rates lower and boost US exports.\u201d\nLater on Wednesday, the Fed will take center stage. Markets expect the Fed to keep interest rates at 3.75%, shifting the focus to Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s view on the labor market, inflation, and the timelines for further monetary policy easing will be key for the US Dollar and USD/JPY trends.\nHints of a rate cut in H1 2026 would likely weaken buying interest in the US dollar, sending USD/JPY lower.\nRecent US labor market and inflation data have curbed bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut. However, cooling inflation and rising unemployment would change the narrative.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a June cut fell from 83.4% on December 26 to 65.0% on January 27. Crucially, an H1 2026 rate cut would support expectations of two rate cuts in 2026. Multiple Fed rate cuts would coincide with the BoJ\u2019s hawkish policy stance, signaling a narrowing of US-Japan rate differentials. Narrowing rate differentials, favoring the yen, would weigh on USD/JPY.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, traders should assess technicals and closely monitor the Fed, the BoJ, and geopolitical developments.\nOn the daily chart, USD/JPY remains below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), but above the 200-day EMA. The EMAs indicated a near-term bearish trend reversal, aligning with the negative outlook for USD/JPY. Positive yen fundamentals have aligned with the near-term technicals.\nA break below"

                "body": "USD/JPY, DAX Forecast: Two trades to watch\nUSD/JPY inches higher as yen strengthening lacks follow-through, Fed 2-day meeting begins\nUSD/JPY is edging higher on Tuesday with the yen weakening amid concerns about Japan\u2019s fiscal health on the back of Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s plans for aggressive spending and tax cuts. Furthermore, the market mood is more positive, which is also undermining safe-haven demand for the JPY.\nYesterday\u2019s strengthening of the yen is lacking follow-through for now. However, the downside in the yen could be limited given the willingness of US and Japanese authorities to step in and support the currency and the BoJ\u2019s hawkish stance.\nThe sharp move in USD/JPY in recent sessions highlights market nervousness over a possible intervention.\nPM Takaichi has called a snap election for February 8, aiming to capitalise on her popularity to strengthen her mandate and push ahead with fiscal expansionary policies. Japanese bond yields have soared in recent weeks amid nervousness over Japan's fiscal outlook. That same nervousness had weighed on the yen.\nTokyo CPI data is due late in the week. The BoJ lifted its growth and inflation forecasts in last week\u2019s meeting, keeping more rate hikes on the table.\nThis is in contrast to the Federal Reserve, which kicks off its two-day meeting today. The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged at 3.5% to 3.75% after three consecutive rate cuts last year. Attention will be on Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference for further clues on the timing of further rate cuts.\nThe USD has steadied around a 4-month low, weighed down in recent sessions by the \u201csell America\u201d trade, by Trump's threats of 100% tariffs on Canada and higher tariffs on South Korea, by fears of another US government shutdown, and by speculation of JPY intervention.\nUSD/JPY forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nUSD/JPY broke aggressively below its rising trendline dating back to mid-September, and the 50 SMA, falling to a low of 153, before settling above the 154.25 support.\nUSD/JPY bulls are extending the recovery today towards 155.00. A rise above the 155 puts the pair on a more stable footing and brings 156.00 back into focus ahead of 157.50 as the next key resistance area to watch; this had acted as a support before the sharp selloff.\nOn the downside, there isn\u2019t that much in the way of support. Should sellers take out the 153.30 low, this exposes the longer-term trendline support around 152.00. A break below here exposes the 200 SMA at 149.75.\nDAX rises as EU-India trade deal is agreed\nDax, along with European shares, is seen opening broadly higher on Tuesday, with trade tensions, the upcoming Fed rate decision, and mega cap tech earnings all in focus.\nThe EU and India have concluded a free trade agreement after almost 20 years of negotiations, and space science seeks to deepen economic ties and offset the impact of Trump's tariff policies.\nThe deal is expected to double EU goods exports to India by 2032, eliminating or reducing tariffs on almost 97% of those exports. This includes a range of products from automobiles and industrial goods to wine and chocolate. India has agreed to allow up to 250,000 European-made vehicles into the country at preferential duty rates.\nMeanwhile, the EU will eliminate or reduce tariffs on almost 100% of goods imported from India over the coming seven years. The deal is set to give India a competitive edge in exporting labour-intensive goods, which have been hit hard by Trump's steep tariffs.\nLooking ahead, today also sees the start of the FOMC meeting ahead of tomorrow's rate decision, where investors will be looking for clues on the timing of the Fed's next rate cut. President Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair within the coming days.\nIn the US, 100 S&P 500 companies are due to release their quarterly earnings results this week. Among these firms, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will unveil their latest results.\nDAX forecast - technical analysis\nAfter running into r"

Join live on Monday\u2019s at 8:30am EST.\nCanadian Dollar Price Chart \u2013 USD/CAD Weekly\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; USD/CAD on TradingView\nTechnical Outlook: In my last Canadian Dollar Technical Forecast we noted that, \u201cA nine-day rally takes USD/CAD into pivotal resistance, and the focus is on a reaction off this mark. From a trading standpoint, losses should be limited to 1.3733 IF price is heading higher on this stretch..\u201d USD/CAD failed at median-line resistance the following week with price reversing sharply last week to post the largest single week decline since May. A break below the lower parallel (blue) and the 78.6% retracement of the June advance today near 1.3669 fueled another leg lower with USD/CAD now down more than 2.6% off the monthly highs.\nThe 2023 trendline is offering some support here with the 2025 swing low just lower at 1.3540. A break / weekly close below this threshold would be needed to fuel the next major leg of the decline with subsequent support seen at the 100% extension of the November selloff at 1.3431 and 1.3360/66- a region defined by the 2024 low-week close (LWC) and the 61.8% extension of the broader 2025 decline. Both areas represent zones of interest for possible downside exhaustion / price inflection IF reached.\nWeekly resistance is now eyed at 1.3669 and is backed closely by the 2026 yearly open & the 2025 LWC at 1.3725/34. A breach / weekly close above this threshold would be needed to suggest a more significant low is in place and a larger recovery is underway (bearish invalidation). Subsequent resistance is eyed at the yearly high and the May high-week close (HWC) at 1.3929/66- strength beyond this region would put the broader uptrend back in focus.\nBottom line: USD/CAD broke below multi-month support this week with today\u2019s selloff marking the largest daily loss in six-weeks. The decline takes price into slope support near the 2025 swing lows ahead of tomorrow\u2019s BoC and FOMC rate decisions and the focus is on a reaction off this mark in the days ahead. From at trading standpoint, a good zone to reduce portions of short-exposure / lower protective stops- rallies should be limited to 1.3669 IF price is heading lower on this stretch with a close below 1.3540 needed to fuel the next leg of the decline.\nKeep in mind that both central banks are widely expected to leave rates unchanged tomorrow and the focus will be on the subsequent presser with Chair Powell. In his December remarks, Powell stated that there were risks on both sides of the mandate as concerns of further deterioration in the labor markets and higher inflation continued to rise. With the recent employment data showing resiliency in the labor market (unemployment falling to 4.4% & better-than expected weekly jobless claims) the centra"

                "body": "USD/CAD recovers from its lowest level since July 2025, retakes 1.3600 ahead of BoC/Fed\n- USD/CAD attracts some buyers on Wednesday amid a goodish USD recovery from a four-year low.\n- Rising Crude Oil prices could underpin the Loonie and cap spot prices amid a bearish USD outlook.\n- Traders now look to the key BoC and the Fed interest rate decisions for a fresh directional impetus.\nThe USD/CAD pair gains some positive traction during the Asian session on Wednesday and reverses a part of the overnight slump to the 1.3560-1.3555 region, or its lowest level since July 2025. Spot prices reclaim the 1.3600 mark in the last hour amid some repositioning trade heading into key central bank events, though the fundamental backdrop warrants caution for bulls.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) is scheduled to announce its rate decision later today and is expected to keep interest rates on hold, though the case for a cut continues to mount amid mixed signals on the state of the economy and trade uncertainties. This will be followed by the outcome of a two-day FOMC meeting. Investors will look for cues about the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate cut path, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term US Dollar (USD) price dynamics and provide some meaningful impetus to the USD/CAD pair.\nIn the meantime, the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, stages a goodish recovery from its lowest level since February 2022, touched on Tuesday, though the upside seems limited amid dovish Fed expectations. In fact, investors are still pricing in the possibility that the Fed would cut rates two more times this year. Moreover, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he will soon announce his pick to serve as the Fed Chair, and predicted interest rates would decline after the new chair takes over.\nMeanwhile, evolving efforts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook revived worries about the central bank's independence. Adding to this, economic and geopolitical risks on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision could act as a headwind for the USD. Furthermore, Crude Oil prices have climbed to a fresh high since October 2025, which could support the commodity-linked Loonie and contribute to capping the USD/CAD pair. This makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before confirming that spot prices have bottomed out.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoC Interest Rate Decision\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the BoC believes inflation will be above target (hawkish), it will raise interest rates in order to bring it down. This is bullish for the CAD since higher interest rates attract greater inflows of foreign capital. Likewise, if the BoC sees inflation falling below target (dovish) it will lower interest rates in order to give the Canadian economy a boost in the hope inflation will rise back up. This is bearish for CAD since it detracts from foreign capital flowing into the country.\nRead more.Next release: Wed Jan 28, 2026 14:45\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 2.25%\nPrevious: 2.25%\nSource: Bank of Canada\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

FX markets are expected to remain subdued ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Bank of Canada and Federal Reserve policy decisions, with both central banks widely expected to leave rates unchanged.\nWTI crude traded in a 60.16-61.03 range and is holding near 60.69 in NY trading. Prices are being supported by reports that the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group is positioned in the Indian Ocean and capable of supporting military action against Iran. Additional support is coming from Mexico\u2019s decision to cancel an oil shipment bound for Cuba and from cold weather across large parts of the US.\nGold (XAUUSD) traded in a 5008.35-5101.10 range and is hovering near yesterday\u2019s highs as investors continue to sour on the US outlook.\nThe move was driven by Trump\u2019s latest tariff broadside, in which he accused South Korea of failing to honour its trade commitments and announced an increase in tariffs on autos, lumber, pharmaceuticals, and other goods from 15% to 25%.\nAsian equity markets brushed off the latest tariff rhetoric and closed higher, with Japan\u2019s Topix up 0.31%, the Hang Seng gaining 1.35%, and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 advancing 0.92%.\nAs of 7:20 am, European equities followed suit, with the UK FTSE 100 up 0.43%, France\u2019s CAC 40 higher by 0.36%, and Germany\u2019s DAX is flat.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is travelling to China for the first visit by a UK prime minister in eight years, seeking to recalibrate relations with Beijing. The trip has taken on added urgency following recent geopolitical tensions linked to Trump\u2019s comments on Greenland.\nUSDJPY bounced in a 153.19-154.88 range and is consolidating near the lower end of recent price action. Political uncertainty in Japan, sharply higher JGB yields, and lingering concern over potential Fed and Bank of Japan FX intervention continue to weigh on sentiment.\nAUDUSD inched higher in a 0.6902-0.6932 range and is pressing the top of that band. The pair is supported by broad US dollar softness, elevated gold prices, and stronger-than-expected NAB Consumer Confidence, which rose to +9 from +7 previously. Ongoing debate over whether the RBA could hike rates next week is also providing underlying support.\nUS Consumer Confidence and the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index are on tap.\n."

                "body": "Just a couple of weeks ago the Dollar was looking relatively strong, holding at a monthly high as we moved into the weekend. As I said in the Friday video, I was expecting President Trump to take a swing at the USD as he\u2019s been vocal in his desire for a weaker Dollar, and it wasn\u2019t long after that that ramped up tariff threats on Europe over Greenland had a fast impact on the USD after the weekly open. That led to a decisive sell-off in the early part of last week but it was another matter that took over on Friday, and that\u2019s an item that has continued to drive into today with DXY setting a fresh three-year-low.\nThis is also a familiar concept and something I had mentioned in that Friday video on the 16th. With both the US and Japan seemingly wanting a weaker spot rate in the USD/JPY pair, it made sense that we could see some force there. That arrived a week later, last Friday, as a Bank of Japan highlighting more rate cut potential drove an episode of carry trade unwind that\u2019s so far driven the USD down to a fresh three-year-low.\nPerhaps more impactful is the fact that USD/JPY strength has been a primary component that\u2019s kept DXY holding support over the past seven months, and now with the prospect of even more carry unwind that\u2019s a very big question mark.\nUS Dollar Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD Strategy\nChasing oversold fresh breakouts is a difficult way to go about trading strategy but on the same token, there\u2019s a difficult decision on the other side as to whether the move could be faded.\nWe must respect momentum and if looking for that weakness to continue, there\u2019s a couple of backdrops in EUR/USD and GBP/USD that could possibly be worked with.\nIn EUR/USD, the pair is similarly at a fresh three-year-high and price has already gotten close to the 1.2000 handle. There\u2019s now support potential around prior resistance of 1.1909-1.1919.\nEUR/USD Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/USD\nCable has been the pair I\u2019ve held as a more attractive venue for USD-weakness and it has similarly set a fresh multi-year high on the Dollar\u2019s breakdown this morning. The additional context here is the 1.2000 level in EUR/USD above, which is the type of major psychological level that can be difficult to slide through on the first attempt.\nMeanwhile, Cable has so far stalled after that touch of a fresh high and there\u2019s support potential at the prior point of resistance of 1.3728 followed by a zone from 1.3643-1.3683, after which a key zone rests from 1.3534-1.3568.\nGBP/USD Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/JPY 151.95\nIn yesterday\u2019s USD/JPY article I highlighted what I thought was the most important strategy parameter at the time, which was whether sellers would defend a bounce up to resistance at prior support, spanning from 154.45-155.00. That hit cleanly since then and at this point sellers have driven down to a fresh low.\nNotably, the high for the session printed right at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2025-2026 rally in the pair. That will come into play on the next chart\u2026\nUSD/JPY Four-Hour Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/JPY 151.95\nWith the pair seeing fresh selling it appears that the unwind scenario is not yet over, at least not yet. As to whether we get a similar backdrop as Q3, 2024 or whether this turns out to be an episode similar to the April-May pullback of that year remains to be seen. The big differentiator of those two episodes is Q3 incident was driven by the prospect of shifting rate expectations. The April-May version was still very much backed by the prospect of continued rate divergence between the US and Japan \u2013 and that was very much behind the motivation for longs that had ridden the rally to close positions.\nWe\u2019ve undoubtably seen at least some squaring up but the big question now is whether there\u2019s motivation for more lo"

Dips could remain contained while price respects the rising short-term average, with the broader trend supported by the medium-term EMA.\nThe momentum indicator 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 73.95 (overbought), which warns of stretched conditions that could slow upside.

A sustained break could open a fresh leg higher toward 1.4248, the highest since April 2018.\nSupport is seen at the nine-day EMA of 1.3626, followed by the lower rising wedge boundary around 1.3570. A break below the wedge would cause the emergence of a bearish bias and expose the 50-day EMA support at 1.3445.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "SEC\u2019s Caroline Crenshaw Exit Fuels Bitcoin and XRP Rally\u2014Why the All-Republican Panel Could Push Crypto Higher in 2026\nThe SEC\u2019s Caroline Crenshaw crypto saga ended on January 2, 2026, when the agency's last Democratic commissioner officially departed. Her exit removed the final internal resistance to clearer rules, faster approvals, and a softer enforcement posture. With an all-Republican panel now in control, investors are reassessing risk across Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) based on improved regulatory visibility rather than speculation.\nThis shift matters because regulation\u2014particularly the strong crypto opposition by Caroline Crenshaw\u2014had been the missing variable holding back institutional capital. As 2026 begins, the focus has moved from legal uncertainty to liquidity, ETFs, and macro alignment, setting the stage for a more structurally driven crypto cycle.\nCaroline Crenshaw's SEC Exit: What Changed on January 2?\nCaroline Crenshaw's departure marked the end of a long-running internal brake on crypto policy at the SEC. As the agency's lone Democratic commissioner, she consistently opposed crypto-related approvals\u2014from spot Bitcoin ETFs to XRP-linked products\u2014and publicly criticized the agency's decision to drop its appeal in the Ripple case. Her stance shaped years of regulatory caution and prolonged uncertainty.\nThat changed when her seat went vacant. The SEC now operates under a unified Republican majority, with no internal dissent blocking votes or softening enforcement direction. Chair Paul Atkins and Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda hold full decision-making control. The new face of the SEC signals clearer rulemaking, fewer surprise actions, and a departure from enforcement-first tactics that defined the Caroline Crenshaw era.\nHow Bitcoin and XRP Responded to the All-Republican SEC Panel\nThe market reaction\u2014particularly the Bitcoin and XRP rally\u2014following Crenshaw's exit reflected relief. Bitcoin moved steadily, climbing from around $88,000 to above $93,000 as regulatory uncertainty eased. The shift confirmed expectations already forming after her tenure expired, so the response stayed controlled.\nXRP told a different story. The token jumped 8% on January 3, reclaiming $2 for the first time since mid-December as long-standing regulatory pressure disappeared. XRP ETFs saw $13.59 million in inflows that day alone, pushing cumulative inflows past $1.3 billion since their November launch. Exchange balances also tightened, creating a supply squeeze that amplified demand.\nAlthough Bitcoin had already cleared its regulatory hurdles, XRP had not. Crenshaw's opposition had weighed directly on XRP-linked products, but her exit removed that ceiling overnight, allowing capital that had waited through 2025 to move quickly.\nWhy Crypto-Friendly Regulation Could Accelerate in 2026\nThe SEC's posture toward digital assets has changed in a measurable way. Enforcement activity slowed sharply after Paul Atkins took over, with most crypto-related cases quietly closed rather than expanded. This wasn't delayed action\u2014it was a deliberate shift away from enforcement as policy. With Crenshaw gone, internal resistance disappeared, allowing the agency to move in a single direction.\nWith Crenshaw gone, internal resistance disappeared entirely. The current Republican majority can advance rulemaking without dissents muddying intent or slowing timelines. Project Crypto, announced by Atkins in July 2025, aims to define what tokens are and how they should be regulated instead of leaving markets in limbo. Clear categories reduce guesswork for exchanges, custodians, and banks that previously stayed sidelined.\nThe SEC has outlined plans for a \"token taxonomy\" establishing digital commodities, network tokens, digital collectibles, and digital tools as non-securities. An \"innovation exemption\" is expected by early 2026, allowing crypto firms to launch tokens and products faster without full SEC registration.\nAdvertisement\nThe impa"

                "body": "In brief\n- The SEC dropped its Gemini Earn lawsuit earlier this week, adding to a list of many other cases already closed off.\n- So far, at least 17 other crypto cases have been closed or dropped under the new regulatory regime.\n- The agency now favors targeted enforcement based on investor harm, over symbolic or sweeping legal battles, Decrypt was told.\nSince U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s return to public office, the Securities and Exchange Commission has scaled back its crypto enforcement agenda. It has dropped cases, closed investigations, and changed what it prioritizes for enforcement.\nThe most prominent case to fall out of the docket so far is the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Gemini Trust Company.\nEarlier this week, the SEC, alongside Gemini\u2019s exchange now operating as Gemini Space Station, filed a joint stipulation to dismiss the Earn case after a \u201c100 percent in-kind return\u201d of investors\u2019 crypto assets.\nThe case was filed in early 2023 over its high-yield lending product, Gemini Earn. The exchange and its partner, Genesis Global Capital, were previously accused of offering unregistered securities. The bankruptcy process for the latter was set in motion in 2023.\nAfter years of negotiations between the regulator and the company, the case has now come to a resolution.\nThe SEC had also cleared Gemini of a separate investigation unrelated to the Earn program last year. That probe, which had lingered for nearly two years, was closed without enforcement action.\nThe SEC\u2019s changing stance on crypto\nThat decision coincided with a broader shift under new SEC leadership in 2025, which began softening and either dropping or pausing several crypto cases which have been regarded as regulatory overreach by the newly sworn in Trump administration at the time.\nThe year saw more cases dropped and investigations closed, with the SEC ending actions against at least 17 firms to date\u2014including Coinbase, Binance, Ripple, Gemini, Kraken, ConsenSys, Cumberland DRW, Robinhood, Uniswap, OpenSea, Crypto.com, Yuga Labs, Immutable, Helium, PayPal, Aave, and Ondo Finance\u2014as well as several other individual enforcement cases.\nMost involved staking products, token listings, or wallet infrastructure, and were closed without penalties or further action.\nThe decisions were viewed as part of a broader directive under SEC Chair Paul Atkins to end legacy investigations inherited from the Gensler era, in which the industry faced a so-called war on crypto.\nA \u201ctactical experiment\u201d on enforcement\nIndustry observers say the SEC is backing off broad crackdowns and focusing instead on cases where the agency sees clear harm or unresolved risk.\nThe SEC appears to be \u201ctesting a more selective, risk-based enforcement approach,\u201d and is moving to a \u201ctactical experiment\u201d where \u201cenforcement is being deliberately restrained,\u201d Alice Frei, head of security and compliance at crypto agency Outset, told Decrypt.\nThese dismissals \u201cindicate the SEC is recalibrating its enforcement playbook, moving away from headline driven crypto cases,\u201d Leo Fan, founder and CEO of on-chain compute platform Cysic, told Decrypt.\nThe moves show the agency is pursuing \u201clegal certainty and economic competitiveness, acknowledging that enforcement alone is not an effective framework for governing decentralised technologies,\u201d Fan added.\nIt could also be \u201ca change in enforcement posture,\u201d Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Human.tech, told Decrypt, adding that the SEC appears to be \u201cdeprioritizing legacy crypto cases where investor harm has already been resolved and where continued litigation offers limited regulatory upside.\u201d\n\u201cThe underlying securities framework has not been rewritten, but the agency is signaling greater discretion in how and when it applies it to crypto,\u201d El Damaty said.\nChanges in the agency\u2019s posture \"coincided with the passing of the GENIUS Act,\" Sri Balan Krishnan, associate legal counsel at decentralized AI platform Pundi AI, told Decrypt.\n\u201cWe now have clarity and certainty over the do's and "

Sign up here.\nThere\u2019s a consensus that quantum computers will be able to break the encryption that puts the \u201ccrypto\u201d in \u201ccryptocurrency.\u201d The only disagreement is over when, exactly, that will happen.\nWhile that debate is currently raging in Bitcoin land, it has already become a priority in Ethereum land.\nLast week, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake said the Swiss nonprofit had established a post-quantum team led by researcher Thomas Coratger, who earned a PhD in applied maths with a focus on the automotive and aeronautic industries.\nThe decision follows what Drake called \u201cyears of quiet R&D.\u201d That begs the question: If the EF had been studying the threat of quantum computing for years, why create a dedicated team now?\n\u201cTimelines are accelerating,\u201d Drake said.\nIn October, Google released new research which it claims brings quantum computing much closer to being used in real-world applications.\nWhile many believe the threat to blockchains is a decade away, others are more alarmed by the pace of development.\nIn November, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned that quantum computers could break the blockchain\u2019s encryption before the next US presidential election in 2028.\nGiven the sway he holds within the EF, his fear may explain its decision to double down on quantum research this year.\nIn addition to the creation of the post-quantum team, Drake said there would be new, bi-weekly calls in which Ethereum developers would discuss quantum security.\nThe EF is offering a new $1 million prize to anyone who can help harden quantum-resistant cryptography.\nAnd a soon-to-be-released website will detail a post-quantum strategy for Ethereum that \u201ctargets a full transition in coming years with zero loss of funds and zero downtime,\u201d according to Drake.\nHe also suggested artificial intelligence will play a big role in the coming work. Two weeks ago, a researcher at the foundation ran a maths-focused AI for eight hours, after which it solved \u201cone of the hardest lemmas in the foundations of hash-based snarks,\u201d something he called \u201cmind-blowing.\u201d\n\u201cApplied cryptography will never be the same,\u201d he said.\nThe EF isn\u2019t the only organisation in the Ethereum sphere to announce plans to prepare for a quantum world.\nKarl Floersch, co-founder of Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Optimism, said his company, OP Labs, would swap out certain quantum-vulnerable technology within the next 10 years.\n\u201cUsers don\u2019t need to take any action today,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis announcement is about setting expectations and timelines.\u201d\nThe exact quantum-resistant technology Optimism chooses will depend in large part on what Ethereum does, Floersch said. To that end, he\u2019s been talking to engineers at the EF.\n\u201cThe final choice of schemes and timelines will be a community decision, but our position is clear: PQ\u2011safe consensus is not optional.\u201d\nTop DeFi stories of the week\nThis week in DeFi governance\nVOTE: CoW DAO votes to fund developer team\nVOTE: GnosisDAO votes to enable ranked-choice voting\nVOTE: GMX DAO votes to fund development team\nPost of the week\nAccording to L2BEAT, there are more than 100 chains that claim to function as a layer 2 blockchain for Ethereum.

Sign up now!\nVibe Check: Ethereum is back in the spotlight, and the market is acting like it just remembered who actually powers most of crypto. Price action has been delivering aggressive swings, with sharp pushes upward followed by ruthless shakeouts that liquidate overleveraged traders in seconds. We are not in a sleepy range; this is a full-on volatility arena.\nBecause the latest data timestamp cannot be fully confirmed for today\u2019s session, we need to zoom out from exact ticks and focus on structure. The ETH chart is showing powerful impulse moves followed by corrective pullbacks that keep traders guessing whether this is a healthy bullish reset or the calm before a deeper flush. On shorter timeframes, Ethereum has been making strong attempts to reclaim previous resistance zones and convert them into support, while on higher timeframes it is still battling to prove that the last major rally was not just another exit pump for early whales.\nGas fees have also reminded everyone that Ethereum is still Ethereum. During peak activity windows, transaction costs have spiked dramatically, punishing smaller traders and pushing retail users back toward cheaper Layer-2s and rival chains. Every time we see a surge in NFT activity, memecoin mania, or DeFi rotations, gas fees jump, and the classic debate returns: is this sustainable, or is Ethereum slowly pricing out its own community?\nThe real risk right now is psychological. Sentiment has flipped from apathy to cautious excitement. Many traders who swore off altcoins are suddenly drawing trendlines on ETH again, talking about the \"Flippening\" narrative, and speculating whether Ethereum can eventually overtake Bitcoin in total ecosystem dominance, if not strictly in market cap. But with that optimism comes danger: if this move fails to follow through, late chasers could get brutally rekt by a sharp liquidity grab that wipes out their positions while whales quietly reload lower.\nThe Narrative: What is actually driving Ethereum right now? The fundamental story is bigger than just one pump or dump. Recent coverage out of the crypto press has been dominated by a few recurring themes: Layer-2 scaling, regulatory uncertainty, institutional interest, and the evolving role of Ethereum as \"internet infrastructure\" rather than just another coin.\nCoinDesk\u2019s Ethereum coverage has been heavily focused on the expansion of Layer-2 ecosystems: rollups, optimistic solutions, zk-powered scaling, and new chains that settle back to Ethereum for security. This narrative is crucial. Instead of trying to fix everything at Layer-1, the Ethereum roadmap leans into modularity: Ethereum becomes a settlement and security layer, while cheaper high-throughput chains handle the user-facing activity. That is bullish for long-term viability, but it also creates short-term confusion for traders: if everything moves to Layer-2s, who captures the value, the L2 tokens or ETH itself?\nAt the same time, coverage around regulatory developments and potential spot or derivatives-based Ethereum products continues to shape institutional behavior. Any hint of progress on Ethereum-related exchange-traded products, ETF-like structures, or clearer guidance from regulators about whether ETH is a commodity or a security can trigger waves of risk-on or risk-off flows. This is not just about DeFi degens anymore; fund managers, structured-product desks, and larger capital allocators are watching Ethereum as a core part of the digital asset stack.\nVitalik and the core dev community are still pushing upgrades aimed at boosting scalability, improving security, and optimizing the economics of staking and transaction inclusion. Each improvement reinforces the idea that Ethereum is not a static asset but a constantly evolving tech platform. However, that also means technical r"

This initiative enhances liquidity access and user experience in DeFi and CeFi sectors. Users can now easily deploy $MNT on Solana through Byreal's DEX, earning incentives and benefiting from low transaction fees.\nBybit, Mantle, and Byreal have introduced Mantle Super Portal, a new cross-chain system designed to expand $MNT access on Solana. The launch marks a strategic move to connect Ethereum liquidity, Solana\u2019s DeFi markets, and centralized exchange infrastructure through a single framework. Consequently, Mantle positions $MNT as a flexible asset that moves across networks without fragmenting liquidity or user experience.\nAccording to the press release, the new infrastructure allows users to bridge $MNT from Ethereum directly to Solana through one interface. Additionally, users can deploy liquidity into Solana-native markets on Byreal while accessing exchange incentives on Bybit Alpha.\nThis structure creates a continuous capital loop between on-chain protocols and centralized trading venues. Hence, Mantle strengthens its multichain distribution strategy while targeting both DeFi and CeFi participants.\nMantle Super Portal Connects Capital Across Ecosystems\nMantle designed Super Portal to simplify cross-chain capital movement while maintaining speed and execution reliability. By abstracting technical complexity, the system allows $MNT to function as a natively interoperable asset.\nMoreover, users can access Solana liquidity without navigating fragmented bridges or separate workflows. This approach supports Mantle\u2019s broader goal of linking real-world assets with on-chain markets efficiently.\nSignificantly, the portal supports direct Ethereum-to-Solana transfers for $MNT. Users can then deploy funds across decentralized protocols or centralized platforms seamlessly. As a result, capital flows remain fluid across ecosystems where liquidity and trading activity concentrate.\n$MNT Enters Solana DeFi Through Byreal\nFollowing the portal launch, $MNT became available on Byreal, a Solana-native decentralized exchange incubated by Bybit. Liquidity providers can supply the MNT\u2013USDC pool and earn incentives totaling 96,000 $MNT over three months. Additionally, Solana\u2019s low fees and fast settlement enhance capital efficiency for $MNT holders.\nSolana\u2019s ecosystem also supports this expansion. Ramzy Ali, DeFi Growth Lead at the Solana Foundation, said, \u201cSolana was built to support internet capital markets at scale: enabling price discovery for every asset on-chain, 24/7, and globally.\u201d He added, \u201cThe integration through Mantle Super Portal allows users to leverage Solana's DeFi ecosystem, connecting assets to highly composable markets designed for speed, liquidity, and global participation.\u201d\nBybit Alpha Extends the CeDeFi Loop\nMeanwhile, Bybit Alpha now supports $MNT trading with Solana deposits and withdrawals enabled through Mantle Super Portal. Users can combine on-chain yield opportunities with exchange-based incentives and fee savings. Consequently, the setup reinforces a unified CeDeFi experience.\nBybit, Mantle, and Byreal Expand $MNT Access to Solana Through New Cross-Chain Portal\nShare:\nBybit, Mantle, and Byreal launched the Mantle Super Portal, allowing $MNT to move seamlessly between Ethereum and Solana.

                "body": "London, UK, January 26, 2026 Slothana ($SLOTH), the Solana-based memecoin, has seen its community establish dedicated online resources to support ongoing engagement and onboarding. In an industry notorious for \"rug pulls\" and communities that evaporate the moment the chart turns red, an anomaly has emerged on the Solana blockchain. Slothana ($SLOTH), a project that by all traditional metrics should have struggled in the current market, is currently staging one of the most confusing\u2014and inspiring\u2014grassroots movements in crypto history. The narrative is supposed to be simple: The price dips, and the community dissolves. But for the 23,000+ holders of $SLOTH, the script has been flipped. The \"Anti-Panic\" Phenomenon Over 600 days after its launch, the Slothana community has done the unthinkable: they stayed. Instead of panic selling, the core community\u2014forged in the fires of a grueling market\u2014has hardened into a diamond-handed collective. What started as a standard speculative play for thousands of presale buyers has evolved into a fascinating social experiment in digital resilience. \"We all came here chasing a quick win,\" admits one long-time community member. \"But when the hype settled and the official channels went quiet, the people who were left realized we actually shared a vision. We stopped looking at the chart and started looking at the chat. That\u2019s when the real project started.\" \"We all came here chasing a quick win,\" admits one long-time community member. \"But when the hype settled and the official channels went quiet, the people who were left realized we actually shared a vision.

We stopped looking at the chart and started looking at the chat. That\u2019s when the real project started.\" From Bagholders to Builders With the original developers remaining silent, the community has effectively seized the destiny of the project. This is not a formal DAO, neither is it a CTO, it is something pretty unique that has yet to get its own three letters title, NAP? Grassroots Marketing: The community successfully crowdfunded its own PR campaign to reignite momentum\u2014a rarity for a project operating without official dev backing. Self-Made Ecosystem: Community developers and creatives have built their own onboarding tools, including a dedicated LinkTree and the \"Slothonomics\" educational hub, designed to guide newcomers through the ecosystem. The \"Slow\" Philosophy: In a market obsessed with speed, $SLOTH holders have embraced their mascot\u2019s nature. The \"Slow and Steady\" mantra has transformed from a meme into a legitimate investment thesis, creating a psychological safe harbor for investors tired of the high-stress, 24/7 anxiety of the crypto market.

However, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%.\nYesterday, the three indexes finished higher, with the Dow adding more than 300 points, to begin a busy week of tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) stock ended nearly 20% lower after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed raising Medicare Advantage payment rates by just 0.09%, well below expectations. UnitedHealth also issued a soft fiscal 2026 revenue projection along with fiscal fourth-quarter results that mostly met estimates.\nOther health-insurer stocks sank, with Humana (HUM) dropping 21% and Centene (CNC), Elevance Health (ELV), and CVS Health (CVS) down more than 10% apiece.\nHowever, chip stocks advanced Tuesday, lifting the Nasdaq and S&P 500.

In fact, the economy is on track to grow at a blistering 5.4% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the fastest since the rebound from the pandemic recession, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDP Now tracker.\n\"Consumer sentiment has become unusually divorced from the macroeconomy since the pandemic,\" Bernard Yaros, Lead US Economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a commentary. \"Understanding this disconnect is important because forecasters have historically looked to consumer surveys for additional useful information on consumption trends.\"\nThe main reason economists believe the economy is solid is that the main engine"

                "body": "US stock futures had a mixed start to the session on Wednesday, January 28. Markets shifted their attention to Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference and key earnings results.\nMarket optimism over tech stock earnings has sent the Nasdaq 100 E-mini futures and the S&P 500 E-mini futures toward their all-time highs.\nDespite the mixed morning, lingering bets on a Fed rate cut in H1 2026 and upbeat sentiment toward upcoming earnings support a bullish medium-term outlook for US index futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.\nThe Asian markets reacted to President Trump\u2019s overnight speech on January 28, driving demand for US stock futures.\nSpeaking at a highly anticipated rally in Iowa, President Trump hinted at sharply lower interest rates, stating:\n\u201cI will announce it soon! You will see rates come down a lot.\u201d\nThe US President also triggered a US Dollar sell-off, sending the US Dollar Index to its lowest level since February 2022. When asked about the weaker US Dollar, Trump reportedly quipped:\n\u201cThe Value of the Dollar is great.\u201d\nThe Kobeissi Letter commented on President Trump\u2019s reaction to the weaker US Dollar, stating:\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clear signal that President Trump is willing to tolerate a weaker Dollar to push rates lower and boost US exports.\u201d\nUS futures saw a mixed Asian session on January 28. The Dow Jones E-mini was flat, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini advanced 144 points and 18 points, respectively. Market bets on the Mag-7 topping earnings estimates boosted demand for tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.\nLater on Wednesday, the Fed interest rate decision and Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference are the main events on the economic calendar. Hints at an H1 2026 rate cut would likely fuel demand for risk assets. A more dovish Fed rate path would support the bullish short- to medium-term outlook for US equity futures.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a June Fed rate cut has plunged from 83.4% on December 26 to 65% on January 27. Strong US labor market data and sticky inflation have curbed bets on a June cut. However, Powell could change the narrative if he sees inflation cooling in the near term. Uncertainty about Powell\u2019s policy outlook may induce some market volatility in the lead-up to the press conference.\nMeanwhile, the Magnificent Seven will also be under the spotlight as investors assess the outlook for AI-linked stocks. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) are on the earnings calendar. Strong earnings and positive outlooks would likely overshadow Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference, sending the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 to new highs.\nThe steady morning session left the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini trading above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs indicated a bullish bias, aligning with favorable fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on tariff headlines, earnings, Fed Chair Powell, and US economic indicators. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook remains bullish. Lingering bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and market optimism over Q4 tech earnings reaffirm the bullish outlook. These bullish fundamentals align with technicals for US equity futures.\nHowever, several events would challenge the bullish medium-term outlook, including:\nIn summary, the robust US economy, a dovish Fed rate path, strong earnings, and a cautiously hawkish BoJ reaffirm a bullish short- and medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nHowever, traders should closely monitor BoJ chatter, yen intervention threats, and USD/JPY trends. Hawkish BoJ chatter, a dovish Fed Chair, and more intervention warnings could send USD/JPY sharply lower, potentially triggering an unwind of yen carry trades. USD/JPY rose 0.39% to 152.757, supporting US risk assets.\nDespite risks of an unwind of yen carry trades, US stock futures rema"

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic European suspense mode: not in a euphoric melt-up, not in a full-blown panic, but stuck in a tense trading range where every headline about the ECB, energy prices, or German industry hits like a mini shockwave. The index has recently swung between strong rallies and sharp intraday pullbacks, showing that both bulls and bears are very much awake.\nMomentum traders are watching the price action closely: every push higher gets met with profit taking, but every dip attracts buyers who still believe in the long-term strength of German blue chips. Volatility isn\u2019t insane, but it is elevated enough that breakout chasers and dip buyers alike can get punished if they are on the wrong side of the move for even a few hours.\nThe Story: To understand what is really going on with the DAX 40, you need to look beyond the chart and into the European macro engine room.\n1. ECB and Rates \u2013 The Central Bank Overhang\nThe European Central Bank is still the main puppet master for the DAX. Markets are obsessing over the path of interest rates: will the ECB keep policy tight to crush inflation, or pivot more aggressively to support a slowing economy? Traders are pricing in a scenario where inflation has come off its brutal peaks, but not enough for the ECB to fully relax. That creates a delicate balance: higher-for-longer rates weigh on valuations, but any hint of a dovish tilt sparks a powerful relief rally across European equities.\nChristine Lagarde\u2019s tone in recent speeches and press conferences has stayed cautious. She acknowledges progress on inflation, but the message is: do not expect a reckless rate-cutting fiesta. For the DAX, that means the market is trading every macro data release as a binary event \u2013 strong inflation data or hawkish central bank language and growth-sensitive sectors like autos, chemicals, and industrials feel the heat. Softer inflation or hints of easing, and suddenly the dip looks like a gift.\n2. German Economy \u2013 Industrial Giant Or Slow-Motion Recession?\nGermany, the core of the DAX story, is still wrestling with structural headaches. Manufacturing is no longer firing on all cylinders. PMI readings and factory orders have repeatedly signaled pressure, with global demand for machinery, autos, and chemicals not as explosive as in previous cycles.\nEnergy is another key factor. The worst of the European energy shock may be behind us, but prices remain a competitive disadvantage versus the U.S., where cheap energy keeps industry more flexible. That weighs particularly on energy-intensive German sectors. Still, the market is forward-looking: if energy prices stabilize and governments keep support mechanisms in place, investors may start to look through the weakness and price in a slow industrial recovery rather than doom.\n3. Euro vs Dollar \u2013 FX Is The Silent DAX Driver\nThe euro\u2019s relationship with the dollar is a big, underestimated driver for the DAX 40. A weaker euro tends to help German exporters: their products become cheaper abroad, and foreign revenues translate into higher euro profits. A stronger euro, on the other hand, can compress margins and pressure earnings.\nRight now, traders are watching the euro like a secondary chart overlay on the DAX. Any move driven by shifting expectations about the Federal Reserve versus the ECB instantly changes the narrative. If the Fed turns more dovish while the ECB remains cautious, the euro could strengthen, which might cap the upside for export-heavy DAX names. If the opposite happens and the euro softens, DAX bulls will argue that export tailwinds justify buying the dips.\n4. Se"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic tug-of-war mode: German blue chips are dancing around important zones, with bulls trying to defend the uptrend while bears sell into every bounce. No clean breakout, no brutal crash \u2013 just that dangerous, deceptive phase where traders get chopped up if they don\u2019t have a plan.\nEuropean stocks are reacting to a cocktail of factors: shifting expectations on European Central Bank (ECB) rate cuts, stubborn inflation pockets, fragile German industrial output, and constant headlines about global growth, shipping disruptions, and geopolitics. The DAX is not collapsing, but it is clearly struggling to extend the previous strong rally, and that alone tells you big money is in wait-and-see mode.\nThe Story: Let\u2019s zoom out from the 5-minute chart and look at the real drivers behind the current DAX mood.\n1. ECB, Rates and the Euro: The Oxygen of the Rally\nThe ECB is still the main puppet master here. Markets have shifted from a straight-line \"rate cuts incoming\" narrative to a more cautious \"maybe fewer, maybe later\" mindset. Whenever traders price in faster or bigger rate cuts, European equities and the DAX tend to catch a bid. When those hopes fade, the momentum stalls and profit taking kicks in.\nA stronger euro can be a headwind for big German exporters, especially the auto and industrial names that live and die by global demand and currency moves. A softer euro helps their competitiveness but often signals growth worries. Right now, the euro-dollar dynamic is sending mixed signals: not a full-on crisis, but not a clean green light either. That uncertainty feeds directly into the sideways, choppy tone of the DAX.\n2. German Economy: Industrial Giant With A Headache\nGermany is still the industrial heart of Europe, but that heart has been under pressure. Manufacturing data has been wobbling between weak and just-okay, with survey-based indicators flashing lingering recession vibes. The energy shock from the past years still casts a long shadow: higher structural energy costs make German heavy industry less competitive compared to regions with cheaper power.\nInvestors know this. So every new data release on factory orders, PMI, or industrial production can flip the daily narrative from \"Germany is stabilizing\" to \"Germany is stagnating\" within hours. That is why the DAX reacts aggressively to macro numbers even when the index itself does not break out in one direction. Under the hood, sector rotation is wild while the headline index hides the real battle.\n3. The Auto Story: VW, BMW, Mercedes & The EV Arms Race\nGerman autos are still the backbone of the DAX. But the game has changed: they are fighting on three fronts at once \u2013 the EV transition, price wars (especially with China), and stricter regulations. Any hint of softer demand, rising costs, or political tension instantly spills over into the index mood.\nWhen auto names show resilience, the DAX suddenly looks like a value plus quality play again. When they stumble, international money rotates into US tech or other themes, and the DAX feels heavy. Traders need to watch these giants as sentiment barometers: they often lead the daily moves, even when the index itself looks calm.\n4. Energy Prices & Geopolitics: The Pain Trade\nEnergy prices remain a joker card. Spikes in gas or oil \u2013 driven by geopolitical risks or supply disruptions \u2013 hit Europe harder than many other regions. For Germany, with its energy-intensive industry, rising input costs squeeze margins and force investors to slash growth expectations.\nWhenever energy calms down, you see a relief bid into cyclical sectors and indus"

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is moving in a tense, emotionally charged zone right now. Instead of an explosive melt-up or a brutal crash, the index is locked in a choppy battlefield where every macro headline sparks sudden moves. German blue chips are swinging between cautious optimism and sharp risk-off phases as traders weigh recession fears against the hope of an eventual policy pivot and recovery.\nThis is not a calm, low-volatility drift. It is an environment of reactive spikes, hungry dip buyers, and quick profit taking. The DAX is trading in a broad, contested region that feels like a coiled spring: either a breakout toward new optimism, or a deeper correction if growth data keeps disappointing.\nThe Story: To understand what is really driving the DAX 40 right now, you have to zoom out and think in three dimensions: ECB policy, German macro data, and global risk appetite.\n1. ECB and the Rate Game\nThe European Central Bank remains the key puppet master over European risk assets. After the aggressive rate-hike cycle to crush inflation, markets are now obsessed with the timing and speed of potential rate cuts.\nInflation in the euro area has cooled from its extremes, but core price pressures and wage dynamics are still making the ECB nervous. That means traders are constantly repricing expectations: one day the market is dreaming of early, faster cuts; the next day, a hawkish comment from an ECB official sends yields higher and hits equity sentiment.\nFor the DAX, this is critical. Many of Germany\u2019s heavyweights are interest-rate sensitive: cyclical industrials, exporters, and auto names. When the market believes in a gentler rate path and softer yields, these stocks get a tailwind. When rate-cut hopes are pushed further out, the mood shifts to caution, especially in sectors like construction, real estate related plays, and levered cyclicals.\n2. German Economy: Industrial Hangover And Energy Reality\nGermany is still dealing with an industrial hangover. Manufacturing data has been mixed to weak, with factory orders and PMI readings sending a message of sluggish demand and cautious corporate planning. Global trade is not in full sprint, and Germany, as an export machine, feels that instantly.\nThe energy shock from the past years has not fully disappeared either. While gas prices have eased from the extreme crisis levels, energy in Europe remains structurally more expensive and less predictable than before. That eats into margins for heavy industry and undermines the classic German advantage: high-quality output at competitive cost.\nAll of this translates into a DAX that is constantly negotiating between two stories:\n- The bearish story: weak industrial output, recession chatter, and margin pressure.\n- The bullish story: global demand stabilises, energy prices are manageable, and companies have already cut costs, setting up operating leverage once volumes return.\n3. Euro vs. Dollar: FX As A Silent Driver\nThe euro\u2013dollar rate is another silent force shaping the DAX narrative. When the euro weakens against the dollar, German exporters become more competitive abroad in dollar terms, which can boost earnings translated back into euros. A softer euro often acts as a stealth support for the DAX\u2019s global champions in autos, chemicals, and industrial tech.\nConversely, when the euro strengthens sharply, those FX tailwinds fade. In a fragile growth environment, that can be enough to cap rallies and trigger bouts of profit taking. Right now, the FX backdrop is more of a tactical battlefield than a clear long-term trend: moves are driven by shifting expectations betwee"

I will continue to serve as D.C.\u2019s Warrior on the Hill until the end of my current term,\" she added.\nThe announcement comes two days after Norton's team filed a termination report with the FEC, signaling an end to her campaign. It follows months of chatter about her declining health, causing a stir after she insisted last summer she would run for re-election, a statement her own staff disputed at the time.\nEven some of Norton's allies had suggested it's time for her to go. Some supporters noted that she had taken a step back from the spotlight, arguing that the District needed a representative who would be more active in protecting D.C. sovereignty, advancing the fight for statehood and battling recent moves by President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress to reverse local laws in the deep-blue city.\nWhile Washington, D.C.'s delegate cannot vote on the House floor, they can serve on and vote in committees and play an active role in drafting and shaping legislation. They can also speak on the floor.\nIn the statement announcing her retirement, Norton\u2019s office touted achievements throughout her career like \u201cthe revitalization of entire sections of the city \u2014 the Wharf, Capitol Riverfront, NOMA, Walter Reed and St. Elizabeths West campus for the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d as well as \u201cthe transfer of the RFK Stadium site to the District of Columbia,\u201d along with education programs.\nThe 2026 election in Washington, D.C., includes an array of candidates who have already jumped in to replace Norton \u2014 city council members, a former legislative staffer to Norton and other former congressional aides.\n\u201cThank you to my constituents for choosing and trusting me to fight for you in Congress 18 times,\" Norton said in her statement. \"I will leave this institution knowing that I have given you everything I have.
