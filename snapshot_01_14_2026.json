                "body": "Gold prices are holding above $4,600 as soft U.S. inflation data, rising geopolitical tensions, and bullish technical patterns support a continued rally toward $5,000 for gold and a potential breakout above $100 for silver.\nGold (XAUUSD) prices are trending higher above $4,600 in early Asian trading. This rally followed the softer-than-expected US inflation data.\nThe inflation rate over the year was 2.7% and the core inflation rate was 2.6% as shown in the chart below. These numbers were the same as and in line with market expectations.\nMoreover, the United States consumer prices increased by 0.3% month-on-month in December 2025 in line with market expectations and repeating the increase from September.\nTraders raised bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year. These expectations helped the gold and silver (XAGUSD) rally and increased the demand of precious metals. The focus is now on new data for confirmation.\nMoreover, geopolitical risks are also helping gold. Iran\u2019s crackdown on protests and US threats of intervention have increased tension in the markets. Traders move towards gold during periods of political unrest, which forces the demand for safe-haven.\nThe market is waiting for the U.S. Retail Sales and PPI data, which may add volatility. Stronger than expected numbers could boost the dollar and put pressure on gold in the short term. However, if inflation cools, gold may continue the rally.\nThe gold price is still in the beginning of a new bull run as seen on the daily chart below. It is observed that the price is trading near the lower edge of new ascending broadening wedge pattern and looks set to surge above $5,000 level in 2026.\nThe 50-day and 200-day SMAs also point to continued upward movement. The immediate resistance is at $4,800 level, and it still seems likely to break out above $4,800. Moreover the RSI is rebounding from the mid-level in January 2026, which indicates continued upside momentum in gold.\nThe 4-hour chart for spot gold shows that the price has formed a bottom at the support of the ascending triangle pattern at $4,360. After reaching $4,360, the price has formed an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and spiked above $4,600 level. The consolidation above $4,600 indicates the continuation of upward momentum this week.\nSilver is approaching the short term target of $90 to $100 level. However, the continued geopolitical tensions in the Middle East suggest that silver will likely continue to go higher in the coming weeks.\nA break above the $100 level will bring the larger prospect of a surge to the $300 level in the silver market. The formation of an ascending broadening wedge pattern points to heavy volatility and higher price ranges.\nThe 4-hour chart for spot silver also shows the formation of an ascending broadening wedge pattern, whereby a breakout above the $100 level will open the door for much higher levels in the silver market.\nThe price action within the ascending broadening wedge pattern is still bullish pattern, which is supported by formation of inverted head and shoulders patterns and a symmetrical broadening wedge pattern. As long as the $70 support level holds, the next move in the silver market may be a break above the $100 level.\nThe US Dollar Index is now trying to break above the 200-day SMA at 99.20 level. However, the price action is still in the neutral zone of 96.50 \u2013 100.50. A break in either of these levels will be the deciding factor for the next move in US Dollar Index.\nA break above 100.50 will be bullish with the 102 level as the target. However, a break below 96.50 will open the door for a move towards the 90 level.\nThe 4-hour chart for the USD Index shows strong consolidation between the 96.50 and 100.50 levels. As long as this sideways range holds, the next move in the USD Index is uncertain.\nMuhammad Umair is a finance MBA and engineering PhD.

OPEC production is covered in a separate post.\nBelow are a number of Crude plus Condensate (C + C) production charts, usually shortened to \u201coil\u201d, for the oil producing countries. The charts are created from data provided by the EIA\u2019s International Energy Statistics and are updated to September 2025. This is the latest and most detailed/complete World oil production information available. Information from other sources such as OPEC, IEA, STEO and country specific sites such as Brazil, Norway, Mexico, Argentina and China is reported to provide a one or two month outlook.\nThe World\u2019s September oil production increased by 737 kb/d to 86,033 kb/d, a new World Peak Oil All Time High. The large September C + C increase is due to the 792 kb/d increase in crude production shown in the crude graph. That increase then drops in January 2026. The large January drop is just as surprising as the September increase.\nThe January 2026 STEO was released today and it projects oil production out to December 2027.\nThis chart has been updated to project World C + C production out to December 2027. It uses the January 2026 STEO report along with the International Energy Statistics to make the projection. Production in October 2025 is projected to increase by 47 kb/d to 86,080 kb/d, if correct, another new World Peak Oil next month.\nThe 12 month Centred Moving Average shown at July 2027 is 85,378 kb/d vs the September 2018 12 month CMA of 82,962 kb/d.\nFor December 2027, production is projected to be 85,918 b/d.\nSeptember\u2019s World oil output W/O the US increased by 692 kb/d to 72,189 kb/d. October\u2019s production is expected to increase by 20 kb/d to 72,209 kb/d.\nThe projection is forecasting that December 2027 World W/O US oil production will be 72,759 kb/d, an increase of 570 kb/d from September 2025.\nA Different Perspective on World Oil Production\nSeptember\u2019s Big 3 oil production increased by 1,087 kb/d to 34,010 kb/d. Saudi Arabia contributed 900 kb/d to the increase while Russia added 143 kb/d.\nProduction in the remaining countries has been slowly increasing since the September 2020 low of 42,970 kb/d. However production dropped in September 2025 by 351 kb/d to 52,023 kb/d.\nCountries Expected to Grow Oil Production\nThis chart was first posted a number of months back and shows the combined oil production from five Non-OPEC countries, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Guyana and the U.S., whose oil production is expected to grow. These five countries are often cited by OPEC and the IEA for being capable of meeting the increasing World oil demand for next year. For these five countries, production from April 2020 to July 2025 rose at an average rate of 1,130 kb/d/year as shown by the orange OLS line.\nTo show the impact of US growth over the past 5 years, U.S. production was removed from the five countries and that graph is shown in red. The production growth slope for the remaining four countries has been reduced by 614 kb/d/yr to 516 kb/d/yr.\nSeptember production has been added to the five growers chart, up by 41 kb/d to 24,494 kb/d. September\u2019s small production increase was a mix of small gains and declines. For the Five growers W/O U.S., September production declined by 4 kb/d to 10,649 kb/d.\nOctober production is expected to grow again due to the large October Brazilian production increase.\nNote: The OLS lines are updated to July. 2025\nWorld Oil Countries Ranked by Production\nAbove are listed the World\u2019s 13th largest oil producing countries. In August 2025 these 13 countries produced 78.6% of the World\u2019s oil. On a MoM basis, production increased by 821 kb/d in these 13 countries while on a YOY basis production rose by 3,541 kb/d. Note the YoY increases from Saudi Arabia, U.S. and Brazil\nSeptember Non-OPEC Oil Production Charts\nSeptember\u2019s Non-OPEC oil production decreased by 76 kb/d to 55,106 kb/d. October is"

                "body": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s sudden enthusiasm for developing its vast shale resources -- led by the giant Jafurah basin -- is rooted in a hard?nosed mix of energy security, export optimisation, and geopolitical positioning. Riyadh wants to slash the crude it still burns for power, free up more barrels for export at a time of tight OPEC+ management, and secure new feedstock for its expanding petrochemicals and industrial base. At the same time, the Kingdom is acutely aware that the U.S. shale boom reshaped global energy markets and eroded OPEC\u2019s pricing power, and it is determined not to be left behind in the next phase of unconventional development. With Jafurah holding one of the world\u2019s largest unconventional gas endowments, Saudi Arabia is presenting the field as the cornerstone of a new era of domestic supply growth and future export potential, with a recent announcement that it will export its first condensate from Jafurah gas plant in February. That said, there is often a vast difference between Saudi Arabia\u2019s projections of key numbers, including oil reserves and production, and the reality, and a thorough analysis of the Jafurah project reveals deep shortcomings in is projections here too.\nWith around 229 trillion standard cubic feet (Tscf) of natural gas and 75 billion barrels of condensate, the US$100 ?billion Jafurah project is expected to produce 200 million standard cubic feet per day (Mscfd) of gas in Phase 1, with the figure set to rise to 2 billion standard cubic feet per day (Bscfd) by 2030. The projected numbers would mark around a 60% increase in Aramco\u2019s gas output capacity, while the company\u2019s ultimate goal is to boost its gas output by 80% by 2030. In large part, this will go to meeting domestic power demand, which is increasing by around 3-4% annually, with projections that it could reach at least 2.5 times today\u2019s level by 2050. It may well be higher, in line with forecasts that artificial intelligence, cloud, and heatwave-driven power needs will drive 40-50% of incremental global gas demand to end-2040 at a minimum. Moreover, according to industry projections, by that point data centre-related demand could add 150\u2013200 billion cubic metres a year globally, a 3.6-4.9% increase over current global gas demand projections. Saudi Arabia intends to position itself as a key Middle Eastern player in this high?growth, geopolitically critical segment. Overall, Aramco has said its unconventional ?gas programme at peak production is expected to generate electricity equivalent to displacing 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil. Another positive for Saudi Arabia in this equation is that because Jafurah is primarily a gas project, it should not be counted in Saudi Arabia\u2019s OPEC output quota.\nRelated: Markets Price Chaos as Oil Finds Its Footing\nThis all looks great on paper, as do all of Saudi Arabia\u2019s key forecasts related to its oil and gas sector. But, as ever, the reality is somewhat different. The overriding reason for this is Saudi Arabia\u2019s influence in the world rests almost entirely on its oil and gas reserves and associated production numbers -- the larger these appear, the greater its geopolitical weight. Consequently, it has never been more in any country\u2019s interest to talk up anything than it is in Saudi Arabia\u2019s to overinflate these key figures, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. For example and starting from the very beginning, 1989 saw Saudi Arabia claim proven oil reserves of 170 billion barrels. But only a year later -- without the discovery of any major new oil fields or major verified reappraisals of reserves at existing fields -- the official estimate somehow grew by 51.2%, to 257 billion barrels. Shortly after that, and again without any major new discoveries, Saudi Arabia\u2019s proven reserves increased to just over 266 billion barrels, and they rose once more in 2017 to 268.5 billion barrels. Over the period in which these increases were announced, the country was extractin"

                "body": "EUR/USD remains steady as traders digest recent US inflation data, which aligns with market expectations. The Consumer Price Index rose by 0.3% in December, maintaining a steady year-on-year increase at 2.7%. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% month-on-month, below the expected 0.3%. Yearly core inflation held steady at 2.6%, slightly below the 2.7% forecast.\nFederal Reserve Policy Outlook\nThe softening in core inflation suggests no immediate upside pressure on overall inflation, aligning with the Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious outlook. Markets anticipate two rate cuts this year, but the Federal Reserve is expected to keep its rates unchanged through the first quarter. Mixed labour data, with a declining Unemployment Rate and weaker Nonfarm Payrolls, supports this perspective.\nAttention shifts towards upcoming speeches by Federal Reserve officials for further policy cues. The US Dollar showed mixed performances, weakening slightly against the Euro and Canadian Dollar while gaining against the Japanese Yen. The foreign exchange market heat map illustrates the percentage changes of major currencies against one another, highlighting the relative shifts in currency strength.\nThe latest US inflation report, with core CPI coming in at 2.6%, confirms the Federal Reserve will not be rushed into cutting rates. We should therefore expect the current period of consolidation in EUR/USD around the 1.1667 level to persist in the coming weeks. This stability presents a clear opportunity for specific derivative plays.\nLooking back, this steady environment is the result of the Fed\u2019s work throughout 2025 to bring inflation down from higher levels. This is a stark contrast to the volatility we saw in early 2024, when the market was first trying to price in the timing of the Fed\u2019s pivot away from its peak 5.50% interest rate. The current data shows that the disinflationary trend is intact but slow, reinforcing the Fed\u2019s patient stance.\nDerivative Trading Opportunities\nFor derivatives traders, this low-volatility, range-bound market is ideal for income-generating options strategies. With the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) likely to remain subdued, similar to the low teens we saw for much of 2024, selling premium becomes attractive. We should consider selling short-dated EUR/USD strangles or iron condors to capitalize on price stagnation and time decay.\nAt the same time, we must watch for outliers like the USD/JPY exchange rate, which is pushing towards 159.00. This is a level that has historically triggered verbal and physical intervention from Japanese authorities, as we witnessed back in late 2024. Buying cheap, out-of-the-money put options on USD/JPY could serve as a cost-effective hedge against a sudden, sharp reversal.\nThe primary risk to this quiet market is a shift in communication from Fed officials Musalem and Barkin later today. Any new emphasis on last week\u2019s softer Nonfarm Payrolls data could spook markets into repricing rate cut probabilities. We will need to listen carefully to their speeches for any change in tone from the established cautious outlook."

                "body": "The EUR/USD pair stabilised around 1.1658 on Tuesday, following a period of volatility over the preceding two sessions.\nMarket focus remains firmly on the forthcoming US inflation data, which is expected to provide crucial clarity on the future path of Federal Reserve policy. Currently, the market is pricing in two rate cuts this year, with the first anticipated in June. However, any upside surprise in inflation could significantly temper expectations for policy easing.\nSupporting a more dovish outlook was last week\u2019s disappointing Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report for December, which revealed weaker-than-expected job growth.\nInvestors are also monitoring developments in the US Supreme Court, which is expected to rule on the legality of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy as early as Wednesday.\nEarlier this week, the US dollar faced additional headwinds following reports that Fed Chair Jerome Powell could face scrutiny over his congressional testimony related to a building renovation project. This has raised concerns, albeit limited, regarding the perceived independence of the Federal Reserve.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD\nH4 Chart:\nOn the H4 chart, the pair is forming a corrective retracement within the context of the second downward impulse. The immediate corrective target stands at 1.1700. Once this correction concludes, we anticipate the resumption of the downtrend, with the next bearish target at 1.1555. This scenario is supported by the MACD indicator, whose signal line is below zero and pointing decisively downward, reinforcing the ongoing bearish momentum and potential for further downside.\nH1 Chart:\nOn the H1 chart, the market has completed a decline to 1.1655 and is now forming an upward corrective impulse towards 1.1700. Upon reaching this level, we expect a renewed wave of selling pressure to emerge. The Stochastic oscillator aligns with this view, as its signal line is currently below 20 but is turning upward towards 80, indicating room for a short-term rebound before the next potential decline.\nConclusion\nThe EUR/USD pair is in a holding pattern ahead of key US inflation data, which will likely dictate the near-term direction of the pair. While the technical structure remains bearish, a corrective bounce towards 1.1700 appears likely before sellers potentially regain control. A stronger-than-expected inflation print could reinforce the dollar\u2019s strength and accelerate the move towards 1.1555.\nDisclaimer:\nAny forecasts contained herein are based on the author\u2019s particular opinion.

The price is currently hovering around the 1.1670 level, so a bounce is possible before the downtrend resumes. Technically, the Fibonacci retracement tool indicates areas where bears might be waiting to re-enter. The decline could reach the 38.2% Fibonacci level at 1.1666, which coincides with a secondary resistance zone. The 50% level is located at 1.1680, while a larger retracement could test the 61.8% Fibonacci level at 1.1695, which is close to the downtrend line resistance.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nOverall, if any of these Fibonacci levels manage to halt the gains, the EUR/USD pair could resume its decline towards the lows of 1.1619 or lower. A sustained break below these levels could lead to a sharp decline in the currency pair's price. Regarding moving averages, the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) remains below the 200-day SMA, suggesting that the most likely trend is downward, or that selling pressure will gain too much momentum to reverse. Both indicators are above the current price action and could form dynamic resistance for any corrective attempts.\nHowever, the Stochastic oscillator is rising from the middle of its range, which could give buyers enough momentum to push for a near-term bounce. The indicator has room to rise before reaching overbought territory, meaning the correction could continue until then. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving sideways, reflecting bearish exhaustion and a chance of consolidation. However, a rise could attract more buyers in anticipation of a subsequent decline to Fibonacci levels.\nTrading Tips:\nThe EUR/USD pair can be affected by released economic data and statements from central bank officials, especially any changes in monetary policy expectations that could impact the strength of the US dollar. Be cautious before entering trades on this currency pair.\nThe future of Federal Reserve policies and their impact on EUR/USD trading\nBased on performance across top trading platforms, the EUR/USD exchange rate may see a significant improvement this week. It appears that the legal actions taken by the Trump White House against the Federal Reserve have halted the intense sell-off of the euro against the US dollar.\nAccording to currency market activity, the EUR/USD pair had fallen to a low of 1.1618 after 11 consecutive days of decline, but at the start of the trading week, it saw a notable rise of 0.50% to 1.1698, thanks to Trump's recent actions.\nAfter failing to heed Trump's demands for more aggressive US interest rate cuts, the Federal Reserve is now facing a lawsuit from the US Department of Justice regarding the costs of renovating its headquarters in Washington. The Justice Department has also threatened Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell with criminal charges in this case. Legal documents were filed on Friday, but these developments only came to light over the weekend.\nThe overall decline in the US dollar reflects financial markets' concerns about the future independence of the Federal Reserve. The White House's efforts to exert control over the Fed will have long-term implications for US monetary policy, as well as for the stability of the US financial market and economic growth.\nOf course, the short-term implications for the US central bank's policy, and consequently for the dollar, are unclear, as it is difficult to predict how the Fed's upcoming monetary policy decisions will be affect"

His comments raised concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence and exerted downward pressure on the U.S. dollar.\nAttention will now turn to the US CPI report for further clarity over the Fed's next move. CPI is expected to hold steady at 2.7% in December, while core CPI is expected to rise to 2.7%, up from 2.6%. Given data-collection issues in the November reading, the US CPI for December could come in hotter than expected.\nThe market is currently pricing in two rate cuts from the Fed compared to one rate cut guided by the US central bank. Higher-than-expected inflation could prompt the market to rein in expectations for rate cuts, which would boost the US dollar.\nThe Bank of England cut interest rates to 3.75% at its December meeting and is expected to reduce rates further in 2026, as inflation pressures persist and the UK labour market shows signs of weakness. However, the official line is that future decisions will be closed to calls.\nUK GDP data is due on Wednesday. The data follows figures released today by Barclays showing that UK consumers reined in spending in December by the most in five years. Separate figures from the British Retail Consortium also painted a weak picture of sales growth among retailers, which slowed for the 4th consecutive month in December.

Traders brace for the US Retail Sales and Producer Price Index (PPI) data later on Wednesday.\nThe US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.7% YoY in December, matching November\u2019s increase, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Tuesday. This figure aligned with the market consensus. Meanwhile, the core CPI, excluding fluctuating food and energy costs, increased by 2.6% YoY in December, versus November\u2019s 2.7% rise. This reading came in softer than the 2.7% expected.\n\u201cThe initial excitement sparked by a cooler-than-anticipated core CPI was short-lived,\u201d said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. \u201cThe reversal was influenced, in part, by the report\u2019s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell\u2019s December cut will be his last at the helm.\u201d\nRenewed concerns over the Federal Reserve (Fed) independence could drag the Greenback lower. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that the Fed has received subpoenas from the Justice Department over statements he made to Congress last summer on cost overruns for a $2.5 billion building renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in Washington. Powell termed the threats a \"pretext\" for putting pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates.\nHowever, a dovish stance from the BoE could undermine the Pound Sterling (GBP) against the USD. The Bank of England (BoE) cut its interest rate to 3.75% in the December policy meeting and is expected to implement further reduction in 2026 as inflation eases, though officials note future decisions will be \"closer calls.\u201d Many analysts believe the UK central bank will hold rates steady in February, with the next 0.25% cut most likely to occur in March or April this year.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if econo"

In the absence of domestic data, price action was driven largely by broader market sentiment.\nThat mood remained muddled. With risk appetite lacking conviction, the increasingly risk-sensitive Pound struggled to attract demand against both higher-risk currencies and traditional safe havens, as investors opted to stay cautious and avoid bold positioning.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar (USD) was also confined to a narrow range as traders digested the latest US consumer price index data.

With the data broadly matching projections, the report did little to alter expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, leaving the \u2018Greenback\u2019 without a clear directional impulse.\nA mixed global market backdrop further limited movement in the safe-haven currency, reinforcing USD\u2019s subdued performance.\nSave on Your GBP/USD Transfer\nGet better rates and lower fees on your next international money transfer.\nCompare TorFX with top UK banks in seconds and see how much you could save.\nGBP/USD Forecast: US Retail Sales and Central Bank Rhetoric in Focus\nLooking ahead, attention turns to Wednesday\u2019s US retail sales data. A rebound in consumer spending could offer the US Dollar some support, particularly if it suggests resilience in household demand.\nHowever, any USD gains may prove short-lived amid a packed schedule of speeches from Federal Reserve officials. If policymakers strike a broadly dovish tone, markets may revive expectations for further rate cuts, placing renewed pressure on the Dollar.\nFor the Pound, focus will be on comments from Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden. As one of the policymakers who backed a rate cut last month, any signals that he remains open to further easing could weigh on Sterling and influence the direction of GBP/USD.\nLike this piece?

The pair may further weaken as the US Dollar (USD) advances despite the softer inflation in the United States (US), hinting that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could indeed reduce interest rates as priced in by the financial markets.\nUS Core Consumer Price Index (CPI), excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in December, below market expectations, while annual core inflation held at 2.6%, matching a four-year low. The data provided a clearer sign of easing inflation after earlier releases were skewed by shutdown effects. However, last Friday\u2019s strong Nonfarm Payrolls report, a dip in the Unemployment Rate, and a solid four-week average ADP Employment Change point to a resilient labor market.\nHowever, the AUD/USD pair could gain ground as the Australian Dollar (AUD) may find support from rising expectations of further rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), following a solid rebound in Australia\u2019s Building Permits data.\nSeasonally adjusted approvals for total dwellings in Australia surged 15.2% month-on-month to a near four-year high of 18,406 units in November 2025, in line with the preliminary estimate. This marked a sharp reversal from the 6.1% decline in the previous month and represented the strongest monthly increase since May 2023.\nPersistent strength in housing demand may raise concerns at the RBA, as it could slow progress toward easing inflationary pressures and reinforce expectations of a more restrictive policy stance. This is despite a moderation in November inflation, which remains above the central bank\u2019s target.\nTraders will likely observe the Trade Balance data for December later in the day from China, Australia\u2019s close trading partner. Trade balance is expected to widen to $113.60B in December, compared to $111.68B in the previous reading. Exports are expected to rise by 3.0% YoY in December, while Imports are projected to increase by 0.9% YoY during the same period.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as e"

It is the only currency in the world breaking through its lows, US48 cents is possible\u2014and there is even a risk of a dip to US45 cents.\u201d\nPrime Minister John Howard argued that the fall was simply a reflection of the strength of the US dollar.\nExcept the AUD was also falling against the euro, yen and pound.\nThe situation looked dire and hinted at something amiss with the Australian economy.\nBack then, some observers linked the massive falls in the AUD to selling by Japanese banks, who were liquidating Aussie-denominated assets to avoid collapse.\nThroughout the 1990s, Japan was a major buyer of Australia\u2019s commodities, taking in around one-fifth of our exports.\nIts deep financial problems were having a significant impact on the Aussie Dollar.\nDrawing from that experience could one day be essential, given today\u2019s even heavier reliance on the Chinese market.\nBut I don\u2019t think we need to be concerned about that, not yet anyway.\nFor now, the Australian Dollar is trading closer to its all-time lows compared to its highs.\nAnother factor why we could be\nclose to a rebound in the AUD\nNote the chart below that my colleague, Nick Hubble, shared with me over the holiday break\u2026\nIt shows the capital expenditure (capex) on tech-related investments versus commodities.\n[Click to open in a new window]\nWhy is it important?\nWe could be at a critical inflection point in global markets right now\u2026\nCapital could be about to rebalance away from tech and back into commodities.\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out, that could be very positive for the Aussie Dollar.\nAlso, note on the chart the last time capex in commodities was this low relative to the new economy\u2026 2001.\nThe very year that the Aussie dollar recorded its historic low!\nFrom there, mining capex accelerated rapidly as international markets poured into resource investments throughout the early 2000s.\nThat\u2019s the playbook investors should be looking at right now.\nWe\u2019ll dig into this idea further in our next edition.\nStay tuned!\nRegards,\nJames Cooper,\nMining: Phase One and Diggers and Drillers"

As of January 9, 2026, the AUD/USD pair trades near 0.67, reflecting a resilient yet cautious stance following recent volatility. Investors seeking clarity on queries such as \u201cAustralian Dollar forecast 2026,\u201d \u201cAUD USD prediction,\u201d or \u201cAUD strength in 2026\u201d will find the outlook one of cautious optimism, tempered by persistent risks.\nSee Sentiment Graph at end of story.\nThis analysis draws on recent market dynamics, institutional forecasts, and narrative insights from Permutable AI\u2019s synthesis of thousands of headlines, highlighting the Aussie\u2019s enduring sensitivity to Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) guidance, resource prices, and China-related developments.\nRecent Performance and Current Positioning\nIn the closing weeks of 2025 and into early 2026, the AUD navigated phases of rebound and consolidation. From mid-December highs, it dipped on domestic data weaknesses before staging a commodity-fueled rally of +1.65% into late December, bolstered by hawkish RBA signals and metals strength. Year-end pressures from agricultural disruptions and trade frictions induced range-bound trading, with early January pullbacks underscoring competing forces.\nAs of January 9, 2026, AUD/USD hovers around 0.6699\u20130.6700, down marginally on the session but supported by broader resilience. Sentiment analysis of Permutable AI\u2019s data reveals a policy-dominant regime, where interest rate expectations have anchored the currency against episodic headwinds.\nSource: Permutable AI\nThe color gradient of the heat map reveals a predominantly policy-driven sentiment regime: strong bullish signals in Interest Rates and Monetary Policy early on gave way to mixed neutral-to-bearish tones in mid-December amid economic data weaknesses, before rebounding with greenish commodity and growth narratives in late December. This visual underscores the AUD\u2019s sensitivity to RBA hawkishness and external pressures, offering a real-time tool for tracking shifts that could inform short-term trading decisions.\nPrincipal Drivers Shaping the AUD in 2026\nThe Aussie\u2019s trajectory this year will be sculpted by interconnected forces, its commodity provenance ensuring high beta to global growth while policy and trade impart directional nuance.\nRBA Policy and Rate Divergence\nThe RBA\u2019s cash rate stands at 3.60%, unchanged since December 2025. Yet, sticky inflation has shifted the narrative: markets now anticipate potential hikes, with a February increase partially priced and up to 44 basis points of tightening implied across 2026.\n\u201cInflation will remain stubbornly high over the next year, forcing the Reserve Bank of Australia to increase interest rates at least twice, according to a survey of the country\u2019s major economists, some of whom predict the official cash rate to rise as early as February.\u201d \u2013 source: Financial Review\nMajor institutions, including Commonwealth Bank and NAB, foresee at least one or two rises to counter persistent pressures, contrasting with expected Federal Reserve easing.\nSuch divergence could invigorate carry flows, lending structural support to the AUD, provided inflation moderates without necessitating aggressive tightening.\nCommodity Cycles: Tailwinds with Nuances\nAustralia\u2019s resource endowment positions the AUD to benefit from firming base metals. The World Bank and Fitch project strengthening copper and aluminum prices through 2026\u20132027, driven by supply constraints and energy transition demand, with J.P. Morgan eyeing copper averages near $12,075 per tonne. Gold, too, enjoys bullish institutional support amid cyclical and investment flows.\nIron ore, however, faces downward pressure from expanding supply.

But this time feels different. Back then, ballooning rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan were the villain. Now, the yen\u2019s slide looks home grown, tied to domestic politics and policy expectations rather than global carry dynamics.\nTalk of a snap lower house election in Japan later this month has added fuel, with traders gaming out a landslide win for Prime Minister Sanae Takaishi and the prospect of aggressive fiscal stimulus. That has reignited chatter about an Abenomics 2.0 reboot, sending both the yen and JGBs, especially the long end, lower in tandem. The correlation between USD/JPY and the Japanese 2s10s curve has spiked, reflecting bets that reflationary policies could be back in vogue.\nAgainst that backdrop, the question is not just whether intervention would work beyond a short-term jolt. It is whether Tokyo even wants a stronger yen if the goal is to turbocharge growth and inflation.\nPrior Intervention Episodes: A Quick Primer\nSource: TradingView\nThe first chart provides context as to what happened prior to recent intervention episodes. It plots USD/JPY with markers showing how far the pair ran beforehand. The contrast is stark. Ahead of the 2024 action above 160, USD/JPY surged almost 10% in a matter of weeks, with later episode following a move of nearly 5%. Compare that to now: barely 3% so far. It is a tiddler, which raises the question of whether the move is big enough to force the Ministry of Finance\u2019s hand.\nHistory from 2022 reinforces the point. Those interventions came after rapid run ups of 12% and 8% respectively, measured in weeks not months. If speed matters more than absolute levels, as recent MoF behaviour suggests, it may require a quick extension into the low 160s to trigger action.\nWe have heard plenty of jawboning from Japanese government officials lately, but most of it repeats the same lines: rapid one sided moves are undesirable, and price should reflect fundamentals. Nothing yet screams imminent intervention if history is any guide. Expect one more round of forceful language before any real move occurs.\nThat brings us to the bigger question: even if the BOJ is asked to act, would it work? The yen\u2019s latest slide looks home grown, driven by domestic politics and reflation bets rather than global rate differentials. That makes any intervention a ultra short-term shock at best, not a trend changer in my opinion.\nDomestic Drivers: JGBs and Steeper Curves\nThe next two charts speak volumes. The first shows Japanese government bond yields across 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 year tenors over the past six months. Every line is pointing higher, led by the back end as term premium ratchets up. Traders are positioning for heavier fiscal outlays to spur growth alongside wage and inflation pressures.\nSource: TradingView\nThe second chart adds to the story. Both the 2s10s (LHS) and 2s30s (RHS) curves have steepened dramatically on Abenomics 2.0 speculation. 2s10s sits at 102 basis points, the widest since 2011. 2s30s is at 234 basis points, the most since 2004. These figures are simply the differential between short and longer-dated Japanese government bond yields. These moves underline growing concern about Japan\u2019s already record sovereign debt burden. Prior reflationary pushes have delivered little lasting success, adding to an already ballooning debt to GDP ratio rather than fixing the structural challenge.\nSource: TradingView\nIt all drives home one point: domestic politics is exerting a major influence on Japanese borrowing costs. And as the next section shows, that same dynamic loo"

Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up intere"

                "body": "The USD/CAD currency pair continues its upward momentum for a second day, hovering near the 1.3900 mark during Wednesday's Asian trading session. This strength is largely attributed to gains in the US Dollar, following a US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report that closely aligned with forecasts. The data has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely maintain its current policy stance this month, despite indications that underlying inflationary pressures are beginning to ease.\nIn December 2025, the US Consumer Price Index rose by 0.3% from the previous month, mirroring both market predictions and the increase recorded in September. Year-over-year, inflation held steady at 2.7%, in line with expectations. The Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, edged up by 0.2% for the month\u2014slightly underperforming forecasts\u2014while annual core inflation remained at 2.6%, matching its lowest level in four years.\nThese figures suggest that inflation is gradually cooling, especially after previous data was distorted by government shutdown effects. Nevertheless, the labor market remains robust, as highlighted by last Friday\u2019s strong Nonfarm Payrolls numbers, a decline in the Unemployment Rate, and a healthy four-week average for ADP Employment Change.\nDespite the US Dollar\u2019s recent strength, further gains for USD/CAD may be limited. The Canadian Dollar, which is closely tied to commodities, could find support from rising Oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading near its highest level in two months, around $60.70 per barrel at the time of reporting.\nOil prices have climbed following US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to suspend negotiations with Iranian officials until ongoing protests subside, while also expressing solidarity with demonstrators. The unrest in Iran, combined with the possibility of US intervention, poses a threat to the nation\u2019s oil production of approximately 3.3 million barrels per day. Additionally, President Trump\u2019s warning of a new 25% tariff on countries continuing business with Iran has heightened fears of further supply disruptions."

                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/trading-at-approximately-1-3880-usd-cad-remains-stable-due-to-conflicting-economic-indicators-and-oil-influences/",
                "body": "USD/CAD remains stable, trading around 1.3880, amidst mixed signals from the US and factors specific to Canada. The Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates US inflation is cooling slowly but not yet complete. December\u2019s CPI increased by 2.7% year-over-year, maintaining market expectations, while core CPI stayed at 2.6%, falling short of predictions for a slight increase. Month-on-month, headline inflation rose by 0.3%, and core inflation by 0.2%, with shelter costs primarily driving monthly price pressures.\nMarket Expectations\nThese figures suggest ongoing disinflation, with markets expecting gradual monetary easing from the Federal Reserve. Markets currently assign a 95% probability that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in January. In the Canadian context, the CAD gains support from rising oil prices, as Canada is a major crude exporter to the US. WTI US oil prices have increased for four consecutive days, around $61 per barrel, driven by supply concerns and geopolitical tensions.\nUSD\u2019s daily percentage movements show strength against the Japanese Yen. In this market environment, the balance between US inflation data and oil-driven CAD support keeps USD/CAD in a consolidation phase, lacking a strong immediate catalyst.\nLooking back to early 2025, we saw the USD/CAD pair trading in a tight range around 1.3880, caught between US disinflation and rising oil prices. Now, a year later, the pair is still range-bound, though at a lower level near 1.3450, as these same core themes have evolved but not resolved. The fundamental tug-of-war continues to limit any strong directional momentum.\nOn the US side, the disinflation we tracked throughout 2025 has become more stubborn. Yesterday\u2019s data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the Consumer Price Index for December 2025 holding at 2.9%, slightly above the consensus forecast and complicating the Federal Reserve\u2019s path forward. Consequently, CME FedWatch data shows markets are pricing in a 98% chance the Fed will keep rates on hold at its meeting later this month.\nOpportunities for Traders\nMeanwhile, the Canadian dollar continues to draw support from elevated energy prices, a trend that intensified since last year. West Texas Intermediate crude is trading steadily around $78 a barrel, a notable increase from the low $60s we saw in early 2025, buoyed by ongoing supply discipline from OPEC+ and persistent geopolitical tensions. This strength in oil provides a solid floor for the Canadian currency, preventing significant USD/CAD rallies.\nThis prolonged period of consolidation has suppressed market volatility, with the Deutsche Bank Currency Volatility Index recently touching a 52-week low. For derivative traders, this presents an opportunity to buy options cheaply, as current pricing suggests the market is underestimating the potential for a breakout. We feel that long straddles, which profit from a significant move in either direction, look attractive for contracts expiring in the next six to eight weeks.\nFor those with a directional bias, the fundamentals slightly favor Canadian dollar strength. A patient approach of buying out-of-the-money USD/CAD puts could be a cost-effective way to position for a potential break below the key 1.3400 support level. This strategy would benefit if stubborn US inflation data forces the Fed to remain hawkish longer than the market expects, eventually triggering a risk-off move.\nGiven the balanced risks, using option collars is a prudent way to hedge currency exposure over the coming weeks. This strategy of buying a protective put and simultaneously selling a call option to fund it establishes a defined trading range. It allows for participation in a limited move while protecting against an adverse sharp swing in the exchange rate."

                "body": "GBP/JPY continues to gain momentum, reaching a high of 214.00, its highest level since August 2008, due to JPY weakness. Contributing factors include uncertainty surrounding the Bank of Japan, tensions with China, and talks of a potential snap election in Japan.\nJapan\u2019s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call a snap election to leverage approval ratings, adding to fiscal policy speculations. Amidst international tensions, the demand for Japanese Yen as a safe-haven currency has diminished.\nYen Intervention Concerns\nThe Japanese Yen shows little response to potential intervention by Japanese authorities to curb further depreciation. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama has voiced concerns over the Yen\u2019s decline, yet BoJ\u2019s position remains unchanged, supporting the GBP/JPY\u2019s upward trend.\nThe British Pound benefits from reduced US Dollar demand, maintaining a positive outlook. The recent breakout past the 212.15 level supports this, though overbought signals suggest caution. Anticipation surrounds Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s speech and future interest rate movements.\nThe Japanese Yen is sensitive to Bank of Japan policy, bond yield differentials, and risk sentiment. Its value is shaped by economic performance, and the Yen\u2019s safe-haven status depends on market conditions. The BoJ\u2019s policy impacts currency value, with past ultra-loose policy periods resulting in Yen depreciation.\nThe move to 214.00 in GBP/JPY is a clear signal of intense Yen weakness, which has been a dominant theme since we closed out 2025. With the Yen already down over 5% against the Pound in the first two weeks of this year, the path of least resistance appears higher. We believe the strategy is to follow this strong upward momentum.\nPolicy Differences Impact\nThis trend is fundamentally supported by the stark policy difference between the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England. Looking back at the final data from 2025, UK inflation remained sticky above 3% while Japan struggled to keep core inflation much above 1%. This wide interest rate differential continues to fuel carry trades, where we borrow in Yen to invest in higher-yielding Sterling assets.\nHowever, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) now in overbought territory, a direct long position carries significant risk of a sharp pullback. We see value in using derivatives, specifically buying call options, to maintain exposure to further upside while strictly defining our maximum loss. The elevated cost of these calls reflects high demand and is a price worth paying for risk management.\nWe must remember that the last time GBP/JPY traded at these levels was just before the 2008 financial crisis, after which it collapsed from over 250 to below 120. While fundamentals are different today, this serves as a stark reminder of how quickly sentiment can reverse in this pair. This historical precedent reinforces the case for using options rather than highly leveraged spot positions.\nIn the immediate term, we are cautious ahead of the US CPI inflation report due later today and the upcoming speech from BoE Governor Bailey. These events could inject significant volatility, potentially offering a better entry point on any temporary dip. We will be watching for any change in tone from the BoE regarding the two rate cuts expected this year."

Spot prices have climbed to a fresh high since August 2008, with bulls now looking to extend the ascending trend further beyond the 214.00 mark amid a broadly weaker Japanese Yen (JPY).\nReports that Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may soon call a snap election to take advantage of her approval ratings fuel speculations about further expansionary fiscal policy. This comes on top of the uncertainty over the likely timing of the next rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the deepening Japan\u2013China diplomatic crisis, which, in turn, is seen weighing heavily on the JPY. Moreover, the underlying bullish sentiment across the global equity markets turns out to be another factor undermining the JPY's safe-haven status and pushing the GBP/JPY cross higher.\nThe JPY bears, meanwhile, seem unaffected by expectations that Japanese authorities could step in to stem further weakness in the domestic currency. In fact, Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said this Tuesday that she shared concerns over the JPY's recent one-sided slide with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and added that the tolerance for weakness was limited. Moreover, the BoJ's hawkish outlook also does little to ease the prevalent selling bias surrounding the JPY, which backs the case for a further near-term appreciating move for the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, benefits from the lack of any meaningful US Dollar (USD) buying interest. This, in turn, validates the near-term positive outlook on the back of the overnight strength beyond the previous multi-year peak, around the 212.15 region, touched last week. From a technical perspective, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is flashing overbought conditions and warrants caution for the GBP/JPY bulls. Traders now look to Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey's speech for a fresh impetus amid bets for two more interest rate cuts in 2026."

It received $44.6 billion during this period.\nAccording to the blockchain security firm Chainalysis, the massive adoption of crypto in LATAM has been fueled by persistent inflation and sanctions. For citizens, it emerged as a new lifeline after hyperinflation.\nHowever, for the Venezuelan government, it was reportedly a tool to bypass U.S sanctions on its oil sector, particularly through USDT and Bitcoin. Sanctioned crypto flows featured prominently in illicit crypto activities in 2025, from Venezuela to Russia.\nIn fact, Chainalysis highlighted that inflows into sanctioned addresses and jurisdictions surged by 694% in 2025. This coincided with a rise in geopolitical tensions.\nThe most preferred crypto assets to circumvent capital controls have become stablecoins and Bitcoin.\nWorth pointing out, however, that speculations have placed the alleged \u201cshadowy\u201d Venezuelan BTC stash at around 600,000 coins. That would be worth $56.4 billion at the press time market price of $94k per coin.\nAlas, at the time of writing, the official and verified BTC currently held by the Venezuelan government was worth only $22.61 million (240 BTC), according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. It remains to be seen whether the rest of the alleged stash will be fully accounted for.\nFinal Thoughts\n- SEC Chair Paul Atkins expressed uncertainty about the U.S government\u2019s next steps regarding the alleged Venezuelan crypto stash.\n- At press time, verified Venezuelan government addresses held only $22.6 million worth of BTC."

Ethereum looks relatively more stable rather than explosive, but investors consider MUTM a DeFi crypto alternative to diversify into the best crypto to buy now category.\nMUTM: Early Access to the High-Potential DeFi Ecosystem\nWhat is offered in Mutuum Finance is an opportunity for investors to participate in a DeFi project that is highly profitable, and this is available in the early stages. With the cost per token at $0.04 in phase 7, MUTM is at the cheapest entry it will ever be at. Other phases, such as Phase 8 at $0.045, as well as the public token launch $0.06, have less growth potential, making early investment even more attractive.\nWith adoption and completion of the roadmap, there is great potential for the value of MUTM after the token sale event to reach $0.50. This will turn $1000 invested today into $12,500, an $11,500 ROI by the end of 2026. This makes it Mutuum Finance the best crypto to buy now.\nYield-Bearing Collateral\nOne of the features of MUTM is its USD-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing collateral. An investor can for example commit 8,000 USDT to borrow the stablecoin for use within the platform. Their 8000 USDT remains active in lending pools at up to 15% APY. The interest accrued from this position can be used to repay some of the borrowed loan. This makes the DeFi crypto a stand-out amongst competitors who may have an algorithmic stablecoin model.\nCommunity Incentives Encourage Adoption\nMutuum Finance engages in community engagement activities that entice members to engage. The activities include a $100,000 giveaway where ten members will receive $10,000 while another program gives the largest buyer of each day $500 MUTM bonus. The activities not only improve the holder base but also enhance the use of the platform, solidifying its reputation as a top DeFi crypto and drawing attention as the potential best crypto to buy now.\nSecurity and Testnet Milestones Build Confidence\nAmong the more prominent aspects and areas of emphasis is the Security. The token scan security rating of this project according to Certik is 90/100, and it has also completed a Halborn Security audit of its lending & borrowing contracts. Mutuum Finance has also initiated a bug bounty program worth $50,000 in conjunction with Certik to reward white hats to find bugs within its code.\nUpcoming V1 protocol launch on Sepolia testnet will enable interaction with liquidity pools, mtTokens collateralized by user deposits, debt contracts governing loans, and the automated liquidator for under-collateralized markets. MUTM will support various assets and blockchains aside from the initial focus of ETH and USDT.\nWhile Ethereum represents a stable and proven network utility, MUTM represents early-stage access to a DeFi ecosystem that is poised for high growth.

According to a new draft of the U.S. Clarity Act that has just come to light, any crypto asset that is used as the main underlying asset of a U.S.-listed ETF by Jan. 1, 2026, will not be considered a security under the Securities Act of 1933. And XRP qualifies.\nThis single clause may do what Ripple\u2019s legal team, two partial court wins and over $200 million in legal defense could not fully achieve: give XRP an explicit legal carve-out from securities status.\nThe text in question, buried deep in the discussion draft, states that \u201ca network token shall not be considered a security if, on Jan. 1, 2026, any units of that token were the principal asset of an exchange-traded product.\u201d\nThat would put XRP in the same category as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which the SEC has always considered nonsecurities. If it is passed as written, it will also clear SOL, LTC, HBAR, LINK and even DOGE.\nDetails matter for Ripple and XRP\nThe SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple was based on the fact that XRP is an unregistered security. Now, the language of the law could directly nullify that premise going forward \u2014 not just for Ripple, but for every exchange and fund manager interacting with XRP.\nMeanwhile, XRP ETFs continue to attract capital. As of Jan. 12, the total net inflows added up to $1.23 billion across four U.S.-listed products, with Bitwise, Franklin and Grayscale leading the way. With assets nearing $1.5 billion and XRP trading above $2, investor confidence seems to be in line with this legal push.\nFor Ripple and its global partnerships, this clause could be a big win, legally making years of SEC aggression irrelevant in a single stroke.\nSource: https://u.today/xrp-may-soon-be-legally-untouchable-by-sec-thanks-to-this-doc"

                "body": "The Solana Policy Institute has asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to provide an explicit exemption for developers of decentralized finance.\nHis argument was that the release of open-source and non-custodial software should not require engineers to assume the same regulatory risks as centralized crypto exchanges or other market intermediaries.\nThe appeal comes as regulatory pressure, enforcement actions, and legal uncertainty continue to weigh on DeFi development in the United States, even as policymakers show a shift away from aggressive enforcement toward clearer rules.\nSEC Framework Built for Centralized Markets Falls Short for DeFi\nIn a letter submitted Friday through the SEC\u2019s website, the nonprofit responded to a December 17, 2025, request for public input from Commissioner Hester Peirce on how crypto assets are traded on national securities exchanges and alternative trading systems.\nThe Institute focused on how the SEC can protect the ability of individuals to write and deploy software and transact directly through autonomous systems without creating unnecessary regulatory barriers.\nIt argued that the agency\u2019s existing framework, built around centralized intermediaries, does not fit how smart-contract-based systems actually work.\nIn DeFi systems, users retain custody of their assets, approve their own transactions, and interact directly with public blockchains. The software does not hold funds, exercise discretion, or act on behalf of users.\nBecause those trust-based risks are absent, the Institute said, applying broker, dealer, exchange, or clearing agency rules to non-custodial software would be misplaced and counterproductive.\nRequiring such software to register as an ATS would be impractical and, in many cases, impossible. In practice, the Institute said, it would force decentralized protocols either to shut down or to reintroduce centralized control, undermining the very investor protections regulators seek to preserve.\nCrypto Developers Call for Protection as Enforcement Pressure Grows\nThis push for clarity comes against a backdrop of mounting legal risks for developers. In recent years, several high-profile cases have targeted individuals who wrote or maintained open-source software, including prosecutions tied to crypto mixer projects.\nDevelopers have also faced enforcement actions from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over registration and compliance failures, even when protocols were designed to operate autonomously.\nIndustry participants say the lack of clear exemptions leaves developers choosing between innovation and personal legal exposure."

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice.\nAmid efforts to further enhance its ecosystem, Fors, a prediction market aggregation platform built on Solana, announced today the release of its beta version.\nWhile the move follows plans to make prediction markets accessible, efficient, and professional-grade, the project\u2019s beta version had been designed to address fragmentation and inefficiencies across modern prediction markets.\nThe evolution of Fors comes as prediction markets covering multiple categories, including politics, sports, macroeconomic events, cryptocurrencies, and global developments, have continued to expand rapidly in recent years.\nNonetheless, market data, liquidity, and pricing have shown no expansion across isolated platforms, making it difficult for participants to efficiently compare outcomes and identify inefficiencies.\nTo remediate this problem, Fors plans to aggregate multiple prediction venues into a single unified interface. As such, it has normalized probabilities, pricing, and liquidity, allowing users to compare identical outcomes side by side across different markets.\nWhile the prediction market aggregation platform is built on Solana, it leverages high-performance infrastructure to support real-time aggregation and low-latency data processing.\nMoreover, the platform is developing smart order routing capabilities to direct trades to the most favorable venue based on price, liquidity, and execution conditions, while maintaining transparency and user control.\nBy presenting pricing disparities across venues, Fors enables users to identify arbitrage opportunities arising from fragmented liquidity and inconsistent market pricing.\nIn addition to aggregation and execution optimization, the beta release introduces copy trading functionality adapted for prediction markets.\nNonetheless, it is important to note that Fors operates with a non-custodial design, ensuring users retain ownership of their funds while interacting with multiple prediction markets through a single interface.\nPer the announcement, the beta launch of the platform which happened on Jan 8 represents an early step in Fors\u2019s broader vision to provide infrastructure-level tools as prediction markets continue to mature."

                "body": "Solana Policy Institute urged the U.S. SEC to carve out clear protection for DeFi software developers. The group submitted its view on January 9, 2026, through the SEC\u2019s website. It responded to a crypto market request for information dated December 17, 2025.\nThe institute argued that existing exchange-style rules fit centralized venues, not open DeFi tools. It also warned that unclear standards raise legal risk for builders and slow U.S. innovation.\nPolicy push focuses on custody and control\nThe institute asked the SEC to draw bright lines around custody and transaction control. It said developers who publish non-custodial, open-source tools do not act like brokers or exchanges.\nUsers keep their own keys and approve each transaction themselves. Consequently, the institute framed code as a tool that users run, not a middleman. Besides, it said investor protection improves when rules target parties who hold assets or direct execution.\nAdditionally, the submission urged the SEC to confirm that publishing software does not equal operating a venue. It argued that exchange and ATS frameworks assume an operator who controls access and order interaction.\nDeFi protocols do not rely on that structure in many designs. Hence, the institute said ATS-style requirements could force DeFi into a model it tries to remove.\nWhy the \u201cexchange\u201d label creates friction for DeFi\nThe institute warned that broad readings of \u201cexchange\u201d could sweep in interfaces and messaging layers. It said developers do not run order books or match counterparties in many non-custodial systems.\nMoreover, it argued that forcing registration could drive builders offshore. It also said the U.S. could lose competitiveness without gaining market integrity benefits.\nSignificantly, the group supported guidance that clarifies developer activity stays outside intermediary regimes. It also pointed to targeted rule changes that exclude non-custodial software from the exchange definition. However, it still framed enforcement as appropriate for actors who take custody or control transactions.\nSOL price tracks \u201cascending accumulation,\u201d analyst says\nSource: CoinCodex\nSolana traded at $142.74, up 0.73% in 24 hours as of publication, with $6.93 billion in volume. It gained 2.85% over seven days, with roughly 570 million SOL in circulation. Market participants valued the network near $80.68 billion at the time of reporting.\nCryptoJobs3 described an ascending accumulation setup with buyers defending higher lows. Price action has held support near $139\u2013$140 and faced supply around $144\u2013$146.\nRepeated tests of that zone can signal absorption when buyers keep returning quickly. A firm break above $146 could open $152 next. Consequently, CryptoJobs3 watched the $160\u2013$162 zone as a higher target if momentum persists."

Meanwhile, \"core\" prices, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, came in at 2.6%, the same as November and below consensus projections of a 2.8% annual rise. The 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, was little changed from Monday's close of 4.18% at 4 p.m. ET but down from 4.20% before the data this morning.\nInvestors also were focused on fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which kicked off bank earnings season. The largest U.S. bank reported an adjusted profit beat but slightly lower-than-expected revenue, and shares declined more than 4%.\n\"The U.S. economy has remained resilient. While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said. \"Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy. These conditions could persist for some time, particularly with ongoing fiscal stimulus, the benefits of deregulation and the Fed\u2019s recent monetary policy. However, as usual, we remain vigilant, and markets seem to underappreciate the potential hazards\u2014including from complex geopolitical conditions, the risk of sticky inflation and elevated asset prices.\u201d\nYesterday, investors shook off news of a Justice Department probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with the S&P 500 and Dow hitting fresh intraday and closing highs, and the Nasdaq also ending in the green.\nFinancial stocks slid yesterday after President Donald Trump over the weekend suggested capping credit card interest rates at 10%, and the likes of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the biggest S&P 500 decliners Tuesday, with shares down 4.5% and 3.8%, respectively.\n\"While investors have shown resilience amid rising uncertainty, it's far from clear that markets can absorb unlimited turbulence,\" said David Wagner, Head of Equity and Portfolio Manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. \"With policy volatility now emanating more directly from Washington, it\u2019s reasonable to think that unpredictability itself could become a sentiment headwind for equities in the year ahead, but until then the market is properly focusing on earnings growth that appears to become more broad based.\"\nSalesforce (CRM) was the worst-performing stock in the Dow, dropping roughly 7% following an update to its virtual assistant Slackbot feature in Slack. Delta Air Lines (DAL) stock fell nearly 2.5% after its fiscal 2026 first-quarter and full-year profit forecasts came in below expectations.\nThe Nasdaq was led by shares of chipmakers Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which closed up 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively.\nGold futures, considered a haven during market turbulence, pulled back 0.5% to $4,590 an ounce after setting its latest record high of $4,644 an ounce Tuesday. Silver futures rose 1.6% to $86.40 an ounce after hitting a fresh all-time high above $89 an ounce earlier in the day.\nWest Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, rose 2.5% to $61 a barrel after President Trump said any country doing business with Iran would face a 25% U.S. tariff.\nBitcoin was trading around $95,900 in late-afternoon trading, up from the day's low of roughly $90,900.

Investors turned cautious as JPMorgan\u2019s earnings raised concerns about upcoming earnings from other US banking giants.\nIncreased geopolitical risks contributed to the morning pullback. This week, President Trump announced a 25% tariff on countries that maintain business relations with Iran amid growing concerns over the US-China trade war truce. President Trump\u2019s threats to seize Greenland and events in Venezuela have tested US-China relations.\nMeanwhile, Japanese political uncertainty and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus plan sent USD/JPY to a morning high of 159.453, its highest level since July 2024. The weaker yen fueled yen carry trades into US risk assets, limiting the downside for US equity futures.\nDespite the pullback, optimism about the AI earnings season, hopes for multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026, and a robust US economy support a bullish medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the key technical levels traders should watch.\nMarket concerns over a snap election in Japan weakened the yen and sent 10-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGB) yields to their highest level in decades.\nJapanese Prime Minister Takaichi hinted at a snap national election, potentially in February. Takaichi enjoys a high approval rating in contrast with the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s rating, raising uncertainty over an election. A resounding victory would strengthen Takaichi\u2019s case for increased spending, which would further impact Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio.\nNotably, the Nikkei 225 rallied 1.61% in morning trading despite USD/JPY gains fueling speculation about the Japanese government intervening in the FX markets. A weaker yen and Nikkei 225 gains signal yen carry trades into risk assets.\nWhile concerns about Japan\u2019s debt levels weakened the yen, strong Chinese trade data boosted optimism about the Chinese economy. Chinese exports rose 6.6% year-on-year in December, up from 5.9% in November, while imports increased 5.7% (November: 1.9%).\nDecember\u2019s trade data signaled a strong global demand backdrop, lifting sentiment.\nUS futures dipped during the Asian morning session on Wednesday, January 14. The Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini declined 15 points and 8 points, respectively, while the Dow Jones E-mini fell 102 points.\nLater Wednesday, US producer prices and retail sales figures will influence the Fed rate path. Economists forecast retail sales will increase 3% year-on-year in November, down from 3.5% in October. Meanwhile, economists expect producer prices to rise 2.7% YoY in November, mirroring September\u2019s increase.\nSofter producer prices and retail sales growth would likely raise bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, boosting demand for US stock futures. Typically, lower borrowing costs improve earnings and equity valuations.\nWhile the economic data will influence sentiment, traders should closely monitor earnings announcements. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) will release their earnings. Weaker-than-expected earnings would likely overshadow the economic data and weigh on risk appetite.\nThe current dynamics, including market optimism over AI-linked corporate earnings and bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, affirm a cautiously bullish near-term and bullish medium-term price outlook.\nDespite the latest losses, the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini remained above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs signaled bullish momentum, aligning with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on geopolitical tensions, US economic data, corporate earnings, and Fed chatter. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook remains cautiously bullish, supported by bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and strong AI-linked corporate earnings.

JP Morgan also kicked off Q4 earnings season.\nUS CPI rose 0.3% on a monthly basis in line with forecasts. On an annual basis, CPI rose 0.7% in line with November and compared with estimates of 2.7%. However, core inflation, which excludes more volatile items such as food and fuel, rose 0.2% on a monthly basis, below expectations for a 0.3% advance, and was 2.6% year on year, below the 2.7% forecast.\nThe knee-jerk reaction in the markets just showed relief that consumer prices didn't jump further. With cooler-than-expected CPI, the Fed has a bit more leeway to be dovish. Wala, January rate cuts are highly unlikely, and a March reduction could potentially be on the table. According to the Fed, the next 25-basis-point cut is fully priced in by June, unchanged from the data.\nWhile the data offers some relief regarding inflation, it does not substantially change the market's perspective that the Fed will keep rates unchanged for the foreseeable future.\nAttention is also on banks, as JPMorgan kicks off earnings season today, with more bank results due tomorrow.\nInvestors continued to largely strike off geopolitical concerns, including the capture of finance Whalen, President Maduro 10 days ago, and Trump's threat of military intervention in Iran.\nCorporate news\nJP Morgan rose 0.2% despite the largest U.S. bank posting a drop in profits in Q4 as it took a one-time charge to the loss after agreeing to take over Apple's credit card portfolio. An unexpected drop in investment banking revenues and an increase in the reserves set aside for possible loan losses resulted in profits dropping. Net income was 13 billion U.S. dollars for the quarter, just ahead of estimates of 12.8 billion, but down from 14 billion a year ago.\nDelta Air Lines fell 5% after the US carrier reported Q4 adjusted earnings slightly ahead of expectations, but revenue missed estimates, and 2026 guidance also disappointed.\nDow Jones forecast \u2013 technical analysis.\nDow Jones continues to trend higher, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows as buyers target 50,000. The RSI is above 50, supporting further upside. 50k is the next logical target. Support can be seen at 48,760, the December high. It would take a break below 47,850, the January low, to create a lower low.\nFX markets \u2013 USD falls, USD/JPY rises.\nThe U.S. dollar is flat on the day, pairing earlier gains after the U.S. core CPI was weaker than expected. A January rate cut remains very unlikely, but a March rate cut could be on the table.\nUSD/JPY is rising to 158.80 amid yen weakness. The pair trades at its lowest level since 2024, and Japanese stocks have surged on bets of a possible snap election next month.

Symrise\u2019s first-ever buyback signals management thinks the stock is worth backing and that cash generation is strong enough to return capital without stressing the balance sheet. The terpenes sale is the other half of the playbook \u2013 ditch a non-core business, simplify the portfolio, and free up funds for higher-return categories. In the same consumer-staples lane, Deutsche Bank upgraded Beiersdorf to \u201cbuy\u201d and..\nraised its price target to \u20ac105 from \u20ac98, a reminder that analyst calls can still steer sentiment even when an index goes nowhere.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Company decisions are moving prices more than the macro.\nOn sleepy index days, capital returns can steal the show \u2013 Symrise\u2019s surge made it one of the DAX\u2019s top performers. That\u2019s relevant across Europe, where investors are watching whether staples firms can protect margins as pricing power cools and online competition intensifies. Deutsche Bank also flagged 2026 risks like tougher digital channels, smaller disruptors, and more M&A, which could make stock picking matter more than broad beta.\nThe bigger picture: Europe has less help from overseas cash flows.\nThe ECB said the eurozone\u2019s current account surplus in Q3 2025 fell to \u20ac283 billion from \u20ac425 billion a year earlier. A shrinking buffer means less support from net foreign income \u2013 so domestic growth, productivity gains, and disciplined buybacks or divestments may carry more weight for European corporates and their valuations.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "US stock futures declined on Wednesday, January 14, extending their losses from the previous day. Investors turned cautious as JPMorgan\u2019s earnings raised concerns about upcoming earnings from other US banking giants.\nIncreased geopolitical risks contributed to the morning pullback. This week, President Trump announced a 25% tariff on countries that maintain business relations with Iran amid growing concerns over the US-China trade war truce. President Trump\u2019s threats to seize Greenland and events in Venezuela have tested US-China relations.\nMeanwhile, Japanese political uncertainty and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus plan sent USD/JPY to a morning high of 159.453, its highest level since July 2024. The weaker yen fueled yen carry trades into US risk assets, limiting the downside for US equity futures.\nDespite the pullback, optimism about the AI earnings season, hopes for multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026, and a robust US economy support a bullish medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the key technical levels traders should watch.\nMarket concerns over a snap election in Japan weakened the yen and sent 10-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGB) yields to their highest level in decades.\nJapanese Prime Minister Takaichi hinted at a snap national election, potentially in February. Takaichi enjoys a high approval rating in contrast with the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s rating, raising uncertainty over an election. A resounding victory would strengthen Takaichi\u2019s case for increased spending, which would further impact Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio.\nNotably, the Nikkei 225 rallied 1.61% in morning trading despite USD/JPY gains fueling speculation about the Japanese government intervening in the FX markets. A weaker yen and Nikkei 225 gains signal yen carry trades into risk assets.\nWhile concerns about Japan\u2019s debt levels weakened the yen, strong Chinese trade data boosted optimism about the Chinese economy. Chinese exports rose 6.6% year-on-year in December, up from 5.9% in November, while imports increased 5.7% (November: 1.9%).\nDecember\u2019s trade data signaled a strong global demand backdrop, lifting sentiment.\nUS futures dipped during the Asian morning session on Wednesday, January 14. The Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini declined 15 points and 8 points, respectively, while the Dow Jones E-mini fell 102 points.\nLater Wednesday, US producer prices and retail sales figures will influence the Fed rate path. Economists forecast retail sales will increase 3% year-on-year in November, down from 3.5% in October. Meanwhile, economists expect producer prices to rise 2.7% YoY in November, mirroring September\u2019s increase.\nSofter producer prices and retail sales growth would likely raise bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, boosting demand for US stock futures. Typically, lower borrowing costs improve earnings and equity valuations.\nWhile the economic data will influence sentiment, traders should closely monitor earnings announcements. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) will release their earnings. Weaker-than-expected earnings would likely overshadow the economic data and weigh on risk appetite.\nThe current dynamics, including market optimism over AI-linked corporate earnings and bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut, affirm a cautiously bullish near-term and bullish medium-term price outlook.\nDespite the latest losses, the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini remained above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs signaled bullish momentum, aligning with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on geopolitical tensions, US economic data, corporate earnings, and Fed chatter. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook remains cautiously bullish, supported by bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and strong AI-linked corporate earnings.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped roughly 0.1%.\nJPMorgan Chase led out this week's rush of big bank results, posting a quarterly earnings miss amid a $2.2 billion hit to net income from a Apple Card deal. Shares in America's biggest bank were down over 4%. With earnings season now unofficially underway, Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Morgan Stanley (MS) will follow with their own results in coming days.\nMeanwhile, Tuesday morning's CPI report, a key factor in the Fed\u2019s rate-setting decisions, showed that inflation remained steady last month. The annual headline rate came in at 2.7%, with a monthly increase of 0.3%, both in line with forecasts. \"Core\" consumer prices came in below forecasts at 0.2% over last month and 2.6% over last year, marking the lowest annual rise since early 2021.\nThe data takes on added importance after the December jobs report pointed to a cooling labor market. Traders have firmed up bets on the Fed holding steady this month, but odds have slightly shifted for a cut in the months after, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Traders still expect the first of two quarter-point cuts in June.\nTrump visited a Ford (F) plant in Detroit on Tuesday to promote US manufacturing and his economic policies.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) declined 0.1%.\nThe report arrives at a pivotal moment as Fed policymakers prepare for their January meeting at the end of this month.\nEarnings season kicked off on Tuesday with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reporting quarterly results.

                "body": "Counsel seeks death sentence for ex-S. Korean leader Yoon over martial law imposition\nA Seoul court says an independent counsel has demanded a death sentence for former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol\nSEOUL, South Korea -- An independent counsel on Tuesday demanded a death sentence for former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on rebellion charges in connection with his short-lived imposition of martial law in December 2024.\nRemoved from office last April, Yoon faces eight trials over various criminal charges related to his martial law debacle and other scandals related to his time in office. Charges that he directed a rebellion are the most significant ones.\nIndependent counsel Cho Eun-suk\u2019s team requested the Seoul Central District Court to sentence Yoon to death, according to the court.\nThe Seoul court is expected to deliver a verdict on Yoon in February. Experts say the court likely will sentence him to life in prison. South Korea hasn't executed anyone since 1997.\nYoon was scheduled to make remarks at Tuesday's hearing. He has maintained that his decree was a desperate yet peaceful attempt to raise public awareness about what he considered the danger of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which used its legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. He called the opposition-controlled parliament \u201ca den of criminals\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d\nYoon\u2019s decree, the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea, brought armed troops into Seoul streets to encircle the assembly and enter election offices. That evoked traumatic memories of dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s, when military-backed rulers used martial law and other emergency decrees to station soldiers and armored vehicles in public places to suppress pro-democracy protests.\nOn the night of Yoon's martial law declaration, thousands of people rushed to the National Assembly to object to the decree and demand his resignation in dramatic scenes. Enough lawmakers, including even those in Yoon\u2019s ruling party, managed to enter an assembly hall to vote down the decree.\nObservers described Yoon\u2019s action as political suicide. Parliament impeached him and sent the case to the Constitutional Court, which ruled to dismiss him as president.\nIt was a spectacular downfall for Yoon, a former star prosecutor who won South Korea\u2019s presidency in 2022, a year after entering politics.\nLee Jae Myung, a former Democratic Party leader who led Yoon's impeachment bid, became president by winning a snap election last June. After taking office, Lee appointed three independent counsels to delve into allegations involving Yoon, his wife and associates.\nThere had been speculation that Yoon resorted to martial law to protect his wife, Kim Keon Hee, from potential corruption investigations. But in wrapping up a six-month investigation last month, independent counsel Cho\u2019s team concluded that Yoon plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate his political rivals and monopolize power.\nYoon\u2019s decree and ensuing power vacuum plunged South Korea into political turmoil, halted the country\u2019s high-level diplomacy and rattled its financial markets.\nYoon\u2019s earlier vows to fight attempts to impeach and arrest him deepened the country\u2019s political divide. In January last year, he became the country\u2019s first sitting president to be detained."

                "body": "If there's any car earning the \"least likely to change horses midstream\" award, it's the Mercedes-Benz S-class. And for good reason. The S-class has long stood as the archetype for big-body luxury sedans, and with a name that directly translates to \"special class,\" there's an ever-present onus to make sure this thing delivers on each of its trademark promises. With a mid-cycle refresh coming in late January, Mercedes invited us to take an early passenger-seat spin in the Sonderklasse, and\u2014no surprises here\u2014it's every bit as swell as usual.\nWhat We're Allowed to Tell You\nIf you're reading this the day it was published, there's still a solid two weeks before the S-class makes its official debut, hence the brilliant gold \"camouflage\" seen in the accompanying visual aids. But there are some things we can glean from what's on display here. Take the headlights, for example; following the changes made to the new CLA-class, the S-class also earns three-pointed-star running lights integrated into both the headlights and taillights. We also see stars in the parts of the front grille poking through the camo. Otherwise, it looks to be much the same S-class as before, which is fine by us, as its current silhouette remains elegant.\nFor Sale Near You\nSee all results for 2027 Mercedes-Benz S-class for sale near 82001\nWe can also spill some powertrain tea. We know of three trims thus far, but it's unclear which ones will be coming to the U.S. and in what order. All-wheel drive, a nine-speed automatic transmission, and 48-volt hybridization are included in every model mentioned below.\nAt the bottom rung of the ladder is the S500, which relies on a super- and turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six that should produce 442 horsepower and 443 pound-feet of torque, with an overboost function improving torque to 472 pound-feet for short bursts. Above that is the S580e, a plug-in hybrid that combines the aforementioned straight-six with a beefier electric motor and battery to produce 576 horsepower, 73 more than last year's S580e.\nThe current king of the non-AMG mountain is the S580, which adopts the latest iteration of Benz's twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. Here, it produces 530 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. There are a bunch of changes to what's under the hood, including improvements to the intake and exhaust ports, tweaks to the injection system, and\u2014coolest of all\u2014a freakin' flat-plane crankshaft. This is the model for our brief back-seat ride on the roads surrounding Mercedes's plant in Sindelfingen, Germany.\nIn the Passenger Seat\nThe roads around the Mercedes plant are not built for corner-carving. It's pretty much your bog-standard business traffic, with a healthy bit of stop-and-go movement and a decent variety of pavement qualities. The S-class's ride quality was the focus of our 20-minute passenger-seat journey, and while some improvements have been made to the underlying tech, the result is the same as before. (We mean that in a good way.)\nBenz's Airmatic air-spring suspension is standard on the S-class, with the option to upgrade to the fancy electrohydraulic E-Active Body Control. Both setups include something Mercedes calls intelligent damping, or iDamping, which is basically vehicle-to-vehicle communication tech; every car running the latest MB.OS software can send its damping information to the cloud, which can beam that info down to each individual iDamping-equipped car. This allows the suspension to stiffen or soften in anticipation of a gnarly patch of road that some other poor sap had to drive over first.\nIt should come as no surprise that the system was already working its little e-heart out around Sindelfingen, which probably has the highest concentration of iDamping-equipped cars anywhere in the world at the moment. No matter how the pavement looked, the S-class prototype positively sailed over it, producing little in the way of noise or jostle. That said, we're pretty confident that cars without E-Active Body Control will fare "

                "body": "RFK Jr.'s MAHA movement has picked up steam in statehouses. Here's what to expect in 2026.\nWhen one of Adam Burkhammer's foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.\n\"We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,\" said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. \"There are real impacts on real kids.\"\nThe Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.\nThe bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nChemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans \u2014 and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program \u2014 created last year as part of the GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas \u2014 offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.\nFederal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water, and PFAS, a group of compounds known as \"forever chemicals\" that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.\nIn addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.\nMost synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden's term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.\nMajor food companies including Nestle, Hershey, and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.\n\"We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,\" said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.\nThis past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.\n\"The state laws are really what's motivating companies to get rid of dyes,\" said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.\nAndy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California's 2023 law, which bans four food additives.\n\"It's not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,\" Baker-White said.\nAlthough Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 SNAP, or food stamp"

                "body": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.\nTokyo has returned from holiday with a bang, rising 3% to an all-time peak as investors welcome a weakening yen and the chance of even more aggressive fiscal stimulus. South Korea and Taiwan also hit records, while China scaled a four-year top.\nGoing the other way, the yen hit record lows on the euro and Swiss franc and multi-year troughs on a range of others. The shorting of the yen helped save the dollar\u2019s blushes as it climbed to 158.65 and steadied from Monday\u2019s wobble.\nTokyo officials duly stepped up their verbal protests against \u201cone-sided\u201d yen moves, underlining the risk of intervention in the 159.00 to 160.00 range. That just encourages speculators to short the yen against other currencies, including the AUD, MXN and BRL.\nFor Wall Street, earnings kick off today with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon. High expectations mean there\u2019s a risk of disappointment if bank management guidance is not bullish.\nThere\u2019s an added wrinkle in Trump\u2019s sudden announcement that credit card rates will be capped at 10% from January 20, which took everyone by surprise. It\u2019s not even clear he has the legal power to do this, but it\u2019s not stopped him so far.\nBanks, of course, warned such a step could result in millions of American households and small businesses losing access to credit. The crunch would essentially be a tightening in monetary policy, ironic given Trump is pressing so hard for the Fed to cut rates ever deeper.\nThe U.S. consumer price report poses a hurdle, with analysts warning of upside risks following November\u2019s unbelievably low result which was biased down by a lack of data collection.\nMedian forecasts are for core inflation to rise an annual 2.7% in December, but both JPMorgan and Goldman see 2.8% as some of the data distortions wash out. In fact, CPI will be biased downward until April when a reset in housing costs could see a spike.\nThe market has long given up on a January rate cut from the Fed, and even April is under 50%, but a high CPI could lessen the chance for June.\nAs an aside, the Supreme Court has another opportunity on Wednesday to rule on Trump\u2019s emergency power tariffs, but it appears the justices don\u2019t usually make rulings this important so early in the year. April, or even June, seems more likely.\nOh and next Wednesday is when SCOTUS hears oral arguments on Trump\u2019s attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\nKey developments that could influence markets on Tuesday:\n\u2013 US Dec CPI, new home sales, weekly average earnings\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)"

Risk appetite helped too, and the broader Topix also notched an all-time high, suggesting the rally wasn\u2019t just a few mega-caps. Some of the move also reflected traders positioning around possible policy support, though the specifics remain uncertain. Even so, after a strong prior session, profit-taking showed up and kept the surge from being one-way.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: *Currency mo..\nves can quickly reshape earnings expectations.*\nJapan\u2019s indexes are packed with global businesses, so yen weakness can ripple straight into analyst models and sector leadership. That\u2019s why exporters and tech-linked names often lead when the currency slides, while domestically focused firms don\u2019t always get the same lift. The Topix record matters here, because it hints at broader participation rather than a rally carried by a single theme.\nThe bigger picture: A weaker yen helps stocks but squeezes households.\nThe same exchange-rate shift that flatters exporters\u2019 profits can raise the cost of imports like energy and food, keeping inflation pressures alive. That creates a tricky backdrop for policymakers trying to support growth without letting price rises become entrenched.
