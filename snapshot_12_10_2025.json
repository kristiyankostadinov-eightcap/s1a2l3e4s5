Meanwhile, silver grabbed the spotlight, hitting a record $61.02 per ounce and outperforming fellow precious metals.\nWhat does this mean?\nStronger-than-expected US jobs numbers pushed the dollar to a near one-week high, putting pressure on non-yielding gold, which dipped in spot trading. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) revealed that US job openings climbed in October, showing solid labor market momentum and sending Treasury yields to their highest levels in over two months. Higher yields and a robust dollar tend to dampen gold\u2019s appeal, making it less attractive compared to interest-bearing assets. Gold futures held steady as traders braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming rate call, with analysts suggesting the central bank may cut rates but keep a cautious tone\u2014often called a \u2018hawkish cut\u2019. While some officials see room for more easing if inflation stays in check, markets are watching both the Fed\u2019s language and inflation data from China to gauge the next move.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Dollar\u2019s strength shakes up precious metals.\nGold losing ground while silver sets records points to shifting momentum in commodities. Investors are adjusting strategies as steady Treasury yields and a firmer dollar challenge gold\u2019s usual luster during rate cut cycles. Silver\u2019s breakout, with platinum and palladium lagging, suggests market players are searching for growth in new corners of the metals space.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks and economic data set the pace.\nMajor central banks, especially the Fed, are carefully navigating between growth and inflation risks. Global data\u2014like China\u2019s producer and consumer prices\u2014could send ripple effects through financial markets, influencing everything from metal prices to exchange rates. How the Fed communicates its rate decision, alongside new data from economic heavyweights, will help define asset trends heading into the new year.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 12 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Gold prices rose on Monday, driven by growing expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut that pressured the dollar, ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting this week. Spot XAU/USD climbed 0.4% to $4,188.51 per ounce as of December 8, 2025, rebounding from last week's muted performance that saw the metal close flat at around $4,175 amid holiday-thinned volumes and profit-taking.\nThis uptick isn't mere technical bounce\u2014it's a recalibration fueled by last week's labor market fissures and inflation softness, which have solidified market conviction for Federal Reserve easing.\nWith DXY slipping below 103 (down 0.5% last week), gold's -0.87 correlation shines through, but traders must zoom in on the nuances: wage revisions hinting at sticky reflation, and QT taper liquidity that could unlock $60 billion. This week's calendar, headlined by the Fed, JOLTS, and CPI, could catapult XAU/USD to $4,300 or expose it to $4,000 tests.\nLet's dissect last week's drivers and the forward-looking traps.\nA Narrow Trade Driven by Dovish Signals and Profit-Taking\nLast week's gold action was a tale of two realities: headline resilience masking deepening policy-easing imperatives. The metal traded in a narrow $4,150\u2013$4,220 band, ending the period with a negligible 0.1% gain after an initial pop on Thursday's dovish FOMC minutes.\nThose minutes, released December 4, revealed a 7-2 vote for November's 25 bps cut but flagged \"upside risks to inflation\" from potential tariffs, tempering the rally and capping gains near the 50-day EMA at $4,210.\nProfit-taking ensued Friday as spot prices dipped to $4,199 before recovering on light positioning ahead of PCE revisions\u2014ultimately showing core PCE easing to 2.8% YoY from 2.9%, a whisper of abating services inflation that boosted cut odds to 87% for December. Yet, beyond the top-line \"easing intact,\" the minutes' subtext\u2014four FOMC members dissenting on pace, citing labor hoarding\u2014underscored a Fed divided on 2026's trajectory (median two cuts projected).\nThis internal friction, coupled with Challenger's 71,321 announced layoffs (up 15% MoM), amplified stagflation whispers: U.S. Q3 GDP held at 1.8%, but nowcast revisions implied a 0.2-point drag from inventory builds amid tariff fog.\nLabor Market Fault Lines Intensify Safe-Haven Demand\nCompounding this, ADP's surprise 32,000 private payroll drop on Wednesday (versus +150K expected) and the preliminary Michigan sentiment's expectations index slipping to 82 (below recession's 80 threshold) ignited safe-haven bids, lifting gold $25/oz intraday. These weren't isolated shocks; they highlighted labor's underbelly\u2014JOLTS revisions due this week show vacancies at 8.2 million (up 200K from initial), signaling hoarding that keeps wage pressures at 4.1% (above Fed's 3.8% comfort).\nGold, as the anti-dollar play, benefited asymmetrically: each 10K vacancy surprise above consensus has added ~$20/oz via eroded real yields (-0.8% on TIPS).\nGeopolitics simmered in the background, with Red Sea disruptions hiking shipping costs $80/container, but U.S.-China truce rumors capped the haven premium. ETF flows reflected the caution: $1.2 billion inflows for the week (net 28 tonnes added), but physical demand in India/China eased 34% as buyers awaited corrections.\nA Pivotal Fed Week Shapes Risk and Reward\nThis week's economic calendar\u2014dominated by the December 10\u201311 FOMC two-day meeting\u2014serves as gold's ultimate litmus test, with non-headline signals poised to dictate $100/oz swings. Wednesday's core event: the Fed's rate decision (88% priced for 25 bps to 3.75\u20134.00%), but fixate on the dot plot and SEP revisions. September's median eyed two 2026 cuts; watch for a hawkish skew if three+ hawks (e.g., Bowman) dissent, potentially revising unemployment to 4.5% (from 4.2%) while holding GDP at 1.8%\u2014a steeper yield curve scenario that could rebound DXY above 104 and pressure gold to $4,050.\nMarket Triggers to Watch and Tactical Levels\nTechnically, last week's RSI reset to 55 neutralized overbough"

The supply of oil is largely determined by long-term projects. The market is expected \"pretty much guaranteed\" to see some of that supply come on in the next year, given that some projects have been planned for a decade or more, he said.\n- Relatively weak demand growth. \"Even if you were to really double what people are projecting, you're still not making up for that supply growth, Rahim said.\nThe crude market has already been feeling the effects of the supply-demand imbalance this year. Apart from a brief blip during the Israel-Iran conflict over the summer, oil prices have been trending lower all year. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $62 a barrel on Tuesday, down 18% year-to-date. West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $58 a barrel, down 19% year-to-date.\n\"Whether it's a glut or a super glut, it's really hard to get away from that,\" he added, though he noted that factors like tighter sanctions and decreased production among OPEC nations and the US could help with the supply outlook.\nIf China, one of the world's largest oil consumers, were to slow its oil purchases, that could be another factor that could usher in the supply glut, he added.\nThe firm's view tracks with what other forecasters see for the oil market next year, some of whom have floated the possibility of a supply glut in the past.\nIn its November report, the International Energy Agency said it expected the world's oil supply to surge by over 3 million barrels a day in 2026 while demand growth remains \"modest by historical standards.\" The agency added that the balance of the market looked \"increasingly askew.\""

The supply of oil is largely determined by long-term projects. The market is expected \"pretty much guaranteed\" to see some of that supply come on in the next year, given that some projects have been planned for a decade or more, he said.\n- Relatively weak demand growth. \"Even if you were to really double what people are projecting, you're still not making up for that supply growth, Rahim said.\nThe crude market has already been feeling the effects of the supply-demand imbalance this year. Apart from a brief blip during the Israel-Iran conflict over the summer, oil prices have been trending lower all year. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $62 a barrel on Tuesday, down 18% year-to-date. West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $58 a barrel, down 19% year-to-date.\n\"Whether it's a glut or a super glut, it's really hard to get away from that,\" he added, though he noted that factors like tighter sanctions and decreased production among OPEC nations and the US could help with the supply outlook.\nIf China, one of the world's largest oil consumers, were to slow its oil purchases, that could be another factor that could usher in the supply glut, he added.\nThe firm's view tracks with what other forecasters see for the oil market next year, some of whom have floated the possibility of a supply glut in the past.\nIn its November report, the International Energy Agency said it expected the world's oil supply to surge by over 3 million barrels a day in 2026 while demand growth remains \"modest by historical standards.\" The agency added that the balance of the market looked \"increasingly askew.\""

                "body": "It has been a quiet start to the week in FX markets outside of the yen, which continued to slide. But the likes of the pound and euro have been little-changed ahead of the Fed meeting tomorrow, where Powell and co could set the tone for the rest of the year in the FX space. The EUR/USD outlook remains modestly bullish, although in the near-term there is a risk of a drop on the back of a potentially hawkish Fed cut, thanks to US data turning a little positive in the last couple of weeks. Today, the weekly ADP came in surprisingly higher, which gave the US dollar a bit of support.\nWhat\u2019s been driving EUR/USD outlook?\nThe euro has been on a decent run lately, and not just against the US dollar. However, with the greenback selling taking a pause ahead of the FOMC rate decision, the EUR/USD pair has stalled after climbing from sub-1.15 handle to around 1.1650.\nHowever, the downside has been limited for the single currency so far, thanks to at least a handful of macro reasons.\nAmong these is lower energy prices, thanks mostly to oversupply from OPEC+ keeping pressure on crude oil. Meanwhile gas prices have dropped to the lowest level in nearly 5 years across the US, standing around $2.90 per gallon on average. The US is an oil exporter, and falling energy prices is usually not a great sign for the dollar. Weaker energy prices have given currencies of energy importing regions like the eurozone\u2019s single currency some breathing room, although not all oil importing currencies have benefited (e.g., the JPY and INR).\nAlso supporting the euro are ongoing peace talks in the Ukraine-Russia war, which is easing geopolitical pressure, and we have seen this in the form of a recovery in the EUR/CHF pair, which is now up for the fourth consecutive week.\nWhat\u2019s more, even though it\u2019s small, we\u2019re have been seeing some mild improvement in Eurozone economic data, which has effectively ended talks of any further near term rate cuts by the ECB.\nAdd in the German fiscal stimulus, which is expected to boost the eurozone\u2019s economics powerhouse in 2026, and suddenly there are not much in the way of negative factors to influence the EUR/USD outlook.\nMeanwhile, the US dollar has been dealing with its usual dose of December seasonal weakness, although it has bounced back at the start of this week. Still, the EUR/USD was still holding somewhat comfortably above the 1.16 handle for now.\nAttention turns to the Fed\nNow things will start to get more interesting. We are now inside a massive two-week period for central bank meetings. We have already heard from the reserve bank of Australia calling an end to the easing cycle with a widely expected rate hold overnight. Next up is the Bank of Canada\u2019s turn to hold policy steady on Wednesday, where the central bank may hint at the next move being a hike in 2026. Next week, the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan are among the more important policy meetings to keep an eye on.\nOf course, the big one is happening this week: the US the Federal Reserve, which is widely expect to trim rates by an additional 25 basis points on Wednesday. But the cut is almost fully priced in. So, the real market mover won\u2019t be the cut itself, but more so the Fed\u2019s tone about rates outlook in 2026 and beyond.\nUS economic data lately has been mixed: Strong in some pockets, soft in others. Whether things will improve or get worse is something no one can predict of course, especially with recent government shutdown delaying the release of critical data.\nNonetheless, markets are looking for a softer, more dovish message from the Fed than we are likely to hear from other major central banks in the next couple of weeks.\nBut here\u2019s the risk: If Powell & Co. don\u2019t validate the 70-80 basis points of easing priced in for 2026, the dollar could bounce back, at least temporarily.\nI say that because the focus is then likely to shift to the governance of the Federal Reserve, with current the Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s tenure set to end in Ma"

Current US job figures show a modest rise in private-sector employment, averaging 4,750 jobs per week, and a slight increase in vacancies to 7.67 million.\nThe US Dollar hovers around six-week lows, with a strong market prediction of a 25-basis-point rate cut. This anticipation comes despite previous labour market concerns and mixed recent data.\nJerome Powells Upcoming Remarks\nJerome Powell\u2019s upcoming remarks are awaited for clues on the easing cycle\u2019s direction. Meanwhile, in the Eurozone, improvements in sentiment have not significantly boosted the Euro.\nThe currency heat map shows percentage changes, with Euro outperforming the Japanese Yen. The table lists how major currencies have shifted against each other today.\nThis has left EUR/USD in a holding pattern as market players await more definitive guidance from the Federal Reserve. This guidance will likely impact EUR/USD\u2019s next directional move.\nWe are seeing the market almost fully price in a 25-basis-point rate cut for this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. This anticipation has kept the US Dollar weak, hovering near lows we haven\u2019t seen since late October 2025. Consequently, EUR/USD is holding steady around 1.1640 as traders wait for the official announcement and guidance.\nThe Real Trade Potential\nThe real trade is not the rate cut itself, but the potential for volatility surrounding Jerome Powell\u2019s forward-looking statements. We should be prepared for him to adopt a firm tone to manage market hopes for a rapid easing cycle into 2026. This setup is ideal for using options strategies like straddles or strangles on EUR/USD to position for a large price swing, regardless of the initial direction.\nRecent data gives the Fed room to ease, with the latest November 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showing headline inflation cooling to 2.9%, continuing its gradual decline. This situation is a world away from the aggressive rate hikes we saw culminate in 2023 when inflation was the primary concern. Still, any surprisingly hawkish commentary could see traders rapidly unwind short-dollar positions.\nWhile the latest JOLTS report showed job openings at 7.67 million, the broader trend in the US labor market remains one of moderation. We have seen nonfarm payrolls growth average just 145,000 over the past quarter, down significantly from the start of the year. This underlying softness supports buying dips in EUR/USD or using call options, but this should be done cautiously ahead of the Fed\u2019s new economic projections.\nOn the other side of the pair, the Euro offers little independent direction, as recent comments from European Central Bank officials suggest a pragmatic, wait-and-see approach. This relative quiet from the ECB means the Fed\u2019s policy path will almost single-handedly drive the EUR/USD pair into early 2026. Our derivative positions should therefore remain focused on catalysts originating from the US economic calendar."

At the time of writing, the pair trades at 1.1626.\nEuro trades sideways as solid US labor data fails to sway expectations for a December rate cut\nEconomic data in the US revealed that the jobs market is still solid, yet the data barely moved expectations for a Fed rate cut on December 10. ADP showed that companies hired people in the week ending November 22, while job vacancies rose according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\nMoney markets indicated an 88% probability that the Fed would lower rates by 25 basis points.

In the last meeting, there were two dissenters, Governor Miran, voting for a 50-bps cut, while Kansas City Fed Jeffrey Schmid wanted to hold rates unchanged.\n- There\u2019s some speculation that the Fed will cut rates, but Powell would lean hawkish at the press conference, pushing against immediate easing next year, to please the hawks in the room.\nTechnical analysis: EUR/USD rangebound below 1.1650, eyes on FOMC meeting\nEUR/USD holds below 1.1650 for a sixth consecutive session, carving out a narrow consolidation band between 1.1650 and 1.1600. The pair\u2019s inability to reclaim 1.1700 kept buyers at bay, as bearish momentum builds as depicted by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) flattening and signaling fading buying pressure\u2014putting at risk any attempt to revisit 1.1800 or the year-to-date high at 1.1918.\nImmediate support below 1.1650 emerges at the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) near 1.1604. A decisive break beneath this zone would expose the 20-day SMA at 1.1597, followed by the 1.1500 psychological level.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone.

UK Retail Sales for November fell from 1.5% YoY to 1.2%, below forecasts of 2.4%, impacting GBP/USD.\nTechnically, GBP/USD appears neutral to upward biased, but risks further losses given its breach of the 200-day SMA. Further support lies at the 50-day SMA at 1.3259, with potential declines towards the 20-day SMA at 1.3201 and the 1.3150 area.\nThe US dollar is gaining strength, and we see the British pound weakening because of it. Stronger than expected American job openings data has pushed the GBP/USD pair below the key 200-day moving average, a bearish signal for us. All eyes are now on the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decision coming up this week.\nTo support this view, we can see that recent US inflation data from November 2025 showed core CPI holding firm at 3.8%, which is still significantly above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. This, combined with the strong JOLTS report, gives the Fed every reason to maintain its restrictive stance. In contrast, the UK economy is showing signs of slowing down, with last week\u2019s data confirming just 0.1% GDP growth for the third quarter of 2025.\nPositioning For Further Downside\nThe Federal Reserve is therefore likely to signal that interest rates will remain higher for longer, which will continue to attract capital to the US dollar. The market is pricing in a hawkish pause, where the Fed holds rates but emphasizes that the fight against inflation is not over. This outlook puts further downward pressure on other currencies like the pound.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England is in a difficult position. Members are openly worried about persistent inflation, but the weak retail sales and stagnant growth limit their ability to raise rates further without risking a recession. This policy conflict creates uncertainty, which is typically negative for a currency.\nGiven this divergence, we should consider positioning for further downside in GBP/USD over the coming weeks. Buying put options on the pound offers a way to profit from a potential drop, especially if the Fed delivers a hawkish message that pushes the pair toward its next support levels. This strategy also provides a hedge against any long sterling positions we might hold.\nWe saw a similar dynamic play out in late 2022, when the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate-hiking cycle far outpaced the Bank of England\u2019s, leading to a sharp decline in the GBP/USD exchange rate. That period of policy divergence provides a historical template for what we might expect now. The current combination of a robust US labor market and a fragile UK economy is echoing that pattern.\nWith the break below the 200-day moving average at 1.3331, our immediate focus shifts to the next technical support level. We will be watching the 50-day moving average at 1.3259 closely. A decisive break below that could open the door for a slide toward the 1.3200 area."

Price action has slumped back into the 1.3300 handle and is holding just north of the long-term 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near 1.3250 as markets hunker down for the last Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision of 2025.\nFed on deck, rate cut expected but tone matters\nInvestors are mainly focused on the Fed's interest rate decision scheduled for December 10, which is widely anticipated to result in a third consecutive quarter-point reduction. Fed funds futures currently suggest about an 87% probability of a cut, a significant increase from a month earlier. Market participants believe that the outcome of this rate decision, along with Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s messaging in one of his final press conferences before the rate decision, could influence market sentiment for the rest of December. This is especially true as markets grapple with persistent inflation, delayed economic data, and the ongoing transition toward new Fed leadership in 2026.\nBeyond this immediate decision, analysts note that markets are already eyeing the next phase of Fed leadership and potential shifts in communication strategies amidst a year marked by unpredictable expectations. With the Fed\u2019s dual mandate still under pressure from uneven inflation and slowing labor markets, investors are keenly observing whether policymakers can keep an accommodative approach in 2026 or if economic conditions will necessitate a more cautious stance.\nBoE lurks around the corner\nThis week, UK economic data releases are quite subdued, but the Pound Sterling will prepare for a busy schedule next week, leading up to a possible interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE). The BoE's policy positions are generally more diverse than the often cautious statements from the US Federal Reserve. However, BoE officials have been increasingly open to the idea of further rate cuts, especially since the latest Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, where a narrow majority decided to keep rates unchanged.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling.

And more importantly, since the Fed started cutting rates in September, buyers have been in-charge until the strong zone of resistance around the 100-handle in DXY stymied the advance.\nUS Dollar Weekly Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEuro Remains the Key for FX Market Trends\nAt this point there\u2019s still higher-highs and lows on shorter-term charts but bulls still have yet to make a significant mark on the EUR/USD pair. I\u2019m looking to the major pair as a key determinant for USD direction, although I\u2019m still focusing directional Dollar plays elsewhere such as GBP/USD or USD/JPY.\nIn EUR/USD, support at the 1.1593-1.1600 zone is key and if sellers can push below that, the breakout test last week starts to look like a failure, USD strength would be on the verge of taking over, and this would then point to another test at the 100-handle in DXY.\nIn that scenario, however, I still think I\u2019d prefer USD/JPY for USD-strength scenarios as I\u2019ll look at below.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/USD\nWhile the rally in EUR/USD has been unconvincing, the structure has been cleaner in GBP/USD, and this stands in stark contrast to what we looked at in the webinar in early-November.\nI wrote about the pair yesterday with updated levels and so far, the 1.3287 price has come in as support, and there\u2019s additional structure a bit lower, around 1.3250 and 1.3186.\nGBP/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/JPY Bulls Go Back to Work\nUSD/JPY had a clean pullback, held support at prior resistance, building a falling wedge along the way, and has since broken out in the prior trend side direction. For USD-strength, this remains the venue that I find most attractive and like I looked at yesterday, that JPY-weakness theme can be focused elsewhere, as well, for those that would like to avoid the USD altogether.\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\n--- written by James Stanley, Senior Market Analyst, Global Macro\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

                "body": "AUD/USD consolidates below mid-0.6600s; bulls await Fed decision amid RBA's hawkish tilt\n- AUD/USD lacks firm intraday direction as traders opt to wait for the crucial FOMC rate decision.\n- The RBA\u2019s hawkish stance offsets mixed Chinese inflation data and acts as a tailwind for the AUD.\n- Bets for more rate cuts by the Fed keep the USD depressed and further lend support to the pair.\nThe AUD/USD pair is seen consolidating its recent strong gains to the highest level since September 18, touched the previous day, and seesaws between tepid gains/minor losses through the Asian session on Wednesday. Spot prices currently trade around the 0.6640 area, nearly unchanged for the day, as traders keenly await the outcome of a two-day FOMC meeting.\nThe US Federal Reserve (Fed) is scheduled to announce its policy decision later during the US session and is widely expected to lower borrowing costs by 25 basis points (bps). This has been a key factor behind the recent US Dollar (USD) decline to its lowest level since late October and the AUD/USD pair's strong move up witnessed over the past two weeks or so. Traders, however, seem reluctant to place aggressive bets and opt to wait for more cues about the Fed's future rate cut path.\nHence, the focus will remain glued to updated economic projections and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments during the post-meeting press conference. The outlook, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and determining the next leg of a directional move for the AUD/USD pair. In the meantime, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish stance might continue to underpin the Australian Dollar (AUD) and act as a tailwind for the currency pair.\nThe RBA, as was expected, left the Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 3.6% on Tuesday. Moreover, RBA Governor Michele Bullock said that the Board discussed what they might have to do if rates need to go up and that it looks like more rate cuts are not needed. This, in turn, backs the case for a further appreciating move for the Aussie, which seems rather unaffected by mixed Chinese inflation figures, showing that consumer prices accelerated in November while producer deflation persisted.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics reported earlier today that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerated to the 0.7% YoY rate last month, as compared to the 0.2% rise recorded in October. In contrast, the Producer Prices Index (PPI) declined 2.2% YoY in November, compared with a 2.1% fall in the previous month. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop seems tilted in favor of the AUD bulls and suggests that the path of least resistance for the AUD/USD pair remains to the upside.\nAustralian Dollar Price This Month\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies this month. Australian Dollar was the strongest against the Swiss Franc.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Australian Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent AUD (base)/USD (quote).\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

With inflation rising to 3.5% y/y in Q3 - the highest level in over a year - policymakers now view risks as \"tilted to the upside\". At the same time, they appeared more optimistic about the economic outlook, noting that the economy \"continues to recover\" after GDP grew 2.1% y/y in the third quarter, marking the fastest pace in two years.[1]\nWhat's more, Governor Bullock delivered a clearly hawkish message during the press conference, stating succinctly that \"I don't think there are interest rate cuts on the horizon for the foreseeable future\" and that the board has discussed the circumstances that could warrant a rate hike next year.[2]\nAUD/USD rose following the decision, with the US dollar under pressure as markets bet the Federal Reserve will cut rates on Wednesday amid a recent run of weak employment data and a benign core PCE reading. These shifting dynamics could support further AUD/USD strength towards the 2025 peak.\nNonetheless, the Fed may opt for a one-and-done message due to persistent inflation, upside risks from tariffs, and a data gap stemming from the recent government shutdown. Moreover, the RBA may find it difficult to raise rates given rising unemployment and continued economic headwinds. As a result, AUD/USD remains vulnerable to declines back towards the 200-day EMA, which would challenge the pair's upside momentum.\nNikos Tzabouras\nSenior Financial Editorial Writer\nNikos Tzabouras is a graduate of the Department of International & European Economic Studies at the Athens University of Economics and Business.

                "body": "The AUD/USD exchange rate has experienced gains this week, a trend ANZ analysts attribute to the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) recent December meeting. The central bank maintained the cash rate at 3.6 per cent, aligning with market expectations. However, RBA Governor Michele Bullock\u2019s commentary struck a hawkish tone, noting that inflation risks are \u201ctilted to the upside\u201d. Bullock downplayed the necessity for future rate cuts, reinforcing forecasts that the cash rate will likely remain steady through 2026.\nThe Australian 2-year government bond yield reached a 13-month peak, contributing to widening Australia-US yield differentials, which have now hit multi-year highs. Market pricing currently indicates a full probability of at least one 25 basis point hike by mid-2026. This pricing is buoyed by ongoing domestic growth and persistent inflationary pressures within the Australian economy.\nMarket focus is now shifting towards Australia\u2019s upcoming November labour force report. The RBA has previously identified tightness in the labour market as a potential upside risk to inflation. Consequently, stronger-than-anticipated wage growth or substantial employment gains could solidify the existing hawkish outlook.\nAdding to the positive sentiment surrounding the Australian dollar, China\u2019s November trade figures revealed a 5.9 per cent year-on-year increase in exports, a significant rebound from October\u2019s 1.1 per cent decline. Given Australia\u2019s economic reliance on Chinese demand, this data provides additional support for the Aussie\u2019s upward trajectory."

                "body": "Japanese producer prices fueled speculation about a December Bank of Japan rate hike on Wednesday, December 10. Producer prices signaled sticky consumer price inflation midway through the fourth quarter. USD/JPY dropped in response to the uptick in producer prices, partially reversing the previous day\u2019s 0.63% loss on the hot US JOLTs Job Openings report.\nWhile the November figures bolstered bets about a December BoJ rate hike, traders faced a higher degree of uncertainty on the Fed\u2019s monetary policy outlook. Market bets on a December Fed rate cut remained firm despite solid overnight US jobs data.\nHowever, the absence of October inflation and labor market data, canceled because of the US government shutdown, has left the Fed flying blind on crucial reports needed to make an informed interest rate decision and offer meaningful economic projections.\nGiven these dynamics and USD/JPY\u2019s return to 156, the short-term outlook looks cautiously bullish, while the medium-term outlook remains bearish, hinged on the Fed cutting and the BoJ raising rates.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nProducer prices increased 2.7% year-on-year in November, mirroring October\u2019s trend, lifting demand for the Japanese yen. November\u2019s producer prices indicated rising import prices, forcing producers to pass higher costs on to consumers. Higher prices may also signal stronger demand, enabling producers to raise prices and fuel demand-driven inflation.\nThe BoJ has raised previously concerns about the weaker yen pushing import prices higher, adversely affecting household purchasing power. Rising producer prices will give the BoJ hawks a stronger argument to raise interest rates on December 19.\nUSD/JPY responded, briefly falling from 156.840 to 156.795 after the data.\nThe November data followed BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s optimistic economic outlook. He stated that the economy will return to growth in the fourth quarter and beyond, reinforcing his recent bullish pivot. Last week, Governor Ueda supported a rate hike, citing strong wage growth, fading US tariff risks, and FX weakness.\nWhile expectations of a BoJ rate hike are strengthening yen demand, the FOMC interest rate decision, FOMC Economic Projections, and Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference will dictate buyer appetite for the US dollar.\nLater on Wednesday, the Fed will take center stage as investors await its highly anticipated interest rate decision and Economic Projections. Economists expect the Fed to lower interest rates by 25 basis points, with the CME FedWatch Tool giving an 87.6% chance of a rate cut.\nBarring an unexpected hold or a surprise 50-basis-point cut, the market focus will be on the Economic Projections and the dot plot on rate expectations. Notably, the chances of a Q1 2026 rate cut declined overnight.\nThe FOMC Committee has divided into two camps in recent months. On one side, members support further policy easing to bolster a cooling labor market, while on the other, voters view sticky inflation as a reason to pause further cuts. Given the division among voting members, a hawkish cut looks likely, where the Fed downplays further easing in the near-term, but remains data dependent.\nThe Economic Projections and dot plot will provide the crucial insights into the Fed\u2019s outlook and potential rate path. For context, the September dot plot projected a 3.25%-3.50% Fed Funds Rate (FFR) by the end of 2026.\nA 25-basis-point rate cut today would leave two further rate cuts to align with the September dot plot, the baseline for traders. A dovish Fed rate cut would be a lower FFR by the end of 2026, while a hawkish cut would be a higher 2026 FFR forecast.\nNotably, the projections will be based on outdated inflation and jobs data, given the cancellation of October data. The absence of October\u2019s government reports may downplay the influence of inflation, unemployment, and GDP projections on US dollar demand. Howev"

                "body": "USD/JPY, DAX Forecast: Two trades to watch\nUSD/JPY rises amid yen weakness post-earthquake & with central banks in focus\nUSD/JPY is rising amid yen weakness. The yen is the weakest G10 currency, falling against its major peers.\nThe yen fell yesterday and is extending those losses today, albeit to a lesser extent, after coming under pressure following an earthquake in northeastern Japan on Monday, which briefly raised concerns about economic disruptions. The earthquake measured 7.6 on the Richter Scale, and Tsunami warnings have now been lifted.\nA downward revision to Japan\u2019s Q3 GDP also weighed on the currency, supporting PM Takaichi\u2019s stance to boost growth, while also complicating the outlook for the BoJ.\nThe central bank is expected to raise interest rates next week amid a gradual path to normalization. While recent hawkish comments from BoJ Ueda have helped the yen recover from an 8-month low versus the USD, the yen still trades over 5% lower since the start of October, pressurised by PM Takaichi's huge spending plans, which have sent Japanese bond yields to multi-decade highs.\nAny meaningful recovery in the yen would require not just the BOG to follow through with stronger guidance but also for policymakers to demonstrate fiscal prudence.\nThis weakness in the yen is more evident against other yen crosses, with the JPY trading at a 16-month low versus GBP, a 35-month low versus the AUD, and at a 17-month low versus the AUD, particularly after the hawkish RBA held overnight.\nMeanwhile, the USD is unchanged ahead of tomorrow\u2019s FOMC rate decision, where the central bank is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, which is broadly priced in. Attention will be on Powell\u2019s tone and the dot plot for clues over what comes next.\nToday, JOLTS job openings and ADP 4-week average employment change will be in focus, but moves in the USD could remain muted ahead of tomorrow's decision.\nNear-term Worries of hawkish Fed cut and a dovish BoJ hike are supportive of USD/JPY.\nUSD/JPY forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nUSD/JPY broke out of the multi-month rising channel, hitting an 8-month high of 157.90 before easing lower to the 155 support zone. The price has recovered from the 155 support zone and is heading higher, testing the 156.40 resistance level. The long-term uptrend remains intact.\nBuyers will look to rise above 156.40 to extend gains to 157.90 and beyond, creating a higher high towards 160.00.\nSupport is seen at 155. A break below here opens the door to 153, the October 8 high, and the 50 SMA.\nDAX rises to an almost 1-month high\nThe DAX is rising for a fourth straight session, pushing to a nearly monthly high of 24,180.\nThe rise in Europe follows solid gains in the US after U.S. President Trump said NVIDIA should be allowed to export its top H200 chips to China. However, there is also an element of caution ahead of tomorrow\u2019s FOMC decision.\nThe Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points; however, the main focus will be on what Fed Powell says, given the divided central bank, and on how many rate cuts the dot plot projects for 2026.\nMarkets are predicting 77 basis points of easing through the end of 2026, meaning two more rate cuts after the December reduction remain on the table. The broad expectation is for a semi-hawkish tone from the Fed, cautioning that the bar is high for another rate cut, so that a dovish tilt could boost volatility for stocks across the globe.\nOn the data front, German exports unexpectedly rose in October, defying expectations for a decline, thanks to European Union trade, while shipments to the US and China fell sharply. Exports from Europe's largest economy rose 0.1% in October, below expectations of 0.5%.\nExports to EU countries rose by 2.7% on the month, whilst exports of goods to countries outside of the EU declined by 3.3%.\nThe trump administration imposed a 15% import tariff on most goods from the EU under a deal reached with the bloc.

The pair has rebounded sharply from 155.00, a key structural support level tested last week, and now trades just below the 157.14\u2013157.90 resistance area corresponding to the 2025 yearly open. The latest recovery reflects sustained dollar strength supported by resilient U.S. Treasury yields and a persistent monetary policy gap with Japan. The broader trend remains upward but faces immediate technical resistance near the upper boundary of the December range.\nTechnical Setup and Momentum Signals\nThe short-term pattern for USD/JPY shows compression inside a narrow ascending channel, with the pair positioned above both its 20-day moving average (155.85) and 15-day moving average (156.12). This alignment signals controlled bullish momentum rather than overextension. The RSI (14) remains near 56, indicating steady demand without overbought pressure. Price structure continues to respect higher lows from 154.45 and 155.00, reflecting consistent dip buying. Immediate resistance is seen between 157.14 and 157.90, while a daily close above that range could extend the move toward 158.50\u2013158.80. On the downside, initial support holds at 155.36, followed by 153.65, representing a key retracement of the broader April advance.\nFederal Reserve Outlook and Rate Path Expectations\nMarket participants are closely watching the FOMC\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections, particularly the dot plot, which will shape expectations for 2026 rate policy. Current pricing implies a high likelihood of a 0.25% cut, with the next potential move projected for the second quarter of 2026. This moderation in the pace of easing keeps the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield anchored near 4.18%, well above the Japanese 10-year yield at 0.84%. The 334-basis-point gap continues to favor dollar carry trades. Should the Fed signal a slower pace of rate adjustments, the spread could stabilize near current levels, maintaining support for USD/JPY around 155\u2013157 into early 2026.\nBank of Japan Policy and Yen Constraints\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains cautious in shifting policy direction, limiting upside potential for the yen. With inflation data showing mixed persistence and wage growth still moderate, policymakers have refrained from tightening. The BoJ\u2019s benchmark rate remains near -0.10%, and traders currently see less than a 35% chance of any rate adjustment before mid-2026. This continued divergence between the Fed\u2019s restrictive policy stance and BoJ\u2019s ultra-loose framework reinforces structural yen weakness. As long as Japan maintains negative real yields, speculative flows are likely to favor long dollar exposure, keeping USD/JPY supported even amid moderate corrections.\nCorrelation with Japanese Equities and Risk Sentiment\nThe Nikkei 225 continues to reflect strong investor confidence, holding near 50,000 points, its highest level since 1990. The 60-day correlation with USD/JPY stands at 0.9, signaling synchronized movement between risk appetite and currency dynamics. Global equity resilience, subdued volatility (VIX at 16.7), and stable U.S. dollar conditions have dampened safe-haven demand for the yen. As a result, even modest pullbacks in U.S. yields have failed to translate into significant yen strength, highlighting how global capital rotation remains a decisive driver for the pair.\nRead More\n-\nVIG ETF Hits $220.60 as Dividend Growth and $116.6B AUM Signal Renewed Upside\n09.12.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS A"

                "body": "CAD crosses enter a pivotal 24-hour window with BoC and FOMC meetings lined up. Volatility is already elevated in USD/CAD, and both EUR/CAD and AUD/CAD are probing key technical levels that could define the next major swing.\nBelow is the full technical breakdown for USD/CAD, EUR/CAD and AUD/CAD as traders position for the twin risks of the FOMC and BoC meetings.\nView related analysis:\n- Gold Grinds Unconvincingly Higher, USD Holds Ground Into FOMC\n- Japanese Yen Weakness Lifts USD/JPY and EUR/JPY while Nikkei Holds 50k\n- S&P 500 Seasonality: How Santa's Rally Across Wall Street Stacks Up\n- ASX 200 Market Outlook: All Sectors See Red After Hawkish RBA Hold\n- Dead Cat Bounce Explained: How False Rallies Form in Downtrends\nCAD Crosses: RBA Hold, Technical Setups into FOMC and BoC\nReserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Signals Hawkish Tilt as AUD Outperforms\nThe Australian dollar was the strongest major currency on Monday after the RBA delivered a hawkish hold. The statement noted that inflation risks have tilted to the upside, and Governor Bullock said the Board will have a clearer read on those risks by the February meeting \u2014 placing extra emphasis on the Q4 CPI figures due on 26 January.\nWhile a hike was not considered, the conditions for one were discussed. The RBA is clearly preparing investors for the possibility of a rate increase, with incoming data determining the timing on a meeting-by-meeting basis.\nBank of Canada (BOC) up Next\nIt seems inevitable that the BOC will be the next central bank to deliver a hawkish hold. Strong employment, sticky inflation and better than expected growth also opens the door for potential hikes. The question for traders now is whether this has already been priced in, or whether the BOC deliver a more hawkish tone to justify an extension of gains for the Canadian dollar we\u2019ve already seen these past two weeks.\nFinal FOMC Meeting Also Up for Grabs\nNot wanting to miss out, the Fed could be the third central bank to deliver a hawkish tone, though they're expected to deliver a 25bp cut hold at their final FOMC meeting of the year. Updated staff projections will also be released, so traders will keep a close eye on the dot plot and interest rate forecast to see how many cuts are lined up for 2026. Bank of America estimate two 25bp cuts, but I am with Goldman Sachs who anticipate just one cut. But given the recent trend of cuts turning to hikes, the Fed are trapped between concerns over rising inflation and pressure from President Trump who clearly wants multiple cuts.\nUSD/CAD Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Canadian Dollar\nCanadian dollar implied vols spike\nAs expected, overnight implied volatility in USD/CAD has surged ahead of the BoC and FOMC meetings. We\u2019re also seeing 1-week implied volatility trade at a premium to the 1-month tenor, with both drifting higher.\nThis sets the stage for two-way price swings around the central bank events, but note that options positioning leans mildly bearish for USD/CAD. Both the 1-week and 1-month risk reversals are trending lower, signalling stronger demand for puts than calls.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nUSD/CAD Bounce Risk Before Bear Trend Potentially Resumes\nThe daily chart shows US\u2013Canada 2-year yield differentials holding near cycle lows, implying any USD/CAD bounce may be short-lived. Still, with the pair already down 2.3% in two weeks and stabilising above support, a short-term rebound is plausible before the broader downtrend resumes.\nA bullish divergence has formed on the RSI(2) within oversold territory, and price is holding above the September VPOC near 1.38 and the monthly S2 pivot.\nKey resistance sits around 1.390 via the monthly S1 pivot and 1.3880, followed by the 200-day EMA (1.3919), the November low (1.3938), and the weekly VPOC (1.3962). These levels offer potential fade zones should sellers look to re-engage with the dominant bearish trend after an anticipated bounce.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingVi"

                "body": "USD/CAD ticks up to near 1.3850 in countdown to BoC-Fed monetary policy\n- USD/CAD edges higher to near 1.3850 ahead of Canada-US interest rate policy.\n- The BoC is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 2.25%, while the Fed seems to cut them by 25 bps.\n- US employers posted 7.67 million fresh jobs in October, unexpectedly higher than the former reading of 7.658 million.\nThe USD/CAD pair trades marginally higher to near 1.3855 during the Asian trading session on Wednesday. The Loonie pair is expected to trade broadly sideways as investors await monetary policy announcements by the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Federal Reserve (Fed), which are scheduled for the North American session.\nAt the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades flat around 99.25, following an upside move the previous day. The DXY attracted bids on Tuesday after the release of the surprisingly upbeat United States (US) JOLTS Job Openings data for October. The data showed that fresh jobs posted increased marginally to 7.67 million from 7.658 in September, while they were expected to come in lower at 7.2 million.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75% in the December policy meeting is 87.6%. This would be the third interest rate cut by the Fed in a row.\nAssuming that the Fed is almost certain to ease interest rates further, the major highlight of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy will be the Economic Projections report. The report will provide fresh estimates for inflation, growth and unemployment, and the Fed\u2019s dot plot, which shows where policymakers collectively see Federal Funds Rate heading in the medium and longer term.\nMeanwhile, the BoC is expected to hold interest rates steady at 2.25% amid signs that Canada\u2019s labor market is regaining ground. In the September-November period, the Canadian economy has created 180.6K fresh jobs after releasing 106.3K workers in the July-August period. The Unemployment Rate has also fallen to 6.9% in November from 6.5% in October.\nEconomic Indicator\nFed Interest Rate Decision\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) deliberates on monetary policy and makes a decision on interest rates at eight pre-scheduled meetings per year. It has two mandates: to keep inflation at 2%, and to maintain full employment. Its main tool for achieving this is by setting interest rates \u2013 both at which it lends to banks and banks lend to each other. If it decides to hike rates, the US Dollar (USD) tends to strengthen as it attracts more foreign capital inflows. If it cuts rates, it tends to weaken the USD as capital drains out to countries offering higher returns. If rates are left unchanged, attention turns to the tone of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement, and whether it is hawkish (expectant of higher future interest rates), or dovish (expectant of lower future rates).\nRead more.Next release: Wed Dec 10, 2025 19:00\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 3.75%\nPrevious: 4%\nSource: Federal Reserve\nAuthor\nSagar Dua\nFXStreet\nSagar Dua is associated with the financial markets from his college days.

                "body": "Over the past five trading sessions, USD/CAD has maintained a notable bearish bias in favor of the Canadian dollar, accumulating a decline of more than 1% in the short term as the market approaches the upcoming policy decisions from the central banks of the United States and Canada. For now, the expectation of lower rates in the United States and a neutral stance in Canada continues to support the strength of the Canadian dollar, which could keep consistent selling pressure on USD/CAD during the next trading sessions.\nWhat to Expect from the Central Banks?\nTomorrow\u2019s session will be particularly important for both the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, as it will mark the final interest rate decision of the year for both central banks. These announcements will also provide insight into each bank\u2019s monetary policy direction heading into next year. At the moment, the central bank leaning most toward a lower-rate environment in the short term is the Federal Reserve, as recent comments from several members signal that the institution is prioritizing economic relief rather than maintaining an aggressive anti-inflation stance. With just one day remaining before the official decision, the CME Group probability model shows an 87.4% chance of a rate cut from 4.00% to 3.75% during the December 10 meeting.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nThe outlook for the Bank of Canada is quite different. A series of positive economic surprises\u2014such as stronger-than-expected GDP growth of 2.6% annualized in the third quarter (well above the 0.5% forecast), and the addition of 53,600 jobs in November versus an expected loss of 5,000\u2014has led the bank to reconsider its policy stance. Increased economic activity could generate inflationary pressures, especially considering that the central bank\u2019s inflation target is 2.00%, while October inflation printed at 2.2%, still slightly above the target.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nGiven these conditions, it is possible that, unlike the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada may lean toward maintaining a neutral interest rate to contain inflation risks in the short term, keeping the policy rate unchanged at 2.25%. As the rate divergence between both central banks widens, Canadian-dollar-denominated fixed-income instruments remain more attractive, while those denominated in U.S. dollars become less appealing as U.S. yields decline. This dynamic could encourage capital inflows into Canada and reduce demand for U.S. dollars, since a stable rate in Canada supports stronger foreign demand for CAD, whereas increasingly lower rates in the United States reduce appetite for USD investments and weaken the currency\u2019s demand.\nThus, if a neutral stance from the Bank of Canada is confirmed alongside a rate cut from the Federal Reserve, the combination could act as a key catalyst, maintaining the Canadian dollar\u2019s strength and generating continued selling pressure on USD/CAD in the coming sessions.\nUSD/CAD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend at Risk: Since mid-June of this year, the bullish structure in USD/CAD had managed to sustain a relevant buying bias, forming a consistent uptrend line through the second half of the year. However, recent bearish movements have begun to jeopardize this structure, as the price has crossed below both the 50-period and 200-period moving averages, signaling an increasingly dominant bearish tone competing directly with the uptrend. If selling pressure continues in the sessions ahead, this could result in a definitive break of the uptrend and shift the pair toward a bearish bias into the final weeks of 2025.\n- RSI: The RSI line maintains a steady downward slope and remains below the 50 neutral level, indicating that the average bearish momentum over the past 14 sessions confirms the presence of a significant short-term selling bias. However, the indicator is approaching the 30 level, associated with oversold conditions. If the RSI dips into this zone, it may signal an excess of selling pressure, "

ARKF picked up 5,754 shares of ARKB, while ARKW bought 49,246 shares. The transaction was valued at $1.7 million based on ARKB\u2019s closing price of $30.92.\nRecent analysis highlighted how repeated sell-offs at the start of the U.S. session have erased earlier Bitcoin advances, a pattern some market observers attribute to aggressive high-frequency strategies that lean on liquidity pockets before reversing course.\nMeanwhile, the new Commodity Futures Trading Commission framework, announced by Acting Chair Caroline Pham, has widened Bitcoin's role inside traditional finance by permitting approved intermediaries to accept major tokens and stablecoins as margin under strict custody and reporting rules.\nAt the same time, crypto prediction markets now assign roughly even odds that Bitcoin can break above 100,000 before the end of 2025, giving Ark a macro backdrop where regulatory tailwinds and expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts offset near-term volatility.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin traded 2.49% higher over 24 hours at $92,269.08 as Wall Street priced in expectations of a rate cut.\nOther Key Trades\nAlongside the ARKB accumulation, Ark made several notable adjustments across its sector-focused funds on the same Tuesday session.\n- Ark trimmed its position in Ibotta (IBTA), unloading 52,047 shares from ARKF and another 47,141 shares from ARKW.\n- The firm continued to reduce exposure to satellite operator Iridium Communications Inc. (IRDM), selling 23,994 shares from ARKK, 5,681 shares from ARKQ and 1,575 shares from ARKX.\n- In the genomics sleeve, ARKG offloaded 90,807 shares of Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp (ADPT) while adding 17,732 shares of Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (ARCT) and 1,653 shares of GeneDx Holdings Corp (WGS).\n- ARKQ also pared back its semiconductor testing exposure by selling 2,253 shares of Teradyne Inc. (TER), aligning with Ark's recent pattern of reallocating capital from mature hardware names to higher-growth innovation themes.\nBenzinga Edge Stock Rankings indicate ARKB falters on Short, Medium and Long Price Trends.

Let\u2019s look at how this move to Layer-2 tech is changing Ethereum\u2019s economy and what it means for businesses.\nWhat\u2019s Happening with Ethereum Fees?\nRecently, Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees have plummeted. The 90-day simple moving average has fallen below 300 ETH per day, which is a significant drop. This suggests a shift in demand toward Layer-2 solutions, as on-chain activity slows down.

It\u2019s a fundamental change in how the Ethereum economy works.\nLayer-2 Solutions Are Gaining Traction\nLayer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are here to help Ethereum scale better by processing transactions off-chain, then settling on the mainnet. This can drastically cut transaction costs, making crypto payroll more practical for startups. With fees potentially dropping to below $0.01 per transaction, businesses can now think about using cryptocurrency payments without worrying about high costs. This opens up possibilities for real-time settlements and micro-payments.\nWhat Does This Mean for Validators and DeFi Protocols?\nThe drop in Ethereum fees has a significant impact on validators and DeFi protocols that are still on Layer-1. As transaction volumes decrease, validator income is affected, which could lead to big changes in the Ethereum economy. On the other hand, DeFi protocols that depend on high transaction volumes for revenue might have to adapt to this new reality. The shift to Layer-2 networks seems to be changing the Ethereum ecosystem fundamentally. Flexibility is key for protocols hoping to stay afloat in this new environment.\nStartups and Crypto Payroll: A New Opportunity\nFor startups, this drop in Ethereum fees is an opportunity to adopt crypto payroll solutions. By using Layer-2 technologies, businesses can simplify their payroll processes and cut costs associated with traditional payment methods. This means startups can invoice freelancers in crypto, improving payout efficiency and attracting talent. Using stablecoins for payroll makes it easier to manage payments to international teams.\nSummary: Adapting to Ethereum's Changes\nThis significant drop in Ethereum fees due to Layer-2 scaling will make crypto payroll solutions more available, affordable, and scalable for startups. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, businesses must adapt to these changes. By taking advantage of Layer-2 solutions, startups can tackle the challenges of crypto payroll, ultimately fostering growth in the decentralized finance space. The future of Ethereum is bright, and those who adjust to its shifting dynamics will be prepared to thrive in this new blockchain era."

                "body": "On-chain Gas Futures: Vitalik's Genius Idea or a False Proposition for Retail Investors?\nWritten by: KarenZ, Foresight News\nIn the Ethereum ecosystem, the volatility of Gas fees has always troubled developers and users.\nTo address this, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed a thought-provoking solution: to build a trustless on-chain Gas futures market, using financial market mechanisms to resolve the uncertainty of future costs.\nAlthough technical upgrades and a quiet on-chain market have made Ethereum Gas fees very cheap at present, community concerns have not dissipated. Vitalik pointed out this real contradiction.\nEven though Gas fees are currently low, developers and institutions are still asking: \"What will happen in two years?\" When technologists respond with roadmaps\u2014fees will remain low, BAL (Block-Level Access Lists), ePBS (Proposer-Builder Separation), and future ZK-EVM (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) will continue to increase the Gas limit.\nHowever, pure technical promises can sometimes seem weak. After all, the history of network congestion is still fresh in memory.\nFor project teams, low fees now do not mean controllable costs in the future. For large institutions, the uncertainty of Gas price volatility often becomes a major obstacle to Ethereum adoption.\nThe on-chain Gas futures market proposed by Vitalik is essentially about turning decentralized market expectations for Gas fees into tradable standardized contracts. This mechanism has several core values:\nTransparent Expectation Signals\nThe price in the futures market is itself a summary of information. If market participants generally believe that future Gas fees will remain low, the futures price will reflect this belief. Conversely, if not, because it is backed by real capital allocation decisions.\nRisk Hedging Tools\nFor different ecosystem roles, the Gas futures market allows developers to tailor risk management solutions:\nBoosting Institutional Confidence\nLarge institutions and enterprises generally dislike unpredictable operating costs. The Gas futures market will provide them with tools similar to commodity hedging in traditional finance, making them more willing to migrate core businesses to Ethereum and further attracting institutional capital inflows.\nPioneers in Gas Financialization\nAlthough the concept of Gas futures is still in its early stages, several projects have already begun practical exploration.\nETHGAS is building a foundational financial market for the Ethereum blockspace market, and is already live on the mainnet and available for testing on the Hoodi network. In terms of Gas cashback and hedging, ETHGAS allows DApps to hedge Gas to lock in a fixed Gas cost, turning volatile costs into predictable operating expenses. Then, users transact on DApps partnered with ETHGAS and pay Gas fees as usual, but in reality, the DApp covers this cost for the user in the background. Afterwards, users can access the ETHGas dashboard to view and claim all cashback. In addition, ETHGAS will launch Base Fee futures, allowing traders to go long or short on the Base Fee.\nHedgehog is a prediction market focused on on-chain metrics, supporting predictions for Base Fee, Priority Fee, funding rates, blob fees, BTC transaction volatility, and more. In March 2024, Hedgehog completed a $1.5 million pre-seed round, with investments from Marshland Capital, Tenzor Capital, Prometeus Ventures, 3Commas Capital, Nothing Research, and angel investors such as Lido Finance co-founder Vasiliy Shapovalov, Yearn Finance's anonymous developer Banteg, and Gearbox's anonymous core contributor ivangbi. Currently, Hedgehog is still in the waiting list stage.\nDaniele Sesta's DeFAI project Hey Anon has announced that it will launch a prediction market called Pandora this month, where anyone can predict events, including Gas fees. Additionally, Pandora can be seen as a launchpad, where users can fork Pandora and create a prediction market specifically for Gas prices on "

According to Daylight, roughly 60% of the cost of a typical residential solar installation comes not from hardware, but from customer acquisition and other inefficiencies.\nTo tackle this, DayFi is applying crypto-native tools such as token incentives and permissionless vaults to coordinate capital and scale infrastructure.\nBadeaux said Daylight\u2019s model brings together incentives, financing, and standardization onto one network, making distributed solar more accessible to users and more usable by grid operators and power traders.\n\"That\u2019s building a new type of financial instrument, one you can\u2019t access in traditional markets unless you\u2019re one of the few large banks underwriting huge securitizations of distributed energy portfolios,\" Badeaux said.\nHow DayFi works\nAt the core of DayFi is the use of two tokens: GRID and sGRID.\nGRID is a stablecoin built on M0\u2019s tech stack and is fully collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and cash. It does not pay yield.\nsGRID, the yieldcoin, is a derivative that combines Treasury interest with the actual revenue generated from Daylight\u2019s solar installations. Deposits are locked for two months using vault infrastructure provided by Upshift and managed with curation strategies by K3. The capital investors deploy are lent out against tokenized rights to the cash flows of energy infrastructure.\nFrom the investors perspective, they can deposit stablecoins into smart contract vaults. Those funds are used to finance rooftop solar and battery systems. Revenues from these energy systems \u2014 generated through long-term power contracts, grid incentives and participation in virtual power plants \u2014 are tokenized and returned to depositors in the form of a yield token.\nDaylight currently is active in Illinois and Massachusetts, with plans to expand to more regional markets across the U.S. including California.\nRead more: Obex Raises $37M to Build 'Y Combinator' for RWA-Backed Stablecoins, Led by Framework, Sky\nMore For You\nProtocol Research: GoPlus Security\nWhat to know:\n- As of October 2025, "

                "body": "As 2025 unfolds, Solana (SOL) finds itself at a crucial juncture, propelled by significant technological enhancements, favorable macroeconomic trends, and growing institutional interest. For large-scale investors, these converging elements create a unique opportunity to consider optimal entry strategies, especially as Solana\u2019s infrastructure evolves to support real-time and enterprise-level applications.\nSolana\u2019s roadmap for 2025 has introduced a series of pivotal upgrades, positioning the network ahead of its peers in terms of speed and cost-effectiveness. The introduction of the Firedancer validator client by Jump Crypto, which utilizes a C/C++ architecture instead of the previous Rust-based Agave client, has dramatically reduced validator hardware expenses by up to 80% and diversified the network\u2019s technical foundation. Alongside this, the Alpenglow consensus protocol brings rapid 150ms block finality and deterministic execution, enabling Solana to achieve transaction speeds exceeding 1 million per second\u2014a fifteenfold increase over its 2024 throughput.\nThese technical leaps are more than just milestones; they are catalysts for widespread adoption. Alpenglow\u2019s support for parallel processing and multiple concurrent leaders makes Solana an attractive platform for high-frequency trading and institutional DeFi solutions. The rollout of ZK Compression v2 has slashed transaction costs by over 5,000 times, making large-scale airdrops and NFT launches feasible without network slowdowns. Developer engagement has surged by nearly 30% year-over-year, fueled by improved development tools like the Anchor framework and robust ecosystem initiatives.\nDespite periods of market turbulence, Solana\u2019s on-chain data highlights its resilience. By late 2025, the network\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi applications rebounded to $8.8 billion, securing its status as the second-largest DeFi ecosystem. Daily transaction volumes reached $500 billion, and staking yields remained above 7%, making Solana especially appealing to institutional capital. The launch of the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which quickly accumulated $500 million in assets, further underscores institutional confidence in the network.\nRetail participation is also strong, particularly in regions like India and the United States, where tokenized equities and innovative projects such as xStocks and RTX are gaining momentum. These developments, combined with a 32.7% quarterly increase in TVL, reflect a maturing ecosystem capable of navigating broader economic challenges.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision in December 2025 to lower interest rates by 25 basis points and halt quantitative tightening has created a supportive backdrop for risk assets. Historically, such policy shifts have coincided with crypto market rallies, as seen during the liquidity surge of 2020\u20132021 that propelled Solana\u2019s TVL to $35 billion. With inflation easing to 3.7% by October 2025, expectations for further rate reductions in early 2026 are mounting, lowering the opportunity cost for holding high-growth assets like Solana.\nThe end of quantitative tightening on December 1, 2025, marks another turning point. Expanding global liquidity, which has historically benefited Bitcoin, could similarly favor Solana as a high-volatility, high-reward asset. Major institutional players, including MicroStrategy, have demonstrated their confidence by acquiring Bitcoin at record levels, a move that may serve as a benchmark for Solana\u2019s long-term potential.\nTechnical analysis of Solana\u2019s price action points to a bullish setup. As of November 2025, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 42.5, indicating a neutral stance, while the MACD remains in positive territory, suggesting upward momentum. Key support zones have held firm, with prices rebounding to $133\u2014a 5% weekly increase\u2014even amid broader market fluctuations.\nThe next major hurdle is breaking above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) with strong trading volume"

                "body": "Key Points\nNvidia will remain the top AI chip play for the foreseeable future.\nMicrosoft's cloud and AI businesses are rapidly expanding.\nAmazon's cloud, e-commerce, and advertising businesses have plenty of room to grow.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, the price-weighted index that tracks the 30 most prominent companies in America, is a benchmark of the U.S. economy. It's not as broadly diversified as the market cap-weighted S&P 500, but it's still a good starting point for finding a few blue chip stocks that can deliver dependable long-term returns.\nThe Dow is often associated with slower-growth blue chip stocks like Verizon Communications and Caterpillar, but it also houses plenty of higher-growth tech stocks. Let's take a look at three of them -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) -- and see why these Dow components could soar higher in 2026 and beyond.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nNvidia\nNvidia, the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs, is still the easiest way to profit from the secular expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Its data center GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks, and most of the top tech companies -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Amazon -- use its chips. Nvidia also locks in its customers with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a proprietary software platform developers use to create Nvidia-optimized AI applications.\nNvidia faces some competition from cheaper data center GPU makers like AMD and custom AI accelerators, but it should continue to sell the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush for the foreseeable future.\nFrom fiscal 2025 (which ended this January) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to both grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% as the AI boom continues. At 26 times next year's earnings, Nvidia still looks surprisingly cheap relative to its long-term growth potential.\nNvidia is already the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $4.4 trillion, so it probably won't replicate its 21,400% rally from the past decade. But its core engines are firing on all cylinders -- and it could remain one of the best-performing stocks in the Dow next year.\nMicrosoft\nOver the past decade, Microsoft has expanded its cloud infrastructure platform, Azure; transformed most of its on-premise software into cloud-based services; ported its top productivity applications to iOS and Android devices; and upgraded its software with AI-powered services.\nThe \"mobile first, cloud first\" evolution -- which accelerated after its cloud chief Satya Nadella took the helm in 2014 as its third CEO -- transformed Microsoft from a slow-growth tech company into a high-growth one that was well diversified across the cloud, AI, mobile, and gaming markets. It also became OpenAI's biggest single investor, and it integrated the AI start-up's generative AI tools into its own cloud infrastructure platform and productivity services.\nFrom fiscal 2025 (which started this July) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 16% and 17%, respectively. That robust growth should be fueled by the ongoing AI boom as more companies upgrade their cloud infrastructure services to support the latest AI applications.\nMicrosoft is already the world's third most valuable company with a market cap of $3.65 billion, but it doesn't seem overvalued at 26 times next year's earnings. So if you're looking for a no-brainer way to profit from the growth of the cloud and AI markets, Microsoft checks all the right boxes.\nAmazon\nAmazon, the world's largest e-commerce and cloud infrastructure platform company, is still growing. Its e-commerce business continues to expand into more overseas markets, and its cloud business is profiting from the AI boom. It's also expanding its advertising b"

                "url": "https://ts2.tech/en/uk-stock-market-today-9-december-2025-ftse-100-edges-higher-as-defence-stocks-offset-bat-slide/",
                "body": "The UK stock market spent Tuesday moving in a narrow band but ultimately closed modestly higher, as defence stocks helped the FTSE 100 overcome weakness in tobacco and consumer names ahead of crucial interest rate decisions from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.\nMarket snapshot: modest gains for FTSE 100 and FTSE 250\nBy early afternoon in London, the FTSE 100 was up around 0.1%, with the domestically focused FTSE 250 gaining about 0.2%, helped by strong defence shares and despite pressure on British American Tobacco (BAT). [1]\nLater price data show the blue\u2011chip FTSE 100 finished the session at 9,667.35, up 0.23% on the day, after trading between 9,628.85 and 9,672.90. [2] That leaves the index less than 3% below its 52\u2011week high around 9,930 points. [3]\nThe mid\u2011cap FTSE 250 closed at 21,956.25, up roughly 0.16% from Monday\u2019s 21,921.28, according to index data providers. [4]\nIntraday, trading was subdued. RTT News reported the FTSE 100 was down just 0.09% around 9,653.95 late in the morning, underscoring how narrow the day\u2019s range was as investors largely sat on their hands ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy announcement. [5]\nZooming out, 2025 remains one of the strongest years for UK equities in recent memory. Analysis from The Motley Fool suggests FTSE 100 shares are up around 17% on average so far this year, making 2025 \u201cone of the best years\u201d for the index, with at least one miner up over 300% year\u2011to\u2011date. [6]\nDefence rallies while tobacco and retailers lag\nDefence stocks lift the index\nThe main positive driver on the day was defence.\n- BAE Systems gained around 2\u20133%.\n- Rolls\u2011Royce also ticked higher.\nBoth moved after reports that German lawmakers are poised to approve a record \u20ac52 billion defence procurement package, boosting sentiment toward European defence contractors. [7]\nRTT News also highlighted Babcock International and Fresnillo among the notable gainers in the FTSE 100, alongside The Sage Group, which climbed more than 3%. [8]\nBritish American Tobacco under pressure\nThe main drag on the blue\u2011chip index was British American Tobacco.\n- BAT shares fell about 2.8\u20132.9% after the group said it expects 2026 trading to land at the lower end of its mid\u2011term targets, reflecting intensifying regulatory and competitive pressures in the US vaping market. [9]\nThe stock\u2019s high dividend yield has long attracted income investors, but today\u2019s move shows markets are increasingly wary about long\u2011term growth in traditional tobacco and the cost of transitioning toward reduced\u2011risk products. IG and other analysts have previously pointed out that BAT is among the highest\u2011yielding FTSE 100 names, with yields around 7\u20138% in 2025. [10]\nMixed picture for UK consumer names\nFresh data reinforced the message that the UK consumer is still under pressure:\n- Barclays reported that card spending by UK consumers fell 1.1% year\u2011on\u2011year in November, the biggest decline since early 2021.\n- The British Retail Consortium said big\u2011box retail sales were up just 1.4% versus a year earlier, the slowest growth since May. [11]\nThose numbers weighed on parts of the retail and discretionary complex. RTT News noted declines in JD Sports, Tesco, easyJet, IAG and Antofagasta, while some consumer staples and travel names drifted lower as investors questioned how resilient demand will be through 2026. [12]\nIndex reshuffle: British Land replaces WPP in FTSE 100\nAlthough the actual index changes take effect later in December, traders are already positioning around the FTSE UK Index Series quarterly review, which often drives buying and selling flows.\nIn its December review, FTSE Russell confirmed that: [13]\n- British Land will join the FTSE 100, moving up from the FTSE 250.\n- Advertising giant WPP will be ejected from the FTSE 100 and relegated to the FTSE 250.\nThe review also reshuffles the FTSE 250 itself, with additions including GB Group, Pan African Resources, Princes Group, Shawbrook Group and WPP, and deletions such as British Land Co, European Opportunit"

                "body": "The UK stock market spent Tuesday, 9 December 2025, in a cautious mood, with a handful of big names doing most of the damage.\nThe FTSE 100 slipped around 0.1% to roughly 9,640, its lowest close in about two weeks, as investors positioned for a crucial Federal Reserve decision and another Bank of England rate call. [1]\nWhile the index is still hovering near record highs for 2025, British American Tobacco, Chemring and Ashtead were among the standout losers today, and Monday\u2019s sharp falls in Unilever, Barratt Redrow, JD Sports Fashion, Persimmon and Entain are still shaping sentiment. TechStock\u00b2+1\nMarket snapshot: Cautious FTSE 100, weak consumers\nTwo big forces are driving London trading this week:\n- Central banks: Markets expect another Fed rate cut this week, but there\u2019s major uncertainty over how aggressive cuts will be in 2026. That\u2019s keeping global bond yields elevated and equity valuations under pressure. TechStock\u00b2+1\n- Soft UK consumer data:\n- Barclays reported card spending in November fell about 1.1% year\u2011on\u2011year, the sharpest drop since early 2021.\n- BRC\u2013KPMG data showed total retail sales up just 1.4% and like\u2011for\u2011like sales up 1.2% \u2013 the weakest growth in roughly six months \u2013 with Black Friday spending described as underwhelming. [2]\nThat combination \u2013 central\u2011bank jitters plus cautious households \u2013 explains why defensives, housebuilders and consumer names have been under pressure, even as the headline index is not far from record territory. TechStock\u00b2+1\n1. British American Tobacco (BATS): Guidance cut at the margin, share price hit hard\nMove today (9 December 2025)\n- Price: ~4,160p\n- Day move: roughly \u20133.5% to \u20134.5%, making BAT one of the biggest blue\u2011chip losers on the day. [3]\nWhat spooked investors?\nBritish American Tobacco\u2019s trading update tried to strike a reassuring tone but landed badly with the market:\n- The group reaffirmed its 2026 medium\u2011term targets of 3\u20135% annual revenue growth and 5\u20138% EPS growth\u2026\n- \u2026but warned that performance is now expected at the lower end of that range, citing a tougher outlook in parts of its heated\u2011tobacco and vaping portfolio. [4]\n- For 2025, management now expects roughly 2% revenue and adjusted profit growth, rather than anything more punchy. [5]\n- At the same time, BAT announced a \u00a31.3bn share buyback for FY26, on top of its already hefty dividend, underlining its status as a high\u2011yield \u201cbond proxy\u201d. [6]\nEven though the numbers weren\u2019t disastrous, the message was clear: growth will be slower than investors had hoped, and the stock sold off accordingly.\nThe investment debate now\nRecent analysis notes that:\n- BAT still generates huge cash flows and remains committed to progressive dividends plus buybacks. TechStock\u00b2+1\n- \u201cNew Category\u201d products (vapes, heated tobacco, oral nicotine) are growing quickly, but regulatory uncertainty \u2013 especially in the US \u2013 makes forecasting tricky. [7]\nFor income\u2011focused investors, the yield looks attractive, but today\u2019s reaction shows how sensitive tobacco valuations are to even small downgrades to growth expectations.\n2. Chemring Group (CHG): Cost overrun knocks a defence winner\nMove today\n- Chemring shares fell around 2\u20132.5%, underperforming a broadly flat market. [8]\nStrong results, awkward detail\nOn the face of it, Chemring\u2019s full\u2011year numbers looked solid:\n- Revenue rose about 2% to \u00a3497.5m.\n- Underlying operating profit increased roughly 6% to \u00a373\u201374m.\n- The order book jumped about 20% to \u00a31.34bn, with management saying demand from NATO states remains strong. [9]\nThe problem? Investors latched onto higher\u2011than\u2011expected costs linked to an expansion project in Norway, which are set to squeeze margins in the near term. [10]\nWhy the market still cares\nSeveral analyses published today emphasise that:\n- Around three\u2011quarters of Chemring\u2019s 2026 revenue is already covered by the order book, giving unusually high visibility for a mid\u2011cap industrial. TechStock\u00b2\n- Defence spending by NATO governments remains elevated and is expected to stay strong \u201c"

At Monday\u2019s close (8 December 2025), the index finished around 24,055 points, a gain of roughly 0.1%, holding above the psychologically important 24,000 threshold. TechStock\u00b2\nAcross the region, the tone was more subdued: the STOXX Europe 600 slipped about 0.1%, the FTSE 100 edged down 0.23%, while Spain\u2019s IBEX 35 gained around 0.1%, reflecting mild risk aversion as investors looked ahead to the Fed. [4]\nSector\u2011wise in Frankfurt on Monday: TechStock\u00b2+1\n- Gainers:\n- Pharma & healthcare: Bayer rallied after a rating upgrade from JPMorgan.\n- Defence & industrials: Rheinmetall benefited from renewed inflows into defence stocks.\n- Financials: Deutsche Bank firmed up alongside a broader bid for European banks.\n- Laggards:\n- Real estate: Vonovia and TAG Immobilien were under pressure as long\u2011dated German yields hit their highest levels since 2011.\n- Consumer cyclicals & retail: Puma and other discretionary names gave back recent gains.\nThe picture: the DAX continues to behave better than the \u201cheadline\u201d eurozone narrative suggests, but Monday\u2019s leadership\u2014defence, large pharma and banks\u2014shows investors are still hiding in perceived quality and beneficiaries of higher defence spending.\n2. DAX futures and overnight global cues\nFutures: flat to slightly lower\nLate\u2011session quotes on Monday put DAX futures just above 24,050, almost exactly in line with the cash close. TechStock\u00b2+1\nMore recent futures indications show levels in the 24,050\u201324,060 area, down only a handful of points (around 0.05%) from Monday, signalling a largely unchanged open barring any last\u2011minute macro surprises.

Futures markets now price roughly an 89% chance of a 25\u2011basis\u2011point rate cut, but only two more cuts through the end of 2026, signalling expectations for a shallow easing cycle.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which initially led stocks down, turned around to gain around 0.1%.\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.4%, dragged down by shares of JPMorgan (JPM). The stock fell over 4% after an executive warned that the bank's costs would rise in 2026 amid competition in the credit card space and higher spending on AI.\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT), meanwhile, closed at an all-time high ahead of Wednesday's Fed rate decision.\n(^DJI)\nLong-delayed data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed job openings ticked up in October, in a move that ran contrary to forecasts. But labor market worries persist \u2014 even in the JOLTS report, which also found layoffs increased in the month.\nThe spotlight is on the Fed's two-day meeting and its final policy decision of the year, due Wednesday. Markets are all but convinced of getting a quarter-point rate cut to match similar moves in September and October, with nearly 90% odds currently priced in.\nGiven that, investors have switched to watching the Fed for clues to whether 2026 will bring more easing \u2014 but the chances of that are less certain in the wake of December's \"hawkish cut.\" White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, largely seen as the favorite for the next Fed chair, has struck a cautious tone, saying it would be \"irresponsible\" to set out plans for the next six months. Trump suggested in an interview released Tuesday that he would be looking for a new chair to immediately move to cut rates.\nIn corporates, Nvidia (NVDA) shares ticked down after President Trump signed off on allowing the AI bellwether to resume some shipments of H200 AI chips to China.\nAlso on deck later this week are corporate earnings from Oracle (ORCL), Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU), which could shed light on megacap AI and retail trends.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 21 updatesUS stocks open mixed, tech stocks down on Tuesday\nThe US stock market opened with a mixed performance on Tuesday, as investors awaited the start of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, with some convinced of a rate cut this week turning their focus to the chances of further easing next year.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.25%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) held just above the flat line, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) traded into the red by around 0.4% before paring losses.\nDJI - Delayed Quote USD(^DJI)\n47,560.29-179.03(-0.38%)At close: December 9 at 4:56:22 PM EST^DJI ^GSPC ^IXICIn the tech sector, Nvidia opened the trading day down a bit over 0.8%, coming off a small gain after President Trump signed off on allowing the AI bellwether to resume some shipments of H200 AI chips to China.\nIn focus on Tuesday will be the Fed's two-day meeting and its final policy decision of the year, which markets will get on Wednesday.

Traders will be watching the post-meeting statement, set for release at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, and Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference for clues on how the committee is thinking about the path forward.\nTuesday\u2019s trading session offered little momentum as Wall Street waited for the Fed as the next catalyst. The Dow (^DJI) led the way lower, dragged down by weakness in JPMorgan (JPM). The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) eked out a small gain thanks to strength in Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG).\nThe tech trade will get a key test Wednesday with an earnings report from Oracle (ORCL), as Wall Street increasingly looks to the cloud firm as proxy for the AI trade.

                "body": "-\nClick here to listen to this article - Share via\n- Camp Josepho, a historic 110-acre Scouting camp in the Santa Monica Mountains, was severely damaged in January\u2019s Palisades fire.\n- Scouts who camp at the site returned on Saturday for the first time since the fire.\n- Instead of rebuilding structures that burned down, the Scouts are focused on restoring the land and creating new memories in the process.\nElliot Copen, 17, was worried the Scouting America camp he had visited dozens of times in an undeveloped canyon of the Santa Monica Mountains would feel empty.\nThe Palisades fire roared down the canyon 11 months ago, destroying the historic lodge and its Hogwarts-like interior (albeit without the \u201cflying balls,\u201d Copen noted), a smattering of cabins and the trading post where Scouts would buy candies and memorabilia. Weeks later, heavy rains sent mud and debris careening into the canyon, burying sections of the camp in feet of dirt.\nCopen, an Eagle Scout with Troop 67 in Santa Monica and a leader in the Scouts\u2019 honor society Order of the Arrow, had seen the videos online of what the disasters had done to the camp where he had made so many memories. \u201cIt was just weird,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt wrong.\u201d\nOn Saturday, he was one of about four dozen Scouts, parents and regional Scouting leaders that headed to camp for the first time since the fire, picked up some tools and got dirty. It was a humble and cautious start: remove some of the invasive species that were taking advantage of the open soil and dig out the camp\u2019s veterans memorial that the mudslides had partially covered.\nIt was also a much-needed moment for the Scouts to mourn their loss, spend time with their peers and give back to the land that has given them so much.\nCamp Josepho is one of three camps Scouting America\u2019s Western Los Angeles County Council operates. While their Catalina and Sequoia sites are certainly breathtaking, Josepho \u2014 which is just minutes from the city \u2014 was an accessible haven from the hustle and bustle of algebra tests, essay deadlines and school drama.\nTo help the public process the January wildfires, artist Evan Hall created a memorial made of salvaged chimneys from destroyed homes.\nSince the 1940s, the 110-acre camp has served as a second home in the wild for thousands of Scouts. The land was gifted by Ganna and Anatol Josepho \u2014 a silent film star and the inventor of the photo booth, respectively. Its centerpiece was a hangar-like lodge built out of redwood by the aircraft manufacturer Donald Douglas, which is listed as a Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument. Over the years, the camp has hosted the Scouts\u2019 Order of the Arrow induction ceremonies, service weekends focused on projects like brush removal and many good old-fashioned camping trips.\nWhen Copen entered the camp, he felt relieved. It was no longer the fire-stricken wasteland he saw in the videos, but in fact quite green. Yes, some of the green was invasive species, but some was made up of native grasses and shrubby chaparral plants. Many of the towering sycamore trees and elder oaks \u2014 probably far older than even the adult Scout leaders \u2014 still blot out the midday sun with new, green leaves sprouting from their charred trunks.\nNoah Rottner, an Eagle Scout with Troop 777 in West Hills who is also in the Order of the Arrow, said he had hoped to \u201chelp rebuild most of the stuff that\u2019s been burnt and get most of the memories back.\u201d But as Rottner, 15, talked with his peers, \u201cwe were just deciding, maybe we could start new memories in it, and start a new journey.\u201d\nThe Scouting council likely won\u2019t try to reconstruct all of the camp\u2019s facilities. Lee Harrison, 54, chief executive of the council, acknowledged that since the Palisades fire likely won\u2019t be the last to burn through the land, a smaller footprint at the site is ultimately more sustainable.\nCopen fondly remembers a weekend before the fire, when his group spent the entire time at a fairly isolated campground on site.

                "body": "Why the S&P 500 is lagging the Nikkei this year\nThis year the performance gap between the Japanese Nikkei and the US S&P 500 has become very clear. The Nikkei is up about 29% year over year, while the S&P 500 is up around 13.55%. The difference comes mainly from how each country deals with interest rates, currency movements, and business conditions.\nUnited States interest rates remain high.\nStocks look more attractive than savings or bonds.\nGlobal investors borrow money in Japan at very low interest rates.\nHigh interest rates and economic uncertainty\nIn the United States, interest rates remain high. This makes borrowing more expensive for both companies and consumers. Businesses are more careful with spending and expansion, and shoppers are paying more on loans, credit cards, and mortgages. This slows down growth and puts pressure on company earnings. When earnings grow more slowly, stock prices usually rise at a slower pace as well. This has helped keep the S&P 500\u2019s gains limited compared to Japan, many US stocks were already expensive after strong gains in previous years, especially in the technology sector. When prices are already high, it becomes harder for the market to rise fast unless earnings grow strongly. Investors also become quicker to take profits when there is uncertainty about the economy or interest rates. This profit-taking has also slowed the rise of the S&P 500.\nSource: Federal Reserve\nLow interest rates\nIn Japan, the situation is very different from the United States. Interest rates remain very low, which makes borrowing cheap for businesses and households. Companies can invest more easily in new factories, equipment, and technology without high financing costs. This supports business growth and helps improve profits. At the same time, low interest rates make stocks more attractive than keeping money in savings accounts or low-yield bonds, so more investors choose to put their money into the stock market. Another important factor is the weak Japanese yen. When the yen is weak, Japanese products become cheaper for buyers in other countries. This helps large export companies such as car makers, electronics firms, and industrial manufacturers sell more goods overseas. When these companies earn money in foreign currencies like the US dollar or euro, those earnings increase in value when converted back into yen. This makes their profits look stronger in yen terms and improves their financial results.\nSource: MacroMicro\nCarry trade\nstrong performance of Nikkei is the carry trade. Many global investors borrow money in Japan at very low interest rates and then invest that money in higher-return assets, including Japanese stocks and foreign markets such as U.S. Stock market and Dollar. Because borrowing in yen is cheap, this strategy has been very popular. As more money flows into Japanese markets through carry trades, demand for Japanese shares increases. This extra demand has helped lift the Nikkei further this year. If Japan keeps interest rates low, the carry trade is likely to continue supporting its stock market."
