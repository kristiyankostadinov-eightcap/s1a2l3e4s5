                "body": "Gold prices plunge for fourth straight day of declines as hopes for interest-rate cut fade\nGold prices on Tuesday plunged to their lowest levels in more than a week on diminishing hopes for an interest-rate cut at the Fed\u2019s December meeting.\nGold futures dropped 0.3% to $4,062.20 per ounce as of about 12:30 p.m. ET \u2014 the fourth straight day of declines. The precious metal hit its lowest price since Nov. 10 earlier in the session.\nThe drop comes as traders are pricing in just 52.6% odds of a quarter-point cut next month \u2013 down from 93.7% odds this time last month, according to CME FedWatch.\n\u201cMarket participants are pricing out US interest rate cuts following more hawkish comments from Fed officials,\u201d UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said Tuesday.\n\u201cI would expect gold prices to bottom out soon, as I still see the Fed cutting rates several times over the coming quarters, and central banks\u2019 diversification into gold remains strong.\u201d\nThe US government reopened last week, ending its longest-ever shutdown at 44 days.\nDuring the weeks-long pause, Fed officials were flying blind without access to government data like inflation and jobs reports, which are key to their decision-making process on interest rates.\nNow investors are looking ahead to the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday, and the delayed September jobs report, which will come out Thursday.\nWhile the non-farm payrolls data will be more backward-looking than usual, it will be one of the most significant clues into the health of the US economy in weeks.\nDespite the upcoming data, several Fed officials have advocated for a slower rate-cutting pace \u2013 spooking investors who are eager for lower interest rates.\nFed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said Monday that the central bank needed to \u201cproceed slowly\u201d on further cuts.\nGold previously gained more than 50% so far this year, on track for its best year since 1979 despite recent days\u2019 declines.\nInvestors often turn to gold as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, thanks to its capacity to hold value even as other assets fall.\nAnxiety around Trump\u2019s tariffs and their potential to cause inflation, stubbornly high interest rates, a weaker US dollar, the government shutdown and a slow labor market have all contributed to gold\u2019s explosive rise this year. Elevated central-bank buying also added to gold\u2019s increase.\n\u201cWe still see a longer-term favourable fundamental backdrop for gold,\u201d Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said Tuesday.\n\u201cThe US economy continues to cool, US interest rates are set to fall and the US dollar should weaken as a result.\u201d\nMeanwhile, spot silver remained flat at $50.2 per ounce, platinum ticked up to $1,534.30 and palladium jumped 0.7% to $1,402.73.\nWith Post wires"

But for investors who don\u2019t share his appetite for risk, gold has always been considered the ultimate safe haven.\nThis appears to be more true today than ever as the price of the precious metal has soared 50% this year, far outpacing returns from equities. In October, the gold value hit $4,380 an ounce, an all-time record.\nThe rally has been largely driven by uncertainty \u2013 \u201cwhether that is geopolitical, economic or now there is the interest rate cycle entering people\u2019s minds\u201d, Ryan McIntyre, from investment management firm Sprott, told The New York Times.\nThe Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

Previous surges took place after the dotcom crash of the early 2000s, the financial crisis at the end of the decade, and during the Covid pandemic. This time round it is Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war and fears of an imminent AI-stock crash that is driving investors to seek safety in gold.\nCentral banks, too, have increasingly sought protection \u201cnot against short-term meltdowns but longer-run changes\u201d. According to the International Monetary Fund, central bank holdings of physical gold in emerging markets have risen 161% since 2006, with purchases going into overdrive in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Both China and Russia have ramped up switching their official reserve assets out of currencies such as the US dollar and into gold.\nFinally, there is the recent US government shutdown. The prolonged stand-off increased \u201clong\u201d positions held by hedge funds on gold futures, meaning that speculators are \u201cthe most likely drivers of recent price movements\u201d.\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day \u2013 and the best features from TheWeek.com\nWhat does it say about the economy?\nCitadel hedge fund founder and CEO Ken Griffin recently said the rising price of gold is an indication of something big. \u201cThat something is a loss of trust,\u201d said The Telegraph. \u201cA loss of trust first and foremost in US treasuries, but also in other G7 government bond markets, including the UK.\u201d\nStress in the long-term bond markets combined with a devaluation of the US dollar, which suffered its biggest decline in more than half a century this year, \u201chave unsettled alternative assets typically viewed as low-risk investments\u201d, said ABC News.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can interpret these exploding gold prices as a good sign \u2013 they're a warning sign,\u201d said Paolo Pasquariello, professor of finance at the University of Michigan. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a case to be made that these high gold prices are a leading indicator of troublesome times ahead for the US economy.\u201d\nWill it end?\nOctober\u2019s sudden price decline, when gold dropped 10% before recovering, was \u201cdriven by a confluence of factors\u201d that may prove a useful predictor of what might curb the rally, said Bloomberg.\nA successful resolution of trade tensions between the US and China \u201ccould stop gold from resuming its record-breaking rally \u2013 as could a broader de-escalation of US tariffs\u201d. A \u201ccontinued dollar rally, a resolution to the legal proceedings against Fed Governor Lisa Cook, and a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine\u201d "

                "body": "(Kitco News) - Gold demonstrated resilience today, closing higher despite trading to both a lower low and lower high during the session.\nPrices opened under pressure, reaching an intraday low of $3,997 before staging a recovery. This rebound prevented what would have been the fourth consecutive day of declining prices.\nFederal Reserve policy remains key driver\nThe central question facing gold markets continues to be whether the Federal Reserve will implement a rate cut or maintain current interest rate levels at the upcoming FOMC meeting. With inflation running near 3%\u2014a level typically inconsistent with rate cut considerations\u2014the December meeting presents an unusual scenario. Current probabilities show just under 50% odds of a rate cut, down significantly from a month ago but still indicating an even split among market participants.\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials have recently expressed concerns about the current monetary policy stance, adding to the uncertainty. As a non-yielding asset, gold typically benefits from lower interest rates, making any potential Fed action particularly consequential for precious metals markets.\nEmployment data supports rate cut narrative\nRecent economic data has tilted in gold's favor, though government shutdown delays have limited the flow of information. Today's unemployment claims data revealed Americans receiving benefits reached a two-month high in mid-October, with continued claims rising to 1.9 million for the week ending October 18.\nMarket participants now await two critical releases: the Fed's minutes from the October 28-29 meeting (tomorrow) and the delayed September employment report from the Labor Department (Thursday).\nThese reports are expected to provide crucial insight into December rate cut prospects, which many analysts believe explains today's gains in both gold and silver.\nStructural demand remains strong\nBeyond near-term policy considerations, gold continues to benefit from sustained central bank accumulation. Major central banks worldwide have actively increased gold reserves rather than dollar holdings, providing fundamental support for the bullish bias that has driven recent price advances.\nTechnical outlook\nLooking ahead, the $4,000 level appears positioned to serve as support rather than resistance. Barring significant shifts in the economic landscape, gold should find solid footing at or above this psychological level.\nFor those who wish to learn more about our service, please click here\nWishing you as always. good trading,"

A new oil market outlook from Goldman Sachs this week projects a roughly 2 million bpd global surplus in 2026 as delayed long-cycle projects come online, OPEC+ unwinds more of its remaining cuts, and non-OPEC supply from the U.S. and Brazil continues to edge higher. The bank now sees Brent averaging about $56 and WTI about $52 in 2026, well below current forward prices, with the International Energy Agency\u2019s latest projections pointing to an even larger potential surplus if demand growth underperforms. While those forecasts don\u2019t dictate today\u2019s spot price, they do shape how much risk appetite there is among funds to buy dips in the front of the curve when the medium-term picture is one of abundant supply."

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 24 cents, or 0.4%, at $60.5 a barrel, after rising 1.4% on Tuesday.\nU.S. crude and fuel stocks rose last week, market sources said late on Tuesday, citing American Petroleum Institute figures.\nCrude stocks rose by 4.45 million barrels in the week ended November 14, while gasoline inventories climbed by 1.55 million barrels and distillate inventories increased by 577,000 barrels, the API reported, according to the sources.\nA report on Wednesday from Chinese brokerage Haitong Futures said the API data showing the builds in crude and fuel inventories \"pointed to weak demand and a bearish outlook for oil prices.\"\nOfficial U.S. government inventory data will be released later on Wednesday. Eight analysts polled by Reuters ahead of that data release estimated on average that crude inventories likely fell by about 600,000 barrels in the week to November 14.\nPrices gained on Tuesday as investors considered the impact of U.S. sanctions on Russian oil exports and as Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries and export terminals have increased concerns of crude and fuel disruptions.\nThe worries about Russian supply are being weighed against forecasts from analysts that oil output is in excess of current demand, which has pressured prices.\nFollowing Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy and port infrastructure, profit margins for producing diesel fuel have surged in Europe, reaching their highest since September 2023 on Tuesday. This is occurring amid an increase in refinery margins globally.\nThe Haitong report noted that \"oil prices have found support from the strong diesel market but the persistent crude oversupply is keeping investors cautious about chasing further gains in crude.\"\nU.S. President Donald Trump is willing to sign legislation making its way through Congress to add new Russian sanctions, a senior White House official said on Monday, as long as he retains final authority over its implementation.\nFurther secondary sanctions on Russian crude buyers should provide continued support for oil prices."

                "body": "As the third week of November begins, EUR/USD continues to show a steady bearish bias, with the pair declining for three consecutive sessions, marking a depreciation of more than 0.4% in favor of the U.S. dollar in the short term. The recent selling pressure stems partly from uncertainty over the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move ahead of its December policy decision. The long-awaited Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report\u2014key labor market data\u2014is expected this week and could help define the monetary policy outlook for the United States. Until then, indecision is likely to dominate EUR/USD movements, keeping the pair under persistent downward pressure in the short term.\nWhat to Expect from the U.S. Employment Data\nWith the end of the U.S. government shutdown, delayed labor data for September will finally be released, including the NFP report, expected on Thursday, November 20. Market consensus anticipates 58,000 new jobs, compared with 22,000 in August. However, investors will focus on whether the data meets or falls short of expectations. A weak result would likely confirm the slowdown in the U.S. labor market observed throughout 2025, a year that began with over 200,000 new jobs per month, but has since seen figures drop below 50,000 as the months progressed.\nSource: ForexFactory\nGiven this outlook, employment data will serve as a key indicator for the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming decision in December. According to CME Group, there is currently a 51.6% probability that the central bank will keep interest rates steady at 4.00% on December 10, compared with a 48.4% chance of a rate cut to 3.75%. These figures highlight the Fed\u2019s ongoing indecision, with no clear consensus on whether to adopt a more restrictive or accommodative stance.\nSource: CMEGroup\nIn this context, Thursday\u2019s NFP data could be the decisive catalyst that removes some of the uncertainty. If the results exceed expectations, the Fed may choose to keep rates unchanged, postponing any potential rate cuts. Under this scenario, the U.S. dollar could strengthen, supported by strong demand for high-yield fixed-income instruments, attracting foreign capital into the U.S. Treasury market.\nConversely, if the data reveals significant labor weakness, the probability of rate cuts would increase, reducing demand for the dollar and weakening the currency in the short term. In summary, this week\u2019s employment report will be crucial in defining the direction of EUR/USD: a scenario of steady or higher rates would favor the U.S. dollar, while expectations of lower rates could temporarily support the euro.\nIn the most likely outcome, where rates remain unchanged, EUR/USD may continue under selling pressure, reinforcing a stronger bearish bias in the coming sessions.\nWhat About the European Central Bank?\nUnlike the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) is not expected to deliver any major surprises in the short term. According to ECB Watch, there is a 90.2% probability that the current deposit rate will remain unchanged at 2.00% during its upcoming December 16 meeting. So far, there are no indications of policy changes or comments suggesting a shift in the near term.\nSource: ECBWATCH\nUnder this scenario, the euro\u2019s strength will depend largely on the Federal Reserve\u2019s direction. As long as the ECB\u2019s rate remains significantly lower than that of the U.S., European fixed-income assets will remain less attractive compared to their U.S. counterparts. This wide interest rate gap could continue to dampen demand for euro-denominated assets while boosting appetite for the dollar, maintaining downward pressure on EUR/USD into year-end.\nEUR/USD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Downtrend Holds Firm: The recent price action in EUR/USD continues to outline a clear downward trajectory in the medium term. Despite multiple attempts at bullish corrections, none have been strong enough to break the dominant bearish trend. For now, selling pressure remains the key technical factor, and as l"

The pair may further lose ground as the US Dollar (USD) gains amid declining US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut bets for December. The highly anticipated September Nonfarm Payrolls data are scheduled to be released on Thursday.\nThe CME FedWatch Tool suggests that financial markets are now pricing in a 49% chance that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, down from 67% probability that markets priced a week ago.\nUS Initial Jobless Claims showed on Tuesday that 232,000 people filed first-time claims for state unemployment insurance in the week ended October 18. Continuing Claims came in at 1.957 million, up slightly from 1.926 million in the prior week.\nMeanwhile, an Automatic Data Processing (ADP) report showed that employers cut 2,500 jobs a week on average during the four weeks ending November 1.\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin commented on the economic outlook on Tuesday, noting that the labor market appears more balanced, with firms reporting improved worker availability and recent layoffs signalling the need for caution. Barkin said inflation doesn\u2019t seem to be rising, but it\u2019s also unclear whether it will return to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. He emphasized that, without more decisive data, it remains difficult to reach a broad policy consensus.\nThe Euro (EUR) attempts to hold ground against the US Dollar due to the cautious sentiment surrounding the near-term European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) monetary policy outlook. The ECB is widely expected to keep rates unchanged, supported by stable economic performance and inflation near target.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign "

The euro continues to hover just below the 1.1600 psychological level, reflecting a tense balance between resilient dollar demand and muted eurozone momentum. The U.S. dollar\u2019s strength, supported by hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric and cautious risk sentiment, has kept the pair within a narrow corridor \u2014 unable to break the descending trendline that has capped every rally since late September.\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) trades around 99.46, recovering from last week\u2019s low amid renewed defensive positioning. Traders have dialed back expectations for a December rate cut to 43%, down from 62%, following comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, who warned that the slowdown in hiring could signal labor \u201cstall speed.\u201d The Fed\u2019s reluctance to pre-commit to easing has pressured risk-sensitive currencies, keeping the euro pinned despite oversold conditions.\nAcross the Atlantic, eurozone fundamentals remain stagnant. The European Central Bank\u2019s policymakers maintain a cautious tone, with most members leaning toward holding rates steady. The EU September Current Account and the October HICP final estimate\u2014both due this week\u2014are unlikely to alter expectations of policy inertia. This lack of catalyst has left the euro vulnerable to U.S. macro forces, particularly employment and inflation releases.\nTechnical Landscape: EUR/USD Defends 1.1570 but Resistance Layers Thicken\nTechnically, the EUR/USD structure shows clear congestion between 1.1570 support and 1.1650 resistance. The pair trades slightly above its 100-period SMA on the 4-hour chart, yet remains capped beneath both the 20- and 200-period SMAs, located near 1.1610. The short-term trend is neutral-to-bearish, with momentum indicators signaling a pause rather than a reversal.\nThe RSI holds near 48, reflecting limited selling pressure, while the Momentum oscillator trends downward. The daily chart reinforces this equilibrium: the 20-SMA flattens near 1.1600, while the 100-SMA at 1.1655 caps any advance attempts. The 200-SMA, still upward sloping but losing pace, underscores the medium-term bias toward gradual consolidation rather than a sustained breakout.\nFor traders, immediate supports are found at 1.1570, 1.1540, and 1.1510, while resistance lies at 1.1610, 1.1655, and 1.1690. A decisive close above 1.1720 would mark a significant shift in momentum, potentially opening a path to 1.1810, but as long as price remains trapped beneath the descending trendline from 1.1818, each bounce risks fading into renewed selling pressure.\nMarket Dynamics: Jobs Data and Fed Policy Steer Near-Term Volatility\nThe upcoming U.S. September NFP report is the key catalyst. Economists forecast a 50,000 job increase, following the 22,000 rise in August, with unemployment expected to hold near 4.3%. A stronger print would likely boost the dollar, dragging EUR/USD toward 1.1540\u20131.1500, while weaker numbers could spark short-covering toward 1.1670\u20131.1710.\nThe NFP release is particularly critical after the six-week U.S. government shutdown delayed vital labor and inflation data. The reopening has reintroduced regular data flow, and markets are recalibrating policy forecasts accordingly. Fed officials including Richmond\u2019s Thomas Barkin and Vice Chair Michael Barr are scheduled to speak before the data, potentially shaping short-term expectations.\nEurozone Under Pressure as Growth Momentum Weakens\nThe euro area continues to underperform rel"

It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only doe"

The pair briefly touched 1.3185, a resistance aligning with its 20-day Simple Moving Average, before retreating on renewed U.S. Dollar demand ahead of crucial Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data and UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures.\nThe Pound remains constrained by rising speculation that the BoE could deliver a rate cut as early as December, with money markets pricing an 83% probability of easing. Meanwhile, Fed cut odds for December have edged up to 55%, a shift from below 50% last week, after weaker jobless data showed 232K initial claims and 1.957 million continuing claims, suggesting a cooling but resilient U.S. labor market.\nSterling Struggles As Markets Eye UK Inflation And Autumn Budget\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) remains subdued as traders brace for the release of UK October CPI. Expectations center on a further slowdown from September\u2019s 2.8% headline rate, with energy base effects and housing costs contributing to disinflation. A weaker CPI print could cement market conviction of a BoE rate cut, pressuring GBP/USD toward 1.3080.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 Autumn Budget, scheduled for November 26, adds fiscal uncertainty. Analysts estimate Reeves may seek to raise \u00a330\u2013\u00a340 billion through fiscal adjustments to bridge widening deficits. Speculation over potential corporate tax reforms and spending cuts has kept UK gilt yields volatile, undermining Sterling\u2019s near-term appeal.\nDollar Index (DXY) Stability Caps GBP/USD Upside\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) trades around 99.46, supported by cautious risk sentiment ahead of NFP and Fed minutes. Market participants expect the U.S. economy to add roughly 50,000 jobs in November, with unemployment steady at 4.3%. Stronger readings could reinforce the Greenback, pushing GBP/USD back toward the 1.3090\u20131.3110 range.\nFed officials maintain a mixed tone: Governor Christopher Waller hinted that slower hiring could justify a December rate cut, while Vice Chair Michael Barr cautioned against premature easing given resilient consumer demand. This policy ambiguity continues to anchor DXY near the 100.00 handle, keeping Sterling capped under resistance zones.\nTechnical Landscape: Cable Faces Range Compression Between 1.3130 and 1.3210\nOn the daily chart, GBP/USD consolidates beneath the 20-day SMA (1.3185), forming consecutive doji candles that reflect market indecision. The short-term structure shows compressed moving averages \u2014 the 20, 50, 100, and 200 SMAs \u2014 all clustering within 1.3141\u20131.3158, signaling equilibrium before a directional breakout.\nA sustained move above 1.3185 would clear the path toward 1.3210, followed by 1.3247 and 1.3290, with the next resistance aligning with the 100-day SMA. Conversely, failure to hold above 1.3130 could expose downside targets at 1.3080 and 1.3045, where traders anticipate fresh dip-buying interest. RSI hovers near 50, confirming balanced sentiment, while MACD remains neutral.\nBoE\u2019s Dovish Tilt Meets Market Skepticism\nBoE Chief Economist Huw Pill noted that inflation has \u201cnot slowed as much as expected,\u201d urging caution in interpreting recent data. Still, the broader market sees his remarks as tactical \u2014 setting the stage for a controlled rate reduction amid easing wage pressure.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) maintains a mild upward bias after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) published Minutes showing policymakers see no urgency to cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) as domestic demand remains robust and inflation pressures persist. However, the central bank also noted that monetary easing could be considered if growth weakens further or if labor-market conditions deteriorate materially.\nMarkets now turn their attention to Australia\u2019s third-quarter Wage Price Index, due Wednesday, with expectations for a 0.8% QoQ and 3.4% YoY increase. A result in line with forecasts would reinforce the view of a cautious, data-dependent RBA, limiting the prospects of rapid rate cuts.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar (USD) struggles to gain momentum after several mixed data releases earlier in the day. ADP figures showed that private-sector payrolls declined by an average of 2,500 jobs per week over the four weeks ending November 1, following a sharper drop in the previous period. Meanwhile, the latest Initial Jobless Claims, for the week of October 18, came in at 232,000, while Continuing Claims climbed to 1.957 million, both pointing to a softening labor market. Added to this, August Factory Orders rose 1.4% after a 1.3% contraction in July, though the rebound had little market impact.\nThese indicators come as investors await Thursday\u2019s delayed Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for September, a key release for refining expectations around Federal Reserve (Fed) policy. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets currently price in around a 43% chance of a 25-basis-point cut in December, reflecting heightened caution as the economic outlook cools.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

It dropped to 0.6490, down from the year-to-date high of 0.6700.\nRBA and Fed Interest Rate Minutes\nThe AUD/USD pair reacted mildly to the latest RBA minutes of the last monetary policy meeting. In that meeting, the bank caught investors off guard by deciding to leave interest rates unchanged at 3.6% after delivering three cuts earlier this year.\nTop Forex Brokers\nThe minutes showed that officials remained concerned about the country's inflation, which has remained at an elevated level in the past few months. A recent report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that inflation remained above 3% in the fourth quarter.\nAs such, officials believe that more cuts will lead to higher inflation. The bank also believes that the economy is running close to capacity, with the labor market being strong. A report released last week showed that the unemployment rate remained at 4.3%, with employment rising to 14.68 million.\nThe AUD/USD exchange will next react to the upcoming Federal Reserve minutes, which will come out on Wednesday this week. These minutes will provide more information on the economy and what officials expect in the coming meetings.\nThe pair will also react to the upcoming US jobs report, which will come out on Thursday.

It has dropped from the year-to-date high of 0.6700 to the current 0.6490.\nThe pair has moved below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It has moved below the Supertrend indicator, a sign that bears remains in control.\nAlso, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have continued falling. It has formed the head-and-shoulders pattern, a sign that bears are in control.\nTherefore, the pair will likely continue falling as sellers target the next key support at 0.6400.

The pair benefits from a slightly firmer US Dollar (USD) amid a cautious market mood, while the Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to weaken under the weight of Japan\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy.\nThe US Dollar shows a mild upward bias as investors remain hesitant to take strong directional positions ahead of a backlog of US economic reports delayed by the recent government shutdown. Markets are watching Tuesday\u2019s ADP weekly employment reading and the US Factory Orders release, which could shape the Greenback\u2019s near-term direction before Thursday\u2019s highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for September.\nMonday\u2019s US data also supported the US Dollar. The Empire State Manufacturing Index sharply beat expectations, climbing to its highest level in nearly one year in November, while construction spending surprised to the upside in August. Together, these figures point to a resilient US economy despite administrative disruptions.\nStill, some remarks from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials encourage caution. Governor Christopher Waller warned that rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence technology could reduce demand for labor, potentially forcing the Fed to ease policy sooner if the job market weakens. Even so, expectations for a December rate cut remain below 50%, with investors awaiting additional data in the coming days.\nMarkets will also monitor upcoming comments from Fed Governor Michael Barr and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin for further clues regarding the December meeting.\nIn Japan, the JPY remains under pressure.

The pair has tested a ten-month high after breaking firmly above the 155.00 psychological level, with resistance seen between 155.50 and 156.00. This advance follows a clear divergence between the Federal Reserve\u2019s restrained approach toward easing and Japan\u2019s entrenched ultra-loose monetary stance. The yield spread between U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government bonds continues to hover near multi-decade highs\u2014over 360 basis points\u2014cementing the Dollar\u2019s advantage as traders adjust positions before the release of delayed U.S. NFP and FOMC minutes.\nFed Caution And U.S. Data Reinforce Dollar Strength\nThe Dollar Index remains above 99.40, reflecting cautious optimism around U.S. resilience after stronger-than-expected manufacturing and construction data. The Empire State Manufacturing Index jumped to its highest level in a year, while August construction spending rose beyond forecasts, confirming robust activity despite the recent government shutdown. These figures cooled speculation of a December rate cut, which futures now price below 40%, compared to more than 60% earlier this month. Fed Governor Christopher Waller warned that accelerated AI adoption could soften labor demand, signaling that policy easing would depend on incoming data. Still, markets anticipate roughly 75 bps in total cuts by the end of 2026. Treasury yields remain elevated, with the 10-year holding near 4.46%, reinforcing the interest-rate gap favoring the Dollar against the Yen.\nBoJ Reluctance And Fiscal Policy Pressure Undermine The Yen\nThe Bank of Japan continues to resist a full pivot toward tightening, even after inflation eased to 2.6% year-on-year and Q3 GDP contracted for the first time in six quarters. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi reiterated her call for sustained low rates to safeguard growth, effectively constraining Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s room for normalization. Fiscal plans to stimulate consumption via targeted tax cuts worth \u00a51.5 trillion further strain Japan\u2019s long-term fiscal balance, undermining Yen confidence. The Ministry of Finance\u2019s verbal warnings about \u201cone-sided\u201d currency moves have done little to reverse sentiment, with traders doubting imminent intervention. Still, thin liquidity periods\u2014especially during the Asian session\u2014remain vulnerable to abrupt volatility if Tokyo steps in.\nTechnical Setup Shows Strong Bullish Bias For USD/JPY\nThe technical landscape highlights an entrenched uptrend. USD/JPY (155.35) remains above all key moving averages\u201415-day at 154.20, 20-day at 153.70, 50-day at 152.10\u2014forming a steep ascending channel. Momentum oscillators confirm strength, with RSI at 66.4 still shy of the overbought threshold. The MACD histogram continues to widen, indicating sustained bullish momentum. A decisive close above 156.00 could expose the next resistance at 157.40, a level last tested during the 2022 yield-spread shock. On the downside, 154.50\u2013154.45 acts as immediate support, followed by 153.60, where multiple EMAs converge. A break below 153.50 would suggest short-term exhaustion, but the broader structure remains intact as long as 153.00 holds.\nRisk Appetite, Equity Volatility, And Cross-Currency Influence\nRecent equity turbulence\u2014driven by renewed AI bubble fears and profit-taking in tech heavyweights like NASDAQ:NVDA\u2014has fueled risk-off sentiment without boosting the Yen, a sign of structural weakness in the safe-haven correlation. The S&P 500\u2019s retreat below 6,707 and the Nikkei 225\u2019s modest 0.8% rebound show that global inv"

                "body": "The USD/JPY is currently trading around 155.40. Today\u2019s movements remain clearly influenced by fundamental factors, with the balance of power between Japan and the United States still favoring the dollar. Despite the deterioration in global sentiment, markets are not turning to the yen, highlighting its structural weakness caused by the BOJ\u2019s policy and the wide interest rate differential. Attention is also focused on domestic tensions in Japan, expectations regarding the Fed, and a set of upcoming US economic data that could determine the next moves for the pair.\nWhat is driving USDJPY today?\nMonetary policy of the Bank of Japan (BOJ)\nThe Bank of Japan continues its exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, keeping interest rates unchanged despite growing tensions within the Policy Board, where some members favored a hike. Markets do not expect tightening soon, as BOJ Governor Ueda signals that decisions may come only next year or even in 2026. Expectations for a December rate hike are very low, which keeps the yen widely used in funding strategies. This approach maintains persistent pressure on the Japanese currency.\nSummary:\nThe BOJ remains very dovish, and markets do not expect near-term hikes. The US interest rate advantage remains strong, reinforcing the yen\u2019s weakness.\nRelations between the BOJ and the Japanese government\nThe government repeatedly stresses the need to stabilize the yen, but its interventions remain mostly verbal without concrete action. The BOJ is unwilling to adjust its policy solely to curb currency weakness, focusing instead on inflation and economic support. These differing priorities create clear tension between institutions, increasing market uncertainty. In this environment, Japan\u2019s actions are seen as inconsistent, weakening confidence in the yen.\nSummary:\nThe government talks about strengthening the yen but does not act decisively. The BOJ sticks to its strategy, creating tension. Markets interpret this as a sign of currency weakness.\nExpectations regarding Fed policy\nMarkets are uncertain about the outcome of the Fed\u2019s December meeting. The chances of a rate cut are limited, and the Fed emphasizes that decisions depend on incoming data, which stabilizes the dollar but does not give it a clear directional push. Compared with the BOJ\u2019s dovish stance, this Fed neutrality favors the US currency.\nSummary:\nThe Fed remains neutral, which is enough for the dollar to maintain its edge. Markets see a clear contrast with the dovish BOJ, supporting higher USD/JPY levels.\nUS and Japanese macroeconomic data\nIn the coming days, market attention will focus on releases such as ADP, the FOMC minutes, NFP, and inflation data from both the US and Japan. US data can strongly influence expectations for future Fed decisions, directly affecting USD/JPY. Stronger figures boost the dollar, while weaker ones may increase rate cut expectations and temporarily weaken USD. Japanese data have a smaller impact, as the BOJ reacts slowly.\nSummary:\nUS data are the main driver of USD/JPY. Japanese data have little influence on the pair\u2019s direction. Markets focus almost entirely on the US side.\nInterest rate differential between the US and Japan\nThe wide gap between high US rates and very low Japanese rates remains a key factor in the yen\u2019s structural weakness. This US advantage keeps yen funding attractive for markets, supporting capital flows into dollar-denominated assets. Even a global risk-off environment does not push markets back to the yen, as returns on US assets remain much higher. This phenomenon consistently weakens the Japanese currency.\nSummary:\nThe large interest rate differential works against the yen. Markets continue to use it for funding, maintaining the dollar\u2019s structural advantage.\nGlobal situation and the current risk-off climate\nThe current deterioration in market sentiment is not leading to the typical strengthening of the yen, marking a notable shift from previous cycles. This results from the combina"

                "body": "USD/CAD gains near 1.4000 as Oil prices drop, Fed rate cut bets ease\n- USD/CAD gains ground as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar struggles due to weaker Oil prices.\n- WTI price edges lower as the API Weekly Crude Oil Stock rose by 4.4 million barrels last week.\n- The CME FedWatch Tool indicates a 49% odds for a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in December.\nUSD/CAD rebounds after registering 0.5% losses in the previous session, trading around 1.4000 during the Asian hours on Wednesday. The pair appreciates as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) comes under downward pressure amid lower crude Oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price halts its four-day winning streak, slipping to near $60.40 per barrel at the time of writing.\nCrude Oil prices weakened following another inventory build in the United States (US). The latest American Petroleum Institute (API) report showed US crude stocks rising by 4.4 million barrels last week, the third straight weekly increase and the largest in over five months. The data, along with the IEA\u2019s projection of a record surplus in the coming year, reinforced worries that global supply may outstrip demand.\nHowever, the Canadian Dollar (CAD) could receive support from the cautious sentiment surrounding the Bank of Canada (BoC) policy outlook. Canada\u2019s core measures monitored by the BoC stayed close to the 3% mark in October. Moreover, firm labour data, unemployment at 6.9% and wage growth around 4%, underlying price pressures remain elevated, reinforcing the central bank\u2019s cautious stance. Markets widely expect the BoC to keep interest rates unchanged through the end of 2026.\nThe USD/CAD pair also draws support as the US Dollar (USD) gains amid declining US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut bets for December. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that financial markets are now pricing in a 49% chance that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, down from 67% probability that markets priced a week ago.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a "

But with Parliament\u2019s approval, the budget doubled the country\u2019s fiscal deficit to fund defense and housing\u2014moves aimed at softening the blow from new US tariffs. That clarity sent political uncertainty packing, paving the way for the loonie\u2019s best run since last October. Canada\u2019s global role as a commodities powerhouse means its currency often follows oil\u2019s lead\u2014so a 1.4% boost in us crude, triggered by tighter Western sanctions on Russian oil and shifting supply forecasts, only added momentum. Bond yields in Canada nudged higher as well, hinting at evolving rate expectations, while news of a 17% drop in October housing starts barely dented market enthusiasm.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Markets find their footing after budget clarity.\nThe Canadian dollar just logged the biggest single-day jump in the G10 since August, signaling demand for stability and decisive fiscal direction. US stocks also regained some footing, following a rocky patch tied to Fed policy uncertainty and high equity valuations. With oil prices on the up and Canadian bond yields rising, investors could turn their focus toward energy stocks and resource-led sectors. If global growth finds its groove, that positive momentum may have legs.\nThe bigger picture: Fiscal direction and commodities shift the global narrative.\nCanada\u2019s budget reveals a willingness to lean into fiscal stimulus, even as some peers focus on budget discipline. The Canadian dollar\u2019s surge highlights the currency effects of global commodity swings\u2014especially as Western oil sanctions and supply changes keep energy markets on edge. How Canada juggles resource-driven growth with government spending will be closely watched, as both politics and commodities help steer global currency trends in 2025.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nRosa Leo \u2022 5 days ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 15 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

As one of Canada\u2019s largest exports, declines in crude prices will often undermine the attractiveness of the CAD.\nSecond, domestic inflation figures released on Monday painted a mixed picture for monetary-policy expectations. Canada\u2019s annual inflation rate eased to 2.2% in October from 2.4% in September.\nWhile the cooling in headline inflation may seem supportive of looser policy in the long term, the details suggest the opposite for now as core inflation measures remain sticky and well above the Bank of Canada\u2019s comfort zone, limiting the need for prompt action from the bank.\nNear-Term GBP/CAD Forecast: Cooling UK Inflation to Weaken Sterling?\nLooking ahead to the middle of the week, the primary catalyst of movement in the Pound to Canadian Dollar (GBP/CAD) exchange rate will no doubt be the UK\u2019s own inflation figures.\nWednesday\u2019s CPI figures are expected to report headline inflation cooled from 3.8% to 3.6% in October, marking the first time prices have cooled since May.\nA cooldown in inflation is likely to stoke bets the Bank of England will cut interest rates in December, pulling the Pound lower in the process.\nMeanwhile, in the absence of any notable CAD economic releases, movement in the \u2018Loonie\u2019 is likely to remain linked to oil price dynamics.\nIf prices continue to drop amid fears that an economic downturn could hit demand, it could apply pressure to the Canadian Dollar."

At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is trading around 204.25, hovering close to the more-than-five-week high reached on Monday.\nHowever, sentiment around the Pound remains fragile as markets brace for the November 26 UK Budget, with uncertainty over the government\u2019s tax and spending plans. Recent reports suggest the Treasury is exploring alternative revenue options after dropping a proposed income-tax increase, including the possibility of a new property-related levy.\nAt the same time, growing bets on a December Bank of England (BoE) rate cut are weighing on Sterling. Investors are reacting to signs of cooling momentum in the UK economy, including softer wage growth and a rise in unemployment, while inflation appears to have passed its peak.\nAttention now turns to October's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report due on Wednesday, with headline inflation expected to ease to 3.6% YoY from 3.8% and core inflation seen edging down to 3.4% from 3.5%.\nAdding to the cautious mood, BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill struck a balanced but slightly dovish tone on Tuesday, saying policymakers are now navigating \u201ca series of quite finely balanced decisions.\u201d Speaking at a Natixis event, Pill noted that underlying inflation pressures in the UK are \u201cprobably not as strong as the headline figures suggest.\u201d\nHe cautioned against over-interpreting the latest data, highlighting unusual noise in several key indicators, but added that if evidence of persistent economic slack becomes clearer, he would feel \u201ccompelled to act.\u201d\nIn Japan, expansionary fiscal plans and the BoJ\u2019s gradual approach to policy adjustments continue to weigh on the Yen.\nEarlier in the day, a meeting between BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi also failed to offer any support to the Yen. Ueda told the Prime Minister that the BOJ is \u201cin the process of making gradual adjustments to the degree of monetary easing,\u201d adding that the Bank aims to deliver a \u201csmooth, stable landing\u201d toward its 2% inflation target. He later confirmed that Takaichi made no specific request regarding monetary policy.\nJapan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama voiced concern over the Yen\u2019s moves through verbal intervention, saying the government is \u201calarmed\u201d by the currency\u2019s recent moves and will closely monitor markets for excessive or disorderly behaviour.\nEconomic Indicator\nConsumer Price Index (YoY)\nThe United Kingdom (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly basis, is a measure of consumer price inflation \u2013 the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall \u2013 produced to international standards.

He said that underlying inflation dynamics in the UK are lower than headline inflation suggests and that policymakers should be cautious about over-interpreting.latest changes in key data\nKey takeaways\nUnderlying inflation dynamics in the UK are lower than headline inflation suggests.\nPolicymakers should be cautious about over-interpreting latest changes in key data.\nWe haven't seen the moderation in key nominal data that we would have expected in the past. Recent private-sector surveys have presented a less bearish picture of the economy than official figures.\nI expect the QE portfolio held for monetary policy purposes to be wound down to a very low level.\u201d\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

A locked-down base layer might be less exciting, but it\u2019s also less likely to break.\nAnd for a network securing hundreds of billions in value, perhaps boring is a feature, not a bug.\nOssification isn\u2019t binary\nButerin argued that Ethereum can ossify different layers at different speeds.\nThe consensus layer could lock down changes while the Ethereum Virtual Machine remains openly flexible. Or vice-versa.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to maintain some flexibility,\u201d he said.\nThe goal isn\u2019t to stifle or kill innovation but to redirect it away from the base layer and into the surrounding ecosystem. That means layer 2 rollups, wallets, privacy tools, and user-facing applications \u2014 not fundamental protocol changes.\nLayer 2s already handle most of Ethereum\u2019s transaction volume. The more activity that moves there, the more space opens up on layer 1 for settlement and security.\n\u201cIt\u2019s healthy to move attention out of L1 and into the surrounding ecosystem,\u201d Buterin said.\nThe cost of maturity\nBut Buterin admitted the shift comes with tradeoffs.\nEthereum\u2019s early days had a \u201cspirit of exploration\u201d that has largely disappeared as the ecosystem took unsavoury turns with the surge of memecoins, and simultaneously maturing with the arrival of institutional players.\n\u201cThere is too much of the space that has gone in the direction of \u2018if you want to succeed, be a fast follower and copy what\u2019s already working,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt harms the imagination of the space.\u201d\nQuantum computing looms\nTowards the end, Buterin issued a stark warning.\nElliptic curve cryptography, the foundation of Ethereum \u2014 and Bitcoin\u2019s \u2014 security, won\u2019t last forever.\n\u201cElliptic curves are going to die,\u201d he said, pointing to a prediction that the ability of quantum computing to break Ethereum\u2019s underlying security model could come before the next US presidential election in 2028.\nThat gives Ethereum roughly four years to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptography \u2014 a timeline that assumes quantum computers advance on schedule.\nIt\u2019s the kind of existential technical challenge that will require coordination across the entire ecosystem. But if Buterin\u2019s vision holds, those changes will happen at the edges \u2014 not in Ethereum\u2019s increasingly unchangeable core.\nPedro Solimano is DL News\u2019 Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent.

Activity \"explicitly allowed under the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act\" will require banks needing to pay network fees as an agent for customers or as part of its custody operations, the letter said.\nThe need for banks \"to pay network fees to facilitate otherwise permissible crypto-asset activities and to hold, as principal, amounts of crypto-assets on balance sheet necessary to pay network fees for which the bank anticipates a reasonably foreseeable need is permissible for the bank,\" the OCC concluded\nU.S. banking regulators \u2014 also including the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the wider Treasury Department \u2014 are already working on writing new regulations to govern stablecoin issuers and activity, based on the new GENIUS Act requirements. But those rules aren't yet in place for the law approved earlier this year.\nThe OCC has reversed years of hesitation about letting regulated banks engage in digital assets activity with the arrival of the pro-crypto administration of President Donald Trump.

                "body": "The Solana ecosystem is attracting more developers than ever. After recovering from the 2022 FTX collapse, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) invested heavily in tools, hackathons, and grants to bring developers back.\nThe strategy worked. Electric Capital notes a 29.1% year-over-year increase in Solana\u2019s full-time developers and a 61.7% rise over two years, while the Solana Foundation\u2019s internal tracking shows a 42% jump in active developers after revamping its developer tools. Here\u2019s what\u2019s driving that surge and why it matters for the network\u2019s future.\nSolana\u2019s Developer Numbers Hit New Peaks\nDevelopers have been flooding back to Solana since late 2023. Electric Capital\u2019s 2024 report ranked Solana as the top ecosystem for new developers, with 83% year-on-year growth. That momentum accelerated through 2025, with Solana adding 11,534 new developers in the first nine months compared to Ethereum\u2019s 16,181.\nSolana\u2019s total active developer base now sits at 17,708, second only to Ethereum\u2019s 31,869 but well ahead of Bitcoin\u2019s 11,036. The figures show 29.1% annual growth and 61.7% growth over two years.\nChainspect data tells an even stronger story. Chainspect counts 10,733 active Solana developers, which would make it the largest developer base among blockchains. The gap between 17,708 and 10,733 comes down to methodology: Electric Capital tracks developers across multiple repositories without double-counting, while Chainspect appears to count by repository or commit activity.\nThe Solana Foundation argues Electric Capital\u2019s numbers miss roughly 7,800 developers because many projects use private repositories that aren\u2019t mapped. Either way, both datasets point to the same conclusion: Solana\u2019s developer base hit record highs.\nWhat\u2019s Driving the Surge?\nDeveloper growth doesn\u2019t happen by accident. Solana made specific investments that paid off:\nBetter Tools and Education\nImproved tooling made the difference. Frameworks like Anchor and the Solana Mobile Stack cut the complexity of writing programs, making it easier to build high-performance dApps. The Solana Foundation invested heavily in developer education through the Solana Educate series and regional bootcamps, onboarding thousands of new developers.\nGrants and incentives for open-source tooling accelerated adoption further. These programs helped drive 83% year-on-year growth in active developers by 2024.\nHackathons and Community Support\nSolana\u2019s hackathon circuit became a major growth engine. Events like Riptide, Summer Camp, and Hyperdrive drew thousands of participants, with Hyperdrive alone attracting over 900 projects (a 63% jump from the previous event). But Solana didn\u2019t just host these hackathons and call it a day. The foundation built a post-event pipeline with grants, investor connections, and technical support.\nThe retention numbers prove it worked: more than half of hackathon participants stayed active in the ecosystem. This created a powerful feedback loop where more developers built applications, attracting more users and funding, which in turn drew even more developers.\nNetwork Upgrades and Performance\nTechnical improvements sealed the deal. Solana\u2019s network upgrades (fee markets, spam mitigation, and priority fees) improved scalability and stability. The network now handles real-world transaction rates exceeding 10,000 TPS, with peak test rates above 100,000 TPS.\nThe Alpenglow consensus update cut block finality to 100-150 milliseconds, while the upcoming Firedancer client promises even higher throughput. These upgrades make Solana attractive for developers building high-frequency applications: decentralized exchanges, payment systems, gaming platforms.\nEconomic Incentives and Revenue Growth\nMoney talks. Solana\u2019s protocol revenue exploded from about $13 million (2022-2023) to $2.85 billion (2024-2025). A 21Shares report notes Solana averages $240 million in monthly revenue, occasionally exceeding $600 million.\nDaily revenue milestones tell the story. The ORE protocol alone hit $1 mill"

                "body": "Solana\u2019s fast, low-cost network is fueling a major rise in DEX activity and trading volumes.\nNetwork outages, MEV concerns, and incentive dependence remain major risks.\nLong-term growth depends on stability, sustainable liquidity, and stronger ecosystem maturity.\nThe growth of decentralized exchanges on Solana is one of the strongest trends in the crypto market. Fast transaction speeds, very low fees, and an energetic developer base have created a strong environment for trading and liquidity. The rapid expansion has raised important questions about stability, long-term sustainability, and the real benefits offered by this ecosystem.\nSolana\u2019s decentralized finance activity has grown sharply. Daily DEX trading volume on the network usually reaches billions of dollars. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in Solana\u2019s DeFi is approximately $9.4 billion - $9.5 billion, depending on market conditions. Trading activity is a major part of Solana\u2019s growth, with several exchanges on the network recording some of the highest on-chain volumes across all blockchains.\nMuch of this momentum is driven by Solana\u2019s design. Transactions confirm in under a second and usually cost less than a cent. Because of this, traders who move quickly or trade small amounts find the network especially attractive. Many industry analysts have noted that Solana\u2019s share in global DEX activity has increased significantly over the last year.\nSolana\u2019s biggest advantage is speed combined with affordability. Low fees make it ideal for active trading, especially for tokens with small market caps or for traders who are experimenting with new strategies. This advantage has drawn large crowds into the ecosystem, especially during periods of high memecoin activity.\nAnother major factor is the level of innovation happening on the network. Many Solana-based exchanges have introduced advanced features such as concentrated liquidity, which allows liquidity providers to earn better fees with less capital. These features improve efficiency for both liquidity providers and traders.\nThe broader Solana ecosystem also plays a big role. Launchpads, lending platforms, aggregators, liquid staking protocols, and cross-chain tools work together to create a strong trading environment. As liquidity increases, traders get better prices, which brings even more volume.\nAlso Read - Top Decentralized Exchanges by Volume\nEven though Solana offers great performance, it has also faced periods of network instability. Outages and network slowdowns have occurred at different times in recent years. These incidents make traders and institutions cautious, especially those who depend on reliable uptime for arbitrage or market-making.\nAnother concern is the concentration of activity within a small group of validators or infrastructure providers. A highly efficient network can sometimes lead to a situation where only a few players dominate order flow or extract most of the MEV (value captured through transaction ordering). This can reduce fairness for ordinary traders or passive liquidity providers.\nIncentive programs are another potential weakness. Many Solana DEXs attract liquidity using token rewards. These rewards can quickly increase TVL, but such liquidity is often temporary. When token rewards slow down, liquidity may leave the platform, causing higher slippage and weaker trading conditions. Sustainable fee generation is still a challenge for several protocols.\nThe nature of trading on Solana also adds risk. A large portion of recent volume has come from memecoin speculation. While this increases short-term activity, it also increases volatility. Sharp corrections or liquidity drains can spread quickly across the ecosystem.\nActive traders who need very fast and low-cost transactions gain the most value from Solana DEXs. Solana offers a strong advantage to these people, especially when the network is running smoothly.\nLiquidity providers can also benefit, especially with new concentrated liquidity models. Ho"

                "body": "US stock futures steadied during the Asian session on Wednesday, November 19, looking to snap their losing streaks. The Asian equity markets advanced in early trading, lifting sentiment ahead of crucial earnings and the highly anticipated FOMC Meeting Minutes.\nConcerns about stock valuations have fueled the market sell-off amid fading bets on a December Fed rate cut. The absence of crucial US inflation and jobs data has left FOMC members to guide sentiment toward further policy easing. Fed speakers have raised concerns about elevated prices, suggesting voting members may prioritize taming inflation over supporting a cooling labor market.\nFalling bets on a December Fed rate cut collided with rising concerns about the Japanese government\u2019s fiscal spending plans, sending USD/JPY to a nine-month high of 155.732 this week. Despite a modest pullback in early trading on Wednesday, November 19, the pair traded at 155.266. The weaker yen fuels the carry trade into risk assets.\nNotably, USD/JPY gains lifted demand for Asian equities. The Nikkei, the Hang Seng Index, and Mainland China\u2019s equity markets joined US stock futures in positive territory. The Nikkei led the gains, climbing 0.55%.\nHowever, the gains were modest given investor caution ahead of key earnings results and the upcoming FOMC Meeting Minutes.\nWhile the Fed\u2019s policy outlook remains key for near-term market trends, the US corporate earnings calendar will influence sentiment later on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA) will release its earnings and is likely to influence risk appetite.\nStrong earnings are likely to revive the 2025 market rally driven by relief over the stock\u2019s valuation. Traders will likely be wary ahead of the release, given the potential impact of disappointing earnings on sentiment.\nFutures posted gains during the Asian session after the previous day\u2019s pullback. The Dow Jones E-mini rose 38 points, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini gained 13 points, while the S&P 500 E-mini climbed 5 points.\nLater on Wednesday, the FOMC Meeting Minutes will fuel speculation about a December Fed rate cut. Hawkish minutes underscoring concerns about inflation would likely weigh on US stock futures. On the other hand, a greater focus on a cooling labor market could lift sentiment.\nAhead of today\u2019s minutes, Several FOMC members have poured cold water on hopes for further monetary policy easing, citing high inflation.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a Fed December rate cut have fallen from 66.9% on November 11 to 48.9% on November 18.\nWhile increasing focus on inflation would be a headwind for US equity futures, strong earnings from Nvidia could lift sentiment ahead of key US jobs data on Thursday, November 20.\nDespite Wednesday\u2019s early gains, US stock futures remained below their 50-day EMA, signaling a bearish near-term bias.\nNear-term trends will hinge on the FOMC Meeting Minutes, Fed speakers, and Nvidia\u2019s earnings. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nMarkets face a pivotal test as corporate earnings and Fed Minutes clash, potentially triggering market volatility. The FOMC Meeting Minutes could provide insights into whether inflation or the labor market will have a greater influence on the December interest rate decision.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s earnings could alleviate or exacerbate concerns about AI stock valuations, setting the stage for a choppy mid-week session.\nFollow our live coverage and consult the economic calendar for real-time market updates.\nWith over 28 years of experience in the financial industry, Bob has worked with various global rating agencies and multinational banks.

                "body": "US index futures came off their worse levels at the European open, before resuming lower a few hours later along with European markets as the bounce didn\u2019t have much firepower. Markets have been under intense pressure in recent days across the world, with the risk off sentiment also hurting cryptocurrencies, copper and commodity dollars. Even gold has been forced lower despite being a haven asset. The Dow Jones forecast has turned bearish from a technical perspective, too, following the break of key support levels.\nAnalysis: What\u2019s causing the risk off sentiment?\nMarkets started this week falling quite aggressively. Some pointed out Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings report on Wednesday as a trigger behind the tech sector drop, with the chipmaker\u2019s results poised to test investor nerves over lofty valuations in the AI sector. Others pointed the finger to crypto market where Bitcoin has plunged below several key levels in recent days, putting pressure on leveraged positions in other markets like stocks and bullion. And then, there\u2019s the intensifying concerns about Japan\u2019s growing debt problems, where the new government seems to be trying to have it both ways: implementing a massive fiscal stimulus package worth 17 trillion yen while opposing monetary policy normalisation by the Bank of Japan.\nWhile the trigger behind the drop in risk appetite could be any of the above, I think the Japanese situation is where the real concern is. The abovementioned conflicting stance has led to a sharp decline in both the yen and bond prices, pushing Japanese yields higher to record or multi year highs. Takaichi\u2019s bold expansionary fiscal spending plans are likely to swell Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio even higher. Markets now worry that the government is mishandling the economy, demanding higher returns to compensate for what they perceive as rising risk in holding Japanese debt.\nUnwinding of yen-funded carry trades\nSo why does this matter for US stocks and the Dow Jones forecast? The turbulence in Japanese markets may be triggering a carry trade unwind, similar to what happened in the summer of 2024. In a carry trade, investors borrow funds from countries with very low interest rates\u2014like Japan\u2014and invest them in higher-yielding assets such as stocks, gold, or cryptocurrencies denominated in stronger currencies like the US dollar. As Japanese yields climb, the cost of maintaining these trades rises. With yields now becoming uncomfortably high, traders are being forced to reduce leveraged positions across markets, including US stocks.\nFOMC minutes, Nvidia earnings, NFP payrolls and PMI data all in focus this week\nMuch now hinges on the Fed\u2019s 10 December meeting, with markets assigning roughly a 50% chance of another 25bp cut. That sort of coin-flip pricing likely suits the Fed, especially given the limited data flow after the record-long government shutdown. It also means the dollar probably won\u2019t move too dramatically on Wednesday\u2019s release of the October FOMC minutes, where Chair Powell stressed that a December cut was far from guaranteed and that views within the Committee were sharply divided.\nMeanwhile, this week\u2019s upcoming data and events should set the tone for the dollar. Nvidia reports on Wednesday evening, and the long-delayed September NFP finally lands on Thursday. A 50-60 thousand payrolls print and an unemployment rate stuck at 4.3% would be broadly neutral, perhaps slightly supportive for the dollar, as a December cut would need clearer signs of weakness.\nWe\u2019ll also hear from several Fed officials this week. If overall they reiterate the familiar line that there\u2019s no rush to cut further and that the neutral rate remains uncertain, that would gently support the dollar.\nThis week\u2019s other global data releases include Friday\u2019s PMI figures. But most attention is likely to remain on the US, given the lack any major data releases during the government shutdown.\nTechnical Dow Jones forecast: Bullish trend threatened\nAt the time of writing, our US 30"

Worries that stock prices of such companies have shot too high have roiled world markets recently, with big swings in places that rely heavily on trade in computer chips such as South Korea and Taiwan.\nAlso hanging over the markets is the release due Thursday of US employment data that was delayed by the prolonged government shutdown.\nRegional markets felt a chill after the yield on 30-year Japanese government bonds surged to 3.31pc, reflecting rising risks as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to boost government spending and push back the timetable for bringing down Japan\u2019s huge national debt.\nTokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 was down 3pc at 48,835.20 by midday, with selling of tech shares leading the decline.

                "body": "Did the last Budget sink the FTSE 100? On the surface, the answer to this question would seem like a big fat no! The Footsie is up 33% since October last year.\nBut a \u00a340bn tax bill, much of which comes from the UK\u2019s biggest companies, has an impact on operations. It\u2019s hard to tease out the details as the costs have been shared across earnings, lack of wage increases and higher prices. But with the CEO of BT complaining about \u201cgovernment-inflicted costs\u201d, the CEO of Ryanair threatening the economy is \u201cdoomed to continue to fail\u201d and the CEO of Tesco saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d, I think it\u2019s fair to say the last Budget was not a welcome one.\nAnother round of billions set to be added to the public purse this month. So I thought I\u2019d ask that modern day Oracle of ChatGPT to see what it thought on the matter.\nThe good and bad\nI asked: \u201cWhat might the Autumn Budget mean for the FTSE 100?\u201d Here are some of the most important bits I took from it.\n- \u201cThe FTSE 100 is unlikely to be thrown off its course dramatically solely because of the Budget \u2014 its global earnings base gives it some cushion.\n- If the Budget is seen as fiscally credible (tax rises/constraint rather than giveaways), that could provide a tailwind to the FTSE 100 via improved investor sentiment and possibly lower yields.\n- If the Budget dampens UK growth significantly, domestic\u2010focused stocks (not major part of FTSE 100) may suffer, but the global firms could offset.\n- Currency impact: if the Budget weakens the pound, that could be a boost; if it strengthens it, that may remove a tailwind.\u201d\nI think this highlights what these large language models are good at \u2013 namely, synthesising and simplifying large amounts of data.\nBut the lack of anything past surface level detail also shows where it struggles. That\u2019s going into depth on a particular subject. I\u2019ll also add that they\u2019re still prone to hallucination, so their computer-generated utterances can never be taken as gospel. And they can tend to be all things to all people.\nWorth a look\nI do think that some of the international-focused stocks on the FTSE 100 could benefit after the budget. A stock like miner Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO) is one example that could be worth considering.\nWhile listed in London, the UK is a minor market accounting for less than 2% of revenues. This means a weakening pound benefits it. A weakening in the UK economy is less impactful too.\nThese are some of the advantages to investing in such huge, diversified businesses. But the size of the company (a \u00a392bn market cap) can also be a downside. That\u2019s because of the difficulty of effectively managing such a large organisation.\nThe dividend yield stands at 5.28%, above the Footsie average. The price-to-earning ratio of 11.3 looks reasonable. The share price is near all-time-highs after rising 13% in the last year too. That\u2019s perhaps a sign growth is on the agenda in the coming years."

The blue\u2011chip index traded around 9,580\u20139,600, down just under 1% from Monday\u2019s close of 9,675.43, while the FTSE 250 mid\u2011cap benchmark slid about 1.1% to roughly 21,450. [1]\nJust days after hitting an all\u2011time high near 9,930, the FTSE 100 is now more than 3% below that peak, underlining how quickly sentiment has flipped from euphoria to caution. [2]\nFTSE 100 and UK indices: where the market stands today\nAs of Tuesday\u2019s session in London:\n- FTSE 100: around 9,590, down about 0.85\u20131.0% on the day, after Monday\u2019s 0.24% decline to 9,675.43. [3]\n- FTSE 250: down 238 points (\u20111.1%) at 21,449.61. [4]\n- AIM All\u2011Share: off roughly 1% around 736.7. [5]\n- Cboe UK 100 and Cboe UK 250 indices were each down about 1.1%, mirroring the weakness in their FTSE counterparts. [6]\nAcross Europe, the STOXX 600 fell around 1.1% to a one\u2011week low, with Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC 40 each down more than 1.2%, underscoring that this is a region\u2011wide sell\u2011off, not a UK\u2011specific wobble. [7]\nGlobal tech jitters and Fed uncertainty hit the UK stock market\nThe pressure on the FTSE 100 today is part of a broader global shake\u2011out:\n- On Monday, Wall Street slid again, with the S&P 500 losing around 0.9% and the Dow Jones dropping about 1.2%, as the US benchmark closed below its 50\u2011day moving average for the first time since April \u2014 a technical red flag for many traders. [8]\n- Investors are bracing for Nvidia\u2019s earnings on Wednesday and a long\u2011delayed US jobs report on Thursday, both seen as potential catalysts for either a rebound or a deeper correction in risk assets. [9]\nIn Europe, Reuters reports that worries over overvalued tech stocks and diminishing expectations of a December Federal Reserve rate cut are driving a broad risk\u2011off mood. Financials are under particular pressure, with European banking indices down more than 2% on the day. [10]\nThe risk shunning is visible well beyond equities:\n- Bitcoin briefly fell below $90,000 for the first time in seven months and is now down about 28\u201329% from its early\u2011October all\u2011time high above $126,000, according to both Bloomberg/Business Times and UK market commentary. [11]\n- Bond markets are seeing a bid for safety, with the US 10\u2011year Treasury yield edging down towards 4.11%. [12]\nPut simply: money is being pulled out of the raciest corners of the market (AI\u2011linked tech, crypto, high\u2011beta equities) and parked in safer assets. London, with its heavy weighting in financials, miners and global cyclicals, is getting caught in that downdraft.\nSector snapshot: miners, banks down; defensives and tobacco offer support\nMiners and cyclicals lead the fall\nMining and other cyclical stocks are once again on the wrong side of today\u2019s trade:\n- Gold miners such as Fresnillo were among the worst FTSE 100 performers, slumping around 5\u20136% as the gold price eased from recent highs. [13]\n- Broader risk\u2011sensitive names \u2014 including housebuilders and economically exposed industrials \u2014 also came under pressure, reflecting worries over global growth and tighter financial conditions. [14]\nBanks face mixed signals\nUK banks are being buffeted by conflicting forces:\n- On the negative side, weaker equity sentiment and concerns about the economic backdrop are dragging on share prices. London\u2019s big lenders have been volatile in recent sessions as markets toggle between optimism on rate cuts (which can squeeze margins) and fear of slower growth and rising credit risk. [15]\n- At the same time, the Bank of England\u2019s decision to boost deposit insurance \u2014 increasing the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) cap from \u00a385,000 to \u00a3120,000 per saver \u2014 underscores ongoing regulatory caution around financial stability.

Over in policy land, the European Central Bank kept key capital requirements steady at 11.2% for 2026, signaling faith in European banks\u2019 strong liquidity and profitability.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Cautious vibes steer the market mood.\nThe DAX\u2019s decline shows how easily uncertainty can sway European markets ahead of major US economic releases. While the ECB\u2019s sign-off on bank strength provides some reassurance, individual moves\u2014like Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s blockchain push\u2014highlight the role of innovation in standing out during turbulent times. All eyes are now on the next US jobs data, which could set the tone for the rest of November.\nThe bigger picture: Digital innovation meets financial stability.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s blockchain move points to growing interest in digital assets within Europe\u2019s traditional finance world. At the same time, the ECB\u2019s stable approach reflects confidence in the region\u2019s banks to manage global volatility. Taken together, these trends show how Europe is navigating a path between embracing digital innovation and maintaining financial stability as markets stay on edge.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nRosa Leo \u2022 5 days ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 16 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Germany\u2019s blue\u2011chip DAX 40 index closed sharply lower on Tuesday, 18 November 2025, as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange was hit by a global risk\u2011off wave, fresh warnings from the European Central Bank (ECB) about bank vulnerabilities, and ongoing concerns over an \u201cAI bubble\u201d in technology stocks.\nBy the close of Xetra trading at 17:30 CET, the DAX finished at 23,335.07 points, down 1.08% from Monday\u2019s close of 23,590.52, after trading in a relatively tight intraday range between about 23,230 and 23,365 points. [1]\nDAX 40: Weak Open, Heavy Session, Lower Close\nTrading on Xetra, Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s fully electronic order book and the reference market for German shares and ETFs, runs from 09:00 to 17:30 CET on trading days. [2] The tone was negative from the opening bell:\n- Futures signalled declines after a red session in Asia and on Wall Street. [3]\n- According to intra\u2011day data, the DAX opened around 23,233 points, already more than 1% below Monday\u2019s close. [4]\nEarly in the European morning, European equities slid to a one\u2011week low, with the pan\u2011European STOXX 600 down about 1.1% by around 08:10 GMT and major indices in Germany and France falling more than 1.2%. [5] A little later, live market coverage in London reported Germany\u2019s DAX down about 1.3%, alongside similar losses in other eurozone benchmarks. [6]\nAlthough the German index clawed back a small part of those early losses into the close, the move still marked another down day in what has become a choppy November for German equities.\nKey numbers for 18 November 2025 (Xetra DAX 40): [7]\n- Close: 23,335.07\n- Change: \u2212255.45 points (\u22121.08%)\n- Open: 23,233.18\n- High / Low: 23,365.18 / 23,230.19\n- Volume: ~7.7 million index\u2011level shares traded\nWhy German Stocks Fell Today: Fed Doubts and AI Valuation Jitters\nThe selling pressure in Frankfurt was part of a global risk\u2011off move:\n- A Reuters European market wrap cited worries about stretched technology valuations and fading expectations of a near\u2011term U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut as key drivers, with banking shares among the hardest\u2011hit sectors. [8]\n- A separate \u201cMorning Bid\u201d column from Reuters noted \u201canother sea of red\u201d in Asian markets and highlighted how Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings and a delayed U.S. jobs report later in the week are keeping investors on edge. [9]\n- A live business blog from The Guardian described a fourth consecutive day of global stock market losses, driven by fears that an AI\u2011driven tech boom may be turning into a bubble and by concerns that rate cuts could be slower than previously hoped. [10]\nFor the German stock exchange, this translated into:\n- Persistent selling in interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive banks and cyclical stocks,\n- Profit\u2011taking in semiconductors and industrials that had run hard earlier in the year, and\n- A wider pullback in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin sliding below $90,000 in parallel with the equity sell\u2011off. [11]\nECB Warning Puts German and Eurozone Banks in the Spotlight\nOne of the most relevant policy headlines for Germany today came from Frankfurt itself.\nIn a supervisory update, the European Central Bank warned that eurozone banks face an \u201cunprecedentedly high\u201d risk of extreme, low\u2011probability shocks and must be ready for severe disruptions with far\u2011reaching consequences for financial systems. [12]\nKey points from the ECB\u2019s communication: [13]\n- Structural vulnerabilities from geopolitics, shifting trade policies, climate risks, demographic change and technological disruption mean shocks are likely to be more frequent and more extreme.\n- Banks are urged to maintain strong capital buffers, modern IT infrastructure and \u201cintrusive\u201d risk management, while the ECB plans reverse stress tests to examine how much capital they could lose under hypothetical scenarios.\n- Although the ECB said eurozone banks currently enjoy solid capitalisation and profitability, it warned that this \u201cbenign environment is unlikely to last\u201d, especially given U.S.\u2013EU trade tensions that could hit sec"

Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) slid around 0.3%.\n(YM=F)\nThe lackluster moves followed another down day for stocks. The Dow (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) logged their fourth straight decline, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell for the fifth time in six sessions. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly dipped below $90,000 before rebounding, hinting at the market's reducing appetite for crypto.\nTraders are now bracing for Nvidia\u2019s third-quarter earnings, due after Wednesday\u2019s close. Analysts are predicting a move of up to 7% in either direction, carrying a $320 billion swing based on current market value. But recent profit-taking across mega-cap tech suggests investors are questioning whether valuations have stretched too far.\nOn the consumer front, traders will also parse earnings from Target (TGT), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), and TJX Companies (TJX) before Wednesday\u2019s opening bell. With fresh economic data still sparse after the federal government shutdown, results from the big-box retailers may offer the clearest read on the state of US consumer spending heading into the holiday season.\nThe first major post-shutdown release also looms on Thursday with the delayed unveiling of the September jobs report. The report will help shape expectations for the Federal Reserve's next policy moves, with traders split on whether the central bank will cut rates next month.\nLIVE 1 update"

It was the fourth consecutive session of declines for both the S&P 500 and the Dow, which shed roughly 500 points after having lost about 670 at its lowest level today.\nAI darling Nvidia (NVDA), the world's most valuable company, stock closed down nearly 2% yesterday as investors eagerly await its quarterly earnings report after the bell Wednesday. Nvidia shares closed down a further 2% after announcing strategic partnerships with Microsoft (MSFT) and Claude AI developer Anthropic that will see Anthropic buy $30 billion worth of Azure compute capacity from Microsoft. Nvidia and Microsoft, whose shares fell 2.7%, will invest up to $10 billion and up to $5 billion, respectively, in Anthropic.\nMicrosoft shares also were pressured by a ratings cut by Rothschild, which also did likewise for Amazon (AMZN). Shares of the e-commerce and cloud giant were down 4.4%.\nHome Depot (HD) shares sank 6% after the home-improvement retailer reported disappointing third-quarter profit and cut its full-year outlook. Fellow retailers TJX (TJX), Lowe's (LOW), and Target (TGT) are slated to report results Wednesday morning and Walmart (WMT) early Thursday.\nCloudflare (NET) shares ended down almost 3% after the web security company was affected by an outage that hit several prominent customers, including social media site X and ChatGPT.\nShares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), which hit an all-time intraday high and finished up 3.1% yesterday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) disclosed it had bought 17.8 million shares worth more than $4 billion in the third quarter, faded into the close and finished down 0.3% after it announced its latest AI model, Gemini 3.\nMeta Platforms (META) won a seven-month-long antitrust trial against the Federal Trade Commission, with a judge determining the Facebook parent does not have a social networking monopoly, but shares nevertheless finished down 0.7%.\nBitcoin was trading around $92,800 at 4 p.m. ET after dipping below $89,300 overnight, its lowest level since late April. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked lower to 4.12% from Monday's close at around 4.13%.\nThe U.S. dollar index, which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, was near flat at 99.59. WTI crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, rose 1.5% to $60.80 per barrel. Gold futures edged 0.1% higher to $4,070 per ounce.\nNoteworthy S&P 500 Movers on Tuesday\nDecliners\n- Home Depot (HD) stock tumbled 6% to log the worst performance in the S&P 500 after the home improvement retailer missed forecasts with its third-quarter earnings, noting that a lack of storms during the period weighed on its performance. The company also lowered its full-year profit forecast, citing persistent headwinds in the housing market and suggested that homeowners are pushing back remodeling projects amid broader economic uncertainty.\n- Concerns about high valuations for companies in the artificial intelligence space weighed on the tech sector. Shares of Western Digital (WDC), the hard disk drive maker that has drawn attention from investors given its opportunity to help satiate AI's massive data storage needs, fell 5.9% Tuesday. Shares of memory chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) lost 5.6%.\n- Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) shares slipped 4.4% and 2.7%, respectively, as regulators in the European Union announced that they were launching investigations into cloud computing services offered by the two tech giants.\n- The move lower for Microsoft stock also came as the software giant announced a partnership with AI startup Anthropic.

The major stock market averages, including the Nasdaq Composite, are showing little direction amid an uncertain backdrop. While President Trump is strategizing his next move, the price of oil has soared to multi-month highs to hover above $73 per barrel.

The Fed's decision on interest rates is imminent, and the markets appear to have priced in the likelihood that rates will remain unchanged. A decision is expected by mid-afternoon.\nHere\u2019s a look at the performance as of morning trading:\nDow Jones Industrial Average: Up 54.67 (+0.13%)\nNasdaq Composite: Up 8.08 (+0.04%)\nS&P 500: Up 4.68 (+0.08%)\nAdvertisement\nMarket Movers\nJPMorgan is bullish on fintech stocks, which incidentally serve as competition to traditional financial institutions.

                "body": "TOKYO - Tokyo stocks dropped Tuesday, with the benchmark Nikkei index falling more than 3 percent, led by a plunge in tech issues and growing uncertainty over the U.S. economy, while concerns over Japan's fiscal health spurred a selloff in the yen and government bonds.\nThe 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average extended losses toward the close, ending down 1,620.93 points, or 3.22 percent, from Monday at 48,702.98 and marking the biggest percentage drop since April 9, when the index slid 3.93 percent. The broader Topix index finished 96.43 points, or 2.88 percent, lower at 3,251.10.\nThe yen fell to its lowest since early February against the U.S. dollar, trading in the lower 155 range in Tokyo, while the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield climbed to a more than 17-year high.\nAt 5 p.m., the dollar fetched 154.99-155.01 yen compared with 155.22-32 yen in New York and 154.67-69 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Monday.\nThe euro was quoted at $1.1590-1592 and 179.64-68 yen against $1.1587-1597 and 179.86-96 yen in New York and $1.1613-1614 and 179.63-67 yen in Tokyo late Monday afternoon.\nIn the stock market, heavyweight chip-related stocks took a battering following a drop in their U.S. counterparts overnight ahead of earnings by U.S. chip giant Nvidia Corp. on Wednesday, brokers said.\nExporters also finished mostly lower, even as the yen depreciated against the dollar and the euro, amid fears of a slowing U.S. economy. A weaker yen boosts profits earned overseas when repatriated and makes Japan-made products more price competitive abroad.\nThe near-term outlook is expected to hinge on U.S. economic indicators, with investors awaiting jobs data -- delayed by the U.S. government shutdown -- later this week for clues on the health of the world's largest economy.\n\"Concern is...growing that the U.S. economy will deteriorate if the (Federal Reserve) does not cut interest rates in December,\" as suggested by recent statements from several Fed presidents, said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management Co.\nConcerns grew stronger that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's plan to support Japan's inflation-plagued economy with aggressive fiscal spending could hamper efforts to restore the country's fiscal health.\nInvestors are concerned that the prime minister may ramp up government bond issuance to fund upcoming stimulus measures, which Finance Minister Satsuki Kayatama said Sunday are expected to reach \"well above\" 17 trillion yen ($110 billion) in size.\nJapan's benchmark 10-year government bond yield briefly hit 1.755 percent, its highest level since June 2008, on worries that the action may lead to fiscal deterioration. It ended at 1.745 percent, up 0.015 percentage point from Monday's close.\nIn New York overnight, the Japanese currency weakened beyond the 180 line against the euro for the first time since the single European currency was introduced in 1999, before moderately rallying back."

                "body": "Japan-China tensions trigger Nikkei 225 sell-off as tourism stocks plunge\nDiplomatic tensions between Japan and China sparked a sharp sell-off in the Japanese market, with tourism and retail stocks declining significantly following Beijing's travel advisory.\nWhat happened\nDiplomatic tensions escalated after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi stated in parliament on 7 November that a Chinese military action against Taiwan could constitute an existential threat to Japan, potentially warranting a military response from Tokyo. Beijing responded over the weekend by issuing a travel advisory and expressing concerns regarding the safety of Chinese nationals in Japan.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry asserted that recent statements on Taiwan had undermined the foundation of bilateral relations and called upon Takaichi to retract her remarks. On Monday, Takaichi characterised her comments as 'hypothetical' and pledged to refrain from making similar statements in parliamentary proceedings.\nNikkei plunges below 50,000 and yen weakens\nHeightened diplomatic tensions with China triggered significant investor concern, with travel and retail-oriented equities experiencing substantial sell-offs following Beijing's advisory to Chinese citizens against visiting Japan. Beauty and personal care company Shiseido witnessed its shares decline by 12%, while department store operator Isetan Mitsukoshi fell over 11%, and Ryohin Keikaku, parent company of Muji, shed more than 9% of its market value.\nCombined with concerns regarding elevated valuations in US technology equities, the Nikkei 225 declined 3% across the first two trading sessions this week, falling beneath the 50,000 threshold. The yen simultaneously weakened, breaching 155 against the dollar.\nMarket vulnerability and economic backdrop\nRecent developments reinforce external perceptions of Takaichi's hardline conservative positioning, which has clearly unsettled Beijing. While the market reaction appears pronounced, the underlying concerns are legitimate.\nThe timing proves particularly inopportune given Japan's fragile economic landscape. Japan's third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 1.8% on an annualised basis, marking the first contraction in six quarters. The deceleration stemmed from a sharper decline in net exports and softened private consumption. Households continue to grapple with rising costs amid anaemic real wage growth, while the broader economy confronts external headwinds including US tariffs. Domestic consumption has failed to generate meaningful momentum in retail sales, rendering tourism revenues increasingly critical to economic growth.\nTourism impact\nVisitors from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau represent approximately 27% of all foreign arrivals to Japan in 2024, totalling close to 9.8 million visitors. Should tensions persist, tangible impacts on retail and tourism-related equities could materialise. That said, visitors from other regions may partially offset this demand contraction. Notably, Japan's recent decision to triple the tourism tax to \u00a53000 suggests authorities believe current visitor volumes exceed optimal levels, indicating some buffer capacity exists.\nIt is worth noting that certain equities most severely affected in this episode, such as Shiseido, were already contending with separate operational challenges\u2014the geopolitical tensions merely amplified pre-existing vulnerabilities.\nTrade implications\nShould tensions intensify further, disruptions could extend into the trade relationship, which remains asymmetric yet mutually significant. Japan maintains a \u00a56.4 trillion trade deficit with China in 2024 and depends heavily on Chinese imports for consumer electronics, household appliances and critical rare-earth metals\u2014inputs essential for Japanese manufacturers to sustain export competitiveness. Conversely, Japan dominates the global supply of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and precision machinery crucial to China's technology sector and indus"
