                "body": "Gold saw an increase of over 1%, surpassing $4,200 for the first time in ten days. This rise is attributed to market expectations of further easing by the Federal Reserve, with a 0.25% reduction anticipated at their December meeting, supported by an 87% probability.\nWhile Fed officials have been quiet due to the Thanksgiving period, internal policy disagreements persist. Comments from notable Fed members suggest a more dovish stance, despite the resilience in the job market. This mixed economic backdrop sees inflation stalling with a PPI of 3.1% YoY, dropping to 2.7%.\nGeopolitical And Economic Influences\nPotential shifts in the geopolitical landscape, particularly between Russia and Ukraine, might limit any further Gold gains. Developments in upcoming US economic data, including November\u2019s ISM PMIs and the ADP Employment Change, will be pivotal in the coming week.\nThe Gold price is technically supported above $4,200 and could test recent highs. If it surpasses $4,300, it approaches its record high of $4,381. On a downward trajectory, key support levels include $4,109 and the 20-day Simple Moving Average.\nCentral banks continue to be significant purchasers of Gold, adding 1,136 tonnes in 2022, primarily motivated by economic stability considerations. Gold\u2019s price movements are indirectly linked with US Treasuries and the US Dollar.\nWith gold holding strong above $4,200, we see the market has almost fully priced in a Federal Reserve rate cut for December. The latest readings from the CME FedWatch Tool show an 89% probability of a 25-basis-point cut, suggesting that the path of least resistance is upwards for now. Derivative traders could position for a potential test of record highs by considering call options on gold futures or related ETFs.\nKey Economic Indicators And Market Strategies\nThis dovish sentiment is supported by recent inflation data, which strengthens the case for easing. We recall that the Core PCE Price Index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, cooled to 2.9% year-over-year in the latest reading for October. This disinflationary trend gives policymakers the cover they need to pivot towards supporting the economy with lower rates.\nHowever, a significant risk is building from the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, which could cap any rally. A definitive breakthrough in negotiations would diminish gold\u2019s safe-haven appeal and could trigger a sharp correction. We believe holding protective put options could be a prudent hedge against long positions in the coming weeks.\nImplied volatility on gold options will likely stay elevated ahead of the December 10th Fed meeting and as geopolitical headlines develop. This environment could make strategies that benefit from volatility decay, like selling out-of-the-money credit spreads, appealing for traders who expect the price to stay within a defined range. The risk of a sharp move, however, means such positions must be managed carefully.\nNext week\u2019s data, especially the ISM reports and the ADP employment numbers, will be critical. The last Non-Farm Payrolls report for October showed a gain of 175,000 jobs, which, while healthy, was below the 2024 average and signaled a gradual cooling labor market. A surprisingly strong report could be the only factor to slightly temper rate cut expectations before the Fed meeting.\nWe must remember why gold is at these levels in the first place, looking back at trends from 2023 and 2024. Aggressive purchasing by central banks, who have been diversifying away from the US dollar, has provided a strong underlying bid for the metal. Data from the World Gold Council released earlier this year confirmed that central banks continued their record buying spree through 2024, adding a net 800 tonnes to their reserves."

                "body": "Gold rate today: Following high bets on the US Fed rate cut, gold prices in India and other global bourses witnessed strong buying interest last week. This enabled MCX gold rates to finish higher for the fourth straight month. Gold futures contract on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) for the February 2026 expiry finished \u20b91,932 or 1.51% higher at \u20b91,29,599 per 10 gm on Friday, around \u20b92,700 away from its record high of \u20b91,32,294 per 10 gm, which it had climbed on 17 October 2025.\nAccording to the commodity market experts, the gold rate today is on an uptrend across global bourses as the probability of a 25 bps rate cut in the US Fed meeting next month has gone up to 87%. They said that falling US dollar rates and political uncertainty caused by the Donald Trump administration are also lending support to the gold price rally.\nOn why gold prices are skyrocketing, Sugandha Sachdeva, Founder of SS WealthStreet, said, \"Gold prices extended their winning streak for the fourth straight month, buoyed by rising expectations of a US Federal Reserve rate cut. Dovish commentary from several Fed officials has pushed the probability of a December cut to nearly 87%, reinforcing the bullish bias in the precious-metals complex.\"\n\"On the macro front, recent US economic data has painted a mixed picture. The labour market remains resilient, with a decline in initial jobless claims; however, consumer-driven indicators, such as retail sales and consumer confidence, have softened. Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index (PPI) revealed stable inflation, effectively opening the window for a 25bps rate cut by the Fed in the near term,\" Sugandha added.\nPointing towards US President Donald Trump's style of work weighing on the American currency, Sugandha Sachdeva said, \u201cPolitical uncertainty has also lent support to gold, especially after former President Trump announced plans to pause immigration from third-world nations and withdraw federal benefits for non-citizens, moves that have added to broader uncertainty. The weakness in the US Dollar Index, which has struggled to sustain above the 100 level, remains one of the strongest catalysts supporting gold\u2019s upward trajectory. India\u2019s import surge has added another layer of support as gold imports surged nearly 200% to a record $14.72 billion in October 2025, up from $4.92 billion a year earlier, while silver imports jumped by 528% to $2.72 billion, from $0.43 billion in October 2024.\u201d\nRegarding the domestic trigger fueling gold rates today, the SS WealthStreet expert stated, \"The domestic physical market also remains underpinned by demand from nearly 45\u201350 lakh weddings lined up between early November and mid-December 2025, a period that traditionally drives gold purchases higher.\"\nPointing towards the demand-supply equilibrium, Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Lead at VT Markets, said, \"Large jewellers and bullion dealers could benefit from the India-UAE CEPA talks, which aim to provide an auction-based quota system for gold imports from the UAE. The aim is to increase organised supply, which would help keep domestic premiums even if headline gold prices remain high.\"\nUnveiling the investment strategy for bullion investors, Ross Maxwell said, \"On the global front, gold continues to enjoy strong safe-haven demand amid geopolitical uncertainty and inflation concerns. We have seen recent volatility in gold and some dip buying opportunities, and this continues to be the safest approach, which offers the best value.\" However, he maintained that silver prices may continue to outperform the gold price rally if global demand or investor rotation accelerates.\nAdvising investors to remain vigilant about the developments in the Russia-Ukraine war, Sugandha Sachdeva said, \"Progress on the Russia\u2013Ukraine peace framework could cap extreme upside, negotiations remain complex and far from resolution, keeping geopolitical risks alive, an environment that continues to favour safe-haven assets like gold.\"\nSpeaking on the gold "

                "body": "Crude Oil Futures slip after a weak Friday close as rising Inventory, soft Oil Demand, and OPEC Production risks weigh on the broader Oil Outlook.\nLight Crude Oil Futures settled at $58.55 on Friday, a small dip that still closed out a solid week \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t enough to break the broader downtrend. November marked a fourth straight monthly loss, and traders can feel the drag. Demand is soft, supply is heavy, and the market keeps fading every bounce.\nThe supply story is still the problem. U.S. inventories jumped by 2.8 million barrels last week, far above expectations, as imports surged. Add in steady non-OPEC+ growth \u2014 roughly 1.4 million barrels per day heading into 2025 \u2014 and total supply pushing toward 105.5 million barrels per day, and buyers don\u2019t have much room to push back.\nDemand isn\u2019t helping. Growth in Q3 barely cleared 0.8 million barrels per day year-on-year, and traders say consumption just isn\u2019t behaving like a market that wants higher prices. Even with WTI logging a small weekly gain, real money hasn\u2019t shown conviction.\nOPEC+ added another 137,000 barrels per day this month \u2014 the same modest increase as October \u2014 but it lands at a tricky moment. The group is expected to pause further additions in early 2026, yet that doesn\u2019t solve today\u2019s imbalance. Most traders see the bloc as reactive rather than steering the market, especially with non-OPEC supply doing the heavy lifting.\nA Reuters poll now pegs the 2026 WTI average at $59, down from last month\u2019s estimate. Not a collapse \u2014 just a market that keeps slipping lower as expectations reset.\nThe Russia-Ukraine peace chatter knocked crude earlier in the week before talks stalled, giving prices a quick bounce. But the bigger surprise came late Friday: headlines that President Trump and Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro discussed a potential meeting. That\u2019s the kind of story that can bleed risk premium out of the barrel fast, and sellers leaned on it into the settlement. Bottom line: geopolitical rallies are fading faster \u2014 traders aren\u2019t sticking around to chase them.\nThe forward picture still leans heavy. The EIA expects inventories to rise through 2026 and sees Brent averaging just $54 in Q1. Goldman is even more bearish, arguing the market won\u2019t rebalance until 2027 as one last supply wave works through.\nThe one bright spot: rate-cut expectations. Markets now price an 87% chance of a December Fed cut, and that could help demand stabilize. But for now, buyers are selective, and sellers still have the easier trade.\nForecast: Bearish. Supply is too strong, demand too soft, and geopolitical support too unreliable for a sustained rebound.\nMore Information in our Economic Calendar.\nJames Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

                "body": "The Euro remains under pressure, nearing 1.1550 against the US Dollar ahead of the release of German inflation data. Despite losses, it is set for a 0.5% weekly gain due to a weaker US Dollar influenced by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nRecent Eurozone data presents a mixed outlook. Retail Sales fell short of predictions, while the Import Price Index exceeded expectations. The unemployment rate stayed steady with lower-than-anticipated job growth. France\u2019s GDP met forecasts, but consumer inflation remained stable contrary to expectations.\nTrading Subdued by External Factors\nTrading has been subdued due to US Thanksgiving and a technical issue at CME Group\u2019s centre affecting currency trade. The Euro is expected to gain guidance from Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel\u2019s statements later. Meanwhile, the US Dollar temporarily rises with an increase in US Treasury yields, though overall on track for its poorest weekly performance since July.\nGerman data shows retail sales declined by 0.3% against predictions of a 0.2% rise, with a year-on-year increase of 0.9%. The Import Price Index decreased by 1.4% year-on-year. In France, GDP upheld a 0.5% growth, and inflation steadied at 0.8%. German inflation is anticipated to accelerate to a 2.4% year-on-year rate for November.\nThe main event for us is the preliminary German inflation data, which will set the tone for the Euro into next week. With EUR/USD currently testing the 1.1550 support level, the market is at a pivotal point. The broader trend of a weaker US dollar is still the dominant theme, driven by strong expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut.\nWe saw US inflation continue to cool in October 2025, with the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge, hitting a two-year low of 3.5%. This has cemented market bets on policy easing, with Fed funds futures now pricing in over a 90% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in December. Consequently, any rallies in the US dollar are likely to be short-lived and seen as selling opportunities.\nMarket Reactions to Inflation Data\nThe consensus for the German year-on-year inflation figure is a slight increase to 2.4%, but we should be prepared for a surprise. We saw a similar situation back in late 2023, when a much larger-than-expected drop in inflation caught the market off guard and sent the Euro lower. Buying short-dated EUR/USD put options with a strike price near 1.1500 offers a defined-risk way to position for a repeat of that scenario.\nConversely, an inflation print that is hotter than expected would reinforce the view that the European Central Bank will hold rates for longer than the Fed. This could quickly propel the pair back toward the 1.1615 resistance level. In this case, call options targeting the October 2025 highs near 1.1670 would become an interesting play for momentum traders.\nFor now, the pair appears caught between the bearish European data and the decidedly weak outlook for the US dollar. One-week implied volatility has risen to 7.5%, reflecting the market\u2019s uncertainty ahead of the German inflation release. This suggests that traders should be cautious about taking on large, unhedged positions until the data provides a clearer direction."

But, as we\u2019ve seen this year, there\u2019s been a generally bullish response in DXY to FOMC rate meetings. And just a couple of weeks ago the odds for a December rate cut were basically a coin flip, so the heavy pricing in of another move of softness hasn\u2019t yet been able to breach that bullish structure that\u2019s built since the Fed started cutting rates now more than two months ago.\nPerhaps more to the point, even as the Fed\u2019s been cutting they\u2019ve been urging caution, calling prior moves \u2018a risk management rate cut,\u2019 and then Powell refusing to commit to another cut at the move on October 29th, which helped to spur a series of lower-lows and highs in equities.\nFrom the below chart, I\u2019ve drawn vertical lines around FOMC meetings going back to the beginning of last year, and notice how, even with the Fed in a net cutting posture, especially of late, there\u2019s been a proclivity towards USD-strength at or around those meetings. To be sure, there have been other factors to come into play to reverse those moves, such as Trump threatening to fire Jerome Powell or such as we saw in June, Michelle Bowman saying she was ready to cut rates in July which reversed a post-FOMC rally in DXY to ultimately bring on a fresh low in day one of Q3.\nUS Dollar Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nAn important factor of consideration for the US Dollar is that DXY is really just a basket of underlying currencies, so there\u2019s more than just the direct matter of US economic fundamentals. And as I\u2019ve been saying for weeks, if the USD rally is going to take-hold, it\u2019s going to need some help from other currencies, such as the Euro, with an extra push of weakness.\nIn EUR/USD, it\u2019s the 1.1500 level that looms large for that effect and as I looked at last Friday, that support hasn\u2019t yet shown signs of giving way. Bulls haven\u2019t exactly taken over at this point as the daily chart shows still bearish structure, but this sets up an important test at the 1.1656-1.1669 area, which are the lower-highs from late-October and early-November.\nIf we see that zone hold without testing, the door remains open for both USD bulls and Euro bears \u2013 but if it breaches, we have to begin considering failure in the USD rate cut rally that started in September.\nWith that said, if looking for USD-weakness, there may be a more amenable pasture elsewhere, which I\u2019ll look into next.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart: 1.1500 Support"

                "body": "EUR/USD Weekly Forecast: It is all about the December Federal Reserve decision\n- Recent US data and Federal Reserve officials\u2019 comments revive hopes of a December cut.\n- European macroeconomic data keep hinting at torturous economic progress in the Old Continent.\n- EUR/USD keeps trading within familiar levels, with a modest bearish technical tilt.\nThe EUR/USD pair held within familiar levels in the last trading day of November, settling below the 1.1600 mark. The pair had made little progress throughout the month and even clinched a fresh three-month low of 1.1468, despite broad US Dollar (USD) weakness.\nThe American currency found some footing in the first two weeks of November amid speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could refrain from cutting rates in the upcoming December meeting. However, the USD lost steam as days went by, as speculative interest slowly resumed bets on an interest rate trim.\nIt is all about the Federal Reserve\nInitial speculation on an on-hold Fed was triggered by Chairman Jerome Powell, who said a December rate cut should not be taken for granted following the October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps). However, the tide began turning after some Fed officials hinted at still room for an interest rate cut at the last meeting of the year considering the current modestly restrictive monetary policy stance. The odds for a December cut stand at roughly 85%, well above the 39% in the previous week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nMeanwhile, the United States (US) data flow continued to be irregular in the aftermath of the government shutdown. The country published September Retail Sales, which rose a modest 0.2% in the month, following a 0.6% increase in August. Also, Durable Goods Orders were up 0.5%, slightly better than the 0.3% anticipated, yet below the August reading of 3.0%. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for the same month rose by 2.7% from a year earlier, meeting expectations, while the core annual reading printed at 2.6%, slightly below the 2.7% expected. Overall, inflation at wholesale levels remained stable at non-concerning levels.\nEmployment-related figures, however, painted a different story: The ADP Employment Change 4-week average showed that the US private sector lost job positions for a third consecutive week. For the four weeks ending November 8, private employers shed an average of 13,500 jobs a week, according to the report. This is the third consecutive negative reading. On a positive note, Initial Jobless Claims increased by 216K, improving from a revised 222K in the previous week.\nFinally, Consumer Confidence plummeted in November, according to the Conference Board\u2019s monthly report. The index printed at 88.7, following the 95.5 posted in October, also missing expectations of 93.4 and the lowest reading since April.\nEuro can\u2019t find its footing\nAcross the pond, the Euro (EUR) remains among the less attractive high-yielding currencies. The EUR has been unable to attract speculative interest for quite some time as market participants lost interest once the European Central Bank (ECB) completed the monetary easing cycle and President Christine Lagarde announced the monetary stance is in a \u201cgood place.\u201d\nAdditionally, EU data remains generally unimpressive, hinting at slow economic progress. Germany released the final estimate of the Q3 Gross Domestic Product (GDP), confirming it at 0%. Also, the November IFO survey showed that the Business Climate index deteriorated to 88.1 from the previous 88.4, while Consumer Confidence in December improved slightly from -24.1 to -23.2, according to the GfK survey.\nFinally, the country reported on Friday that Retail Sales fell by 0.3% in October, worse than the 0.2% advance anticipated, while the preliminary estimate of the November Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) printed at 2.6% YoY, higher than the 2.4% anticipated and the previous 2.3%. Every month, the HICP was 0.5% down "

Dovish commentary from Fed officials and mixed US data ramped up odds for such a move by the central bank.\nNew York Fed President John Williams said on November 21 that \u201cUS interest rates could fall without putting the Fed's inflation goal at risk, while helping guard against a slide in the job market,\u201d per Reuters.\nEarlier in the week, Fed Governor Christopher Waller also favored a rate cut before the end of the year and expressed concerns about a \"still fragile\" labor market.\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also noted that \u201cthe Fed shouldn\u2019t hold off on cutting rates now out of fear it may need to reverse course later.\"\nLater in the week, the Pound Sterling recovery gained traction due to the UK Budget announcement, which eased pressures surrounding fiscal concerns and bolstered GBP/USD.\nCiting analysts, Reuters reported, \u201cfears about slow growth, weak productivity and sticky inflation are not reflective of an attractive investment backdrop.\u201d\nChancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves' budget was well received by markets despite the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) downward revision of the economic growth for 2025.\nHowever, the pair\u2019s upswing remained restricted because of the details of the Budget, entailing back-loaded tax measures.\nWeek ahead: US data to dominate\nThe week kicks off with the US ISM Manufacturing PMI on Monday.\nNext of note for markets remains the monthly ADP Employment Change report on Wednesday, followed by the US ISM Services PMI release.\nOn Thursday, the weekly Unemployment Claims will be reported ahead of the release of the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, on Friday.\nBesides the economic data, speeches from BoE policymakers and updates on the US-Ukraine discussions on the potential peace deal will also be closely followed.\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis\nThe 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) has started to turn higher but remains below the 50- and 100-day SMAs. The 50- and 100-day SMAs extend their decline, while the 200-day SMA rises; price stays below the 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs but above the 20-day. The Relative Strength Index (14) prints at 53 (neutral), signaling modest momentum recovery. Measured from the 1.3675 high to the 1.3011 low, the 38.2% retracement at 1.3264 acts as near-term resistance, with the 50% at 1.3343 above.\nBias remains uneven, with improving short-term momentum yet persistent overhead hurdles. The 20-day SMA currently stands at 1.3142 and offers nearby support, while the 200-day SMA at 1.3313 acts as dynamic resistance; the 50- and 100-day SMAs continue to slope lower. RSI holding above 50 would increase the odds of an upside extension, while a pullback would expose the 20-day SMA as the first line of defense.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool)\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom.

                "body": "During the North American session on Friday, GBP/USD dipped to 1.3220, influenced by the Autumn Budget. Despite this dip, the pair still closed the week with a near 1% gain, having hit a daily high of 1.3244.\nOn Friday, GBP/USD continued its ascent for a seventh consecutive session, hovering around 1.3240 in Asian trading hours. This rise was primarily due to the weakening of the US Dollar, amid increasing Federal Reserve rate cut expectations for December.\nImpact of the Autumn Budget\nBy Thursday, GBP/USD held steady at around 1.3230, as the market processed the UK\u2019s Autumn Budget. This stability was noted during lower trading volumes, as US markets were closed for Thanksgiving, with the rate at 1.3232 later that day.\nWe are seeing strong momentum behind the idea that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. The market is currently pricing in an 88% chance of a rate cut according to CME FedWatch Tool data, which explains the US dollar\u2019s recent weakness. This sentiment has pushed pairs like GBP/USD toward multi-month highs.\nThe British pound is benefiting from this dollar weakness, with GBP/USD holding steady above 1.3200. While US inflation has cooled to 2.8% according to the latest CPI report, UK inflation remains stickier at 3.4%, suggesting the Bank of England may hold rates for longer. This growing interest rate differential is providing a tailwind for the pound in the short term.\nFuture Market Speculations\nLooking back, the surge in gold to over $4,200 per ounce is a clear reminder of the high inflation we experienced through 2024, and traders are wary of being caught on the wrong side again. We believe buying call options on GBP/USD could be a prudent way to gain upside exposure to further dollar weakness while defining risk. This is especially relevant as the pair has broken through several key resistance levels this month.\nUpcoming data will be crucial for confirming the market\u2019s dovish view on the Fed. All eyes are on next week\u2019s Non-Farm Payrolls report, where analysts expect a modest gain of just 110,000 jobs, a significant slowdown from the averages seen earlier in the year. A weaker-than-expected number would almost certainly solidify a December rate cut.\nWith the market so heavily positioned for a cut, the biggest risk is a surprise hawkish shift from the Fed or a string of unexpectedly strong US economic data. Therefore, we should consider hedging long positions with out-of-the-money puts on currency pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD. This provides a cheap way to protect against a sudden and sharp reversal in the dollar."

Markets ramped up wagers that the Federal Reserve will begin easing in its December meeting, weighing on the US yields and denting the US dollar, which acted as a headwind for the Aussie. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a 25-bps rate cut by the Fed is now near 87%.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about day trading brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nCommodity prices and China-linked risk flows also supported this trend. Iron ore and base metal stability supported the term structure for the Aussie, while Asian equities remained resilient, maintaining a constructive risk appetite.\nOn the domestic front, Australian data remained mixed, with consumer spending showing strain, while the labor market remained comparatively resilient, leaving the RBA in a patient and data-dependent stance. The RBA\u2019s neutral tone capped the Aussie\u2019s strength. The uptick in the pair was mainly attributed to the softness of the greenback rather than Australia\u2019s domestic macroeconomic pivot.\nThe US data, including Durable Goods Orders, Chicago PMI, and Retail Sales, showed weakness, while Fed members also left dovish remarks, cementing the odds of aggressive easing in 2026 as well. Liquidity remained thin into the US Thanksgiving holiday, and the CME outage triggered intraday volatility.\nAUD/USD Key Events Next Week\nThe following week\u2019s direction depends on three variables:\n- Australian GDP\n- US data (PMIs and Core PCE) and Fed speak\n- Risk sentiment, depending on China and commodity momentum\nIn the event of a Fed surprise, moving away from easing, the AUD/USD could see a resumption of the downside. However, the path of least resistance lies on the upside.\nAUD/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Buyers Eyeing 0.6700 Above 200-DMA\nThe AUD/USD daily chart shows consistent support by the 200-day MA. However, the price remains within a broad range of 0.6400 to 0.6600. The move above 20-, 50-, and 100-day MAs suggests a solid case for the upside. Meanwhile, the RSI is also heading north at 56.00.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about crypto signals? Check our detailed guide-\nThe bulls could ultimately aim for the 0.6700 level, which is the swing high for September. Conversely, dropping down, the pair could test the 200-day MA near 0.6465. Moving below the level could test the demand zone at 0.6370-0.6420.\nLooking to trade forex now? Invest at eToro!\n67% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

                "body": "The Australian Dollar remains stable as persistent inflation tempers expectations of quick interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia. A stronger-than-forecast rise in private sector credit, which grew by 0.7% in October, suggests the RBA might stay vigilant as annual growth reaches 7.3%.\nAt the same time, the US Dollar faces pressure as markets predict further Federal Reserve rate cuts in the coming years. AUD/USD trades around 0.6535, largely unchanged, as the pair is influenced by Australia\u2019s robust economic growth, ongoing inflation, and increased expectations of US monetary easing.\nInflation in Australia\nInflation in Australia remains above the RBA\u2019s target, driving up the risk of another rate hike, although the Official Cash Rate is expected to remain at 3.6% in December. The labour market moderates but remains solid, keeping inflationary pressures persistent.\nMarket consensus expects the RBA to maintain a cautious policy approach amid ongoing domestic demand strength. The US Dollar lacks a clear direction as traders anticipate three additional rate reductions by 2026, following reports surrounding changes in Federal Reserve leadership.\nThe Australian Dollar strengthens against the Euro, while staying roughly level against other major currencies. It\u2019s a period of economic balancing as both Australian and US economies navigate inflationary pressures and monetary policy expectations.\nMonetary Policy Divergence\nGiven the divergence between central banks, we should consider strategies that benefit from a rising AUD/USD. The Reserve Bank of Australia is staying vigilant on inflation, while the Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting rates soon. This policy gap creates a fundamental tailwind for the Australian dollar against its US counterpart.\nAustralian inflation remains a key factor supporting the Aussie. The most recent Q3 2025 Consumer Price Index data showed a 3.8% year-over-year increase, staying stubbornly above the RBA\u2019s target band. This persistence, combined with strong private credit figures, makes another RBA rate hike a real possibility in early 2026, even if they hold in December.\nConversely, the US dollar is under pressure from expectations of monetary easing. The latest US Non-Farm Payrolls report for October 2025 came in softer than expected at 95,000, fueling speculation that the Fed will act to support a slowing economy. CME FedWatch Tool probabilities now show a greater than 70% chance of a rate cut at the December FOMC meeting.\nWith this backdrop, we should look at buying AUD/USD call options or implementing bull call spreads. This allows us to profit from a potential upward move while defining our risk, which is prudent as the pair is currently consolidating around 0.6535. These positions would benefit directly if the RBA maintains its hawkish tone while the Fed confirms its dovish pivot.\nLooking back, we saw a similar divergence in 2023 when the RBA paused its hiking cycle before the Fed, which led to AUD/USD weakness. The current situation appears to be the reverse, where Fed easing is front-running any RBA action, providing a historical template for potential Aussie strength. For now, the pair holding steady suggests implied volatility may be relatively low, presenting an opportunity to enter these positions at a reasonable cost ahead of the upcoming central bank meetings."

                "body": "AUD/USD holds steady as Australian inflation persists, US Dollar weakens\n- The Australian Dollar remains firm as hotter inflation continues to push back expectations of rapid RBA easing.\n- Australian private sector credit beats forecasts, reinforcing the prospect of a vigilant Reserve Bank of Australia.\n- The US Dollar stays under pressure as markets price in additional Federal Reserve rate cuts in the coming years.\nAUD/USD trades around 0.6535 on Friday at the time of writing, virtually unchanged on the day. Despite several attempts to extend its recent rebound, the Australian Dollar (AUD) struggles to maintain upward momentum, even as stronger-than-expected inflation continues to delay expectations of Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) easing and revives the risk of another rate hike.\nThe AUD benefited earlier in the week from hotter inflation data showing consumer prices rising for a fourth consecutive month and now sitting above the RBA\u2019s 2%-3% target band. Markets still expect the central bank to leave the Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 3.6% in December, but the risk of additional tightening remains elevated given persistent price pressures. RBA officials stress that, while the labor market is moderating slightly, it remains fundamentally solid, keeping upward pressure on inflation.\nThe cautious policy tone is reinforced by Friday\u2019s data. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, Private Sector Credit rose 0.7% MoM in October, beating expectations of 0.6% and lifting annual growth to 7.3%, signaling still-resilient domestic demand.\nAt the same time, AUD/USD draws moderate support from a softer US Dollar (USD). The Greenback lacks clear direction as markets increasingly price in Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts starting in December. Traders now anticipate three additional rate reductions by 2026, following reports that Kevin Hassett, the White House National Economic Council Director, is the leading candidate for the next Fed chair, a profile seen as aligned with US President Donald Trump\u2019s preference for lower interest rates.\nAgainst this backdrop, AUD/USD remains driven by a delicate balance between Australia\u2019s resilient economic momentum, persistent inflation, and mounting expectations of US monetary easing. For now, the pair holds steady around 0.6535, as markets wait for the next signals from both the Fed and the RBA.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

With month-end flows out of the way, attention turns to a heavy calendar: U.S. PMIs, labor indicators, and core PCE on one side, and Ueda\u2019s speech, household spending, and JGB auctions on the other. Add in a technical backdrop that\u2019s softened from overbought conditions, and the stage is set for volatility as December begins.\nAssessing U.S. Event Risk\nEven though USD/JPY has not shown a meaningful relationship with traditional drivers such as rate differentials, risk appetite, or volatility measures recently, history suggests that disconnect will not last for long, especially with the calendar turn removing factors like month-end window dressing. That puts continued emphasis on factors that could impact those drivers, including known risk events on the calendar.\nSource: TradingView (U.S. Eastern Time)\nOn the U.S. side, manufacturing and services PMIs released Monday and Wednesday look particularly important, as does the next swathe of labor market indicators such as Challenger layoffs and jobless claims on Thursday, given continued concern from Fed officials about downside risks for the economy and labor market. Incomes and consumption data out Friday will also receive plenty of attention, along with the core PCE deflator, the Fed\u2019s preferred underlying inflation measure. These figures may be delayed for September, but recent patterns suggest delayed data can still spark volatility.\nSource: TradingView\nAs things stand, traders are pricing around 88 basis points of cuts from the Fed through the end of 2026, with any meaningful shift in that total likely to influence the performance of the U.S. dollar. While it doesn\u2019t show up in correlation analysis against USD/JPY, the latest pullback in the U.S. dollar index corresponds with a slight uptick in dovish pricing.\nWhile Jerome Powell and Michelle Bowman are scheduled to speak during the week, the nature of their appearances does not point to discussion regarding the monetary policy outlook, meaning it will likely be left to the data to influence rate pricing over the coming days.\nUeda Speech Eyed\nSource: TradingView (U.S. Eastern Time)\nTurning to Japan, the calendar is arguably even more important for USD/JPY direction, with a key speech from BOJ Governor Ueda on Monday, household spending data out Friday, and 10 and 30-year Japanese government bond (JGB) auctions slotted in between.\nSource: Bloomberg\nFollowing a hotter-than-expected Tokyo inflation print last Friday, traders see the risk of a 25-basis-point hike from the BOJ in December as more probable than not, so Ueda\u2019s speech looms as particularly important should he choose to endorse or push back against that pricing.\nSource: TradingView\nWith JGB yields failing to retrace much of the gains seen in early November over the past week, demand signals from the latest round of debt auctions will be closely scrutinised, especially as there has been a relatively strong relationship between longer-dated Japanese yields and USD/JPY until the past few days, hinting that unease over Japan\u2019s fiscal outlook has been a major influence behind the yen\u2019s recent weakness.\nUSD/JPY neutral bias favoured\nSource: TradingView\nFrom a technical standpoint, USD/JPY looks heavy on the charts, trading through the October uptrend on Friday with indicators such as RSI (14) and MACD rolling over from overbought conditions, signaling waning upside strength. While the latest pullback resembles a bull flag pattern, pointing to the risk of an eventual resumption of the bullish trend, the overall assessment favors a neutral bias as we enter D"

Hopes of BoJ tightening are supporting the Yen, though investors\u2019 concerns about Japanese PM Takaichi\u2019s fiscal largesse are limiting upside attempts.\nJapanese data released on Thursday revealed that the advanced Tokyo Consumer Prices Index (CPI) grew at a steady 2.7% year-on-year pace in November, while the core CPI remained steady at a 2.8% yearly rate, against expectations of a moderation to 2.7%.\nApart from that, Japanese Retail Trade jumped 1.7% year-on-year in October, more than twice the 0.8% market consensus, and following a downwardly revised 0.2% gain in September. In a similar line, Industrial Production rose 1.4% against expectations of a 0.6% decline.\nBoJ-Fed monetary divergence supports the Yen\nThese figures endorse the theory that the Bank of Japan will hike interest rates by 25 basis points in December or January at the latest, which has been providing support to the Japanese Yen through the current week.\nInvestors, however, remain concerned about the country\u2019s increasing government debt, which is acting as a headwind for the Yen. Japan\u2019s Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, approved a 21.3 Trillion Yen (USD 136 billion) stimulus package last week, aimed to help households cope with the higher inflationary pressures, which sent the Yen lower across the board.\nIn the US, dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials and downbeat US Retail Sales figures released earlier this week have boosted hopes of a quarter-point Fed rate cut in December. Furthermore, rumours that the White House\u2019s National Economic Council (NEC) Director, Kevin Hassett, is the best positioned to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell in May are feeding hopes of further rate cuts down the road, and keeping the US Dollar rallies subdued.\nEconomic Indicator\nTokyo Consumer Price Index (YoY)\nThe Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Statistics Bureau of Japan on a monthly basis, measures the price fluctuation of goods and services purchased by households in the Tokyo region.

                "body": "USD/JPY Struggles Above 156.00 As Fed Easing Bets Collide With BoJ Hawkish Signals\nThe USD/JPY pair trades just above 156.00 after retreating from last week\u2019s 158.00 highs. The yen gained momentum amid strong Tokyo CPI data, rising retail trade, and accelerating industrial production. Tokyo\u2019s headline CPI increased 2.7% year-on-year in November, with the core reading stable at 2.8%, defying expectations of a decline. Japanese retail trade surged 1.7% versus the forecasted 0.8%, while industrial production rose 1.4%, sharply outperforming expectations of a -0.6% drop. These figures have revived speculation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may raise rates by 25 basis points in December or early 2026, which has strengthened the yen against the dollar.\nFed Dovish Shift Pressures the Dollar as Rate-Cut Odds Hit 86.9%\nThe U.S. dollar remains subdued as traders price in aggressive easing from the Federal Reserve. The CME FedWatch tool now assigns an 86.9% probability of a rate cut on December 11, with the federal funds rate expected to fall to 3.75%. U.S. core PPI rose just 0.1% in the latest reading versus expectations of 0.2%, and retail sales came in at 0.2%, missing the forecasted 0.4%. Treasury yields fell back below 4.00% on the 10-year, driving the DXY Index down from the 100 area to around 99.20. The narrowing yield differential between Japan and the U.S. continues to fuel yen demand and reduce dollar inflows.\nBoJ Fiscal Tensions Limit Yen Gains Despite Hawkish CPI Data\nWhile inflation pressures justify tightening, Japan\u2019s fiscal imbalances remain a concern. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi recently approved a \u00a521.3 trillion ($136 billion) stimulus program, adding to record national debt. This expansionary stance limits the BoJ\u2019s room for policy tightening, tempering yen gains. At the same time, long-term Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields have surged to two-decade highs, signaling market stress around funding costs. However, BoJ board member Asahi Noguchi stated that monetary tightening would proceed gradually, reinforcing expectations for a slow normalization path rather than a rapid series of hikes.\nTechnical Outlook: USD/JPY Consolidates, Key Levels at 155.00 and 158.20\nThe USD/JPY pair continues to consolidate within a narrow band between 155.00 and 158.20. On the daily chart, RSI has eased from overbought conditions above 70 to near-neutral levels, reflecting reduced momentum. The MACD histogram remains flat around zero, suggesting indecision. Resistance is firm at 158.20, marking the yearly high and major bullish barrier for 2025. A breakout above this level could reestablish the long-term uptrend toward 160.00. On the downside, immediate support lies at 156.00, with deeper levels at 155.00 and 153.30, aligned with the 50-day moving average. A sustained break below 155.00 would mark the end of the October rally and potentially trigger a reversal toward the mid-150 range.\nMarket Sentiment and Policy Divergence: The Tension Builds\nMarket behavior shows a growing divergence between U.S. dovishness and Japan\u2019s cautious hawkish turn. Traders are now reassessing positions ahead of the Fed\u2019s blackout period, with volatility expected to spike as both central banks move in opposite directions. Risk sentiment remains mixed: optimism around a Russia\u2013Ukraine peace proposal and weaker U.S. data have supported equities but weighed on the dollar\u2019s defensive appeal. Meanwhile, speculation about a dovish successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell has deepened the bearish bias on the greenback.\nTradingNews.com Verdict\nThe USD/JPY structure has shifted from a one-sided rally to a corrective consolidation. Strong Japanese macro data, firm inflation, and rising rate expectations are likely to keep the yen supported near-term, while Fed-driven rate-cut expectations weaken the dollar. However, Japan\u2019s heavy fiscal expansion and structural debt risk limit long-term yen strength. The pair\u2019s path into December will depend on whether the BoJ confirms a hi"

                "body": "A stronger-than-expected GDP report, firmer oil prices, and weaker Fed-cut expectations in the US gave the loonie its best week since May and trimmed bets on more Bank of Canada easing.\nabout 11 hours ago \u2022 2 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nCanada\u2019s dollar just logged its best week since May, after surprisingly strong economic growth and firmer oil prices pushed the loonie to around 1.398 per US dollar.\nWhat does this mean?\nFresh data showed Canada\u2019s economy grew at a 2.6% annualized pace in the third quarter, miles ahead of the 0.5% economists were expecting. That upside surprise came mostly from crude oil exports and government spending, even as business investment and household consumption stayed soft. The news has traders rethinking how far the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates next year: markets now see the policy rate bottoming around 2.15% by July, only a touch below today\u2019s 2.25%, which is already a three-year low. Higher expected rates tend to support a currency, and strategists at TD Securities argue the loonie still looks cheap when it trades weaker than 1.40 per US dollar. At the same time, the US dollar has slipped as investors bet on a December rate cut from the Federal Reserve, adding an extra tailwind for Canada\u2019s currency.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A sturdier loonie reshapes the playbook.\nThe Canadian dollar\u2019s roughly 0.9% weekly climb, helped by oil\u2019s 1.5% rise to about $59.50 a barrel, is a reminder that this currency still dances to the tunes of commodities and rate expectations. Canadian government bond yields ticked higher across the curve, with the 10-year around 3.15%, clawing back part of a recent slide as traders dialed back hopes for deep, fast cuts. If TD Securities is right that the loonie is undervalued when it\u2019s weaker than 1.40 per US dollar, any extra dose of steady growth or trade clarity could tug it closer to fair value on their models. One key wild card is the 2026 joint review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which helps shield a hefty chunk of Canadian exports from US tariffs and underpins confidence in the country\u2019s longer-term trade story.\nThe bigger picture: Growth, trade, and rates are tightening the links.\nCanada\u2019s latest GDP surprise shows how an export-heavy economy can still chalk up solid headline growth even when households and businesses are watching their wallets. It also shines a light on a widening policy gap with the US: markets see the Federal Reserve kicking off rate cuts as soon as December, while the Bank of Canada may now tread more gingerly. That kind of divergence can chip away at the US dollar and support currencies like the loonie, especially when energy prices are underpinned by geopolitical tensions. Looking ahead to 2026, the scheduled USMCA review could turn into a major macro moment for North America, with any tweak to tariff protections likely to ripple through growth, corporate investment, and currency valuations across the region.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nInsight\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 10 hours ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 18 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 8 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "USD/CAD extends losing streak as Canada\u2019s Q3 GDP rebound boosts the Loonie\n- USD/CAD extends its decline for a fourth straight day as Canada\u2019s Q3 GDP rebound supports the Loonie.\n- Markets expect the BoC to hold rates in December, while the Fed is seen leaning toward a 25 bps cut next month.\n- Widening policy divergence keeps the US Dollar under pressure, maintaining a bearish bias for USD/CAD.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) strengthens against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday as traders respond to Canada\u2019s Q3 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rebound. At the time of writing, USD/CAD is trading around 1.3984, extending losses for a fourth consecutive day as broad Greenback weakness keeps the pair under sustained downside pressure.\nStatistics Canada reported that the economy expanded modestly in Q3, with September GDP rising 0.2% MoM, in line with expectations, after August was revised to -0.1% from -0.3%. Real GDP increased 0.6% in the third quarter, reversing the previous quarter\u2019s -0.5% contraction, while the annualized growth rate accelerated to 2.6%, well above the 0.5% consensus and a sharp improvement from -1.8% in Q2.\nThe details of the report showed that Canada\u2019s Q3 rebound was driven mainly by trade, with exports rising 0.2% while imports fell 2.2%, providing a strong positive lift to growth. Domestic demand weakened as household consumption declined, as vehicle purchases fell 2.3%, and government spending dropped 0.4%.\nLooking ahead, the GDP figures are unlikely to significantly alter expectations for the Bank of Canada\u2019s (BoC) December 10 interest rate decision. At its October meeting, the BoC cut its policy rate by 25 bps to 2.25% and signaled that this move could mark the end of the easing cycle, noting that the current level is \u201cabout right\u201d as long as inflation and economic activity evolve in line with its projections.\nIn contrast, traders are increasingly pricing in a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut next month, following dovish-leaning remarks from key policymakers earlier in the week. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are now assigning roughly an 85% probability to a 25 bps rate cut at the December 9-10 meeting.\nOverall, with the BoC expected to hold rates steady in December while the Fed appears poised to ease, the US Dollar is likely to stay on the back foot, keeping the broader tone for USD/CAD tilted lower.\nBank of Canada FAQs\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC), based in Ottawa, is the institution that sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for Canada. It does so at eight scheduled meetings a year and ad hoc emergency meetings that are held as required. The BoC primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at between 1-3%. Its main tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Canadian Dollar (CAD) and vice versa. Other tools used include quantitative easing and tightening.\nIn extreme situations, the Bank of Canada can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the BoC prints Canadian Dollars for the purpose of buying assets \u2013 usually government or corporate bonds \u2013 from financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker CAD. QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The Bank of Canada used the measure during the Great Financial Crisis of 2009-11 when credit froze after banks lost faith in each other\u2019s ability to repay debts.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the Bank of Canada purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the BoC stops buying more assets, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Canadian Dollar.\nAuthor\nVishal Chatur"

                "body": "The Canadian Dollar has shown resilience this week, experiencing a slight 0.1% drop against the US Dollar while performing well against other G10 currencies, except the Japanese Yen. Scotiabank\u2019s Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, report a 0.5% gain for the CAD, bolstered by fundamentals and a narrowing interest rate differential due to expected US Federal Reserve easing.\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s outlook remains neutral, with minimal policy changes anticipated through October 2026. This week\u2019s federal energy plan announcement has had little impact on the market amid the introduction of new tariffs on steel products. The USD/CAD fair value estimate stands at 1.3915, witnessing a slight decrease within the recent range.\nPrice Activity and Resistance Levels\nPrice activity has pointed to resistance around 1.4100, and attention now turns to downside risk with the focus on the 50-day moving average at 1.4005. The RSI has shifted back to neutral at 50, suggesting the chance of entering bearish territory. Expectations are for a near-term range between 1.3980 and 1.4080, with a neutral stance maintained unless the 50-day moving average is broken.\nThe Canadian dollar is strengthening against the US dollar because traders expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates. In contrast, the Bank of Canada is seen holding its policy steady for the foreseeable future, well into 2026. This policy difference makes holding Canadian dollars more attractive.\nSupporting this view, Canada\u2019s latest October inflation data, released last week, came in at a stable 2.1%, giving the Bank of Canada no reason to change course. Meanwhile, the most recent U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report showed job growth slowing more than expected, reinforcing the case for future Fed easing. The steady price of WTI crude oil around $85 a barrel also provides a solid foundation for the loonie.\nUpcoming Market Trends\nFor the coming weeks, we see the USD/CAD pair likely staying within a tight range, defined by strong resistance near 1.4100 and support around 1.3980. This environment is ideal for options strategies that profit from low volatility, such as selling strangles or setting up iron condors. The goal is to collect premium as the pair moves sideways.\nHowever, we must watch the 50-day moving average at 1.4005 as a critical pivot point. A clean break below this level would signal a shift from a range-bound market to a new downtrend. Should this happen, traders should be prepared to close neutral positions and consider buying puts on USD/CAD to capitalize on a stronger Canadian dollar.\nThis situation is reminiscent of what we observed back in late 2023, when expectations of a Fed pivot first emerged and caused a significant narrowing of interest rate differentials. That period led to broad U.S. dollar weakness against currencies with more stable central bank outlooks. We may be entering a similar phase as we head towards the end of the year."

                "body": "The GBP/JPY retreats slightly after reaching a new YTD peak, with no continuation of the trend due to intervention concerns and expectations of a Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate adjustment. This impacts the GBP/JPY\u2019s upward momentum, though the end of the UK budget uncertainty offers some support to the cross, countering predictions of a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut.\nDespite an uptick in the Asian session to 207.20, the GBP/JPY turns lower for the second consecutive day on Friday. The downward movement lacks conviction as spot prices remain above the mid-206.00s, positioning the cross for strong weekly gains.\nBoJ Inflation and Intervention\nTokyo\u2019s recent inflation data indicates persistent inflation, validating BoJ\u2019s hawkish stance with potential rate hikes next month. Market speculation about Japanese authorities intervening to manage domestic currency depreciation supports the JPY, acting as a barrier to GBP/JPY gains.\nThe GBP struggles to gain traction due to the US Dollar\u2019s recovery and BoE rate cut predictions contrasting with BoJ expectations. UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves noted beating the growth forecast this year, with the OBR upgrading future economic projections, potentially deterring GBP bears despite Japan\u2019s challenging fiscal position.\nToday\u2019s currency table shows the Japanese Yen strengthening against significant currencies, notably outperforming the New Zealand Dollar.\nWe are seeing the GBP/JPY cross hover near its highest level since mid-2024, but the path forward is clouded by conflicting central bank signals. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) appears ready to hike rates, while the Bank of England (BoE) is leaning towards a cut. This policy divergence is creating a tense standoff in the market.\nStrategies for Volatile Movements\nThe potential for a BoJ rate hike next month should not be underestimated, as overnight index swaps are now pricing in a 75% probability of a move. We remember the sharp yen appreciation following Ministry of Finance interventions back in 2022, and with the cross testing these upper limits, the risk of a similar sudden move is increasing. This makes holding long spot positions near 207.00 particularly risky.\nOn the other hand, the British pound has a solid floor of support, limiting the downside for now. The uncertainty around the UK budget has been resolved, and the latest monthly GDP figures showed a modest 0.2% expansion for October. This stability suggests that while a pullback is possible, a complete collapse of the pair is unlikely.\nGiven the high probability of a significant move but uncertainty on the direction, traders should consider volatility strategies. A long straddle, involving buying both a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiry, could be effective. This position profits if GBP/JPY makes a sharp move either up or down in the coming weeks.\nFor those leaning bearishly due to BoJ hawkishness, buying put options offers a defined-risk way to position for a downturn. This allows traders to capitalize on a potential strengthening of the yen without the unlimited risk of shorting the pair directly. This is a prudent way to bet on a reversal from the year-to-date highs."

The measure that excludes both food and energy increased 2.8% YoY in November, unchanged from the 2.8% pace recorded in October.\nTokyo CPI excluding fresh food rose 2.8% YoY in November, coming in above the 2.7% forecast and matching the 2.8% reading in October.\nThe data underscored sticky price pressures holding well above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. After weeks of fading conviction in a near-term hike, traders are now reassessing the possibility that the central bank could raise rates at the December 18-19 policy meeting.\nThe ongoing weakness of the Yen is also in focus, with markets increasingly viewing currency depreciation as a factor that may push policymakers toward tightening as they monitor exchange-rate-driven inflation risks.\nJapan\u2019s economic calendar also featured labour-market and consumption indicators. The Unemployment Rate stood at 2.6% in October, slightly above the 2.5% forecast and unchanged from September. Retail Trade rose 1.7% YoY in October, beating the 0.8% forecast and picking up from the 0.2% increase seen in September.\nOn the UK side, the session remains light on major data releases, but recent weeks have seen expectations build that the Bank of England (BoE) could move toward a rate cut in December. The shift has been driven by softer inflation momentum, with BoE policymaker Megan Greene saying on Thursday that the latest inflation news has been \u201cto the downside.\u201d\nGreene also noted that most policy rules suggest keeping rates steady, while acknowledging that slack has opened up in both the labour market and the broader economy.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair experienced minimal movement as traders reacted to Tokyo\u2019s latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Tokyo\u2019s CPI remained above 2%, suggesting a potential Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike in December. The Japanese Yen faced pressure due to fiscal worries after the approval of a large stimulus package.\nThe GBP maintained its position against the JPY, with the pair trading around 206.70. This comes as the JPY continues to weaken amid fiscal concerns, leading to its third consecutive weekly decline. In November, Tokyo\u2019s headline CPI increased by 2.7% year-on-year, matching forecasts but slowing from the 2.8% in October. Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 2.8%, consistent with the previous month.\nPersistent Price Pressures\nNovember\u2019s CPI data showed persistent price pressures above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. Traders are re-evaluating the chance of a December rate hike by the BoJ. The ongoing weakness of the Yen is under scrutiny, with its depreciation viewed as a factor in BoJ\u2019s potential monetary tightening.\nJapan\u2019s unemployment rate in October was 2.6%, marginally above forecasts. Retail trade saw a 1.7% year-on-year increase, outperforming expectations. In the UK, expectations of a possible December rate cut by the Bank of England are growing amid softer inflation trends.\nGiven the persistent Tokyo inflation above 2%, we see a growing divergence between the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England. The GBP/JPY cross is trading high near 206.70, reflecting a policy gap that may be about to narrow. This presents a key opportunity for traders who believe this trend is reaching its peak.\nThe data supports a more hawkish Bank of Japan, which is a significant shift from what we saw over the last few years. With Tokyo\u2019s core inflation holding at 2.8%, a rate hike at the December meeting is now a real possibility, which would build on the cautious steps taken since policy normalization began back in 2024. This contrasts sharply with the UK, where inflation has softened to around 2.2%, prompting Bank of England officials to talk more openly about rate cuts from the current 4.75%.\nOpportunistic Trading Strategies\nFor derivative traders, this suggests it\u2019s time to position for a potential reversal or at least a pause in the GBP/JPY uptrend. Buying put options on GBP/JPY with January 2026 expiries could be a prudent way to gain downside exposure. This strategy offers a defined risk, limited to the premium paid, while providing significant upside if the BoJ hikes and the BoE cuts as anticipated.\nWe should also pay attention to implied volatility, which has been relatively subdued despite the fundamental shift. Looking back at the volatility spikes during events like the 2022 UK mini-budget crisis reminds us how quickly this pair can move. Securing options pricing now, before a potential policy shock, could prove advantageous.\nAn alternative strategy for those less convinced of a sharp drop is to sell call spreads with a ceiling around the 208.00 level. This position profits if GBP/JPY trades sideways or moves moderately lower, allowing us to collect premium. It\u2019s a lower-cost way to express the view that the rally is running out of steam."

IBIT reached that mark \u201c5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days,\u201d Balchunas wrote on X, referring to asset manager State Street\u2019s famous gold ETF.\nWhile other asset managers like Fidelity and VanEck also offer Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock\u2019s version is the largest by far. After IBIT\u2019s $70 billion in total assets, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC comes in second with $20 billion and Grayscale\u2019s GBTC comes in third with just under $20 billion.\nETFs are a type of investment vehicle, traded on the stock market, that track the price of one or more underlying assets. The fees ETF issuers charge are usually less than mutual funds and offer a simple way to diversify an investment portfolio. Before the introduction of crypto ETFs last year, Invesco\u2019s QQQ trust ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq, and Vanguard\u2019s VOO ETF, which tracks the S&P 500, were among the most popular.\nIBIT and 10 other Bitcoin ETFs from various companies launched at the beginning of last year after gaining long-awaited regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The debut of the first Bitcoin ETFs showcased strong investor demand for access to the cryptocurrency\u2019s price movements, with IBIT accumulating over $1 billion in assets under management within its first four days on the market.\nAdvertisement\nBy November, BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF had surpassed its gold fund in total assets, becoming the largest of the 1,400 funds the asset manager offers globally.\nBut the record-breaking did not slow down after that. In December, IBIT became the fastest ETF to hit $50 billion in assets under management, five times quicker than BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF which took nearly four years and invests in companies outside of the U.S. and Canada, according to Balchunas.\n\u201cIBIT\u2019s growth is unprecedented,\u201d Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart told the outlet at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class.\u201d\nSince their launch last January, increased flows into Bitcoin ETFs have coincided with increases in the currency\u2019s price. For example, as Bitcoin hit an all-time of $111,900 in late May, the total net assets across all 12 Bitcoin ETFs reached an all-time high of over $134 billion.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

It \u201cpoints to substantial needs for hedging, risk management, and more sophisticated strategy construction,\u201d he said.\nThis marks Nasdaq\u2019s second request to expand IBIT\u2019s daily contract limit. In January, shortly after options on the ETF were approved, the exchange moved to increase the ceiling tenfold to 250,000 as activity quickly accelerated. The SEC approved that request in July.\nIBIT, by far the largest Bitcoin ETF with about $70 billion in assets, has become a crucial vehicle for crypto options trading since contracts were first listed. Open interest in IBIT options surged to more than $50 billion at its peak in October, rivaling that on Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange."

From tokenized bonds and money market funds to institutional liquidity rails, the world\u2019s capital is beginning to migrate to an ecosystem where transactions are programmable, auditable, and borderless.\nWhy Is Ethereum Chosen As The Default Choice For Global Rails\nThe global capital markets are moving on-chain to Ethereum because it is credibly neutral. ETH has never experienced downtime, and it possesses the economic security necessary to support the world\u2019s financial system. Investor and founder of GM42NFT, Captain GM, has stated that ETH is not fast enough to support trading because it wasn\u2019t built for it.\nHowever, the attempts to build a genuinely fast on-chain trading environment have consistently led teams to centralize significant parts of the trading system. This move creates security, reliability, and neutrality concerns for a system designed to be global. These compromises are in direct conflict with the very benefits that ETH provides, and make it the chosen blockchain for global finance.\nThis is where Raya Network steps in to solve these issues at the core. Raya is delivering a decentralized exchange (DEX) with institutional-grade execution speed and Ethereum-level security. It\u2019s a platform that is as fast as TradFi and remains simultaneously secure, reliable, and credibly neutral as exactly DeFi should be. \u201cFast is easy, decentralized is hard, and it\u2019s only Reya that does both,\u201d Captain GM noted.\nAnalyst Alucard mentioned that the Raya network has become one of the few projects that genuinely solves the speed and security problem. The sub-millisecond execution speeds, trades are fully verified on ETH, and there\u2019s no dependence on a single sequencer. This is an engineered combination designed for real progress in the space.\nHowever, over 45% of the token supply is allocated to the community. Reya, combined with the ETH buyback mechanism, creates an ecosystem that\u2019s aligned both technically and economically. They\u2019re building something fast and secure, and because of that, Reya sits in a different category.\nWhy Reya\u2019s Design Feels More Like A New Standard Than Another DEX\nA trader and ambassador of Somnia, Onur, has also explained that his experience with Reya feels like a full redesign of on-chain execution rather than a small improvement. It offers sub-millisecond fills, unified margin, Ethereum security with ZK settlement, and smooth flow through EigenDA.\nAccording to Onur, the peer-to-pool model keeps trades consistent, efficient, and free from bottlenecks or hidden edges. As a result of this approach, Reya isn\u2019t just another venue anymore, and it\u2019s actively becoming the new execution standard for DeFi.\nHere\u2019s Why Ethereum Emerges As The Global Capital Rails For On-Chain Finance\nShare:\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of digital finance, Ethereum is quickly establishing itself as the primary infrastructure for global on-chain capital markets.

Although both Bitcoin and Ethereum are still trading beneath major resistance points, there are four key developments that many investors have missed, each shaping the outlook for those with a long-term perspective.\nEthereum (ETH) has managed to stay above the $2,900 mark, even as the broader market faced headwinds. On November 24, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs saw a net inflow of $96.67 million, with BlackRock\u2019s fund accounting for $92.6 million\u2014its first positive inflow in two weeks after a stretch of eight consecutive outflow days. Large holders, such as BitMine, have demonstrated renewed optimism by acquiring 69,822 ETH (worth over $200 million), bringing their total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, or about 3% of the entire supply. Notably, while BitMine increased its stake, smaller whale groups were distributing their assets during this period.\nGrayscale\u2019s introduction of its spot Dogecoin Trust ETF (GDOG) on NYSE Arca has brought a new level of credibility to the meme coin space, allowing investors to gain exposure without the need for personal crypto wallets. This move follows the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2025, reflecting Wall Street\u2019s growing willingness to treat digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles, despite ongoing price swings.\nBitcoin Munari (BTCM), a new digital asset with a capped supply of 21 million, has launched its phased rollout on the Solana blockchain. The project\u2019s fixed-supply approach has attracted investor interest, positioning BTCM as a potential safeguard against market volatility. This comes at a time when Bitcoin\u2019s price has mirrored the performance of tech stocks, experiencing a 30% decline from its peak in tandem with drops in the Nasdaq and gold\u2014suggesting liquidity-driven moves rather than fundamental issues.\nDespite recent price fluctuations, major investors are increasing their Ethereum holdings. BitMine\u2019s \u201cAlchemy of 5%\u201d initiative aims to accumulate 6 million ETH, representing 5% of the total supply, through a combination of equity fundraising and staking rewards. Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee, a well-known crypto optimist, attributes the recent downturn to tighter monetary policy and predicts a recovery to $7,500 by year-end, citing the tokenization of real-world assets and the integration of artificial intelligence as key growth drivers.\nThese emerging trends signal a shift in the crypto landscape\u2014from speculative trading to greater institutional involvement. While market corrections are still part of the journey, the rise of regulated investment products, increased whale accumulation, and innovative projects like Bitcoin Munari are helping to strengthen the sector\u2019s foundation. Investors are now watching Ethereum\u2019s $3,000 resistance level and the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming rate decision in December, which could spark a relief rally if interest rate cuts are announced."

                "body": "Wall Street edges higher on Friday, pushing S&P 500 close to its record high\nStocks gained in a short Friday session to close near a record high, capping a five-day rally that helped the S&P 500 index erase nearly all its losses from earlier in the month.\nThe S&P 500 rose 36 points, or 0.5%, to close at 6,849, 42 points shy of its Oct. 28 record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 289 points, or 0.6%, to close at 47,716. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% on Friday but ended November with a decline of 1.5% because of losses for some big tech stocks.\nStock indexes closed at 1 p.m. EDT on Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday.\nThe multi-day rebound came after a largely volatile month for stocks, sparked by concerns about a possible bubble in artificial intelligence and tech stocks. AI chipmaker Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle tumbled 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.\n\"The market needs to prove it can sustain this momentum, but right now, the weakness after Nvidia's earnings looks like it could be more of a short-term AI-selling climax than a sign of heightened bearishness,\" Chris Larkin, Managing Director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, said in an email.\nSome investors have expressed worry that an AI bubble could burst, triggering devastating financial losses. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals.\nSome tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, due to excitement about its recently released Gemini AI model.\nThe market turned around on hopes that the Federal Reserve would again cut interest rates at its meeting next month. Recent comments from Fed officials have given traders more confidence that the central bank will again cut interest rates at its meeting that ends Dec. 10.\nTraders are betting on a nearly 87% probability that the Fed will cut next month, according to data from CME Group.\nThe central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.\nThe minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting in October indicate there are likely to be strong divisions among policymakers about the Fed's next step.\nInvestors also had their eye on retail stocks as they wait to see if shoppers rushed to take advantage of the annual Black Friday sales event. Macy's fell 0.3% while Kohl's gained 1.4%. Dick's Sporting Goods dropped 0.5%. Among specialty retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch rose 2.9% and American Eagle Outfitters gained 0.7%.\nAmid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.\nEarlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.\nTreasury yields rose slightly, with the 10-year yield at 4.02%."

The earlier CME outage has been rectified.\nWhile November is typically a seasonally strong month, that hasn't been the case this November, as investors fretted over an AI bubble and rapid repricing of expectations for Fed rate cuts.\nDecember Fed rate-cut expectations dropped below 30% mid-month. However, weaker-than-expected data and dovish Fed commentary have boosted rate cut expectations, lifting US stocks sharply. The market is now pricing in an 85% probability of a December rate reduction.\nMeanwhile, tech stocks have recovered this week, with the Nasdaq outperforming the Dow Jones as AI fears calmed.\nAttention will now turn to the coming week, when a slew of US data is released, which could help drive rate-cut expectations. While the non-farm payroll will not be released, US core PCE, ADP payrolls, and Challenger cuts will provide clues over how inflation and the US jobs market are holding up.\nCorporate news\nRetailers such as Macy's, Best Buy, Walmart, and Costco are in focus and are set to open marginally higher at the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.\nGold miners will be in focus as the precious metal pushes higher and is on track to rise for a fourth straight month in November, on optimism surrounding a December rate cut.\nCME is trading marginally lower after saying markets were halted due to a cooling issue at one of its data centres, which disrupted futures trading under options markets.\nDow Jones forecast \u2013 technical analysis.\nThe Dow faced rejection at the record high of 48,425 before falling sharply lower to 45,700. From here, the price has recovered to 47,580 at the time of writing. Buyers, supported by the RSI will look to extend gains towards 48k and 48,425 and fresh record highs. Immediate support is around 47k. A break below here opens the door to support at 45,700, the November low. A break below this level creates a lower low.\nFX markets \u2013 USD rises, GBP/USD rises\nThe U.S. dollar is edging higher but is still on track to fall across the week in its worst weekly performance since mid-October. The dollar has fallen amid rising Fed rate cut expectations\nEUR/USD is falling amid USD strength and following German CPI that unexpectedly remained unchanged at 2.3% YoY, defying expectations of a rise to 2.4%. The minutes to the ECB meeting indicate that the central bank has ended its rate-cutting cycle. This data supports that view.\nGBP/USD is falling amid a slightly stronger USD but is set to rise across the week, marking its Strongest weekly performance in over three months, as investors show their relief after the Chancellor\u2019s long-awaited Budget this week. Raxhel Reeve\u2019s doubled her headroom to $22 billion, but the tax burden will rise to 38% of GDP.\nOil rises across the week but falls for a fourth month\nOil prices are rising for a third straight session and are on track to book gains of 2% across the week. However, oil prices are falling for a fourth straight month, down 15% since the start of August.\nOil prices have fallen amid rising expectations of a supply glut, as OPEC+ increased output and producers outside the group also ramped up production.\nMeanwhile, attention is also on developments surrounding a Russian-Ukrainian peace agreement. There appear to be some signs of support from both sides. Should an agreement be achieved, sanctions on Russian oil could be removed, increasing supply. Althoug"

Lenders also feel optimistic about data centers, based on Blackstone's being able to refinance 10 data centers owned by subsidiary QTS in a $3.5 billion deal, according to BisNow.\nAn Eightfold Expansion\nBlackstone entered the data center industry when it acquired QTS Realty Trust in 2021 for $10 billion. QTS now operates more than 70 data centers, marking an eightfold increase in less than five years.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nFast Company Calls It a \u2018Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' \u2014 Investors Can Still Get In at $0.86/Share\n-\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace\u2014Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nThose facilities support more than three gigawatts of capacity, making it a viable option for hyperscalers like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that need more energy for their AI ambitions.\nBlackstone's latest refinance unlocks more capital from its data center portfolio. The funds give the firm flexibility to buy additional facilities or use the cash for other business segments.\nHigh Capital Requirements Align With Surging Demand\nData centers require significant capital to go from concepts to finished buildings, and that's part of the reason why companies like Blackstone are refinancing their existing properties. Financing makes it easier to build more facilities, and the strong demand for AI and cloud computing suggests that more capital will flow into the industry.\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses\u2014This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\nThese facilities currently consume 5% of U.S. power, and that figure is set to double thanks to a $6.7 trillion buildout. Heavy data center concentrations are associated with higher electricity bills, according to CNBC. Higher energy costs and intense capital requirements haven't stopped companies from building and scaling their data center portfolios.\nTech giants have also committed to lucrative deals that make these facilities more attractive in the long run. Meta announced a $27 billion joint venture with Blue Owl Capital (NYSE:OWL) in October to develop the Hyperion data center campus in Richland Parish, Louisiana.\nLower Interest Rates Make Debt More Attractive\nThe refinancing deal comes as interest rates continue to drop. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates twice this year, with the possibility of a third rate cut in December. Lower rates make it more affordable for Blackstone and other firms to borrow money. As rates drop, demand for commercial-backed mortgage securities may increase."

Renewed faith in the AI trade provided a tailwind for tech names in the run-up to Thursday's trading shutdown for the Thanksgiving holiday.\nHowever, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 ended a rocky month of trading with losses. A sharp cooldown in megacap tech names has led to a decline for November as investors reassessed how quickly AI-driven businesses can translate hype into sustainable profits.\nThe Nasdaq snapped a seven-month run of gains with monthly losses of nearly 2%. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% during the month, following a six-month winning streak.

The disruption lasted until 8:30 a.m. ET, when CME said it resolved the outage.\nAs November wraps up, analysts are rolling out their stock-market predictions for the year ahead.

                "body": "Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last five years\nMonolithic Power Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MPWR) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 15% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. We think most investors would be happy with the 188% return, over that period. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend.\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Monolithic Power Systems achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 63% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 24% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Monolithic Power Systems has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on Monolithic Power Systems' balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\nWhat About Dividends?\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Monolithic Power Systems the TSR over the last 5 years was 198%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\nA Different Perspective\nIt's nice to see that Monolithic Power Systems shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 64% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 24% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Monolithic Power Systems better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Monolithic Power Systems has 3 warning signs (and 2 which are significant) we think you should know about."

                "body": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 This time last year, Jon Cherkas and his wife were busy preparing to host relatives, friends and neighbors for Thanksgiving in their Southern California home of more than 20 years.\nThis year, the couple is planning to dine out with friends in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\u201cWe had such great community and fun with neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s really missing now.\u201d\nCherkas\u2019 home was one of roughly 16,000 structures destroyed in the deadly Jan. 7 wildfires that consumed entire swaths of Los Angeles County. At least 31 people were killed, and more than 57,000 acres were scorched in densely populated communities including Altadena, Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Sunset Mesa, where Cherkas\u2019 house overlooked the Pacific Ocean.\nThousands of empty lots now dot neighborhoods that would otherwise be brimming with holiday decorations. Survivors say those inescapable reminders of what was lost gives them a renewed appreciation of Thanksgiving.\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic and try not to dwell on it,\u201d Cherkas said. He's seen wildfires disrupt the lives of plenty of other people. But now, he said, \u201cI am that other person.\u201d\nSo instead of getting ready for his annual party, Cherkas and his wife chose to spend Thanksgiving this year with old neighbors from Sunset Mesa who relocated to Arizona before the fire hit.\nBeing with old friends, he said, \u201cmakes it feel a little bit like being home.\u201d\nCherkas intends to rebuild but says permitting is taking much longer than expected. Like all natural disasters, rebuilding is an onerous process. Fewer than 2,000 permits have been issued in burn zones out of 5,000 applications received to date, according to the state\u2019s dashboard. About 3,100 are under review and thousands more have yet to be submitted.\nTom Reed, who also lost his home in the Palisades Fire, said this year has been a study in creative problem-solving. For Easter, rather than hosting the annual egg hunt for his grandchildren in the backyard, he and wife threw a party in the courtyard of their rental condo. The adults wore T-shirts with eggs attached via velcro. Instead of hunting for eggs, grandchildren hunted for grandparents.\n\u201cThings have changed, but I gotta find amusement,\u201d he said\nWhen the question of where to host Thanksgiving came around, Reed decided one day was simply not enough. Instead of cramming everyone into the condo, Reed, his wife and the rest of the family will spend the weekend at Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino Mountains.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look back because it will mess with your head,\u201d he said.\nAcross the county, in Altadena, Freddy Sayegh is back in his smoke-damaged house. It has been remediated, but his wife and two children remained at their rental for several months.\nTucked in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, Altadena felt like a small village nestled within a megapolis. It was filled with mom-and-pops stores and multigenerational families who purchased homes when other parts of the county were out of reach.\nSayegh and his extended family lost seven properties in the Eaton Fire, homes and businesses included. He has spent much of this year jumping from one rental to another waiting to be able to move back into his house.\nBefore the fire, Thanksgiving with the Sayeghs could mean celebrating with up to 60 people spread throughout \u201cone big home cooking and sleeping and drinking and partying for 48 hours,\u201d he said.\nThis year won\u2019t be like that. Some relatives have decided to vacation out of state, and others made reservations to dine out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been broken up into pieces,\u201d he said.\nBut a strong sense of community defined Altadena, and many are determined to nurture its essence. Some residents have thrown block parties on their otherwise vacant streets, and others meet for weekly game nights or other gatherings throughout the area.\nNext week, Sayegh is hosting a 1980s-themed extravaganza called Back to Altadena that will take over a small block in the western side of the neighborhood near the worst"

It also reacted to the latest Tokyo CPI numbers and the growing tensions between Japan and China. So, does the stock have any upside?\nNikkei 225 Index steady as Japan retail sales rise\nCopy link to sectionThe Nikkei 225 Index, which tracks the biggest companies in Japan, is holding steady near its all-time high, even as Softbank, one of its biggest companies, remain under pressure after falling by 9% from its highest level this year.\nThe index remained above the key resistance level at \u00a550,000 after the statistics agency published strong retail sales data. According to the statistics agency, retail sales rose from 0.0% in September to 1.6% in October.\nThis growth translated to an annual increase of 1.7%, a trend that may continue as the country prepares to implement a major stimulus package under Sanae Takaichi, the new prime minister.\nThe report also showed that the country\u2019s industrial production rose by 1.4% in October, higher than the median estimate of 0.7%. Similarly, the labor market continued to do well, with the unemployment rate remaining at 2.6%.\nHowever, the report also showed that Tokyo\u2019s core inflation continued rising in October, moving to an annual level of 2.8%. Its headline Consumer Price Index moved to 2.7% from the previous 2.8%.\nThese numbers mean that Japan\u2019s inflation is slightly above the BoJ\u2019s target of 2.0%, and is a sign that the bank will continue hiking interest rates this year.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Asahi Noguchi, a BoJ official, said he supported gradual interest rate cuts. He argued that maintaining interest rate too low for so long would have a detrimental impact on the economy.\nOther BoJ officials, including Kazuo Ueda, have hinted that the bank will start hiking interest rates as soon as in December.\nIn theory, Japan stocks would underperform as the bank starts hiking interest rates as that would draw more money to the bond market. Indeed, data shows that foreigners dumped stocks worth \u00a3348 billion and bought bonds worth \u00a5576 billion.\nA BoJ rate hike, coming at a time when the Federal Reserve is considering cutting, may help to boost the Japanese yen, which has plunged in the past few weeks.\nJapan and China tensions\nCopy link to sectionThe Nikkei 225 Index also held steady as Donald Trump pushed Takaichi to avoid further escalation.\nThis crisis started when Takaichi warned Beijing against invading Taiwan, which pushed China to issue travel advisories, economic measures, and international lobbying.\nIn a phone call with Takaichi, Donald Trump urged her to avoid further escalation as he tries to mend his relationship with Beijing.\nTherefore, the ongoing Nikkei 225 Index performance is a sign that investors believe that the ongoing conflict will not have a lasting impact on Japan and its companies.\nNikkei 225 Index technical analysis\nCopy link to sectionThe daily timeframe chart shows that the Nikkei 225 Index has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months. It has jumped from a low of \u00a530,885, its lowest level in April.\nThe stock has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and the ascending trendline, its lowest swings since August.\nThere are signs that the Nikkei 225 Index stock is slowly forming a double-top pattern at \u00a552,627, its highest point this year. This means that it will rebound by 5% from the current level. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological level at \u00a553,000."

Instead, investors are fixated on next month\u2019s central bank meetings in Japan and the US, which could shake up everything from currency moves to high-flying tech stocks. In Tokyo, hotter core inflation is boosting bets that the Bank of Japan might finally lift interest rates in December \u2013 a major break from years of ultra-easy policy. Across the Pacific, the recent surge in US tech stocks leans heavily on hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut, so any delay could knock those richly valued names. Still, Friday\u2019s tone was quietly upbeat under the surface, with 143 Nikkei gainers versus 80 decliners, helped by standouts like machine-tool maker Okuma, up 6.7%, and Furukawa Electric, up 4.7%, even as Mitsui Kinzoku and Toho slipped about 2%.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: When central banks call the shots.\nThis week\u2019s choppy but positive finish shows just how much stock markets are dancing to central bank tunes. A Bank of Japan hike would mark a clean step away from negative rates, likely strengthening the yen and squeezing export-heavy Japanese firms, even as it boosts margins for local banks and insurers. Meanwhile, if the Fed holds off on cutting rates, that could take the shine off pricey US tech stocks \u2013 a group that has powered much of this year\u2019s global equity gains. Put together, those policy decisions could inject more volatility into portfolios built around Japan\u2019s reopening story and America\u2019s big-tech rally.\nZooming out: A slow goodbye to easy money.\nNovember\u2019s 4.2% slide \u2013 the Nikkei\u2019s worst for the month since 2011 \u2013 is a reminder that the era of near-free money is fading, and with it the simple strategy of blindly buying every growth-stock dip. If both the Bank of Japan and the Fed keep nudging policy toward something more normal, investors may increasingly gravitate to firms with sturdy earnings, sensible valuations, and less dependence on ultra-cheap debt. Japan\u2019s solid market breadth, with almost twice as many Nikkei stocks rising as falling, suggests money is rotating within the market rather than rushing for the exits. Over time, that shift away from emergency-level rates could foster markets that are more driven by company fundamentals \u2013 just with a bumpier ride along the way.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nInsight\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 10 hours ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 19 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 8 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
