                "body": "Gold Prices Soar Past $4,400: Humphrey Yang Explains Why and How To Protect Your Portfolio\nAs noted by Morgan Stanley, gold prices have risen by about 50% in 2025 and crossed $4,000 per ounce in October. The investment bank estimated prices could reach $4,400 per ounce in 2026, which they already surpassed as of late December.\nGold\u2019s recent returns can sound impressive when compared to those of popular stocks and cryptocurrencies, but it\u2019s important to consider what may be causing this explosion and whether it will likely continue.\nIn a recent video, financial YouTuber Humphrey Yang discussed four reasons that could explain gold\u2019s popularity in 2025. He also shared his thoughts on adding gold to your portfolio.\n1. Gold\u2019s Relationship to the US Dollar\nYang described the inverse relationship between gold and the U.S. dollar. A rising dollar usually corresponds with a falling gold price, while a falling dollar usually drives gold\u2019s price up.\nAccording to T. Rowe Price, devaluation has been an issue for the U.S. dollar this year, and it will likely continue due to concerns about the Federal Reserve, federal budget, monetary policy and other factors. Devaluation can prompt international investors to explore different options, like gold, to hedge their risk. This can further hurt the U.S. dollar\u2019s value and help gold prices.\nRead More: 5 Key Mindset Shifts To Financially Become the Top 1%, According to Humphrey Yang\nCheck Out: 6 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n2. Inflation\nThe latest September 2025 Consumer Price Index data showed an annual inflation rate of 2.7%, which is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. When people are worried about the value of their money declining, they may find gold appealing since it\u2019s something limited and tangible.\nBut while inflation can drive gold\u2019s demand and value, Yang explained the relationship isn\u2019t always predictable. For example, he noted gold prices had periods of stability and decline during the 1990s and increases during the 2000s, both decades with relatively moderate inflation levels.\nAdvertisement\nYang added, \u201cSo what that means is that while inflation is going up and gold is marketed as an inflation hedge, it doesn\u2019t always mean that just gold will go up in value because there is inflation.\u201d\n3. Central Bank Policies\nYang discussed how foreign central banks are opting for more gold than U.S. Treasuries in their reserves, which hasn\u2019t happened since 1996. China has been one of the major buyers in 2025. This trend shows gold has become more appealing for governments seeking diversification, as it doesn\u2019t require worrying about default \u2014 though the U.S. dollar remains popular.\nYang added, \u201cI personally don\u2019t think that the U.S. dollar is going anywhere anytime soon or is going to be dethroned as the world reserve currency, but that could change in, let\u2019s say, the next 10 or 20 or 30 years.\u201d\n4. Global Uncertainty\nInternational conflicts, trade tensions and general instability can cause people to panic and feel uncertain about the markets. This can make them turn to gold for safety in case of economic downturns. For example, after President Trump threatened new China tariffs in Oct. 2025, gold prices reached new records, Reuters reported.\nYang explained, \u201cHistorical analysis shows that during periods of heightened geopolitical uncertainty, gold has delivered average weekly returns \u2014 weekly returns \u2014 of approximately 1.6% while equity markets often experience simultaneous declines.\u201d\nYang\u2019s Tips for Your Portfolio\nUltimately, Yang recommended diversifying and sticking with having only 3% to 10% of your portfolio in gold and other alternative investments. You should also be prepared for some uncertainty; Yang showed there are sometimes flat or negative returns over time, such as from February 2012 to June 2020.\nAs for future prices, Yang suggested future Fed rate cuts and higher retail demand might be good news for gold, while a rise in the U.S. dollar\u2019s value or stabilizing geopolitical"

                "body": "Gold, silver set for a volatile week as US data, Fed signals and Maduro fallout keep investors on edge\nGold and silver prices are expected to see sharp swings in the coming week as investors track key US economic data and assess rising geopolitical uncertainty following the US military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, analysts told news agency PTI.\nMarket participants will keep a close watch on crucial US indicators such as the ISM Manufacturing data, December ADP employment numbers and the unemployment rate. Comments from several US Federal Reserve officials are also likely to guide expectations around interest rates and influence near-term bullion prices.\n\u201cGold prices are likely to remain volatile in the week ahead as there are bullish as well as bearish factors at play,\u201d said Prathamesh Mallya, DVP \u2013 Research, Non-Agri Commodities and Currencies at Angel One.\nExperts said commodity markets could see aggressive trading at the start of the week amid volatile geopolitics after US forces captured Maduro and his wife in a military operation, accusing them of drug trafficking.\n\u201cThe development could jolt global markets, pushing bullion and crude oil prices higher on fears of supply disruptions from Venezuela, which holds the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves,\u201d one expert said.\nAfter hitting record highs in late December, gold prices corrected sharply last week. On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures dropped by Rs 4,112, or 2.94 per cent. Prices had surged to a record Rs 1,40,444 per 10 grams before slipping over 3 per cent to settle at Rs 1,35,761 per 10 grams on Friday.\n\u201cGold prices declined in the past week ending 2nd January 2026 after hitting record highs in late December. The recent correction in gold prices was on account of profit booking at higher levels, low liquidity due to year-end and Christmas holidays,\u201d Mallya said.\nHe added that gold traded in a wide range of Rs 1,34,000\u20131,40,000 per 10 grams during the week amid volatile conditions and heavy selling pressure.\nSilver prices also reflected similar volatility. On the MCX, silver fell by Rs 3,471, or 1.45 per cent, over the week. After touching a record high of Rs 2,54,174 per kg, prices tumbled by Rs 17,858, or 7.02 per cent, to end at Rs 2,36,316 per kg on Friday.\nIn the international market, Comex gold futures declined by USD 223.1, or 4.9 per cent, during the holiday-shortened week to close at USD 4,329.6 per ounce. Silver prices dropped even more sharply, falling 8 per cent, or USD 6.18. After hitting a record USD 82.67 per ounce, silver slid 14.1 per cent, or USD 11.65, to settle at USD 71.01 per ounce.\nPankaj Singh, smallcase manager, founder and principal researcher at Smart Wealth AI, said gold\u2019s ability to hold near the USD 4,300-per-ounce level shows rising investor caution amid easing US inflation and continued safe-haven demand.\nHe noted that silver saw a short-term correction after CME Group raised margin requirements for gold futures, forcing traders to cut leveraged positions and triggering broader selling across Comex.\nHowever, Singh said that as markets enter 2026, key drivers such as monetary uncertainty, geopolitical risks and policy-led capital reallocation remain intact.\nOn the outlook for the year, he said gold prices could rise between 10 and 60 per cent in 2026, though sharp interim corrections of up to 20 per cent are possible. Silver faces a downside risk of 5\u201330 per cent, but strong industrial demand could drive prices up as much as 40 per cent if supply tightness continues.\n\u201cStructurally bullish, policy-driven precious metals cycle may continue, but risk of significant corrections is also possible,\u201d Singh said.\nInvestors are now expected to closely track the interplay between US economic data and the Fed\u2019s stance, while escalating geopolitical risks could keep precious metal markets volatile in the near term. *With Agency Inputs"

Bearish traders now await a sustained break below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) before positioning for an extension of the recent pullback from a three-month top, or levels just above the 1.1800 mark touched on December 24.\nRising geopolitical tensions assist the safe-haven US Dollar (USD) to capitalize on its recent recovery from its lowest level since early October, which, in turn, exerts pressure on the EUR/USD pair. That said, dovish US Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations might cap gains for the USD. Furthermore, the growing acceptance that the European Central Bank (ECB) is done cutting rates could support the shared currency and the currency pair.\nOn the daily chart, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line slips below the Signal line and sits under the zero mark. The negative histogram widens, suggesting building bearish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) prints 44, below the 50 midline, indicating fading upside impetus. Initial support aligns at the 100-day SMA at 1.1666; holding above it would help contain downside pressures for the EUR/USD pair.\nMeanwhile, the gently rising 100-day SMA continues to underpin the broader bias, though a daily close beneath it would tilt the tone back in favor of sellers. Until that gives way, dips could remain contained above the average. MACD\u2019s placement below zero and beneath its Signal line reinforces a corrective phase.

It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surve"

                "body": "EUR/USD continues to decline, trading near 1.1710 during Asian hours on Monday. The pair weakens as the US Dollar gains strength from safe-haven demand, prompted by increased geopolitical risks after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\nPresident Trump announced a large-scale strike on Venezuela without congressional approval, aiming to maintain order until a stable transition occurs. The US Dollar\u2019s ascent may face limits owing to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026, and Trump is expected to appoint a new Fed chair, potentially influencing a shift towards lower interest rates.\nEuro Support Factors\nThe Euro could see support against the Dollar due to divergent monetary policies between the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. The ECB kept rates steady in December 2025, indicating they might remain unchanged, while ECB President Christine Lagarde cited uncertainty as a challenge for forward guidance.\nWhen financial markets are \u201crisk-on,\u201d investors pursue high-risk assets, boosting commodity-linked currencies like the Australian and Canadian Dollars. In \u201crisk-off\u201d scenarios, safer assets such as bonds and currencies like the US Dollar, Japanese Yen, and Swiss Franc are favoured, as investors seek security amid uncertainty. Some currencies thrive in commodity-driven economies during risk-on periods, whereas major currencies like the US Dollar strengthen during risk-off phases.\nThe US-led action in Venezuela is driving a clear \u201crisk-off\u201d move, sending capital into safe havens like the US Dollar. This has pushed the EUR/USD pair down toward the 1.1700 level, a significant technical area we have been watching since it acted as support late last year. We are seeing this risk aversion reflected across markets, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) jumping over 35% to trade above 26 for the first time in months.\nDollar Strength and Market Strategies\nGiven the immediate uncertainty, the dollar is likely to remain strong in the coming days, possibly pushing EUR/USD further down. The spike in WTI crude oil prices to over $95 a barrel will further complicate the picture, adding to inflationary pressures while global growth fears rise. For now, traders should consider strategies that benefit from this volatility and potential for further euro weakness, such as buying near-term put options.\nHowever, we should not ignore the underlying fundamentals that could reverse this trend quickly. The market is still pricing in two Federal Reserve interest rate cuts for 2026, with fed funds futures indicating an over 80% probability of the first cut happening by the March meeting. This expectation is a significant headwind for the dollar once the current geopolitical tensions begin to fade.\nThis contrasts with the European Central Bank, which we saw in December 2025 signal a firm intention to keep rates on hold for an extended period. This growing policy divergence between a dovish Fed and a neutral ECB should provide strong support for the euro in the medium term. Therefore, any excessive dips below 1.1700 could present opportunities to position for a rebound later in the first quarter."

The pair loses ground as the US Dollar (USD) strengthens on safe-haven demand, driven by a renewed rise in geopolitical risks following the United States\u2019 (US) capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\nCNN reported over the weekend that the US President Donald Trump administration ordered a \u201clarge-scale strike against Venezuela\u201d and captured President Maduro to face charges, without congressional approval. Trump added that the US would oversee Venezuela until a safe, orderly, and judicious transition could take place.\nHowever, the upside of the US Dollar could be restrained due to expectations of two additional Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026. Markets are bracing for US President Donald Trump to nominate a new Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, a move that could tilt monetary policy toward lower interest rates.\nThe Euro (EUR) could find support against the Greenback as monetary policy paths diverge between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed). The ECB kept interest rates unchanged in December 2025 and signaled they are likely to remain on hold for an extended period. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that heightened uncertainty makes it difficult to offer clear forward guidance on future policy decisions.\n(This story was corrected on January 5 at 02:55 GMT to say, in the first bullet point, that the EUR/USD depreciates on safe-haven demand instead of rising.)\nRisk sentiment FAQs\nIn the world of financial jargon the two widely used terms \u201crisk-on\u201d and \u201crisk off'' refer to the level of risk that investors are willing to stomach during the period referenced. In a \u201crisk-on\u201d market, investors are optimistic about the future and more willing to buy risky assets. In a \u201crisk-off\u201d market investors start to \u2018play it safe\u2019 because they are worried about the future, and therefore buy less risky assets that are more certain of bringing a return, even if it is relatively modest.\nTypically, during periods of \u201crisk-on\u201d, stock markets will rise, most commodities \u2013 except Gold \u2013 will also gain in value, since they benefit from a positive growth outlook. The currencies of nations that are heavy commodity exporters strengthen because of increased demand, and Cryptocurrencies rise. In a \u201crisk-off\u201d market, Bonds go up \u2013 especially major government Bonds \u2013 Gold shines, and safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and US Dollar all benefit.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD), the Canadian Dollar (CAD), the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) and minor FX like the Ruble (RUB) and the South African Rand (ZAR), all tend to rise in markets that are \u201crisk-on\u201d. This is because the economies of these currencies are heavily reliant on commodity exports for growth, and commodities tend to rise in price during risk-on periods. This is because investors foresee greater demand for raw materials in the future due to heightened economic activity.\nThe major currencies that tend to rise during periods of \u201crisk-off\u201d are the US Dollar (USD), the Japanese Yen (JPY) and the Swiss Franc (CHF). The US Dollar, because it is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and because in times of crisis investors buy US government debt, which is seen as safe because the largest economy in the world is unlikely to default.

                "body": "Speculation Impact on USD\nThe pair experienced a bearish gap in the Asian session, staying just below the mid-1.3400s, down by 0.10%. Despite a lack of selling momentum, geopolitical events, including the US military\u2019s actions in Venezuela, added pressure to GBP/USD and directed safe-haven flows towards the USD. The USD Index (DXY) benefited, building on a previous recovery.\nSpeculation about potential US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts may restrict further USD gains. Conversely, GBP is supported by easing UK budget worries and hawkish BoE outlooks, contrasting with the Fed\u2019s stance and potentially limiting GBP/USD downside. The Bank of England\u2019s 25 bps rate cut to 3.75% in December, with a narrow vote split, altered expectations for aggressive BoE easing, possibly benefiting GBP.\nCurrency performance data showed USD strongest against the Australian Dollar, with varying changes against other currencies. The heat map helped visualise the percentage changes between major currency pairs, detailing movements like USD appreciation against JPY.\nLooking back a year ago, we saw the US Dollar strengthen due to geopolitical risks, including tensions over Venezuela. However, the dominant theme that played out in 2025 was the divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England\u2019s policies. This has pushed GBP/USD higher, and we are now watching the pair hold ground above the 1.3800 level.\nUK Political Risk and Market Strategies\nThe safe-haven bid for the dollar has softened since early 2025 as the specific military risks mentioned at the time have eased. The focus for the pound has now shifted internally towards the upcoming UK general election later this year, which is beginning to create some uncertainty. This political risk is a new factor that was not on the radar at this time last year.\nAs was anticipated, the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates in 2025, delivering three 25-basis-point cuts throughout the year. The latest US inflation report from December 2025 showed core CPI at 2.9%, supporting the market\u2019s view that the Fed will continue its easing cycle. This ongoing policy shift continues to act as a headwind for the US dollar against major currencies.\nIn contrast, the Bank of England held its nerve for much longer due to persistent UK wage inflation, which as of the last reading still sits above 5%. While they eventually followed the Fed in cutting rates, they did so less aggressively, widening the interest rate differential in favor of the pound. This policy gap remains the key support for GBP/USD.\nGiven this continued policy divergence, but with rising UK political volatility, traders should consider strategies that benefit from upside in GBP/USD while hedging against sudden drops. Buying call options on GBP/USD could capture further gains if the uptrend continues towards the 1.4000 mark. A more cautious approach would be using bull call spreads to reduce the initial cost while still positioning for a measured move higher in the coming weeks."

                "body": "Introduction\nGBP/USD rose 6.5% in 2025; however, this was driven by U.S. dollar weakness rather than by notable strength in the pound, as evidenced by the pound's mixed performance against its major peers. The USD index fell 10% across 2025, marking its worst yearly performance since 1979. Meanwhile, the pound fell 5% against the euro and 6% against the Swiss Franc, although GBP was flat against the Australian dollar and gained against the Japanese yen.\nGBP/USD experienced one of its strongest annual gains in years, rising 6.5% year to date by mid-December. This move followed a 1.7% decline in the previous year and marks the strongest yearly rally since 2017. The pair booked most of its gains during the first six months of the year, as the USD experienced its steepest decline since 1979.\nGBP/USD rose from 1.21, a 15-month low, to a four-year high of 1.3790 by July 1, before consolidating across the summer. The pair fell between September and November before bouncing back in the final weeks of the year. However, with questions over how much lower the USD could go, GBP/USD may struggle to book another strong year in 2026\nUK economic outlook\n-\nInflation & wage growth\nUK inflation eased to 3.2% YoY in November, cooling by more than expected after peaking at 3.8% YoY in September. This was below the 4% peak forecast by the central bank. While inflation remains 1.2% above the BoE\u2019s 2% target, the BoE acknowledged that it expects Inflation to fall closer to its 2% target next spring as CPI cools faster than expected. This, combined with an expected deflationary impact from the Budget, could lead to CPI easing further towards levels consistent with looser BoE monetary policy.\nUK CPI falls below BoE forecasts\nThe labour market is showing more signs of weakening. The unemployment rate rose to 5.1%, an almost 5-year high. Wage growth also cooled to 4.6%, with private-sector pay falling below 4% for the first time since 2020. While some of this weakness may be due to caution ahead of the Budget, these figures indicate that the UK labour market is loosening. The BoE forecasts that unemployment could rise to 5.5% in Q2 2026 owing to higher labour costs. A continued weakening in the labour market could prompt the BoE to cut rates further, although wage growth, while slowing, remains too high to be consistent with a 2% inflation target.\n-\nGrowth\nUK GDP grew 0.1% QoQ in Q3, down from 0.3% growth in Q2. According to the OECD, the UK is expected to grow by 1.2% in 2026, rising to 1.3% in 2027. This is a modest pace of growth, below long-term averages, indicating a slow-moving recovery rather than robust expansion. The slow growth is expected to be supported by easing monetary policy and improved confidence, but constrained by fiscal headwinds, weak productivity, and global economic uncertainty.\n-\nFiscal outlook\nWith the long-awaited November budget in the rear-view mirror, concerns over the UK\u2019s fiscal position have eased. Chancellor Rachel Reeve calmed market worries by giving herself more headroom than expected, pulling gilt yields lower. The market was unfazed by the prospect of the government front-loading spending while back-loading tax increases to finance it. However, this indicates that the fiscal position remains fragile, even if the market is looking through this for now. Government spending has been at record levels across the latter part of 2025. Markets will continue to monitor government spending and public sector net borrowing closely throughout 2026. Persistent high spending could unnerve the bond market, lifting gilt yields and weighing on GBP. Any indication that spending is being reined in could help lower gilt yields while boosting the pound.\n-\nPolitical volatility\nPolitical unease in the UK could weigh on sentiment towards the pound. Prime Minister Kier Starmer looks far from secure.\nBoth PM Starmer and Rachel Reeves have been under pressure, and while the Budget appears to have given them more time, there is a sense that a "

Spot prices, however, lack follow-through selling and manage to hold above last week's swing low amid mixed fundamental cues.\nAgainst the backdrop of the protracted Russia-Ukraine war and unrest in the Middle East, the US military attack on Venezuela adds to concerns about rising geopolitical tensions and drives some safe-haven flows towards the US Dollar (USD). This assists the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, to build on its recent recovery from the lowest level since early October and turns out to be a key factor exerting pressure on the GBP/USD pair.\nHowever, speculation about interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in March and maybe another later this year might keep a lid on any further USD appreciation. The British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, continues to draw support from easing worries over the UK budget. Moreover, hawkish Bank of England's (BoE) expectations mark a significant divergence in comparison to the Fed and should further contribute to limiting the downside for the GBP/USD pair.\nAs expected, the Bank of England cut rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75% in December, with the vote split at 5\u20134. The narrow vote split pointed to differences within the committee on the back of the recent inflation surprise. This, in turn, forced investors to scale back their expectations for more aggressive easing by the BoE this year, which should act as a tailwind for the GBP and the GBP/USD pair ahead of important US macro releases scheduled at the start of a new month.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the strongest against the Australian Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote).\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

A fresh surge in geopolitical risk after the United States (US) capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro boosts safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar (USD) against the Australian Dollar (AUD). Later on Monday, traders will keep an eye on the release of the Chinese RatingDog Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and the US ISM Manufacturing PMI data.\nUS President Donald Trump confirmed the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife: \u201cMaduro and his wife both will face US justice,\u201d Trump said, adding the US will be running Venezuela until they can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.\nJust hours after capturing the Venezuelan leader, Trump said American oil companies were prepared to spend billions to restore Venezuela's crude production, something that could give global growth a lift as greater supply lowers energy prices. The geopolitical risks and uncertainty could boost the safe-haven flows, supporting the Greenback and creating a headwind for the pair in the near term.\nOn the other hand, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) tightening hopes might help limit the Aussie\u2019s losses. The hawkish remarks by RBA Governor Michelle Bullock after the December monetary policy decision showed that policymakers\u2019 concerns about inflation have taken center stage, and that the possibility of a rate hike was on the table last month.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Iron Ore falls. Higher Iron Ore prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance for Australia, which is also positive of"

                "body": "Geopolitical Tensions Impact\nAUD/USD fell below 0.6700 due to rising geopolitical risks after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The currency pair traded around 0.6685 during the early Asian session on Monday, as traders turned their attention to upcoming economic data from China and the US.\nUS President Donald Trump confirmed Maduro\u2019s capture and said Maduro and his wife would face US justice. He also indicated that American oil companies are preparing to invest in Venezuela\u2019s crude production, which could boost global economic growth by increasing supply and lowering energy prices.\nCurrent geopolitical tensions are driving safe-haven flows into the USD, affecting AUD/USD negatively. However, the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s potential interest rate hike could lessen the AUD\u2019s losses. RBA Governor Michelle Bullock\u2019s statements emphasised inflation concerns, keeping rate hike discussions ongoing.\nKey influences on the AUD include RBA interest rates, iron ore prices, the health of China\u2019s economy, and Australia\u2019s trade balance. Higher interest rates and iron ore prices support the AUD, as does a positive trade balance and improvement in China\u2019s economy. However, the AUD faces pressure from rising geopolitical risks despite potential support from the RBA\u2019s tightening stance.\nWith the recent capture of Venezuela\u2019s Maduro, we are seeing a classic safe-haven rush into the US Dollar. This geopolitical shock has increased expected market swings, making options strategies that benefit from higher volatility look attractive. Traders might consider these to play the uncertainty that has pushed the AUD/USD below the key 0.6700 level.\nMarket Tensions and Economic Data\nThe headwind for the Aussie dollar is significant, as a strong US economy continues to support the Greenback. The US ISM Manufacturing PMI for December 2025 surprised to the upside at 54.2, reinforcing the view of a resilient American economy. This makes buying put options or establishing bear put spreads on AUD/USD a logical way to position for further weakness.\nHowever, we must not ignore underlying support for the AUD, which could cushion the fall. We recall that Australia\u2019s Q4 2025 CPI data came in hotter than expected at 3.9%, keeping the pressure on the RBA to remain hawkish. The recent Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI print of 51.8 for December also suggests demand for Australian exports will remain firm.\nThe fall in energy prices, with Brent crude now near $78 a barrel, is a direct consequence of the Venezuela news, easing global inflation fears slightly. In contrast, iron ore prices have held firm above $130 per tonne, providing a solid floor for the Australian currency. This divergence suggests that while the USD is gaining on risk sentiment, the AUD\u2019s fundamental commodity support is not collapsing.\nGiven these conflicting signals, we expect AUD/USD to be caught in a tug-of-war, potentially leading to range-bound trading rather than a sharp directional break in the immediate weeks. This environment is ideal for strategies that profit from time decay and defined risk, such as an iron condor. Setting the wings of such a strategy around the 0.6600 and 0.6800 levels could be a prudent approach."

                "body": "(5 January 2026 \u2013 Australia) The strength of the Australian Dollar in 2026 will be heavily influenced by interest rates, commodity prices and mounting geopolitical tensions.\nThe growing interest rate differential between the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and US Federal Reserve has underpinned recent Aussie Dollar (AUD) strength in late 2025 after the Fed reduced its policy rate for the third consecutive time. Economists are however divided between whether the RBA will keep rates on hold through 2026 or revert to a hawkish stance.\nDespite recent strength, the AUD has been steadily depreciating in value against the US Dollar since its peak of 109 US cents in 2011 with the value of the local currency now arriving at a crossroads.\n\u201cThe Aussie is gradually rising, driven by broad US dollar weakness as the Fed continues to gradually cut. And now that we have the RBA on hold with the risk of hiking. The yield advantage held by the US is likely to erode further\u201d commented NAB FX Strategist, Rodrigo Catril.\n\u201cThe Aussie dollar will also be supported by the strong domestic economy and expectation China will continue a gradual appreciation of the RMB. The local currency is often used as a liquid proxy for the RMB, given China is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner\u201d Catril added.\n\u201cIf the RBA is forced to hike in February due to some unwelcome news on the consumer price index, then it will, and the labour market will be no barrier to that. If the labour market has to loosen a bit more to address inflation, it might be the cost to pay\u201d stated IFM Investors Chief Economist, Alex Joiner.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see further appreciation, as a hawkish RBA vs a more dovish US Federal Reserve and downward USD pressure could see the Australian dollar even get up to 70 US cents\u201d said AMP Deputy Chief Economist Diana Mousina said.\n\u201cFair value is more like 72 US cents, but it\u2019s hard to see significant upside beyond 70 US as the euro and yen benefit more from lower USD and we need to see stronger global growth, and China to see a higher Australian dollar\u201d Mousina added.\n\u201cIf US interest rates fall significantly from here and Australian interest rates rise, the dollar, analysts say, will likely move convincingly above 70 US cents. And US President Donald Trump\u2019s foray into Venezuela puts another spanner in the works of the currency market.\nBrace for big moves in commodities prices and currencies in the coming days and months\u201d said ABC Business Correspondent, David Taylor."

                "body": "Japanese Yen remains depressed as USD strengthens on rising geopolitical tensions\n- Japanese Yen continues to lose ground amid the uncertainty over further BoJ tightening.\n- Geopolitical risks benefit the USD\u2019s status as the reserve currency and support USD/JPY.\n- The divergent BoJ-Fed policy expectations warrant some caution for aggressive JPY bears.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) drifts lower against a broadly firmer US Dollar (USD) for the fourth straight day, pushing the USD/JPY pair to a nearly two-week top, around the 157.30 region, during the Asian session on Monday. Despite the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish outlook, the lack of a clear timeline for future rate hikes continues to undermine the JPY. Furthermore, rising geopolitical tensions benefit the USD's reserve currency status, which is seen as another factor behind the JPY's underperformance.\nHowever, speculations that Japanese authorities would step in to stem further weakness in the domestic currency warrant some caution for the JPY bears. Moreover, prospects for lower interest rates in the US, along with renewed concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) independence, might keep a lid on further USD gains and offer support to the lower-yielding JPY. This, in turn, could act as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair as traders keenly await this week's US macro releases for a fresh impetus.\nJapanese Yen struggles to lure buyers amid BoJ uncertainty and firmer USD\n- The Bank of Japan raised its benchmark policy rate to a 30-year high level of 0.75% in December and signaled that the scale of future adjustments will depend on economic conditions. Moreover, informed sources said that the BoJ is expected to start full-fledged talks on implementing an additional rate hike if solid wage increases are confirmed in this year's shunto negotiations in spring.\n- Investors, however, appear dissatisfied and remain uncertain about the pace of tightening amid bets that energy subsidies, stable rice prices, and low petroleum costs would keep inflation low into 2026. This continues to undermine the Japanese Yen for the fourth straight day, which, along with a broadly firmer US Dollar, lifts the USD/JPY pair beyond the 157.00 mark on Monday.\n- The US Army's Delta Force \u2013 an elite special forces unit \u2013 attacked Venezuela and captured its President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, along with his wife, on Saturday. This comes on top of the lack of progress in the Russia-Ukraine peace deal, unrest in Iran, and issues surrounding Gaza, which keep geopolitical risks in play and benefits the Greenback's status as the global reserve currency.\n- The USD touches a two-week high, though the upside seems limited amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve will lower borrowing costs in March and maybe deliver another rate cut later this year. Moreover, worries over the Fed's independence, especially under US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, could act as a headwind for the buck and keep a lid on the USD/JPY pair.\n- Moreover, dovish Fed expectations mark a significant divergence in comparison to expectations of further monetary policy normalisation by the BoJ. Apart from this, intervention speculation should contribute to limiting losses for the lower-yielding JPY. This, in turn, warrants some caution before placing aggressive bullish bets around the USD/JPY pair and positioning for further gains.\n- Traders now look forward to important US macroeconomic indicators, scheduled at the start of a new month, for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path and some meaningful impetus. A rather busy week kicks off with the release of the US ISM Manufacturing PMI later this Monday and culminates with the closely watched US monthly Nonfarm Payrolls report on Friday.\nUSD/JPY seems poised to climb further; 200-period SMA on H4 holds key for bulls\nThe 200-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) continues to rise, and the USD/JPY pair holds above it, reinforcing a bullish bias.

Dollar strength was evident against the euro and sterling, but the move in USD/JPY was particularly notable, with the pair edging back toward the upper end of its recent range as yield differentials continued to favour the greenback.\nThe dollar rose to around \u00a5156.90 ... and above 157.00 as I update .... extending gains against the yen as markets maintained a cautious stance on the near-term outlook for Japanese monetary policy. While the Bank of Japan has taken incremental steps toward policy normalisation, investors remain unconvinced that the pace of tightening will be sufficient to materially support the currency in the short term, particularly against a still-resilient US economy and potential Fed pause.\nDollar strength elsewhere was more modest. The euro slipped toward $1.1705, its weakest level in more than three weeks, while sterling edged lower to around $1.3440. Overall currency moves were contained, though risk sentiment remained sensitive to geopolitical developments following the United States\u2019 high-profile operation in Venezuela over the weekend.\nFor yen traders, however, macro fundamentals remained, and will remain, the dominant driver. Markets continue to price in one or two interest-rate cuts from the divided Federal Open Market Committee. That gap in expectations has kept US yields elevated relative to Japanese rates, reinforcing downward pressure on the yen.\nAttention now turns to a heavy US data calendar that could further influence rate expectations and, by extension, USD/JPY. The week begins with the ISM surveys and culminates in Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls report, which will be closely watched for confirmation that US labour market momentum is easing in a way that would justify further Fed easing.\nUntil clearer evidence emerges of a decisive slowdown in US activity, or a more assertive tightening signal from Tokyo, the yen is likely to remain vulnerable. The persistence of wide rate differentials, coupled with global investors\u2019 preference for dollar exposure at the start of the year, suggests that rallies in the Japanese currency may continue to be shallow and short-lived.\n---\nNikkei update:"

                "body": "The US fueled geopolitical tensions over the weekend, capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, influencing demand for safe-haven assets, and USD/JPY trends.\nTraders had the opportunity to react to the weekend events on Monday, January 5. US control of Venezuela is likely to have ramifications on supply-demand dynamics for crude oil and Bitcoin (BTC). The news sent USD/JPY higher in early trading.\nWhile market reaction to President Maduro\u2019s capture was key, finalized manufacturing sector PMI data supported a tighter monetary policy environment, affirming the bearish medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nThe S&P Global Japan Manufacturing PMI increased from 48.7 in November to 50.0 in December, hovering at the 50 neutral level. Several components supported the BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions and statements that US tariff risks to the economy had cooled. According to the finalized December PMI survey:\nTighter labor market conditions, rising prices, and an improving demand backdrop support further BoJ rate hikes. Rising employment would likely boost wage growth, fueling demand-driven inflation, affirming the cautiously bearish short- and bearish medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nNotably, the manufacturing sector accounts for approximately 20% of Japan\u2019s GDP, limiting the influence of the headline PMI on the BoJ\u2019s policy stance. However, weakness in the Japanese yen pushed import prices higher, leading goods producers to increase selling prices due to rising input prices. The BoJ has frequently cited concerns about the weak yen eroding households\u2019 disposable incomes.\nDecember\u2019s PMI data would give the hawks a stronger footing. However, the Services PMI figures will be crucial for USD/JPY, given that the sector accounts for roughly 70% of Japan\u2019s GDP and is a key inflation driver. The S&P Global Services PMI will be out on Wednesday, January 7.\nUSD/JPY briefly climbed from 157.119 to 157.250 before falling to a low of 157.086 after the release of the finalized Manufacturing PMI.\nLater on Monday, US private sector PMI figures are likely to influence demand for the US dollar and the USD/JPY pair. Economists forecast the ISM Manufacturing PMI to increase from 48.2 in November to 48.3 in December.\nTypically, a less pronounced contraction, rising employment, and higher prices support a less dovish Fed policy stance, which would lift demand for the US dollar. While the sector accounts for around 10% of the US GDP, the underlying PMI data provide insights into the effect of tariffs and the higher interest rate backdrop on prices.\nLast week, the less influential S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI revealed that tariffs continued to drive prices higher, suggesting a more hawkish Fed policy stance. However, the ISM Services PMI, due out on January 7, will be key, given that the sector accounts for roughly 80% of US GDP and is the key inflation contributor.\nWhile the PMI data will influence US dollar demand, Fed commentary remains key for USD/JPY trends. Increased calls to cut rates to bolster the labor market would dampen demand for the US dollar, pushing USD/JPY lower.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a March Fed rate cut increased from 51.1% on January 2 to 54.0% on January 3.\nLooking ahead, expectations of further BoJ rate hikes, a new Fed Chair, potentially favoring lower rates, and a cooling US labor market remain key drivers. These scenarios continue to support a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, technicals, and fundamentals will continue to require close monitoring.\nLooking at the daily chart, USD/JPY traded above its 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), signaling a bullish bias. While technicals remained bullish, bearish fundamentals are developing, outweighing the technical structure.\nA break below the 155 support level and the 50-day EMA wou"

The pair appreciates as the US Dollar (USD) strengthens on safe-haven demand, driven by a renewed rise in geopolitical risks following the United States\u2019 (US) capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. US President Donald Trump said that the US would oversee Venezuela until a safe, orderly, and judicious transition could take place, per CNN.\nThe Guardian reported on Monday that President Trump warned Washington could launch a new military intervention if Venezuela\u2019s interim president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, failed to meet US demands. He also made remarks about Colombia\u2019s leadership, floated the idea of \u201cOperation Colombia,\u201d criticized Mexico for not getting its act together, and suggested Cuba appeared close to collapse.\nTraders expect two additional Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes suggested that most participants judged that it would likely be appropriate to stand on further rate cuts if inflation declined over time. Markets are bracing for US President Donald Trump to nominate a new Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, a move that could tilt monetary policy toward lower interest rates.\nThe upside of the USD/CAD pair could be capped as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) could strengthen on potential gains in Oil prices. However, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price remains steady after experiencing volatility, trading around $57.20 per barrel at the time of writing.\nTraders evaluated the fallout from the US attack on Venezuela, with markets weighing risks to regional crude supply. However, some analysts expect limited disruption, noting Venezuela produces under 1 million barrels per day, less than 1% of global output.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation"

Both currencies struggled to gain momentum, as the continued weakness of the US dollar persisted in the FX markets. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar was supported by stable domestic data. Instead of a sharp sell-off, the downside move was limited, as sellers still dominated but without any impetus.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about forex indicators? Check our detailed guide-\nThe primary driver has been the changing outlook for US monetary policy. The US dollar also finished 2025 on the steepest annual decline in eight years, and this weakness carried into the first full trading week of 2026. Softer US labor data, coupled with rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver at least two rate cuts this year, have weighed heavily on the greenback. Political uncertainty regarding the future leadership of the Fed has contributed to investor caution, keeping dollar rallies short-lived.\nThe Bank of Canada has held a more moderate position on the Canadian side. Although rate cuts have been left on the table for a later time in 2026, officials have been cautious not to promise too much, especially when inflation rates are proving stubborn in some quarters.\nThis comparative political stability has helped curb the negativity in the Canadian dollar, despite lingering global growth concerns. Oil prices have not skyrocketed but have remained steady enough to support the CAD.\nThe previous week\u2019s price action recorded USD/CAD as probing on the lower support but failing to break decisively. The buyers are still seen on dips, indicating that the market remains wary of pursuing downside without further evidence that the US data will worsen. That indecision has kept the two in a slow grind instead of a precipitous fall.\nThe following week could be pivotal to set the direction. Should US data support the story of decelerated growth and waning inflation tracts, USD/CAD could finally breach the support and open the door to a further downward move. On the other hand, any positive surprise in the US, especially regarding inflation, could induce a corrective rebound, as positioning is showing a more substantial imbalance against the dollar.\nCanadian data will also be critical. Strong domestic releases may inspire CAD bulls, while economic weakness would rekindle downward risk on the currency and stabilize the USD/CAD exchange rate.\nUSD/CAD Major Events Next Week\n- US ISM Manufacturing PMI (Monday)\n- US ISM Services PMI (Tuesday)\n- ADP Employment and JOLTS Job Openings (Wednesday)\n- Canada Employment Report (Friday)\n- US NFP and Consumer Sentiment (Friday)\nUSD/CAD Weekly Technical Forecast: Corrective Upside Under 20-DMA\nThe USD/CAD daily chart shows a corrective upside as profit-taking occurred due to the oversold RSI.

                "body": "GBP/USD 2026 Outlook: Cable Technical Analysis\nIn 2025, GBP/USD rose from 1.21, a 15-month low, to a four-year high of 1.3790 by July 1, before consolidating across the summer. The pair fell between September and November before bouncing back in the final weeks of the year. However, with questions over how much lower the USD could go, GBP/USD may struggle to book another strong year in 2026. For more insight into the fundamental factors set to drive GBP/USD in 2026, see the fundamental outlook.\nGBP/USD technical analysis\nGBP/USD broke out of the symmetrical triangle pattern, rising to a multi-year high of 1.3790, before easing back and testing the trendline support at 1.30 and recovering higher.\nThe price trades above the 50- and 200-day SMA, which, together with the RSI above 50, suggests a continuation of the recovery towards 1.3790.\nA rise above 1.3790 creates a higher high, bringing 1.40 the psychological level and 1.4250, the 2021 high, into focus.\nSellers would need to break below 1.30 to create a lower low and bring 1.2780, the rising trendline support, into focus. A break below here exposes the 200 SMA at 1.2650 ahead of the 1.21 January low.\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

The leveraged Bitcoin vehicle now manages approximately $561.0 million in assets under management (AUM), with the latest redemptions representing about 1.54% of its asset base.\nThe scale of the withdrawal is notable for a single session in a leveraged product, signaling that some investors are taking chips off the table rather than doubling down on volatility. For an ETF designed to amplify Bitcoin\u2019s moves, a 1.5% AUM swing in outflows hints at fading speculative appetite or tighter risk controls among traders after a rocky quarter for crypto prices.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading at $91,424.21. Over the past three months, Bitcoin has shed about 27.18% of its value, a sizable drawdown that helps explain why leveraged exposure has fallen out of favor in recent sessions. Despite the correction, the 1-day technical signal for Bitcoin stands at Hold, suggesting that near-term momentum is indecisive rather than outright bearish.\nAgainst this backdrop, the BITU outflows look less like a capitulation and more like a tactical reset: traders are reassessing how much leverage they want to carry into a market that has lost its upward momentum but has not yet broken decisively lower. As Bitcoin hovers around key psychological and technical levels, the flows into and out of products like BITU will remain a real-time barometer of risk appetite in the crypto complex.\nFor a more detailed analysis and real-time sentiment trends, check the live cryptocurrency prices here."

This isn\u2019t just another market cycle\u2014it\u2019s a potential $trillion reboot of how we think about finance, driven by cutting-edge technology and strategic market positioning. As of January 4, 2026, Ethereum is trading at $3,125.61, while Solana sits at $133.28, reflecting incremental daily gains of 0.12% and 0.84%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. What does this mean for the future? For investors, tech enthusiasts, and everyday users, this convergence could unlock unprecedented opportunities\u2014or risks\u2014if you\u2019re not paying attention. Curious about where this is headed? Check the AI analysis to see what data-driven insights reveal about this transformative moment.\nThe DeFi landscape in early 2026 is buzzing with potential, and Ethereum and Solana are at the heart of this revolution. Ethereum continues to dominate with an 11.88% share of the total crypto market, as reported by CoinGecko, cementing its role as the backbone of DeFi applications. Meanwhile, Solana\u2019s rapid ascent, fueled by its high-performance architecture, positions it as a serious contender, with its price reflecting steady growth.\nBut there\u2019s more to the story. The broader market sentiment, as captured by the Fear & Greed Index from Alternative.me, currently sits at a chilling 25, signaling extreme fear. This environment, while daunting, often precedes significant buying opportunities for savvy investors. Both platforms are leveraging technological advancements\u2014Ethereum with its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) transition and Solana with its Proof-of-History mechanism\u2014to address scalability and efficiency, setting the stage for a DeFi resurgence.\nRecent developments show Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum gaining traction, slashing transaction costs. Solana, on the other hand, is making waves with its lightning-fast transactions, appealing to high-frequency DeFi applications. Could this be the tipping point for mainstream adoption? The data suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of something big.\nFor investors, the rise of Ethereum and Solana in the DeFi space is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the potential for explosive growth is undeniable\u2014Ethereum\u2019s deflationary tokenomics post-PoS could drive price appreciation, while Solana\u2019s low-cost, high-speed network attracts a flood of new projects. On the other hand, volatility remains a constant companion in crypto, amplified by regulatory uncertainties and technical hiccups.\nSo, what\u2019s the play? Diversification across both platforms could mitigate risks while capitalizing on their unique strengths. Ethereum offers stability and a mature ecosystem, ideal for long-term holdings. Solana, with its growth trajectory, might appeal to those chasing higher risk-reward ratios. Want to dive deeper into the numbers? Get AI analysis for Ethereum to uncover actionable insights tailored to your portfolio.\nThe key takeaway: timing is everything. With market sentiment leaning toward fear, now could be the moment to position yourself before the next bull run. But tread carefully\u2014due diligence and risk management are non-negotiable in this fast-moving arena.\nTo grasp why Ethereum and Solana are stealing the spotlight in 2026, we need to rewind a bit. DeFi exploded onto the scene in 2020, promising a world where financial services\u2014lending, borrowing, trading\u2014could operate without intermediaries. Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities, became the de facto platform, hosting over 70% of DeFi\u2019s total value locked (TVL) at i"

                "body": "The Ethereum price is still faced with tough market challenges, sticking around the levels of $2,981 and failing to break past the area of resistance at $3,050-$3,060. The latest pullback following the liquidity trend at $2,900 has stalled, with major whale addresses unloading more than 270,000 ETH, amounting to over $793 million in five days. Despite the indication that some investors are buying, the presence of overhead supply and larger unloading of coins indicates limited upside potential.\nParallel to this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has now entered the DeFi market as a new entrant. Currently selling for $0.04 in phase 7 of its presale, MUTM has managed to raise $19,600,000 in a relatively short period of time through contributions from 18,660 supporters.\nThe project offers an investment opportunity for investors at a relatively cheap entry cost in the presale phase, where a $400 investment has the potential to multiply returns by 35 times its value, to $14,000, given the successful implementation of the project\u2019s expansion strategies.\nEthereum Faces Strong Resistance\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, remains range-bound at the moment. Technical analysis suggests that the asset is due for correction. The inability to sustain above $3,055 and the subsequent selling pressures emanating from the bigger market players make the chances of a rally remote, and the degree of liquidity present at the level of $2,800 threatens to act as the downside anchor.\nUnlike Mutuum Finance which is setting up the framework for supporting revenue-generating infrastructures, the maturity of Ethereum seems to be causing it problems and investors are now pivoting.\nToken Sale Success\nMutuum Finance has broken the $19,600,000 funding barrier, adding 18,660 members to the community-based presale for the MUTM token. It is currently at Phase 7, where the tokens are priced at $0.04. This phase is filling up fast, which may well symbolize a final buying opportunity at this price before the presale transitions into Phase 8, which will see tokens sold at $0.045.\nThe presale is designed to encourage early participation. Those who got in right at presale launch have seen their holdings grow 300%. The current phase presents the best possible opportunity there ever will be for those who were left out. Those who miss the token now are bound to pay higher as prices keep rising. If Mutuum Finance reaches $0.50, investors who buy today reap an 1150% profit. Those who ignore the opportunity and wait to join along with others when MUTM goes live will see 700% or fewer gains.\nOn top of an unmissable current buy price, Mutuum Finance has a 24-hour leaderboard, which provides a $500 award for the top buyer each day. This is in addition to a running $100,000 giveaway that has encouraged massive participation. This initiative will reward 10 unique presale participants with $10,000 each.\nStablecoin Integration and Growth Opportunities\nMutuum Finance will roll out a stablecoin, which will be pegged one-to-one to the US dollar. This will help create an effective lending system for both borrowers and lenders, all without being exposed to risks associated with market volatility. This will, in return, bring increased liquidity and institutional-level participants, which will help boost revenue and trigger the project\u2019s buyback and distribute system. The importance of this project is that it focuses on real-world utility, with its applications being increasingly realized. Such usability is contributing to its continued interest, thus ensuring that its value proposition is reinforced.\nBorrower\u2019s Loan Terms\nMutuum Finance applies a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of around 75\u201380% for stable tokens like ETH and USDT, while more volatile coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin has an LTV ratio of 35\u201340%. If a borrower\u2019s collateral drops below the safety level, the protocol triggers an automatic liquidation to maintain balance and reliability. This creates a strong DeFi p"

                "body": "Ethereum maintains a crucial position in the DeFi sector. Hence, at present, Ethereum occupies a staggering 68% share of the overall DeFi total value locked (TVL). As per the data from DefiLlama, this robust position of Ethereum dismisses the claims of its decline. Additionally, the respective amount is more than the combined share of the other key blockchain entities and L2 solutions.\nEthereum Dominates DeFi Market with 68% TVL Share\nThe on-chain data reveals that, by occupying nearly 68% of the cumulative DeFi TVL, Ethereum effectively defies the false claims about its decline. Particularly, this dominance surpasses the combined share of the prominent blockchain platforms as well as L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Tron, and Solana. Thus, Solana, which is the 2nd top DeFi project, accounts for just 8.96% of the DeFi TVL share. This figure is far lower than Ethereum\u2019s TVL share.\nSubsequently, Bitcoin has become the 3rd leading project in the DeFi sector, getting a 6.67% share in cumulative TVL. Following that, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) stands in the 4th place. Hence, its DeFi TVL share has reportedly reached 6.46%. The next player on the list of notable DeFi projects in terms of TVL is Tron. Specifically, the current DeFi TVL share of Tron is currently sitting at 4.33%.\nConsistent Growth in DeFi Sector Cements Ethereum\u2019s Position in 2026\nAccording to DefiLlama, Arbitrum is the 6th top DeFi project based on TVL share. It presently has a 2.86% DeFi TVL share. After that, Avalanche has a DeFi TVL share of almost 1.26%. Moreover, Polygon and Vaulta occupy 1.05% and 0.37% share, respectively. At the end of the list, OP Mainnet is the 10th noteworthy DeFi project when it comes to DeFi TVL share. Keeping this in view, the consistent growth of Ethereum cements its position in the DeFi in 2026."

This isn\u2019t just another market cycle\u2014it\u2019s a potential $trillion reboot of how we think about finance, driven by cutting-edge technology and strategic market positioning. As of January 4, 2026, Ethereum is trading at $3,125.61, while Solana sits at $133.28, reflecting incremental daily gains of 0.12% and 0.84%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. What does this mean for the future? For investors, tech enthusiasts, and everyday users, this convergence could unlock unprecedented opportunities\u2014or risks\u2014if you\u2019re not paying attention. Curious about where this is headed? Check the AI analysis to see what data-driven insights reveal about this transformative moment.\nThe DeFi landscape in early 2026 is buzzing with potential, and Ethereum and Solana are at the heart of this revolution. Ethereum continues to dominate with an 11.88% share of the total crypto market, as reported by CoinGecko, cementing its role as the backbone of DeFi applications. Meanwhile, Solana\u2019s rapid ascent, fueled by its high-performance architecture, positions it as a serious contender, with its price reflecting steady growth.\nBut there\u2019s more to the story. The broader market sentiment, as captured by the Fear & Greed Index from Alternative.me, currently sits at a chilling 25, signaling extreme fear. This environment, while daunting, often precedes significant buying opportunities for savvy investors. Both platforms are leveraging technological advancements\u2014Ethereum with its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) transition and Solana with its Proof-of-History mechanism\u2014to address scalability and efficiency, setting the stage for a DeFi resurgence.\nRecent developments show Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum gaining traction, slashing transaction costs. Solana, on the other hand, is making waves with its lightning-fast transactions, appealing to high-frequency DeFi applications. Could this be the tipping point for mainstream adoption? The data suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of something big.\nFor investors, the rise of Ethereum and Solana in the DeFi space is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the potential for explosive growth is undeniable\u2014Ethereum\u2019s deflationary tokenomics post-PoS could drive price appreciation, while Solana\u2019s low-cost, high-speed network attracts a flood of new projects. On the other hand, volatility remains a constant companion in crypto, amplified by regulatory uncertainties and technical hiccups.\nSo, what\u2019s the play? Diversification across both platforms could mitigate risks while capitalizing on their unique strengths. Ethereum offers stability and a mature ecosystem, ideal for long-term holdings. Solana, with its growth trajectory, might appeal to those chasing higher risk-reward ratios. Want to dive deeper into the numbers? Get AI analysis for Ethereum to uncover actionable insights tailored to your portfolio.\nThe key takeaway: timing is everything. With market sentiment leaning toward fear, now could be the moment to position yourself before the next bull run. But tread carefully\u2014due diligence and risk management are non-negotiable in this fast-moving arena.\nTo grasp why Ethereum and Solana are stealing the spotlight in 2026, we need to rewind a bit. DeFi exploded onto the scene in 2020, promising a world where financial services\u2014lending, borrowing, trading\u2014could operate without intermediaries. Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities, became the de facto platform, hosting over 70% of DeFi\u2019s total value locked (TVL) at i"

                "body": "Solana enters 2026 with stronger fundamentals, trading near $125\u2013$128 and backed by rising on-chain revenue and ecosystem growth.\nNetwork upgrades like Firedancer aim to deliver higher speed, stability, and lower fees at scale.\nNFTs, gaming, DeFi, and payments expansion reduce reliance on a single sector and support long-term adoption.\nThe cryptocurrency market enters 2026 with renewed optimism, and Solana stands near the center of attention. After a volatile past marked by technical stress and rapid growth, the network now shows stronger fundamentals, improved technology, and expanding real-world use.\nSOL trades near the $125\u2013$128 range at press time and ranks among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. These numbers show growing confidence among traders, developers, and long-term investors.\nSolana\u2019s biggest strength remains speed, but congestion and outages once weakened trust. The roadmap for 2026 directly addresses those issues. Firedancer, a new validator client, stands as the most important upgrade. Engineers designed this tool to process transactions faster, improve network resilience, and reduce the risk of chain-wide slowdowns.\nAlongside Firedancer, Solana developers plan increases in block space and compute capacity. These changes allow more transactions per block and smoother handling of traffic spikes. These upgrades aim to keep fees low even during heavy demand. If deployment stays on schedule and validators widely adopt the changes, Solana could operate with far fewer disruptions than in earlier cycles.\nSolana ended 2025 among the highest-revenue-generating blockchains based on on-chain activity. That revenue came from transaction fees, decentralized exchange activity, NFT trading, and other application-level usage. Strong revenue signals real demand rather than speculative hype.\nIn 2026, this revenue leadership could attract deeper institutional involvement. Payment processors, trading firms, and fintech platforms increasingly look for fast, low-cost settlement layers. Solana better meets that requirement than many alternatives. Growing revenue also strengthens the long-term value case for SOL, since demand for block space directly links to token utility.\nAlso Read: How Solana is Transforming Web3 Banking\nDecentralized finance no longer defines Solana alone. The ecosystem now supports a wide range of consumer-focused applications. NFTs continue to thrive due to low minting costs and fast confirmation times. Gaming studios favor Solana since it handles frequent in-game transactions without pricing users out.\nPrediction markets and social applications also show strong growth. These platforms attract users who may never touch traditional DeFi tools. As more mobile-first applications launch, daily active wallets could rise steadily throughout 2026. This diversified usage base reduces dependence on any single sector and creates more consistent on-chain activity.\nAnalysts and exchanges project a wide range of price outcomes for SOL in 2026. Some forecasts expect moderate gains, while others point to potential moves into the several-hundred-dollar range. The difference lies in execution and macro conditions, not hype.\nSOL already trades near $125\u2013$130, which shows confidence in the recent recovery. Strong network upgrades, rising revenue, and user growth support a bullish medium-term case. At the same time, crypto markets remain volatile.\nMacroeconomic liquidity, Bitcoin price movements, and broader risk sentiment will still influence SOL\u2019s price. Sharp rallies and corrections should remain part of the landscape throughout the year.\nTechnology alone cannot define Solana\u2019s future. Regulatory clarity will play a major role in 2026. Clear rules around stablecoins, tokenized assets, and custody would allow institutions to integrate Solana-based systems more confidently.\nPayment partnerships represent another deciding factor. Solana promotes a vision of near-instant settlement for digital assets and tokeniz"

The trading trend of SOL indicates that the asset is resilient as the value locked in DeFi is rebounding and developer allocations are returning. Previous stability issues have been overcome in network performance, which forms the basis of appreciation.The technical targets imply 2x and 3x growth with a range of 200-300 level on the current level. Yet Solana faces competition from Ethereum Layer 2 solutions offering similar speed advantages with greater security. History Network outage imposes institutional reluctance to adoption by the enterprise. As Solana regains DeFi momentum, the opportunities of the meme trading infrastructure have better asymmetric profiles.\nBridging the lack of trust and technological doubt is needed to succeed in Solana. Meme infrastructure is used in an existing massive trading economy with no risks of network dependency. At presale pricing of $0.000000175 with more than $7.14M raised and staking yields between 216%, Pepeto (https://pepeto.io/) considered the best crypto to buy builds Ethereum based meme infrastructure while Solana pursues DeFi recovery.\nSolana Recovery Trajectory and Price Targets\nAccording to Solana technical analysis, the price will be between 2026 price is between $200 and $400 on the condition of the growth of the DeFi and its stability in the form of a demonstrated stable network. Existing levels of trading of between $100 and $150 provide 2x to 3x of upside.\nTotal value locked growth is a catalyst to the popularity of DeFi as projects bring about resurrection after the FTX exodus. Ecosystem depth is availed by major DeFi protocols rebuilding on Solana. Jupiter aggregator and Marinade staking exhibit traction of application. Measures of developer activity indicate that the presence of hackathons and grant programs to builders benefits developer activity.\nBut still difficulties exist that curtail loving explosions. There is a lack of trust that is created by network outage history. Several high profile downtimes that cut across the board caused bad reputation. What the institutional participants need is regular uptime before investing huge capital.\nCompetition from Ethereum Layer 2 solutions intensifies. Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base offer similar transaction speeds with Ethereum security backing. This splits high performance blockchain demand on numerous networks. FTX association is still forming marketing difficulties. Solana brand had to deal with FTX downfall and SBF criminal charges, which had devastated its technical recovery. It takes years of reliable functioning and development of the ecosystem to restore institutional confidence.\nPepeto Ethereum Foundation Eliminating Network Risk\nPepeto (https://pepeto.io/) builds on Ethereum mainnet eliminating network outage vulnerabilities affecting Solana projects. Ethereum decade plus operational history demonstrates reliability. Validators are thousands of people who make real decentralization vs. Solana smaller set. There are no downtime patterns in infrastructure.\nZero fee swaps through PepetoSwap built on proven Ethereum foundation require no network stability assumptions. The Pepeto Bridge connects established chains rather than experimental networks. The Pepeto Exchange with more than 850 project applications attracts projects prioritizing reliability over pure performance.\nCommunity with more than 100K members is sustained with a strong security base with no worries of failure to address the community. Capital raised surpassing $7.14M reflects participant preference for Ethereum reliability. Staking yields between 216% operate through audited Ethereum contracts from SolidProof and Coinsult.\nMeme trading infrastructure can be used to serve an existing market without necessarily having to "

                "body": "NASDAQ, S&P 500 Mixed as Dow Rises 319 Points in Holiday-Shortened Trading Week\nThe NASDAQ closed the holiday-shortened trading week on a mixed note, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by 319 points, showing strength in traditional and value-focused stocks. The S&P 500 ended slightly mixed, reflecting investor caution as markets balance optimism for 2026 growth with near-term uncertainty around interest rates, earnings guidance, and global demand.\nThis trading week was shorter due to the New Year holiday, which often brings lower volumes and sharper moves. Even so, the market action revealed important signals about sector rotation, investor confidence, and expectations for the year ahead. Technology shares showed uneven movement, while industrials, financials, and select AI-driven names supported broader sentiment.\nWhy did the Dow outperform while the NASDAQ stayed mixed? The answer lies in earnings visibility, valuation comfort, and investor preference for stability as the new year begins.\nMarket Snapshot: How NASDAQ, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Performed\nThe NASDAQ Composite ended the week slightly lower after early gains faded. Mega-cap tech stocks showed mixed performance as investors locked in profits following a strong late 2025 rally. In contrast, the Dow Jones gained momentum, driven by strength in industrials, healthcare, and select financial stocks.\nAccording to market data, the Dow rose about 1 percent for the week, while the S&P 500 hovered near flat territory. The NASDAQ underperformed relative to peers as high-growth stocks faced valuation pressure.\nA Reuters post shared on social media highlighted this divergence clearly, noting that US markets started 2026 with a rotation into value-oriented stocks and defensive plays, reflecting cautious optimism rather than outright risk-taking.\nInvestors are repositioning, not exiting.\nWhy NASDAQ Lagged While Dow Jones Gained Strength\nThe NASDAQ is heavily weighted toward technology and growth stocks. These stocks benefited strongly in 2025, especially companies tied to artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As 2026 begins, some investors are pausing to reassess prices.\nMany large tech stocks are trading above long-term averages. That does not mean investors have lost faith, but it does mean expectations are higher. Even small disappointments can trigger pullbacks.\nAt the same time, Dow components offer steady earnings, dividends, and predictable cash flows. In a holiday-shortened week with thin trading volumes, investors often prefer stability.\nA Zee Business tweet shared during the session explained that institutional money was flowing into blue-chip stocks, supporting the Dow Jones rally while keeping the NASDAQ range-bound.\nS&P 500 Reflects a Balanced Market Mood\nThe S&P 500 often serves as the best mirror of overall market sentiment. This week, it reflected balance rather than fear or euphoria.\nGains in energy, healthcare, and industrial stocks were offset by weakness in some technology and consumer discretionary names. This pushed the index into a narrow range.\nWhy is this important? Because it shows the market is not panicking. Instead, investors are selectively buying stocks with strong fundamentals while trimming exposure where valuations look stretched.\nAn iTradePH post on social media noted that global investors remain constructive on US equities but are choosing stocks carefully as macro data evolves.\nAI Stocks Drive Selective Optimism\nArtificial intelligence remains a major theme across US markets. AI-related companies helped limit downside pressure, even as broader tech stocks paused.\nMentions of AI Stock, AI Stock research, and AI stock analysis continue to dominate investor conversations, especially around earnings forecasts for 2026. Analysts expect AI infrastructure spending to remain strong, supporting chipmakers, cloud platforms, and enterprise software firms.\nHowever, not all AI stocks moved higher this week. Investors a"

Oil prices have declined due to an oversupplied global oil market,\u201d said Rob Hummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Management, said in a note. \u201cThe current events in Venezuela don\u2019t change this dynamic.\u201d\nU.S. oil futures rose 0.19% to $57.43 a barrel, and Brent crude climbed 0.28% to $60.92 a barrel, with both benchmarks reversing earlier losses.\nOPEC+ also backed plans to keep production steady through the first quarter and hold off on any further hikes, as oil markets still face a supply glut.\nFutures tied to the Dow Jones industrial average were essentially flat, down 5 points. S&P 500 futures were up 0.10%, and Nasdaq futures added 0.32%.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury was unchanged at 4.191%. The U.S. dollar was up 0.14% against the euro and up 0.22% against the yen.\nGold rallied 1.7% to $4,403.70 per ounce, and silver jumped 5.4% to $74.86. Bitcoin edged up 2.3% to $92,265.\nAfter the successful Venezuela raid, Trump said he is still eyeing Greenland and warned Cuba is \u201cvery similar\u201d to the Maduro regime.\nBut the economic calendar may bring his focus back on the U.S. economy rather than more foreign adventures. The upcoming batch of numbers is also highly anticipated as they will largely be free from distortions related to the government shutdown.\nOn Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing activity index. On Wednesday, ADP puts out its private-sector payroll report, and the Labor Department publishes job opening and turnover report.\nAnd on Friday, the Labor Department will issue its monthly jobs report, with Wall Street expecting a gain of just 54,000 and another increase in the unemployment rate to 4.7%."

The stock traded between $289.00 and $297.57 and remains below its 52-week high of $324.90, according to market data. Investing\nThe early-year stumble matters because IBM sits at the intersection of enterprise software, infrastructure and consulting, where sentiment can turn quickly when budgets tighten. With U.S. markets closed for the weekend, investors are mapping out the next set of macro and company checkpoints that typically reset positioning.\nIBM\u2019s investor calendar lists Jan. 28 as a preliminary date for its fourth-quarter earnings announcement. The update is expected to refocus attention on software growth, consulting demand and the pace at which IBM is turning corporate AI spending into revenue and cash. IBM\nFrom a technical standpoint, traders have marked Friday\u2019s low near $289 as near-term support, with the high-$290s acting as a first resistance zone.

                "body": "On Friday (2 January), the FTSE 100 finally broke through the 10,000 barrier for the first time in history. It capped a brilliant 12 months for UK shares, but it does raise one worry for many investors. Are they too late to benefit from its resurgence?\nMy short answer is no. For those happy to chase momentum, I think the FTSE 100 could still have further to run as global investors wake up to what they\u2019ve been missing. And for those, like me, who prefer buying stocks when they\u2019re undervalued and out of fashion, there are still plenty to choose from.\nBlue-chips are red hot\nThe UK\u2019s benchmark blue-chip index rose 21.5% last year, having started 2025 at just over 8,260. All dividends are on top. With the average trailing yield north of 3%, the total return was closer to 25%.\nAfter years of being ignored in favour of big, brash Wall Street mega-caps, blue-chips are finally back in fashion. As concerns grow about froth in US tech, investors have started to diversify and many seem genuinely surprised by how undervalued UK shares are.\nPersonally, I\u2019m delighted. I\u2019ve been filling my boots from the FTSE 100 in recent years, especially high-yield dividend stocks. I\u2019ve locked in yields of up to 10% and I\u2019m now enjoying capital growth as well.\nI\u2019ve still got cash sitting in my trading account, and I\u2019m weighing up where to deploy it next. I favour undervalued shares, and I still see plenty of those around.\nThe FTSE 100 trades on an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 14.9, although some put it closer to 17.7. Either way, that\u2019s hardly demanding, and miles cheaper than the S&P 500 on roughly 27.4. I don\u2019t buy the index itself though. I prefer individual shares, many of which look far cheaper still.\nJD Sports Fashion is one of the most striking examples, trading on a P/E of just 6.9. Its shares have struggled as cash-strapped consumers rein in spending and key partner Nike struggles, but I hold the stock and back it to recover over time.\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group shares fly\nAirlines also look cheap. Budget carrier easyJet trades on a P/E of just 7.7, while International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE: IAG) stands at 8.7.\nFive more FTSE 100 stocks have P/Es below 10. Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Centrica are both on 9.2, BT Group sits at 9.8, while Shell and cigarette maker Imperial Brands trade at 9.9.\nI bought International Consolidated Airlines Group last year. Its shares climbed almost 40% in 2025 and are up 240% over three years as flying demand recovers strongly after the pandemic."

Volume was light and the stock remains 27.75% below its 52-week high. MarketWatch\nThe underperformance comes as UK equities began 2026 with a symbolic milestone, with the FTSE 100 briefly crossing 10,000 for the first time on the year\u2019s first trading day. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be going into 2026 with a good news story,\u201d said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. Reuters\nWhy it matters now: investors are re-testing UK exposure after the FTSE 100\u2019s strong 2025 run, while London\u2019s market still faces scrutiny over listings and liquidity after years of muted initial public offerings. A sustained shift in sentiment can flow through to firms tied to trading and capital raising. Reuters\nFriday\u2019s gains were concentrated. Defence and aerospace stocks led the advance, while real estate and construction names fell after data from Nationwide Building Society showed UK house prices unexpectedly dropped 0.4% in December. Reuters\nLSEG disclosed new buyback activity in a regulatory filing, saying it purchased 35,000 shares on Dec. 31 at an average price of 8,960.04 pence per share through Citigroup Global Markets as part of a programme announced in November. LSEG said it intends to cancel the repurchased shares. TradingView\nA share buyback is when a company repurchases its own stock, often cancelling the shares to reduce the number outstanding. That can lift earnings per share, but it does not change the underlying business trends that investors will be watching into results season.\nLSEG is a global financial markets infrastructure and data provider, spanning market data and analytics, index services through FTSE Russell, and trading and post-trade services. That mix means investors tend to track indicators such as market activity and new issuance alongside subscription-style revenue lines. Reuters\nBefore next session, the next major swing factor for global risk appetite is U.S. macro data, with the monthly employment report due on Jan. 9 and U.S. CPI inflation data due on Jan. 13, Reuters reported. Fed funds futures indicated little chance of a cut at the late-January meeting, but nearly a 50% probability of a quarter-point reduction in March. Reuters\nFor LSEG, traders will also watch whether the shares can stabilise around the \u00a388 area when London trading resumes on Monday and test the \u00a390 round number. With volumes thin around the holidays, price action can look sharper than usual on modest flows.\nThe next clear company catalyst is LSEG\u2019s full-year results on Feb. 26, when management is expected to update investors on execution and shareholder returns. In October, the company pointed to organic income growth of 6.5%\u20137.5% (excluding recoveries) and equity free cash flow of at least \u00a32.4 billion as key targets. LSEG"

                "body": "January 04: PwC Extends DAX Audit Lead as EY Loses Key Mandates\nPwC has extended its lead in DAX audit mandates, reaching 42.5%, while EY is set to drop to 7.5% as auditor rotation rules and the EY Wirecard fallout reshape choices at Germany\u2019s largest companies. For investors in Germany, audit stability and quality matter. Changes in audit firms can influence fees, internal controls focus, and assurance on ESG data. We explain what the new split means, what to watch in annual reports, and how this could affect governance and risk in 2026.\nDAX audit mandates shift: who gains, who loses\nRecent data show PwC holds 42.5% of DAX audit mandates, widening its lead, while EY\u2019s share is set to fall to 7.5%. The split reflects scheduled tenders and committee choices after the EY Wirecard fallout. Cross border teams and audit tech also matter in complex groups. German blue chips seek scale, sector depth, and consistent quality across Europe when awarding long contracts, as reported by Handelsblatt.\nMandatory auditor rotation rules typically cap tenures around ten years, with limited extensions in the EU. That means periodic contests where experience, independence, and price are weighed. Boards also evaluate audit quality indicators, staff continuity, and global coverage. After high profile cases, committees seek clearer reporting on key audit matters and internal controls. For DAX committees, PwC and peers are assessed on sector expertise and delivery depth.\nImpact on audit fees and quality for German investors\nMore share for PwC and other leaders can influence pricing, but competition among the Big Four keeps pressure on rates. Complex groups, carve outs, and IT controls add work, which can lift fees in euros. Tender timing matters too. Investors should compare year over year audit and non audit fee lines and ask why changes happened, especially when the auditor switched.\nLook for clear materiality levels, concise key audit matters, and specific findings on revenue, provisioning, and IT controls. Stable partner rotation and lower staff turnover can support consistency. Fewer restatements and strong internal control opinions are positive signs. If audit fees drop sharply after a change, read the committee\u2019s explanation and consider whether scope or coverage also changed.\nEY Wirecard fallout and governance scrutiny\nEY Wirecard fallout still weighs on mandate wins. Several boards favor alternative firms to reset oversight and restore trust. Regulators increased checks on audits and documentation. While EY retains global scale, perception risk can reduce close contests. Analysts expect share to stabilise once legacy issues fade, but the current trend supports rivals like PwC, as noted by InvestmentWeek.\nGermany strengthened audit oversight after past failures. APAS and BaFin tightened enforcement, and audit committees disclose more about selection and fees. Shareholders also vote on the auditor at the AGM. We expect more detailed audit reports and clearer ESG assurance scopes. Better disclosure helps investors judge whether the chosen firm, including PwC or its peers, fits the company\u2019s risk profile.\nThe next rotation cycle: what to expect\nUnder EU rules, audit firm tenure is usually limited to about ten years, with possible extensions after a tender or joint audit in some cases. Many DAX groups will approach new tender windows over the next few years. Expect more split outcomes across sectors, plus joint audit pilots in complex groups where boards want an extra layer of assurance.\nA shift toward PwC in audits can reshape consulting revenue. Independence rules limit non audit services at audit clients. However, a larger audit footprint improves access to boardrooms and may lift advisory work at non audit clients. Expect firms to rebalance between assurance, tax, and deals. Watch disclosed non audit fee ratios to judge compliance and revenue mix.\nFinal Thoughts\nPwC\u2019s larger share of DAX audit mandates at 42.5%, with EY near 7.5%, signals a m"

                "body": "We think that it's fair to say that the possibility of finding fantastic multi-year winners is what motivates many investors. Mistakes are inevitable, but a single top stock pick can cover any losses, and so much more. One such superstar is Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), which saw its share price soar 316% in three years. It's also good to see the share price up 24% over the last quarter.\nSince it's been a strong week for Lam Research shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring three years of share price growth, Lam Research achieved compound earnings per share growth of 9.8% per year. In comparison, the 61% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Lam Research has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\nWhat About Dividends?\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Lam Research's TSR for the last 3 years was 329%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\nA Different Perspective\nIt's good to see that Lam Research has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 149% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 31% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Lam Research .\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Lam Research might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "NASDAQ, S&P 500 Mixed as Dow Rises 319 Points in Holiday-Shortened Trading Week\nThe NASDAQ closed the holiday-shortened trading week on a mixed note, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by 319 points, showing strength in traditional and value-focused stocks. The S&P 500 ended slightly mixed, reflecting investor caution as markets balance optimism for 2026 growth with near-term uncertainty around interest rates, earnings guidance, and global demand.\nThis trading week was shorter due to the New Year holiday, which often brings lower volumes and sharper moves. Even so, the market action revealed important signals about sector rotation, investor confidence, and expectations for the year ahead. Technology shares showed uneven movement, while industrials, financials, and select AI-driven names supported broader sentiment.\nWhy did the Dow outperform while the NASDAQ stayed mixed? The answer lies in earnings visibility, valuation comfort, and investor preference for stability as the new year begins.\nMarket Snapshot: How NASDAQ, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Performed\nThe NASDAQ Composite ended the week slightly lower after early gains faded. Mega-cap tech stocks showed mixed performance as investors locked in profits following a strong late 2025 rally. In contrast, the Dow Jones gained momentum, driven by strength in industrials, healthcare, and select financial stocks.\nAccording to market data, the Dow rose about 1 percent for the week, while the S&P 500 hovered near flat territory. The NASDAQ underperformed relative to peers as high-growth stocks faced valuation pressure.\nA Reuters post shared on social media highlighted this divergence clearly, noting that US markets started 2026 with a rotation into value-oriented stocks and defensive plays, reflecting cautious optimism rather than outright risk-taking.\nInvestors are repositioning, not exiting.\nWhy NASDAQ Lagged While Dow Jones Gained Strength\nThe NASDAQ is heavily weighted toward technology and growth stocks. These stocks benefited strongly in 2025, especially companies tied to artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As 2026 begins, some investors are pausing to reassess prices.\nMany large tech stocks are trading above long-term averages. That does not mean investors have lost faith, but it does mean expectations are higher. Even small disappointments can trigger pullbacks.\nAt the same time, Dow components offer steady earnings, dividends, and predictable cash flows. In a holiday-shortened week with thin trading volumes, investors often prefer stability.\nA Zee Business tweet shared during the session explained that institutional money was flowing into blue-chip stocks, supporting the Dow Jones rally while keeping the NASDAQ range-bound.\nS&P 500 Reflects a Balanced Market Mood\nThe S&P 500 often serves as the best mirror of overall market sentiment. This week, it reflected balance rather than fear or euphoria.\nGains in energy, healthcare, and industrial stocks were offset by weakness in some technology and consumer discretionary names. This pushed the index into a narrow range.\nWhy is this important? Because it shows the market is not panicking. Instead, investors are selectively buying stocks with strong fundamentals while trimming exposure where valuations look stretched.\nAn iTradePH post on social media noted that global investors remain constructive on US equities but are choosing stocks carefully as macro data evolves.\nAI Stocks Drive Selective Optimism\nArtificial intelligence remains a major theme across US markets. AI-related companies helped limit downside pressure, even as broader tech stocks paused.\nMentions of AI Stock, AI Stock research, and AI stock analysis continue to dominate investor conversations, especially around earnings forecasts for 2026. Analysts expect AI infrastructure spending to remain strong, supporting chipmakers, cloud platforms, and enterprise software firms.\nHowever, not all AI stocks moved higher this week. Investors a"

We don't want another war. We're tired of forever wars. We're tired of wars for oil. We're tired of people losing their lives for oil.\n\"This is a clear sign that Trump wants to force Venezuela to do what the U.S. wants and as the Detroit anti-War Committee we reject that.\n\"We reject all U.S. wars, interventions and sanctions because we think that they're just ways in which the United States gets to influence other countries and force its will upon them. We've seen that time and time again with Iraq, Afghanistan, even Palestine,\" Pico said.\nState Sen. Jim Runestad, chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, said he wasn't aware of the protest and declined to comment.\nSean Schaefer of Rochester, 26, held a sign with that read \"America's Most Wanted\" with a contorted picture of President Donald Trump. Schaefer thinks the U.S. should not be involved in criminalizing the leadership of Venezuela.\nSchaefer has a background in campaign finance organizing and stood on the corner of Michigan and Cass avenues with about 20 other anti-war activists.\n\"I think there's a lot of U.S. intervention globally. He (Trump) claimed to be the 'president of no war,' and that's clearly not happening,\" Schaefer said. \"We've got a huge healthcare crisis. ... They didn't have billions for that, but they have billions for a coup in another country.\"\n\"I would like to see the U.S. out of Venezuela. I think that's up to the people of Venezuela to decide what happens,\" he said.\n\"It's a crime. The legitimate elected president of Venezuela, ... the internationally recognized president of that country was kidnapped. He was stolen from his country. Just absolute war crimes and that's what I see it's an attack on the Venezuelan people.\n\"It's a bold face 21st century imperialism,\" said Jackson Robak, a leader in the socialist organization. \"I want to see Maduro be freed and brought back to his country.\"\nmjohnson@detroitnews.com"

                "body": "DENVER \u2014 A massive fire at a construction site for a Denver apartment complex forced evacuations for nearby residents on Friday evening and injured one firefighter, officials said.\nRobert Murphy, operations division chief for Denver Fire Department, explained that more than 100 firefighters from various agencies in the Denver metro area responded to the blaze, which broke out around 6:45 p.m. Friday near S. Leetsdale Drive and S. Forest Street.\n\u201cThis fire ran freely from one end of this building to the (other),\" he said. \"It\u2019s a complete city block and it is on fire.\u201d\nDenver7's news helicopter flew over the scene on Friday night. Below is a sped-up timelapse of what we saw.\nHe said firefighters arrived at the scene to find the west end of a three-story apartment complex, which was under construction, fully engulfed in flames. The fire continued to push its way eastward through the building as firefighters set up to control it.\n\u201cThere was a little bit of wind when this fire first came in,\" Murphy said. \"A fire of this size actually generates kind of its own mini wind and starts pushing those embers out. When I arrived, those embers completely covered my car. That has since died down. That was when the fire was at its peak.\u201d\nInitially, authorities said no injuries were reported but the Denver Fire Department later posted on social media that one firefighter had been hurt and was transported to Denver Health. There were no other reported injuries, but Murphy said firefighters have not been able to safely enter the building and confirm nobody was inside. A chainlink fence was around the building to keep anybody outside of construction crews from going onto the site, Murphy said.\nThe Denver Police Department issued evacuations for residents behind the apartments due to the heat from the fire. As of 9:30 p.m., that is still in place, but Murphy said the fire department is no longer worried about the fire moving outside the burned structure. He said residents should be able to return home Friday evening.\nThere was \"a lot of exposure\" to neighboring buildings at the fire's peak, he said.\n\u201cThe damage is massive,\" he said of the construction site. \"I am not a building engineer, but there is a lot of fire and it is running completely through that building. As you can see, we have water pouring in from every angle that we can, trying to knock that fire down. There is a lot of damage.\u201d\nHe said the apartment complex did not have any drywall to slow the fire's progress, and was not yet outfitted with a sprinkler system.\nWitnesses captured the below videos of Friday evening's fire.\nThe fire was the biggest he has seen in Denver in a long time, he said.\n\u201cThis has really reached the level of about a five-alarm fire, which is huge for Denver,\" he explained.\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation. Fire investigators are at the scene.\nLeetsdale Drive is closed in both directions, according to the Denver Police Department. Murphy said the road closures will likely stay in place through the night because deep-seeded fires are still burning in the apartment units.\nAs of 9:30 p.m., he said about 70% of the fire has been knocked down.\nDenver7's Claire Lavezzorio went to the scene and spoke with families in the neighborhood, who said power was turned off and firefighters knocked on their doors telling them to evacuate.\nResident Sean Horan said he walked out of his neighbors' house to see a small orange glow. Just a few minutes later, he said he saw flames that he estimated were 150 feet tall when compared to trees near the burning structure.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re not sure if we can even get back to our houses,\" added neighbor Michael Weiss. \"The whole street is barricaded off... It\u2019s really, really scary.\u201d\nHoran said a large apartment complex was under construction in the area, and he suspected that was what had caught fire.\nHe said it did not look like it had spread to any trees in the area.\n\u201cWaiting out here, looking at this, is pretty depressing,\" We"

U.S. futures were flat after stocks eked out small gains Friday on Wall Street.\nShortly after trading began, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose slightly. But it later was trading 23 cents lower at $57.09 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 17 cents to $60.58 per barrel.\nAfter years of neglect and international sanctions, Venezuela's oil industry is in disrepair. It could take years and major investments before production can increase dramatically. But some analysts expect Venezuela could double or triple its current output of about 1.1 million barrels of oil a day to return to historic levels fairly quickly.\nWith oil levels already plentiful, crude has been trading at its lowest level in about six months.\nIn any case, the U.S. move was reverberating through financial markets as traders maneuvered to account for the uncertainty brought on President Donald Trump's unusual military operation and his insistence that the U.S. will be running Venezuela following its Maduro's ouster.\nThe price of gold rose 1.9%, while silver jumped 5.7%.\nSuch assets are often considered safe havens in times of geopolitical turmoil.\n\u201cInvestors are happy to own risk, but they want insurance in the drawer.

The index closed at a year end high for 2025 and only resumed trading on Monday.\n\u201cLooking at the environment surrounding the markets, continuously, there are various risk factors.

It had ended Friday with a record high close.\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.1% to 8,733.30, while Taiwan's benchmark climbed 2.9%.\nIn other trading early Monday, the dollar rose to 157.27 Japanese yen from 156.82 yen.

The index was weighed down by a 2.2% loss for Microsoft and a 2.6% decline for Tesla, after it reported falling sales for a second year in a row.\nNvidia, Microsoft and Tesla are among the most valuable companies in the world and their outsized valuations give them more influence on the stock market's direction. That includes sometimes pushing the market up and down from hour to hour.\nFurniture companies gained ground following President Donald Trump's move to delay increased tariffs on upholstered furniture. RH rose 8% and Wayfair rose 6.1%.\nThis week is the first full week of the new year. It will bring several closely watched economic updates, some of the last big updates the Fed sees before its next meeting at the end of January.\nOn the agenda are private reports on the status of the services sector, which is the largest part of the U.S. economy, along with consumer sentiment. Government reports on the job market will also be released. The hope is they'll help paint a clearer picture of how various parts of the U.S. economy closed out 2025 and where it might be headed in 2026."

Dollar strength was evident against the euro and sterling, but the move in USD/JPY was particularly notable, with the pair edging back toward the upper end of its recent range as yield differentials continued to favour the greenback.\nThe dollar rose to around \u00a5156.90 ... and above 157.00 as I update .... extending gains against the yen as markets maintained a cautious stance on the near-term outlook for Japanese monetary policy. While the Bank of Japan has taken incremental steps toward policy normalisation, investors remain unconvinced that the pace of tightening will be sufficient to materially support the currency in the short term, particularly against a still-resilient US economy and potential Fed pause.\nDollar strength elsewhere was more modest. The euro slipped toward $1.1705, its weakest level in more than three weeks, while sterling edged lower to around $1.3440. Overall currency moves were contained, though risk sentiment remained sensitive to geopolitical developments following the United States\u2019 high-profile operation in Venezuela over the weekend.\nFor yen traders, however, macro fundamentals remained, and will remain, the dominant driver. Markets continue to price in one or two interest-rate cuts from the divided Federal Open Market Committee. That gap in expectations has kept US yields elevated relative to Japanese rates, reinforcing downward pressure on the yen.\nAttention now turns to a heavy US data calendar that could further influence rate expectations and, by extension, USD/JPY. The week begins with the ISM surveys and culminates in Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls report, which will be closely watched for confirmation that US labour market momentum is easing in a way that would justify further Fed easing.\nUntil clearer evidence emerges of a decisive slowdown in US activity, or a more assertive tightening signal from Tokyo, the yen is likely to remain vulnerable. The persistence of wide rate differentials, coupled with global investors\u2019 preference for dollar exposure at the start of the year, suggests that rallies in the Japanese currency may continue to be shallow and short-lived.\n---\nNikkei update:"
