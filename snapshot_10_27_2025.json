This week, a robust US dollar hit a multi-week high against the yen, making gold less appealing\u2014and pricier\u2014for overseas buyers. Positive signals from US and Chinese officials engaging in fresh trade negotiations helped ease global anxiety, nudging gold and US gold futures lower. Expectations for a 0.25 percentage point rate cut from the Federal Reserve added to the uncertainty, though softened US inflation and a wait-and-see approach from Indian buyers kept upward pressure in check. At the same time, Chinese and Singaporean demand picked up on price dips, while institutional investors pulled back\u2014evident as SPDR Gold Trust holdings fell 0.52%. Meanwhile, silver, platinum, and palladium saw mixed moves, showing how volatile the precious metals scene can get. Eyes will be on US and European economic data releases to see if this trend sticks.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Shifting safe-haven demand redirects flows.\nGold\u2019s reputation as a go-to in tough times slipped as the dollar strengthened and hopes for smoother US-China ties took center stage. The slide in institutional demand\u2014evident in SPDR Gold Trust\u2019s latest drop\u2014underscores how quickly investors adjust their portfolios in response to changing risk appetites. And with silver and platinum moving in different directions, the whole precious metals space is showing signs of divergence that could keep market watchers on their toes.\nThe bigger picture: Trade talks and rate moves set the tone.\nProgress in US-China discussions has the potential to reshape the global investment landscape and play into currency shifts, which could keep gold under pressure. While expected interest rate cuts from the Fed usually prop up the metal, softer inflation and a strong dollar are complicating that story. Factor in cautious buyers in India and more eager ones in China and Singapore, and it's clear that gold\u2019s trajectory is tightly linked to global economic turns and the next round of data from major economies.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "BEIJING, Oct. 27 (China Economic Net) - Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, recently published a post on social media X titled My Answers to Your Questions About Gold, stating that \u201cgold is beginning to replace U.S. Treasuries as a risk-free asset.\u201d\nCoincidentally, JPMorgan analysts maintained their bullish outlook on gold on Thursday, predicting prices will rise to an average of $5,055 an ounce by the fourth quarter of 2026, up about 15% from Monday's record high of $4,381.\nThe bank pointed out in the report that this forecast is based on the assumption that global investors and central banks' quarterly gold purchasing demand will remain at around 566 tons in 2026, becoming the core driving force for pushing up gold prices. And recently, the proportion of gold in global central bank reserve assets has increased rapidly, while the share of the US dollar has declined.\nGold as the new risk-free asset\nData speaks for itself. The trend of accelerating diversification of global reserve assets has been further confirmed. A recent Deutsche Bank report indicates that, taking into account current spot gold prices, the proportion of gold reserves in total central bank foreign exchange and gold reserves has rapidly increased from 24% at the end of June this year to 30% today, while in the same period, the US dollar's share has fallen from 43% to 40%. This suggests that gold's appeal as a reserve asset is growing, while the dollar's dominance is weakening. The report also states that if the gold price rises to $5,790 per ounce, assuming current holdings remain unchanged, its share will equal that of the US dollar.\nGold rises to 30% of global FX + gold reserve holdings [Deutsche Bank]\n\u201cCombining the gold purchasing intentions reported by central banks and the expectations of global reserve managers, their willingness to increase gold reserves has increased, which is in line with the key drivers of the gold bull market this year,\u201d Ma Wei, assistant researcher at the Institute of American Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told China Economic Net.\nAccording to statistics from the World Gold Council, benefiting from the continuous gold purchases by central banks in recent years and the record highs in international gold prices, as of the end of the second quarter of this year, the global official gold reserves (excluding the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements) comparable to the global official foreign exchange reserves were worth $386.42 billion, slightly exceeding for the first time the official foreign holdings of US Treasury bonds balance of $381.91 billion as measured by the US Treasury's International Capital Flows Report (TIC).\n\u201cHistory shows us that the biggest risk is that debt assets like U.S. Treasuries will either be defaulted on or devalued, more likely devalued. History has also shown that gold is a money and store-hold of wealth that has intrinsic value, so it doesn\u2019t depend on anyone giving the holder of it anything other than the gold itself,\u201d Dalio stated.\nThe evolution of global reserve asset diversification\nWhy is gold returning to the core?\n\u201cThe core motivation lies in the dual drive of safe-haven demand and 'de-dollarization'. Currently, the US dollar credit system is facing structural pressure, and many central banks are seeking to diversify their reserve asset portfolios to reduce their dependence on a single currency,\u201d Ma said.\nAccording to the latest data on the currency composition of global foreign exchange reserves (COFER) disclosed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as of the end of the second quarter of this year, the proportion of the US dollar in the global foreign exchange reserves with disclosed currency composition fell from 57.79% at the end of the previous quarter to 56.32%, a drop of 1.47 percentage points. Its reserve share has been below 60% for 11 consecutive quarters, further hitting a new low in 30 years.\nGregory Shearer, head of ba"

Cipolaro said that expectations of inflation are a \u201cbetter indicator\u201d for Bitcoin (BTC) but are still not closely correlated.\nBitcoin proponents have long lauded that Bitcoin is \u201cdigital gold\u201d and a hedge against inflation due to its hard fixed supply and being a decentralized asset. However, it has recently become more ingrained and correlated with the traditional finance system.\nCipolaro added that real gold isn\u2019t much better as an inflation hedge, as it has an inverse correlation with inflation and has been inconsistent across periods, which he said was \u201csurprising for an inflation protection hedge.\u201d\nWeakening dollar a boon to Bitcoin, gold\nCipolaro said that gold has typically risen as the US dollar has fallen, as measured against other currencies using the US Dollar Index.\n\u201cBitcoin also has an inverse correlation to the US dollar,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile the relationship is a bit less consistent and newer than gold\u2019s, the trend is there.\u201d\nCipolaro said NYDIG expects Bitcoin\u2019s inverse correlation with the dollar to strengthen as the asset becomes \u201cmore embedded in the traditional financial market ecosystem.\u201d\nInterest rates, money supply the real Bitcoin mover\nInterest rates and the money supply were the two major macroeconomic factors that Cipolaro said impacted the movements of Bitcoin and gold.\nGold has typically risen on falling interest rates and fallen when interest rates have risen. That same relationship, Cipolaro said, \u201chas emerged and strengthened over time\u201d for Bitcoin too.\nHe added the relation between global monetary policy and Bitcoin has also been \u201cpersistently positive\u201d and strong over the years, with looser monetary policies typically being a boon to Bitcoin.\nCipolaro said that Bitcoin\u2019s similar price movements to gold, relative to macroeconomic conditions, show its \u201cgrowing integration into the global monetary and financial landscape.\u201d\n\u201cIf we were to summarize how to think about each asset from a macro factor perspective, it is that gold serves as a real-rate hedge, whereas Bitcoin has evolved into a liquidity barometer,\u201d he added."

                "body": "Seeking a $10 billion loan, the Middle Eastern oil tycoon is having a tough time.\n01 Even the Wealthy Run Out of Resources\nThe falling oil prices have made life tough for the oil-rich countries in the Middle East.\nRecently, Saudi Arabia was reported to be seeking a huge loan of about $10 billion from several major Wall Street banks. This is also the largest public loan Saudi Arabia has taken in recent years. How could the Middle Eastern country, known for its wealth, suddenly rely on loans? Is it possible that even the oil-rich kingdom is running out of resources?\nAlthough Saudi Arabia is far from the poverty line, its fiscal situation has indeed faced some problems in recent years. In the first quarter of this year, Saudi Arabia recorded a fiscal deficit of over $3.3 billion, continuing the downward trend of a deficit of about $30 billion throughout 2024. Official forecasts suggest that the country will continue to face fiscal deficits in the coming years.\nAs a country built on oil fields, the root cause of Saudi Arabia's current financial difficulties is clearly related to the fluctuations in international oil prices. Affected by the global economic downturn, weakening demand, and increased oil production in the Americas, the price of Brent crude oil has dropped from over $80 per barrel to around $65 per barrel in the past year. This is far below the $90 per barrel safety line required for Saudi Arabia to maintain fiscal balance.\nTo stabilize oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+), led by Saudi Arabia, have frequently resorted to production cuts in recent years to save themselves. They have attempted to maintain prices by controlling oil supply. However, the market does not seem to buy into these measures. The International Energy Agency has previously stated that even if OPEC+ does not increase production at all, the global oil market will face an oversupply by 2025. Therefore, after several years of daily production cuts of 2.2 million barrels with no obvious results, the OPEC+ member countries reached a consensus. Instead of leaving the oil unsold, they decided to increase production to maintain their market share. Starting from the middle of this year, they gradually resumed increasing production.\nWith the end of the production cut standoff, the major oil-producing countries in the Middle East have returned to their prosperous days of making easy money from oil. However, for Saudi Arabia, which is currently in a critical stage of national transformation and in urgent need of funds, this is not necessarily good news.\nAs one of the most active new players in the international investment market, Saudi Arabia's name has frequently appeared in various emerging industries around the world in recent years. From artificial intelligence and chip manufacturing to new energy vehicles and the sports and e-sports industries, Saudi Arabia has invested in almost all growth projects where it can pour in money.\nFrom a country relying solely on oil to an active participant in emerging industries, Saudi Arabia has adopted an aggressive investment strategy in recent years, both at home and abroad. The aim is to reduce the country's dependence on oil and achieve economic diversification. Behind all these costly and radical reforms, there is a key figure: Mohammed bin Salman, the 40-year-old Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\nIn January 2015, Salman, over 80 years old, succeeded the late Abdullah and became the new king of Saudi Arabia. Two years after taking office, Salman changed the traditional inheritance pattern of the Saudi royal family from \"brother-to-brother succession\" and officially appointed Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who already held significant military, administrative, and financial power, as the new Crown Prince.\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia (left) and King Salman of Saudi Arabia (right)\nAs an executor of his father's will and a firm reformer, Salman proposed th"

Scale matters, diversity matters, and we are going through a natural cycle of that in the business,\u201d Lance added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s healthy for our business. It\u2019s the right thing to be doing for our business,\u201d according to ConocoPhillips\u2019 top executive.\nThe consolidation wave is now receding, and the wave of streamlining and cost-cutting is underway among the major U.S. and European oil firms.\nThe U.S. shale patch is seeing the deepest jobs cuts in three years as producers respond to lower oil prices with slowing drilling activity and greater efficiencies through consolidation and cost cuts.\nThe biggest producers are cutting headcount, in the thousands, following blockbuster acquisitions in recent months.\nChevron, which bought Hess Corporation for $53 billion, has said it would reduce its workforce by 20% by the end of 2026 as part of wide cost cuts. This includes 800 jobs in the Permian.\nExxonMobil will slash 2,000 jobs worldwide, with nearly half of these cuts at its Canadian business, Imperial Oil.\nExxon has already eliminated about 400 jobs in Texas since it acquired Pioneer Natural Resources in a $60-billion deal finalized in May 2024.\nUK-based BP, which is under intense shareholder pressure to slash costs and reduce debt, said in August that it was accelerating the reduction of contractor numbers and office-based workforce.\n\u201cAcross the supply chain, we\u2019ve delivered around $900 million of savings. Over a third of our supply chain spend reductions seen so far reflect a reduction in contractors, significantly enabled by technology,\u201d BP\u2019s chief financial officer Kate Thomson said on the Q2 earnings call.\nBP has already reduced cont"

The focus now shifts to a breakout of this contractionary range to dictate price direction into the monthly crossover.\nEuro Price Chart \u2013 EUR/USD 240min\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; EUR/USD on TradingView\nNotes: A closer look at Euro price action shows EUR/USD trading within the confines of a descending pitchfork extending off the yearly high. A rebound off the median-line shifts the focus to a breakout of last week\u2019s range for guidance. Initial support rests with the 78.6% retracement at 1.1582 and is backed by the objective October low at 1.1542. Ultimately, a break / close below the 100% extension of the September decline / April high-day close (HDC) at 1.1505/14 would be needed to mark downtrend resumption. Note that losses below this threshold could fuel another accelerated decline with the next major technical consideration eyed at the lower parallel / May HDC / August low at 1.1386/91- look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nInitial resistance is eyed at the 10/17 reversal close at 1.1653 and is backed closely by last week\u2019s high / 38.2% retracement of the September decline at 1.1675/86. A break / daily close above this threshold would be needed to suggest a more significant low is in place / a larger trend reversal is underway (near-term bearish invalidation). Subsequent resistance objectives are eyed at the October open at 1.1734 and is backed by the 61.8% retracement at 1.1775 (area of interest for possible topside exhaustion / price inflection IF reached).\nBottom line: EUR/USD is in consolidation within the October range with major event risk on tap next week. The immediate focus is on a breakout of the 1.1582-1.1686 range for guidance with the outlook still weighted to the downside while within this formation. From a trading standpoint, rallies need to be limited to last week\u2019s high IF price is heading lower on this stretch with a close below 1.15 ultimately needed to fuel the next major leg of this decline.\nThe Fed widely expected to cut interest rates by 25bps points next week with no change expected from the ECB.

The pair traded between 1.1665 and 1.1577 last week, showing sharp intraday swings tied to delayed U.S. CPI data, a fragile eurozone recovery, and deep uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal operations. The Federal Reserve\u2019s October 29 meeting carries near-total market conviction\u201498.3% probability\u2014for a 25-basis-point rate cut, but the message from Chair Jerome Powell on quantitative tightening (QT) will dictate the next directional leg for EUR/USD.\nVolatility Returns as U.S. Inflation Weakens and the Euro Fails to Hold Gains\nAfter the delayed U.S. CPI print\u2014+0.2% MoM, +3.0% YoY\u2014the EUR/USD spiked to 1.1650, only to fade as investors reassessed liquidity and rate expectations. That move marked the third failed attempt this month to sustain above 1.1655, suggesting sellers continue to defend that zone. Despite weaker U.S. inflation, the euro\u2019s rally proved short-lived as traders prioritized policy tone over data noise. The U.S. government shutdown, now in its third week, has created data blackouts across employment and spending metrics, leaving the Fed to navigate without critical inputs. The market\u2019s discomfort with missing data has capped speculative long exposure in EUR/USD despite dovish macro conditions.\nThe Fed\u2019s Challenge: Cut Rates Without Losing Control of Inflation Expectations\nMarkets fully expect the Fed to deliver a 25 bp cut, lowering the federal funds rate to 3.75%\u20134.00%, but Powell\u2019s guidance on quantitative tightening could be the more decisive signal. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet runoff has pushed bank reserves to around 10% of GDP, close to the lower bound of comfort. ING economists suggest the Fed may halt Treasury runoffs altogether to prevent liquidity stress, effectively injecting fresh reserves into the banking system. Such a move would weaken the dollar structurally. If confirmed, EUR/USD could break resistance near 1.1700, with scope toward 1.1750\u20131.1800 in early November.\nEurope\u2019s Macro Pulse: Stability Without Growth Keeps ECB in a Holding Pattern\nThe European Central Bank has stayed neutral amid declining inflation and sluggish GDP growth. Headline eurozone inflation eased to 2.7% YoY, and core CPI dropped to 2.8%, marking the slowest pace since 2022. While the ECB signaled that rates have likely peaked at 4.00%, officials remain cautious about premature cuts. That relative stability contrasts with the Fed\u2019s aggressive pivot and gives the euro a latent yield advantage over the coming quarters. Market pricing for 2026 now anticipates the ECB cutting later than the Fed, a dynamic that historically supports EUR/USD strength in mid-cycle turns.\nTechnical Tension: Bulls Defend 1.1600, Bears Guard 1.1655\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains locked in a tight consolidation band between 1.1570 and 1.1665, as momentum oscillators reset after September\u2019s slide. The RSI (14) hovers around 49.5, neutral but climbing, and MACD has turned positive for the first time since early October. Price action near the 100-day moving average (1.1605) will determine short-term direction. A daily close above 1.1655 confirms a short-term breakout, opening 1.1720 as the next target; failure to defend 1.1590 exposes 1.1550, the month\u2019s low. Option flow data show heavy strike activity around 1.1650 and 1.1750, indicating markets are hedging for an upside resolution post-FOMC.\nRead More\n-\nSPYI ETF Yields 11.67% as $7.4T Cash Moves From Money Markets to High-Income"

Traders will observe German IFO Business Survey data later in the day.\nHowever, the Euro could come under pressure as France\u2019s Socialist Party leader, Olivier Faure, has threatened to topple Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu\u2019s government by Monday if the party\u2019s budget demands are not met. Faure, whose party holds a decisive swing vote in the hung parliament, warned that he would submit a no-confidence motion unless higher taxes are imposed on billionaires, per Reuters.\nThe upside of the EUR/USD pair could be restrained as the US Dollar (USD) may gain ground following reports that United States (US) and Chinese negotiators have reached a consensus on major disputes. This development paves the way for Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to meet on Thursday to finalize a trade deal aimed at easing tensions. Officials in Malaysia announced after two days of talks that both sides had agreed on key issues, including export controls, fentanyl, and shipping levies.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS News that President Trump\u2019s threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods \u201cis effectively off the table.\u201d Bessent added that China has agreed to make \u201csubstantial\u201d soybean purchases and to postpone its rare-earth export controls \u201cfor a year while they re-examine it.\u201d\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong e"

                "body": "GBP Faces Potential Limitations\nConcerns over the UK\u2019s fiscal future ahead of November\u2019s Autumn budget may limit GBP/USD advances. Meanwhile, the US Dollar struggles post-Friday following consumer inflation figures and expectations of Fed rate cuts. Potential US government shutdown issues further challenge the Dollar\u2019s strength.\nTraders appear cautious, waiting on FOMC policy outcomes for direction, with attention shifting to an upcoming Trump-Xi meeting. The US PCE Price Index release on Friday is also expected to influence USD movements and impact GBP/USD positioning.\nWe are seeing some positive movement for GBP/USD above the 1.2450 mark today, but the bigger picture suggests this strength may not last. The US dollar is softening slightly ahead of this week\u2019s economic data, giving the pound a brief opportunity to recover from its recent slide. However, the fundamental economic divergence between the UK and the US continues to favor the dollar in the medium term.\nUK Economic Outlook\nThe Bank of England is facing a difficult balancing act, which is weighing on sterling. With the latest ONS data from earlier this month showing UK inflation holding at a stubborn 2.3% and unemployment ticking up to 4.5%, markets are pricing in potential rate cuts in the first half of 2026. Lingering concerns over the UK\u2019s fiscal health, with the debt-to-GDP ratio still near 98%, will also be in focus ahead of next month\u2019s Autumn Statement.\nOn the other hand, the US economy appears more resilient, limiting downside for the dollar. Recent data showed core PCE inflation remains elevated at 2.8%, and last month\u2019s non-farm payrolls report added a stronger-than-expected 210,000 jobs. This reinforces the view that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates higher for longer, making the dollar more attractive to investors.\nWe remember how much volatility was created by major geopolitical events in the past, like the Trump-Xi meetings back in the late 2010s, which caused traders to wait on the sidelines. A similar sense of caution is present now, with traders looking towards the upcoming US GDP figures and inflation data at the end of the week. These releases will be critical in shaping the Federal Reserve\u2019s tone heading into the end of the year.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests looking at strategies that position for a potential drop in GBP/USD. Buying put options with a strike price below current support levels, such as 1.2400, could be a straightforward way to capitalize on further weakness. This would allow for profiting from a downward move while strictly limiting the initial risk to the premium paid for the option."

Despite the rebound, the pair ended the week down 0.85%, highlighting how dollar strength and diverging rate paths continue to define direction. U.S. inflation remains the dominant driver, with September\u2019s annual CPI rising to 3.0%, up from 2.9% in August, but still softer than forecasts. Core inflation eased marginally to 3.0%, maintaining pressure on the Federal Reserve to follow through with a widely expected 25-basis-point cut at the October meeting and another in December. Fed funds futures now price a 94.5% probability of a cut this month and a 92% chance for a second move before year-end, keeping the greenback relatively supported despite easing price growth.\nUK Economic Data Surprises but Sterling Struggles to Break Higher\nThe British economy delivered rare positive data as UK retail sales volumes rose 0.5% in September, defying expectations of a 0.2% decline. The gain followed a 0.6% upward revision for August, marking the strongest back-to-back increase since 2022. Consumer spending resilience, especially in food and household goods, offered a temporary lifeline to the pound. However, broader economic signals remain subdued \u2014 the manufacturing PMI showed contraction, albeit at its slowest pace in a year, while services activity stagnated. S&P Global\u2019s Chris Williamson noted that \u201cSeptember likely marked the low point for UK growth,\u201d but the lack of consistent momentum suggests any sterling rebound could be short-lived. Structural inflation and sluggish productivity continue to constrain the Bank of England\u2019s policy flexibility, leaving GBP/USD at the mercy of U.S. macro developments.\nFederal Reserve Outlook: Policy Divergence Keeps Dollar Bid\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming meeting will be pivotal. Although no new forecasts are expected, attention will fall squarely on Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s tone. With the Fed likely cutting rates to a 3.75\u20134.00% range, markets will dissect any hint of dovish language regarding inflation or labor softness. A potential end to quantitative tightening (QT) could soften the dollar marginally, but the broader bias remains bullish unless the Fed explicitly signals a deeper easing cycle. In parallel, GBP/USD remains constrained by the widening policy gap between the Fed\u2019s gradual easing and the Bank of England\u2019s prolonged pause, with UK rates unlikely to fall meaningfully before mid-2026.\nUK Fiscal and Energy Concerns Add to Sterling Weakness\nUK fiscal headwinds continue to undermine investor confidence. The government\u2019s higher-than-expected borrowing needs, coupled with stagnant wage growth and elevated energy costs, weigh heavily on sterling. Oil prices have surged amid geopolitical tension, lifting import costs for the UK and worsening the current account deficit. The combination of expensive energy imports and slower growth has amplified the perception that the UK economy remains more vulnerable to external shocks than its U.S. counterpart. The resulting imbalance has deepened selling pressure in GBP/USD, with traders increasingly targeting 1.3150\u20131.3100 as the next support area should U.S. yields stabilize above 4%\nRead More\n-\nSPYI ETF Yields 11.67% as $7.4T Cash Moves From Money Markets to High-Income ETFs\n26.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRPR and XRPI ETFs Power XRP (XRP-USD) to $2.64 as Ripple Prime and $100M Inflows Signal New Bull Phase\n26.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nU.S. Natural Gas Price (NG=F) Rises"

With RBA rate-cut expectations building and global sentiment uncertain, AUD/USD could see sharp moves in both directions.\nView related analysis:\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Bulls Reclaim 200-Day, US CPI Looms\n- Australian Dollar Consolidates: AUD/USD, EUR/AUD Near Pivotal Levels\n- With US Dollar \u2018Rebound\u2019 Waning, EUR/USD and GBP/USD Could Bounce\n- ASX 200 Morning Market Outlook: Woolworths (WOW) Set To Bounce?\nAUD/USD Set for Volatile Week Ahead of Fed Decision and Australian CPI\nUS inflation data on Friday came in slightly softer than expected across the board, paving the way for the Fed to continue cutting rates. Fed funds futures implied a 98.3% chance of a 25bp cut next week and a 91.1% probability of another in December. A third successive cut is currently priced at around 50% for either the January, March, or April meetings.\nThe US dollar index initially dropped around 1% after the data release but regained ground by the close, ahead of US\u2013China trade talks over the weekend in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. How those talks unfold could very much set the tone for the Trump\u2013Xi summit, currently scheduled for 30 October in South Korea. Unless the negotiating wheels fall off and talks get cancelled. Either way, traders will need to factor in headline risks for the US dollar surrounding both the trade talks and the upcoming summit.\nAustralian Dollar Performance\n- The Australian dollar was modestly higher against the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and New Zealand dollar, and marginally higher (but effectively flat) against the US dollar, Canadian dollar and British pound\n- AUD/JPY rose for a sixth consecutive day \u2013 its best such run in nearly two months \u2013 and now sits at a 2-week high with 100 in its sights\n- How it trades this week and which way it gaps at the open is likely down to headlines from US-China trade talks, though the Fed meeting and quarterly CPI figures for Australia are the key economic events\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nMoney Markets Favour RBA Cut Next Week\nMoney markets and economists are increasingly backing a 25bp rate cut by the RBA in November following the latest labour force data. Unemployment rose to a four-year high of 4.5%, while August\u2019s figures for headline and full-time employment were revised further into negative territory. Although participation and employment-to-population rates remain historically high, RBA cash rate futures now imply a 75\u201380% probability of a cut at the next meeting\nGiven the hawkish tone of the latest minutes, I place the odds of a cut closer to 60% than 80%. However, the deciding factor will be this week\u2019s quarterly inflation figures.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: ABS, LSEG\nAustralian Quarterly Inflation Report in Focus\nAs things stand, unemployment has already exceeded the RBA\u2019s end-of-year forecast of 4.3%, with the rate reaching 4.5% by September. The RBA\u2019s Q3 estimates place headline CPI at 2.1% and the trimmed mean at 2.7%. However, monthly gauges of annualised inflation show headline CPI rising to 3.0% and the trimmed mean at 2.6%. It is therefore crucial that the quarterly trimmed mean does not move above 2.7% this week \u2014 a print of 2.6% or lower would likely confirm the November rate cut that many already anticipate.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: ABS, LSEG\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: RBA, Statement of Monetary Policy (SOMP)\nAUD/USD Correlations\n- The usual correlations with the Australian dollar have largely broken down over the 20-day lookback, though the link between AUD/USD and NZD/USD remains strong.\n- Even the relationship between the US dollar index and the Australian dollar has weakened to just 0.15 \u2014 effectively showing no correlation.\n- However, with the 10-day correlation between "

This shutdown is now in its 27th day, just eight days shy of the 35-day record set in 2018\u20132019.\nUS-China trade deal lifts AUD/USD\nThis week has kicked off on a livelier note, with AUD/USD surging to a two-week high of 0.6545 following reports that US and Chinese negotiators reached a preliminary trade framework over the weekend. This deal is pending final approval by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea later this week.\nIf signed, the deal would ease fears of a global slowdown and help bolster risk sentiment into year-end. Beyond trade, the key driver for AUD/USD this week will be Wednesday\u2019s third quarter (Q3) consumer price index (CPI) release, previewed below, ahead of next week\u2019s Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest rate meeting.\nAU: Q3 CPI\nDate: Wednesday, 29 October at 11.30am AEDT\nIn the June 2025 quarter (Q2), headline inflation rose by 0.7%, which saw the annual rate of headline inflation ease to 2.1%, the lowest annual inflation rate since March 2021.\nThe RBA\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, the trimmed mean, rose by 0.6% in Q2, allowing the annual rate to fall to 2.7% from 2.9% prior. This marked a tenth quarter of lower annual trimmed mean inflation and equalled the lowest rate of trimmed mean inflation since the December quarter of 2021.\nSince then, the market has received two firmer monthly CPI reports driven by headline strength, prompting more hawkish RBA commentary before the release of a much weaker-than-expected labour force update for September.\nThe market consensus is for Q3 2025 headline inflation to rise 1.0% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), and for the annual rate of headline inflation to rise to 3.0%. The trimmed mean is expected to increase by 0.8% QoQ, which would see the annual rate remain at 2.7%.\nIrrespective of whether the Q3 inflation report shows trimmed mean inflation marginally above the RBA\u2019s forecast, we continue to think the RBA should cut rates by 25 basis points (bp) next week to 3.35%, and follow the path of least regret given the downside risks to the Australian labour market.\nThe Australian interest rate market is pricing in 16 bp (64% chance) of a 25 bp rate cut at next week\u2019s RBA board meeting and a cumulative 45 bp of RBA cuts between now and August 2026.\nAU all groups CPI and trimmed mean chart\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nTechnically, AUD/USD is attempting to bounce away from the support coming from the bottom of the trend channel, which it has been encapsulated within for the past five months.\nProviding AUD/USD continues to hold above 0.6480 (trend channel support) and above a strong band of support at 0.6435 - 0.6410 (coming from the August lows and the 200-day moving average), allow for a rebound back towards 0.6600 - 0.6620.\nAware that if AUD/USD was to first see a sustained break of support at 0.6480 and then below support at 0.6435\u20130.6410, it would warn that a deeper pullback, initially towards 0.6300, is underway.\nAUD/USD daily chart\n- Source: TradingView.

                "body": "- Traditional drivers have faded in USD/JPY influence\n- Yen weakness tied to politics and energy costs\n- Fed and BoJ decisions dominate this week\u2019s focus\n- Tokyo CPI and fiscal signals add extra risk\n- USD/JPY directional risks skewed higher\nSummary\nUSD/JPY has shrugged off traditional drivers like rate spreads and risk sentiment, with correlations to U.S. yields turning mildly negative. Temporary factors such as Japan\u2019s political shift and higher energy costs have added pressure, but the focus now shifts to Fed and BoJ decisions, Tokyo CPI and fiscal signals. U.S. tech earnings could also sway carry trade flows. With price action firm and momentum strong, directional risks for USD/JPY remain skewed to the upside.\nAssessing Fundamental Influences\nHistoric drivers such as interest rate differentials, risk appetite and implied market volatility have shown little to no influence on USD/JPY movements over the past month, as shown by the correlation coefficients in the chart below. Rather than a positive correlation with U.S. yields and yield spreads between the United States and Japan, the relationship has been mildly negative. That suggests other factors are behind the yen\u2019s recent weakness.\nSource: TradingView\nSanae Takaichi\u2019s elevation to Japanese PM has been part of the story, with traders betting on more stimulatory fiscal and monetary policy settings than what would otherwise have been the case. Large increases in energy prices late last week may have also contributed to the yen\u2019s slide, reflecting Japan\u2019s status as a significant energy importer. Those influences are likely to prove temporary unless sustained, suggesting interest rates and market sentiment may once again take over as key influences on the yen.\nWhat\u2019s been interesting is USD/JPY\u2019s strengthening inverse relationship with shifts in relative nominal growth expectations in the United States and Japan, as proxied by the 2s10s yield spread between the two nations. It has not been the strongest relationship over the past month, but at 0.75 it suggests the relative growth outlook in both nations may be something to consider for anyone trading USD/JPY. You can see the relationship visually between the two in the left-hand pane in the chart above.\nFed, BoJ Rate Decisions Loom Large\nA big influence on nominal growth expectations is the interest rate outlook in both nations, adding extra importance to monetary policy decisions from the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan over the coming days. The key economic events in the week are shown in the calendar below, with red shading indicative of those most likely to generate volatility in USD/JPY. Times are shown for the East Coast of the United States. Wednesday looms as the most important day with the Federal Reserve decision followed hours later by the BoJ.\nSource: TradingView\nWhen it comes to the Federal Reserve, this meeting will not contain any new forecasts, meaning the wording of the policy statement, FOMC voting split and chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference will be the key things to watch should it cut rates by 25bps to a range of 3.75\u20134% as is fully priced by markets. Six weeks ago, the FOMC statement said that job gains had \u201cslowed\u201d and suggested that downside risks to employment had \u201crisen.\u201d On inflation, it noted that it had moved up and remained \u201csomewhat elevated.\u201d With so little data received due to the government lockdown, common sense suggests there may not be any changes to those assessments, although there is a risk the language on inflation may shift slightly more dovish given the soft September inflation report released last Friday.\nWithin the statement, there is also a chance the Fed will announce an end to its quantitative tightening program, although on the balance of probabilities it is more likely to come in December. What\u2019s important to note with Fed balance sheet adjustments is that an end to asset runoffs is entirely expected, with the only question being timing and what mix the bank will feel c"

The pair has shrugged off traditional drivers like rate-differentials in recent sessions, even as a full 25 bp Fed cut to 3.75%\u20134.00% is priced for Wednesday and the Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep policy steady. Price action remains unequivocally bullish: RSI(14) is trending higher above 50 without overbought stress and MACD has crossed up through its signal line in positive territory, validating upside momentum while keeping dip-buying the path of least resistance.\nPositioning Context: Politics, Energy, and a New Correlation Map\nTwo transient supports have underpinned USD/JPY\u2019s rise. First, Japan\u2019s political reset\u2014Sanae Takaichi\u2019s elevation raised expectations for a more expansionary fiscal stance\u2014which leans dovish for BoJ policy optics in the near term. Second, the late-week jump in energy prices hurt the yen given Japan\u2019s net-importer profile. More structurally, traders should note the pair\u2019s strengthening linkage to relative nominal growth expectations rather than simple UST\u2013JGB spreads. A 0.75 correlation to the U.S.\u2013Japan 2s10s differential says the market is trafficking in growth outperformance rather than raw rate levels, an important nuance when headline spread correlations temporarily fade.\nFed Watch: A Cut Is Baked In\u2014Guidance and QT Timing Will Move USD/JPY\nThe FOMC is fully priced to trim the target range by 25 bps to 3.75%\u20134.00%. No new dot plot arrives, so the statement tone, the vote split, and Chair Powell\u2019s presser do the heavy lifting. A Miran dissent for 50 bps would be dovish theatrics but unlikely to set the path; a surprise bloc dissent for \u201cno change\u201d would be the genuine USD-positive twist. Keep an eye on balance sheet language: an early end to QT, while broadly expected by year-end, would marginally soften the dollar if announced this meeting; a December signal would likely be USD-neutral near term. With a soft September inflation print and mixed labor signals, the bar for a hawkish surprise is higher than for a dovish lean, but the tape is telling you USD/JPY trades momentum, not narrative, right now.\nBoJ Preview: Policy Hold Favored; Board Vote Split and Ueda\u2019s Tone Are the Tell\nConsensus looks for no move from the BoJ this week with the policy rate steady and YCC flexibility left untouched. The board\u2019s vote distribution matters: growing support for a 25 bp hike would pull rate-hike pricing forward toward December and strengthen JPY; a narrower pro-hike faction would do the opposite. Governor Ueda has sounded cautious as domestic inflation shows signs of moderating at the margin; a dovish press conference would re-anchor USD/JPY topside risks, while any hint that the board sees durable wage-price traction would quickly tug the pair lower.\nJapan Data Catalysts: Tokyo CPI, Retail Sales, Labor, Confidence\nTokyo CPI is the key lead indicator for nationwide inflation and is expected to accelerate to roughly 2.7% y/y from 2.5%. A hot print re-energizes December hike speculation and favors JPY strength; a soft read does the reverse. Retail sales are seen rebounding ~0.7% y/y after \u20131.1%, important because private consumption is ~55% of GDP. The unemployment rate is projected to dip to 2.5% from 2.6%; a tighter labor market strengthens the wage narrative the BoJ needs to justify normalization. Consumer confidence edging up toward 35.6 would complement that story, though the level remains subdued by historical standards.\nRead More\n-\nSPYI ETF Yields 11.67% as $7.4T Cash Moves From Money Markets to High-Income ETFs\n26.10.2025 \u00b7 Tra"

The top negotiators US and China reached a consensus on major disputes and paved the way for Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to meet on Thursday to finalize a trade deal aimed at easing tensions.\nAdditionally, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that President Trump\u2019s threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods \u201cis effectively off the table,\u201d while adding that China will purchase soybeans and postpone rare-earth export controls.\nPresident Trump announced on Saturday that he was raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10% \u201cabove what they\u2019re paying now.\u201d The move came in response to an ad from Canada\u2019s Ontario province that aired during the World Series broadcast. Trump had already halted trade talks with Ottawa on Thursday, calling the tariff-related ad misleading.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposit"

Source: @Karman_1s via X\nThe comparison overlays Ethereum\u2019s 2025 price action onto Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 post-halving recovery. Both coins experienced summer lows followed by strong rebounds, a pattern often seen in historical crypto cycles. Financial journals and past market analyses highlight that such post-halving rallies can be fueled by investor sentiment, ETF inflows, and macroeconomic factors, making pattern-based predictions relevant for traders.\nWhale Activity Fuels Speculation\nRecent on-chain data has intensified speculation around Ethereum\u2019s near-term price movement. Richard Heart, founder of HEX and PulseChain, reportedly transferred $61.15 million in ETH to Tornado Cash today, bringing his total deposits for the week to over $105 million. Heart still retains more than $500 million in Ethereum holdings.\nRichard Heart moves $61M in Ethereum to Tornado Cash today, with $106M transferred this week, still holding over $500M in ETH.

Analysts note that Tornado Cash, sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2022, raises questions about the timing and purpose of these transfers. However, in a bullish environment where Ethereum recently hovered above $4,000, such whale activity could indicate confidence in higher price targets.\nTechnical Analysis Points to Potential Upside\nCrypto trader and analyst @Crypto_Twittier shared insights into Ethereum\u2019s technical chart, emphasizing short- and mid-term bullish potential. \u201cIf the price can recover from the current dip and break above the daily supply zone, I expect at least another leg up toward $5,900,\u201d the analyst noted, highlighting the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level as a critical target.\nBulls stay optimistic as Ethereum tests key RSI and 50-day EMA levels. Source: @Crypto_Twittier via X\nThe weekly chart shows Ethereum closing above a key resistance line, maintaining a bullish outlook for now. Meanwhile, daily support levels, such as the purple trendline, are crucial to sustaining upward momentum. Analysts stress that staying above these support zones is vital for Ethereum to maintain its bullish structure and achieve higher targets in the coming weeks.\nMarket Sentiment and Ethereum ETF Developments\nMarket sentiment continues to play a pivotal role in Ethereum\u2019s price movements. Positive investor outlook, fueled by growing interest in Ethereum ETFs and institutional accumulation, could support further upside. These developments often increase market confidence and attract more participants, adding momentum to the cryptocurrency\u2019s trajectory.\nEthereum eyes $5,900 as it holds key support and readies for the next bullish leg.

October alone recorded $4.21 billion in net ETF inflows, reversing last month\u2019s $1.23 billion in redemptions. This swing underscores renewed conviction among large-scale investors repositioning portfolios as rate cuts approach and the digital asset class cements itself inside traditional finance.\nLeading the charge, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) absorbed $210.9 million in new capital this month, with ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) bringing in $54 million and $52 million respectively. Combined, these three issuers now oversee more than $110 billion in Bitcoin-linked assets. Meanwhile, cumulative ETF flows across the sector have climbed to $61.98 billion, accounting for 6.78% of Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization, a record institutional share.\nETF trading volumes mirror that growth, rising to $3.34 billion weekly, more than double Ethereum\u2019s ETF volume at $1.41 billion. The dominance of Bitcoin over Ethereum in ETF flows reflects a pronounced sentiment pivot: investors now prefer Bitcoin\u2019s perceived resilience and \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative over Ethereum\u2019s yield-based complexity amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nPrice Structure and Market Reaction\nBitcoin trades near $111,383, up +1.7% in the last 24 hours, having rebounded from its mid-October low of $103,587. Earlier in the month, the cryptocurrency briefly touched an all-time high of $125,761 before a rapid correction, triggered by liquidity rotations during the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Despite volatility, BTC-USD has stabilized above $110,000, marking the strongest three-day streak in October and reversing a two-week losing cycle.\nTechnically, BTC sits below its 50-day EMA but remains firmly above its 200-day EMA, sustaining a bullish long-term structure despite short-term resistance. A breakout above $115,000 could reintroduce a rally toward $125,671, while a break below $103,500 would expose $100,000 as the next key support. The price reaction is tightly correlated with ETF inflows: every $500 million in new ETF capital has historically lifted Bitcoin by roughly 2.5\u20133.0%, suggesting that continued momentum could push prices toward the $120,000\u2013$125,000 range before year-end.\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Anchors Market Liquidity and Crypto Access\nBehind the institutional pivot sits BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), now commanding the largest ETF footprint in digital assets through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT alone controls $89.17 billion in assets, nearly 60% of total Bitcoin ETF holdings. The fund\u2019s scale and liquidity have made it the de facto gateway for institutions seeking exposure under regulated frameworks.\nThis leadership aligns with BlackRock\u2019s broader digital strategy: expansion into stablecoin-linked money market funds and private-market digital infrastructure, now spanning acquisitions like HPS Investment Partners and GIP. These moves support the firm's $1 trillion+ cash management arm, making it a liquidity engine across both traditional and tokenized markets.\nAs of October 26, 2025, BlackRock\u2019s stock trades at $1,136.63, up 11.7% year-to-date, with a total 19.1% annual return and a three-year total shareholder return of 84.5%. Market models project a fair value of $1,299.50, implying the shares remain 12.5% undervalued despite trading at 28.9x forward earnings, above the industry average of "

Recent figures indicate\nBitcoin ETF investments\nreached $4.21 billion in October, with BlackRock's iShares\nBitcoin\nTrust (IBIT) alone attracting $210.9 million in net new funds. This uptick is part of a larger movement of institutional money flowing into crypto, and\na Coinotag report\nhighlighted that\nBlackRock\nhas converted over $3 billion into its ETF since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provided clearer guidance for spot-based offerings.\nRecent SEC regulatory updates have prompted major Bitcoin holders\u2014often called \"whales\"\u2014to quietly move their assets into ETF provider-linked custodial wallets. Blockchain data shows previously inactive wallets now receiving large amounts of BTC, suggesting these investors are preparing for ETF-related arrangements.\nAccording to CoinInsider\n, Robbie Mitchnick, who leads digital assets at BlackRock, said the company's ETF has become a preferred option for institutions seeking regulated crypto exposure. This trend could help stabilize the market by locking Bitcoin in custody, reducing available supply and potentially supporting higher prices.\nJPMorgan's move into crypto-backed lending further demonstrates rising institutional trust. The bank intends to let institutional clients use Bitcoin and\nEthereum\nas collateral for loans\nby the end of 2025\n, officially recognizing these assets on their balance sheets.\nAnother Coinotag article\nstates that the initiative will rely on independent custodians for asset security and aims to boost liquidity without requiring asset liquidation. Bloomberg Intelligence projects that such lending programs could generate up to $50 billion in crypto-backed loans within two years. This development reflects a broader shift, as 70% of institutional investors now consider crypto a legitimate investment category.\nRegulatory progress is also underway. The SEC is currently evaluating 155 crypto ETP applications covering 35 different cryptocurrencies for 2025. Although decisions have been postponed due to a government shutdown, outcomes are anticipated by early 2026.\nProShares has submitted\nan application for a diversified crypto ETF that tracks the CoinDesk 20 Index, which features Bitcoin, Ethereum,\nXRP\n, and\nSolana\n. If given the green light, it would be among the first U.S. ETFs to offer exposure to several leading cryptocurrencies, meeting the demand for regulated and diversified crypto investment products.\nDespite these advances, the market remains unpredictable. As of October 24, Ethereum ETFs experienced\n$93.6 million in net withdrawals\n, a stark contrast to Bitcoin's continued strength. Experts attribute this difference to Bitcoin's reputation as a reliable store of value and its preference among institutional investors. At the same time, JPMorgan's collateral initiative and BlackRock's ETF expansion signal a maturing sector, where cryptocurrencies are evolving from speculative assets to essential components of institutional portfolios."

Among the countless emerging projects, a few standout presales are generating exceptional buzz for their potential to deliver gains. Ethereum, Aster, and BullZilla ($BZIL) have captured significant attention, each offering unique strengths that appeal to different types of investors. While Ethereum remains the trusted foundation of decentralized finance, newer contenders like Aster and BullZilla are redefining innovation and growth potential in 2025.\nIn this competitive landscape, identifying the best crypto presales with potential is essential for investors aiming to maximize profits. Ethereum's proven stability continues to shape the DeFi ecosystem, while Aster brings groundbreaking scalability and cross-chain solutions to address blockchain limitations. However, it is BullZilla ($BZIL) that stands out as a game-changer, combining an innovative presale model, strong ROI projections, and community-driven tokenomics. With explosive growth ahead, BullZilla is positioning itself as one of the most promising crypto presales of 2025.\nFinal Countdown: Grab BullZilla at $0.00018573 Before It Blasts Off\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has solidified its place as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Ethereum 2.0, with its transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), enhances scalability and energy efficiency, making it a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. However, despite its foundational role, Ethereum has faced scalability challenges and high gas fees. Investors looking for stability and security may find Ethereum an appealing choice, but its explosive growth potential has slowed, especially compared to newer projects like BullZilla. For those seeking the best crypto presales with potential, Ethereum does not offer the same high-risk, high-reward opportunities as presale tokens.\nEthereum is vital to the crypto ecosystem as it powers DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts, providing the infrastructure for thousands of decentralized applications that drive innovation, scalability, and mainstream blockchain adoption.\nYes. Ethereum remains one of the strongest long-term investments thanks to its proven utility, security, and dominance in blockchain development, though its growth pace is steadier compared to high-ROI presale tokens like BullZilla.\nBullZilla ($BZIL) is fast emerging as one of the top crypto presales with potential, driven by its structured, innovation-focused ecosystem. Featuring a progressive price engine, 24-stage burn system, and multi-tier staking rewards, BullZilla is designed for sustained growth and investor value. Currently in Stage 8, the project has raised over $970K with 3,200+ holders already onboard. With a projected ROI from Stage 8A to the listing price, BullZilla combines scarcity, utility, and momentum, making it a standout early-entry opportunity.\nFor those seeking to capitalize on the best crypto presales with potential, BullZilla presents an extraordinary opportunity. The token's progressive price engine ensures that the price per token increases with each stage, giving early investors a chance to accumulate tokens at a significantly lower price. Investing $7,000 in BullZilla at its current price of $0.0001924 could yield substantial returns as the presale progresses and the token reaches new price points. With an upcoming 3.46% price surge from $0.0001924 to $0.00019906, investors can expect continued growth, making BullZilla one of the most promising presale tokens of 2025.\nJoining the BullZilla presale is simple. First, set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Purchase Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT) through a trusted exchange like Binance or Coinbase, then transfer your ETH to your wallet. Next, visit the official BullZilla presale website and connect your wallet. "

                "body": "Ethereum (ETH) might be preparing for yet another bull run, with analysts setting their sights on a possible breakout past $5,000, but astute investors are aware that true exponential profits tend to come from future DeFi crypto instead of blue-chip giants. One example is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is valued at only $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale. Unlike ETH, MUTM provides a double-lending environment with Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, providing users with the functionality to lend, borrow, and earn yields within an integrated platform. With its groundbreaking structure, presale hype, and increasing investor interest, some experts are labeling MUTM the next big crypto, setting it up as a high-potential candidate for those looking for enormous returns in the next cycle.\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Stablecoin Flow Signals Institutional Confidence\nEthereum (ETH) is demonstrating renewed vigor with stablecoin activity on the network reaching a new all-time high of $580.9B, increasing by 400% over the last 30 days. The aggregate market capitalization of Ethereum-based stablecoins has reached $163B, solidifying ETH\u2019s position as the foundation of on-chain liquidity. On-chain metrics disclose large holders accumulating ETH at $3,738 with some wallets taking multi-million-dollar buys, while institutional involvement in derivative markets like CME futures points to increased conviction in a breakthrough to the upside to $5,000. Strategists refer to a triple-bottom formation at $3,600 and structural demand from stablecoins as longer-term catalysts for profits. Though ETH remains a subject of institutional appeal, investors are also looking into new DeFi crypto projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are gaining traction on the back of their high growth prospects and early-stage market potential.\nWhat is Mutuum Finance?\nMutuum Finance is an innovative DeFi crypto project that seeks to create a versatile and effective digital asset lending and borrowing ecosystem. The platform functions on two synergistic models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P).\nP2C model: Users put assets such as ETH or USDT into mutual liquidity pools and earn passive income with dynamic APY rates that vary according to pool utilization.\nP2P model: Users have the option to set their own lending and borrowing terms, gaining access to assets that aren\u2019t available on pooled markets, such as DOGE or SHIB.\nDepositors are given mtTokens, proof of deposit, that are always equivalent to the underlying asset value. mtTokens earn interest on a continuous basis, and users can further stake them for extra MUTM rewards. A portion of the platform fees is utilized to buy back MUTM from the market and redistribute it to stakers through a buy-and-distribute model, guaranteeing token value in the long term.\nEarn Passive Income with Crypto\nMutuum Finance MUTM is fast gaining traction as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies of 2025 after a record-breaking presale. Six stages of the protocol have raised $17.95 million in coin sales to more than 17,450 investors with Phase 6 already over three-quarters of the way through. The token is now at $0.035, representing the lowest entry point before the next phase which offers the potential for a 14.28% price rise, making it a good early investment before a period of high growth.\nMUTM members can stake cryptos like USDT into the liquidity pool and receive passive income in the form of APY. APY rates are based on market demand so returns will fluctuate over time. With an average 10% APY rate, an investment of $70,000 would yield $7,000 a year, so your crypto wealth compounds automatically without ongoing effort.\nWhereas Ethereum (ETH) is a mainstay of the crypto economy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides early adopters with a distinctive chance to tap into next-generation DeFi crypto innovation. With over 75% sold out for Phase 6 at $0.035 and over $17.95 million raised, MUTM\u2019s dual-lending ecosystem, "

On-chains reveal that there was a buying of 44,000 SOL, which was worth approximately 8.3 million dollars on October 26, 2025. As of April, the same group has been stocking approximately 844,000 SOL worth approximately 149 million dollars. These recurrent inflows are indicative of increasing trust of key participants in the market before any of the major developments within the Solana ecosystem.\nWhales are loading up on Solana at a discount. Solana will go to $1000 soon. pic.twitter.com/tKO06T3WNO\n\u2014 Solana Sensei (@SolanaSensei) October 26, 2025\nEvery trade was made with Solana varying between $192 and $195. This accumulation constitutes approximately 0.18 percent of total supply with a circulation of approximately 470 million SOL. This kind of concentration of purchase is normally an indication of strategic positioning of institutions or those high-net-worth traders who are anticipating a rise in price. The trade pattern is in accordance with the past whale movement during the pre-rally periods.\nThe hybrid Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Stake consensus developed by Solana allows achieving high throughput with low costs. The network also handles over 60,000 transactions in less time of one second, and charges less than 001. These technical benefits are appealing to developers and investors and increase the Solana ecosystem of DeFi and NFT projects. The latest improvements in performance have also enhanced reliability, which is an improvement of the network outages that happened in the past.\nThe optimism among investors is on the rise before the Hong Kong introduction of the first spot Solana ETF in Asia on October 27, 2025. The approval of the ETF should attract institutional inflows, as it has been the case with Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Analysts do estimate a potential inflow of about 1.5 billion in the first year. These regulatory milestones can be followed by market revaluations due to the inflow of new capital into the ecosystem.\nSOL has a next important resistance of $196 as indicated by analysts. In case of the continuation of buying momentum, the next price target will be 218. Both whale accumulation and ETF expectation have a high upward pressure. Nevertheless, the decrease in liquidity to below $180 and heavy shorting around $195 can result in short term volatility. Such trends demonstrate a market that is about to be moving in large quantities.\nThe presence of such platforms as FalconX and Wintermute supports the institutional acceptance of Solana. FalconX operates as an institutional prime broker, but Wintermute is a major liquidity provider in the crypto market. They are active which means that Solana is becoming more and more integrated into organized investment portfolios. It is a change in speculative retail participation to a more institutional ownership.\nNevertheless, with its good fundamentals, Solana is still competing with other Layer-1 networks such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. The market manipulation is an issue when the whales choose to sell their stakes abruptly. The long-term sustainability of Solana price can be ensured by the stable performance of the network and the further adoption of the developers."

Still, cracks are showing beneath the surface: recent surveys point to Britain\u2019s manufacturers cutting back investment compared to sales, the slowest pace since 2017, blaming political uncertainty and uninspiring tax incentives. London\u2019s IPO market could perk up if new rules from the Financial Conduct Authority fast-track listings, yet headlines about Petrofac\u2019s possible administration threaten over 2,000 Scottish jobs, shining a light on struggles for legacy firms. At the same time, HSBC faces a $1.1 billion charge linked to its Madoff appeal loss. On the commodities front, optimism over US-China trade talks sent oil prices up and pushed copper to a 16-month high, while gold ticked lower, suggesting investors are taking on more risk.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Earnings reassure but risks shape the outlook.\nThe FTSE 100\u2019s all-time highs suggest global investors are warming to UK stocks, especially with banks and insurers punching above their weight. Still, lackluster investment by manufacturers could put a lid on future growth, and large-scale layoffs\u2014like those looming at Petrofac\u2014could weigh on sentiment. Commodity moves are also top of mind: strong oil and copper prices may buoy energy and mining shares, while softer gold prices reflect growing risk appetite.\nThe bigger picture: Structural shifts drive winners and losers.\nEfforts to modernize London\u2019s IPO rulebook show the city\u2019s intent to stay competitive on the global stage, but soft manufacturing investment reveals deeper headwinds. Political maneuvering and the outcome of the coming UK budget will be pivotal for long-term growth. Meanwhile, HSBC\u2019s legal battles and Petrofac\u2019s woes underscore the challenges legacy firms face, making clear that shifting market conditions will create both emerging leaders and casualties.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "I\u2019m happy to report that my favourite FTSE 100 growth stock has had a bumpy few years. Why would I want it to struggle? Because it finally gave me the buying opportunity I\u2019d been waiting for.\nThe company in question is London Stock Exchange Group (LSE: LSEG), which sells financial data, trading and clearing services to global investors. Its shares have powered ahead for years, making them expensive and keeping me on the sidelines.\nBig FTSE 100 winner\nFor a long time, they traded on a lofty price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 35, scaring me away. As a rule, I prefer to buy out-of-favour stocks in the hope of picking them up cheap and benefiting when sentiment turns.\nI saw my moment on 10 September and finally jumped in at around \u00a388.90 a share. The London Stock Exchange Group share price had dropped 30% in a year, shrinking the P/E to around 22 times earnings.\nThe shares dipped soon after and I nearly bought more but hesitated, distracted by all the talk of a possible stock market crash. I wish I\u2019d tuned out the noise, because I missed my chance to average down.\nStrong momentum\nWhen the group published its third-quarter results on Thursday (23 October), I didn\u2019t know whether to congratulate or kick myself. It reported total income up 6.4% to \u00a32.22bn, with gross profits up 6.5% at \u00a32.02bn and margins increasing for good measure.\nThe board also unveiled another \u00a31bn of share buybacks, taking total repurchases to \u00a32.5bn over 12 months, and announced a \u00a3170m investment from a group of 11 major banks in its Post Trade Solutions division.\nThe shares jumped 7% on the day and almost 5% on Friday. At \u00a397.84, I\u2019m sitting on a tidy 10% gain. I buy with a long-term view, but it\u2019s always nice to start strong.\nA lower P/E but not cheap\nToday the shares trade on a P/E of about 25.7. That\u2019s not cheap, but the company looks good for it. The \u2018LSEG Everywhere\u2019 strategy is paying off, integrating AI tools such as Microsoft\u2019s 365 Copilot and expanding into higher-margin analytics and data services.\nThere are risks, of course. It we do get that crash, the London Stock Exchange Group would be at the sharp end of it. While it\u2019s adopting AI, as always a danger is that it could be replaced by it. It operates in a competitive sector, and rivals could potentially undercut prices. But with solid cash generation and generous buybacks, I see strong long-term potential.\nLong-term thinking\nSo what do the experts say? Consensus broker forecasts suggest a one-year price target of around 12,280p, implying a bumper 25% rise from here. While that\u2019s not guaranteed, it\u2019s something to aim at. Of 19 analysts covering the stock, 16 rate it a Strong Buy and two say Buy. None say Sell. So I\u2019m not the only optimist.\nThe stock isn\u2019t without risk, but I think it remains one of the FTSE 100\u2019s best long-term growth prospects. At The Motley Fool, we\u2019re barred from buying or selling a company within two full trading days of writing about it. Once that\u2019s expired, I plan to buy more. I just hope the price doesn\u2019t race away first."

                "body": "Just a few months ago, Aquinos Bedding Germany filed for bankruptcy. For decades, the company's mattresses were manufactured in Germany, building a well-known brand with a recognizable logo.\nNow the production lines at the Wattenscheid factory are being shut down. Many employees have been there for decades but their jobs are at risk.\n\"After 30 years to see all this coming to an end - it's really sad,\" says one senior employee.\nThe reasons for the bankruptcy are, among other things, high logistics costs, outdated equipment and difficulties at sister companies. But Aquinos is not an isolated case: in 2024 there were 21,812 bankruptcies in Germany. The economy is weakening, unemployment is around three million - and yet the DAX stock index has risen. But why?\nDespite the economic downturn: Why the DAX is rising\nThere is hardly any sign of a crisis on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The DAX has almost doubled in three years. \"We are in a particularly difficult economic situation in Germany, and the German stock market index is still rising,\" explains fund manager Roger Peeters.\n\"But it must be said that when we talk about German companies or German stocks, these are generally global corporations that generate only a small part of their value in Germany,\" adds Peeters. In principle, this always reflects the global economy, he says. According to him, in some other countries the situation is better than in Germany.\nReasons for the weakening of the industry\nThe Venator chemical plant in Duisburg has also gone bankrupt. Bankruptcy administrator Sarah Wolf explains: \"The reasons here are of course complex. First, there is the general economic situation, which has not improved in recent years.\" In addition, she adds, there are tensions in the raw materials market and energy supply due to Russian aggression against Ukraine.\n\"Energy has become extremely expensive. And all these things together sometimes lead to a situation where there are simply not enough funds and all the outstanding obligations cannot be paid.\" Bureaucracy, taxes and customs duties also accelerate bankruptcy - and not only in the chemical industry.\nEconomic crisis and structural problems\nFor Achim Wambach, president of the Leibniz Center for European Economic Research and advisor to the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, the decline is more than a cyclical decline: \"Three years of decline in a row, this is not a conjunctural crisis. On the contrary, we have a structural crisis.\" Even the expected growth next year will not change much, according to him.\nIndustry must manage the transformation, while government measures must be geared towards competitiveness, the expert said. \"The economy is under great pressure, Germany is under great pressure,\" Wambach said.\nHe believes that economic stimulus programs with loans are simply not enough. The announced \"autumn of reforms\" must indeed come, including adjustments to social systems.\nMany bankruptcies - but not an extreme wave\nDespite the current cases, the number of bankruptcies has historically been significantly higher, for example during the financial crisis, but also in some other periods. Therefore, Germany is still far from an extreme wave of bankruptcies.\nHowever, this remains little consolation for those affected. No investor was found in Wattenscheid for this old production plant, but the brand was sold. Thomas Bu\u00dfkamp, who is from this region and now plans to produce mattresses of this brand in his company in Bocholt, has made an offer to the employees. The company intends to continue the cooperation with them - in Germany and this is good news for them./DW"

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) rose nearly 300 points, or 0.6%.\n(YM=F)\nThe optimism follows a banner week on Wall Street, with all three major indexes closing at record highs Friday. The Dow jumped 472 points to finish above 47,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 added 0.8% to creep closer to the 6,800 level, while the Nasdaq Composite rose over 1%.\nMarkets are almost certain the Fed will slash interest rates when policymakers meet this week, following cooler-than-expected inflation data last week from the government shutdown-delayed release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nInvestors are also eyeing a high-stakes meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea on Thursday, where weekend discussions could pave the way for a potential trade breakthrough. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said \"I believe we've reached a very substantial framework\" for a broader trade deal. China's side also hailed the \"preliminary consensus\" reached during the weekend talks. The upbeat tone raised hopes that the world's two largest economies could avoid a deeper trade war after heightened tensions in recent weeks.\nMeanwhile, the earnings spotlight shifts to Silicon Valley.

Some GOP doctors in Congress are backing him up.\nSen. Bill Cassidy (left) has had his disagreements with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (right), but both are critics of the American Medical Association. | AP\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s tenure as health secretary is straining Republicans\u2019 relationship with the medical establishment to what\u2019s looking like a breaking point.\nDoctors and their professional associations, such as the American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics, have clashed with the GOP over health policy changes, but Kennedy has given them a leftward shove by deriding them as pharma flunkeys and progressive ideologues. In recent months, Kennedy has sparred with the groups over vaccine guidance, transgender care, the handling of the pandemic and whether pregnant women are putting their children at risk of autism if they take Tylenol.\nThe groups have long been considered nonpartisan and have many conservative members. But Republicans in Congress are piling on, potentially risking the medical profession\u2019s evolution into a Democratic-leaning interest group. In turn, that would winnow doctors\u2019 influence on policy issues when Republicans are in power, and prompt big shifts in public health guidance when Democrats are.\nSome GOP lawmakers say it\u2019s the doctors that lost them as they moved left. \u201cWe kind of have a crisis of credibility,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said of physician leaders in the health care establishment. Kennedy, he added, \u201cis a product of that distrust. He is a reaction to what many people feel, that they were being ignored.\u201d\nKennedy\u2019s broadsides \u2014 including his deliberation over limiting the AMA\u2019s role in determining what Medicare pays doctors \u2014 have forced the leaders of physician societies to negotiate between an unfriendly government and many of their own members, who have demanded greater resistance to Kennedy\u2019s plans to overhaul the public health system.\nTheir criticisms of the health secretary have signaled to the public strong disagreement with Kennedy\u2019s policies and widened the split with Republicans on Capitol Hill.\nThe most telling example is Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a liver doctor and the chair of the Senate health committee.\nHe\u2019s been a leading GOP critic of Kennedy and a friend to physician interests. But he recently condemned the AMA for its support of gender-affirming care. This month, he also demanded that the group report revenues from its coding system, suggesting he might seek to upend a medical billing standard that brings in a big chunk of the group\u2019s $500 million in annual revenue. In a letter to AMA President Bobby Mukkamala, Cassidy called the group \u201canti-science\u201d and \u201canti-patient.\u201d\n\u201cWhen people know that there\u2019s scrutiny, they sometimes behave differently,\u201d Cassidy told POLITICO in explaining why he confronted the AMA. The AMA has said it will respond to the senator\u2019s request.\nThe AMA declined to comment for this story. The group, which represents more doctors than any other physician group, has said its positions are rooted in science and the consensus of America\u2019s doctors.\nThe AMA and many groups representing physician specialists have repeatedly called out Kennedy this year, criticizing him for revamping an outside panel of vaccine experts, for deemphasizing Covid vaccination, and for the firing of the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August. Many medical societies have dismissed Republican accusations that they are unduly influenced by drug companies and instead accused the administration of advancing pseudoscience.\nIn contrast with many rank-and-file AMA members, the group\u2019s leaders have repeatedly stressed the need to work with Kennedy. At a summit put on by the medical news website Stat this month, Mukkamala said he finds \u201ctotal alignment\u201d with the administration on some policy i"

It's going to be based on what he can do, all the stuff that he has. The organization will not put him in harm's way. We won't do that.
