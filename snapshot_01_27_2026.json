                "body": "The U.S. dollar has been in relative free fall since late Friday after it emerged that the New York Federal Reserve had conducted a rare \u201crate check\u201d with currency traders on the dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate.\nThe purpose of the move implies that the U.S. Federal Reserve may be considering coordinated action with the Bank of Japan to support the latter\u2019s currency.\nAs a result, traders began selling the dollar, which is now down more than 2.26% over the past five days against a standard basket of international currencies\u2014an unusually steep decline given the gargantuan scale of the dollar in the global economy. Over the last day alone it lost 0.46%. The yen is up more than 3% against the dollar over the same time period. (ING has a detailed blog post on the rate check controversy here.)\nThe Nikkei 225 stock index fell 1.79% this morning. That\u2019s a sign that traders feared equities exposed to Japan\u2019s export trade would be hurt by a rising yen.\nThe price of gold surged to a new record, over $5,000 per troy ounce. That has added to the anti-dollar narrative on Wall Street. The dollar used to be a safe-haven asset, but as the U.S. becomes more politically volatile, investors are going elsewhere.\n\u201cIt used to be the case that any eruption of geopolitical tension tended to rally the world around the U.S. dollar. That\u2019s because the U.S.\u2014despite its role as guarantor of the old order and its obligation to join the fights\u2014was still seen as the safest and most accessible redoubt or haven for global \u2018flight capital,\u2019 and because it had a history of being relatively unscathed (territorially) from the conflicts it itself participated in or enjoined,\u201d according to Macquarie\u2019s Thierry Wizman.\n\u201cBut what is happening now is different. Instead of flocking to the USD, traders flock to gold and its neighbors on the periodic table (e.g., silver, platinum) and defense stocks, and the USD has little to show for its erstwhile vauntedness. We think that this is because the implicit arrangements that have prevailed since WW2 are unraveling, however slowly,\u201d he told clients in a note seen by Fortune.\nAt UBS, Paul Donovan was similarly downbeat. \u201cThe deterioration in the international standing of the U.S. and recent domestic events may be corroding some of the perceived supports of the dollar\u2019s reserve status,\u201d he told clients today.\nWaiting for the Fed\nIn the U.S., everything is on hold for the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision on Wednesday. S&P 500 futures were down 0.12% this morning after closing flat at 6,915 on Friday.\nAlmost no one thinks the Fed will move the base rate level (it\u2019s currently at the 3.5%-plus level). Speculators on the CME FedWatch Fed Funds futures index think there is a 97% chance the rate stays on hold.\nThat potentially sets up some fireworks later in the week, as President Trump has been vocal in calling for lower rates. Ironically, his public aggression on the issue has made the Fed marginally less likely to cut rates, as the Federal Open Market Committee is now under pressure to demonstrate its political independence.\nThe drama in the Fed\u2019s decision, therefore, will center on which words Chairman Jerome Powell uses in his Q&A with the press.\n\u201cWhile the FOMC is expected to keep its policy rate between a range of 3.5% and 3.75%, the real action will be at the news conference afterward on Wednesday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will face reporters,\u201d according to RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas. \u201cWe expect that Powell will use his platform to provide an erudite but accessible defense of central bank independence. The discussion around central bank independence will suck all the air out of the room and will most likely see a real-time response out of the White House.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:\n- S&P 500 futures were down 0.12% this morning. The last session closed flat at 6,915.\n- STOXX Europe 600 was flat in early trading.\n- The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was flat in early "

                "body": "What is the price of silver today?\nIn recent years, with inflation problematic and higher interest rates impacting investors of all types, many turned to gold for protection and portfolio diversification. And the yellow metal subsequently surged in price, surpassing numerous price records on its way toward the $5,000 per ounce mark. But another precious metal has quietly but impressively grown at the same time: silver.\nLong considered the cost-effective precious metal alternative to gold, the price of silver has surged recently and is now up by more than 200% from where it sat in January 2025. And that remarkable growth could easily continue in the weeks and months ahead, especially if certain economic conditions are met. This potential can be both daunting and encouraging for prospective investors \u2013 and advantageous for those who are already invested in the metal or considering adding more to their portfolio right now.\nTo better determine the value of investing in silver now, it helps to know where the price currently stands. So, what is the price of silver per ounce now? That's what we'll outline below (and explain why getting invested now could make the most sense).\nProtect your portfolio with gold and silver here now.\nWhat is the price of silver today?\nThe price of silver is $109.23 per ounce as of January 26, 2026, according to American Hartford Gold, a precious metals dealer. That's up dramatically from just $31 for the same amount of metal in January 2025. So the price growth here is unmistakable and, for investors who have been priced out of the gold market entirely, this could be the smart (and affordable) way to get invested in precious metals now.\nWaiting for the price to decline is generally not advisable. While silver prices can be more volatile than gold, over time, they tend to only increase, so waiting for a temporary drop in the price could be an expensive mistake worth avoiding.\nGet started with a silver investment today.\nWhy should you invest in silver now?\nWhile not identical, the benefits of silver investing are similar to those gold offers. Thanks to a consistent price, particularly during inflationary periods, silver can help your portfolio hedge against the corrosive impacts of inflation in a way that other assets cannot. Accordingly, it can help function as a critical diversifier for those whose portfolios are otherwise too heavily made up of stocks, bonds, real estate or other investment types.\nAnd while gold and silver aren't typically considered income-producing assets, a quick glance at the price chart for either over the past year illustrates that, right now at least, both may be able to be sold for a rapid profit. Still, with industrial demand for silver expected to remain powerful, waiting around to invest may not make sense, either. Instead, consider speaking with a financial advisor or precious metal company that can answer any questions you may have and help you determine the exact role silver can play in your portfolio now.\nThe bottom line\nThe price of silver per ounce currently sits just under $100 per ounce. That said, this is the price for the metal before any dealer mark-ups, which can easily cause the price to rise considerably higher. So, if you need the inflation hedge and portfolio diversification the metal represents and don't want to pay the exorbitant price you'd otherwise have to in order to secure the same benefits with gold, it could make sense to get started with the metal this month. Just be sure to keep silver as a critical but limited portion of your overall portfolio, typically capped at 10% or less, to avoid overcrowding your other assets at the same time."

                "body": "Silver Price Surges Past US$100, Hitting Triple-Digit Territory\nThe silver price hit yet another a new record, pushing past US$100 per ounce.\nThe silver price hit a new all-time high on Monday (January 26), rising as high as US$116.67 per ounce as gold broke US$5,000 and brought its sister metal along for the ride.\nSilver is continuing a breakout that began earlier this month on a mixed bag of economic uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions in Venezuela and Iran and underlying industrial demand strength in the face of a multi-year supply deficit.\nAdding fuel to the fire last week were US President Donald Trump's comments about Greenland.\nOn January 17, Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social he would place tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries until a deal was reached for the US to purchase Greenland.\nThe statement raised hackles in Europe, and Trump ultimately removed the tariff threat, saying the US will not use force to take control of Greenland. However, the president also said he's reached a deal framework with NATO regarding Greenland's future; details about the deal have not been released at this time.\nTensions between Trump and US Federal Reserve are also providing support for silver, which like gold acts as a safe haven in times of turmoil. On January 9, the US Department of Justice served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment over Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee this past June.\nTrump denied knowledge of the investigation, but the move has still reignited concerns about Fed independence, with Powell linking it to the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump would like.\nPowell's term as Fed chair ends in May, but two years still remain on his term as a governor of the board.\nTarget rate probabilities for January 2026 Fed meeting.\nChart via CME Group.\nThe Fed's next rate announcement is set for January 28, and CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool shows strong expectations for a hold. That's despite core consumer price index (CPI) data showing that inflation rose by a lower-than-expected 0.2 percent for December. On an annual basis, core CPI was up 2.6 percent.\nTrump has frequently criticized Powell for not lowering rates quickly enough, and Powell's replacement, who has not yet been announced, is widely expected to be more in line with Trump's views.\n\u201cWe see increased interference with the Fed as a key bullish wildcard for the precious metals in 2026,\u201d Carsten Menke, head of next-generation research at Julius Baer Group, told Bloomberg. He noted that because silver is a smaller market than gold, it typically reacts \u201cmore strongly to such concerns.\u201d\nSilver price chart, January 18 to 26, 2026.\nChart via the Investing News Network.\nSilver and its sister metal gold tend to fare better when rates are lower, meaning rate cut expectations coupled with the investigation of Powell and the Fed have helped to stoke prices for the precious metals.\nWhile silver is known for lagging behind gold before outperforming, it's now ahead in terms of percentage gains \u2014 silver is up about 279 percent year-on-year, while gold has risen around 85 percent.\nThe yellow metal also hit a new all-time high on Friday, peaking at US$5,110.23 per ounce.\nIn addition to rate-related factors, silver's breakout this year has been driven by various other elements.\nAs a precious metal, it's influenced by many of the same factors as gold, but its October price jump, which took it past the US$50 level, was also driven by a lack of liquidity in the London market.\nWhile that issue appears to have resolved, silver remains in a multi-year supply deficit. Tariff concerns and silver's new status as a critical mineral in the US have also provided support.\nIn addition to its appeal as a precious metal, silver's industrial side shouldn't be forgotten \u2014 according to the Silver Institute, the white metal's \"global silver industrial demand is poised to grow fur"

                "body": "Libya signs $20bn oil deals with US and French energy companies\nLibya\u2019s Tripoli-based government signed a 25-year oil development agreement with France's TotalEnergies and the US\u2019s ConocoPhillips that could more than double the output of its Waha Oil company.\nWaha, a subsidiary of Libya\u2019s state-owned National Oil Corporation, is producing roughly 350,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd). The agreement signed on Saturday will unlock $20bn in investments intended to increase production to 850,000 bpd.\nWaha, ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies will develop four new oil fields as part of the agreement, which includes an exploration programme for 19 concession areas.\nTripoli expects at least $376bn in revenue over the next 25 years from the agreement, Libya\u2019s Prime Minister Abdul Hamid al-Dbeibah wrote on X.\nHe said that Tripoli\u2019s partnership with ConocoPhillips and Total \u201crepresent a qualitative and unique achievement, reflecting the strengthening of [Libya\u2019s] relations with the largest and most influential international partners in the global energy sector\u201d.\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\nTripoli also signed an agreement with Chevron and the government of Egypt to cooperate on energy logistics, exploration and production.\nThe deals were announced at an energy and economic summit in Tripoli attended by US envoy Massad Boulos, who is also the father-in-law of US President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter Tiffany.\n\"The National Oil Corporation\u2019s announcement regarding the expansion of the Waha Consortium partnership with ConocoPhillips is a prime example of the deepening collaboration between the United States and Libya,\" the US embassy to Libya said in a statement.\nGeopolitics\nLibya is home to Africa's largest oil reserves and once had daily production close to that of fellow Opec member Saudi Arabia. But international investment in Libya's oil sector waned following the 2011 Nato-backed uprising that ousted former longtime Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.\nLibyan oil is some of the cheapest in the world to extract, and the deals could allow Total and ConocoPhillips to tap those supplies for decades to come.\nThe deal also has geopolitical significance. It is a vote of confidence by the international energy companies, along with the governments of France and the US, in Dbeibeh\u2019s Tripoli-based government.\nDbeibeh was sworn in as president in 2021 with a United Nations mandate to lead a transition government and usher in democratic elections. The vote never took place. Backed by powerful militias, he has clung to power.\nMeanwhile, eastern Libya is ruled by former CIA-asset and general, Khalifa Haftar. The 82-year-old sons are jockeying for influence. Saddam Haftar, who heads the army, is courting the US, Gulf states, and, more recently, Turkey for backing.\nAfter Qaddafi's removal, Libya descended into a civil war that transformed into a proxy conflict with Russia, the UAE, Egypt, and France backing Haftar and Turkey supporting the government in Tripoli.\nThe energy deals underscore how those hard divisions are vanishing as Libya\u2019s elite and foreign governments jockey for power.\nEgypt has signed an energy deal with Dbeibeh\u2019s Tripoli government amid feuds with the Haftar family over its support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary fighting the Sudanese army, which is backed by Cairo, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.\nCairo has tried to mediate between the Haftars and Sudanese General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, but weapons and gas continue to flow from southeastern Libya to the RSF, Middle East Eye has reported. Saddam Haftar is especially close to the UAE.\nThe US has sought to play both sides of Libya. Following his visit to Tripoli, Boulos travelled to Benghazi in eastern Libya, where he met with Saddam Haftar, his brother Belgasem, and Aguila Saleh, the speaker of eastern Libya\u2019s Parliament, backed by the Haftar family.\nBou"

The yen's intervention added fresh fuel to the metals' already impressive rally.\nGold trades over 18% higher so far this year, after rallying by 63% in 2025. Investors have piled into the safe haven amid concerns over geopolitical tensions, USD weakness and lower interest rates, which have all boosted gold's appeal, as well as central bank buying.\nSafe haven demand on tariff threats, government shutdown worries\nThe latest leg higher today came, and Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Canada. Trump warned that if Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately face 100% tariffs on all Canadian goods entering the US. This lifted safe haven flows.\nWorries that the US government could shut down for the second time in months come amid anger from Senate Democrats, who said they wouldn't vote for a federal funding package without major changes to Homeland Security provisions.\nUSD slumps, yen intervention worries, Gold rally\nAdding support to gold, there has been a sharp decline in the US dollar, amid intervention concerns to support the Japanese yen. The yen has risen by 1.5% in the European session, leaving USD/JPY at 153.40, its lowest level since mid-November.\nThe New York Federal Reserve conducted a rate check on Friday, raising the chance of joint US-Japanese intervention, the first in 15 years, to halt the yen's slide.\nThese moves have come as the yen has been under huge pressure following Takeichi's taking over as Japanese Prime Minister in October. She has pledged to ramp up spending and cut taxes, sending Japanese government bond yields to record highs and the currency sharply lower.\nFed rate cut expectations.\nAttention will also be on the FOMC rate decision this week. No rate cut is expected, but the market is still pricing in two cuts this year, which keeps non-yielding gold supported. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s remarks will be watched closely for clues over the timing of the Fed\u2019s next cut. A dovish-sounding Powell could lift Gold further.\nXAU/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nXAU/USD trades within a rising channel on the 4-hour chart, reaching a record high of 5109. The RSI is very overbought, so buyers should be cautious at these levels. However, the MACD shows strong bullish momentum.\nBuyers will look to break out above the rising channel and 5110 to create a higher high to fresh record levels.\nSupport is seen at 4965, the lower band of the rising channel. Below her 4900 comes into focus.\nEUR/USD rises to a 4-month high amid USD weakness\nEUR/USD has risen to a four-month high above 1.1850 in early trade on Monday amid uninspiring German business sentiment and an ongoing slump in the US dollar.\nThe US Federal Reserve conducted a rate check on the US dollar yen on Friday. Such a move is often considered a warning of an intervention in the forex market, prompting investors to cut their U.S. dollar long positions. USD/JPY rallied. The US dollar sharply fell on Friday and extended those losses on Monday, helping the EUR/USD to its highest level since September.\nPresident Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on Canada has brought the erratic trade policy of the Trump administration back into focus, and is also keeping the US dollar under pressure.\nOn the macroeconomic data front, German business sentiment remained unchanged in January according to the latest Ifo survey. The business sentiment index was 87.6 in January, unchanged from December, suggesting the German economy is starting the new year without momentum.\nLooking ahead, the main focus will be on the FOMC rate decision on Wednesday.\nEUR/USD forecast -technical analysis\nEUR/USD extended its recovery from the 1.16 2026 low, rising above 1.18 resistance to 1.19, a four-month high, before easing lower.

At the time of writing, EUR/USD is trading around 1.1886, holding near its highest level since September 17.\nThe renewed demand for the Euro comes as uncertainty surrounding US President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade rhetoric, repeated use of tariffs as an economic weapon and interference with the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) independence are eroding the United States\u2019 economic credibility.\nAgainst this backdrop, traders are rotating out of the US Dollar in favor of other G10 currencies, reflecting fading confidence in the Greenback\u2019s role as the world\u2019s dominant reserve currency.\nPolitical risks are also back in focus. Fears of another US government shutdown have resurfaced after Senate Democrats vowed to block a major funding bill, with lawmakers facing a January 30 deadline.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, is trading near 96.97, sliding to four-month lows.\nThe Dollar\u2019s weakness has been compounded by a sharp recovery in the Japanese Yen (JPY) after reports that the New York Fed conducted a \u201crate check\u201d on USD/JPY on behalf of the US Treasury, fueling speculation about possible coordinated intervention.\nMeanwhile, US data released earlier in the day did little to support the US Dollar. Durable Goods Orders jumped 5.3% in November, well above market expectations of 0.5% and reversing October\u2019s -2.1% reading.\nDurable Goods Orders excluding defense rose 6.6%, while orders excluding transportation increased 0.5%, beating forecasts of 0.3% and following October\u2019s 0.1% gain. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft advanced 0.7% after a 0.3% increase in October.\nAttention now turns to the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision on Wednesday. Markets widely expect the central bank to keep interest rates unchanged, placing the spotlight on Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference for fresh guidance on the policy outlook.\nIn the Eurozone, traders are watching January Business Climate, Consumer Confidence and the Economic Sentiment Indicator data due Thursday, followed by the preliminary estimate of fourth-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on Friday.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy me"

The pair is up about 0.26% to around 1.1860, while the DXY is around 97.00, which is the lowest level in about four months. The driver is ongoing investor worry about US trade relations and policy uncertainty, even though some recent tensions between the US and the EU have calmed down.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about ETF brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nThe Fed\u2019s decision on Wednesday is the major event this week. The markets anticipate the Fed will keep rates between 3.50% and 3.75%. This would be the first time rates stayed the same after three cuts in late 2025 that added up to 75 bps. The reaction function is more important than the rate decision now that the hold is mostly priced in. Traders will pay attention to how Powell communicates about inflation, the job market, and whether the committee is open to confirming or pushing back against expectations for easing in the near future.\nPolitical and institutional risk adds yet another level of complexity to USD pricing. The Fed is facing significant pressure and unusual legal challenges. The markets remain concerned about independence optics and policy credibility. That backdrop could keep the dollar down until something significant happens. However, things could go the other way quickly if the Fed seems united and strong.\nThe next factors to watch for on the euro side are the first estimates of Eurozone GDP for Q4 and Germany\u2019s HICP for January. The recent data is not all good. The Eurozone services PMI fell to 51.9. Germany\u2019s services beat expectations, and manufacturing improved but stayed in contraction. In December, Germany\u2019s industrial production fell by 0.7%, which was a surprise. This makes it harder to argue for a tighter ECB policy and keeps ECB expectations steady instead of supportive.\nOn the other hand, the US still looks strong compared to other countries, with a strong December payrolls print of 210k. If the Fed sounds even a little hawkish, that difference could come back quickly.\nOverall, this week is a battle between weak USD sentiment going into the Fed meeting and the probability that trade news or stronger Fed communication will bring back the dollar\u2019s safe-haven bid and limit EURUSD rallies.\nEUR/USD Technical Price Analysis: Pullback Before Further Upside\nThe EUR/USD price is currently consolidating above the mid-1.1800 level after reaching a multi-month high near 1.1900 and subsequently bouncing from a strong supply zone. The pair formed a bearish pin bar while leaving a bullish gap near 1.1825.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about South African forex brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nThe RSI indicates an extreme overbought condition, which could lead to a pullback to fill the gap at 1.1825 before testing the supply-turned-demand zone near 1.1800. However, the broader trend remains bullish while staying well above the key MAs. The buyers could aim to pierce the 2025 highs near 1.1930 to test the psychological mark at 1.2000.\nLooking to trade forex now?

The UK Composite PMI also reached a 21-month high of 53.9 in December.\nSome analysts suggest these positive figures might delay potential Bank of England rate cuts. Rate stability is anticipated at their next meeting in February, with a rate cut projected by June. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady at its upcoming meeting, but traders will focus on any comments from Chair Jerome Powell that might influence market expectations.\nThe Pound Sterling is the fourth most traded currency globally, with key pairs including GBP/USD. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy, based on achieving a 2% inflation rate, significantly impacts the Pound\u2019s value. Economic data and the trade balance are also influential on the Pound\u2019s strength.\nThe strength in GBP/USD that pushed the pair above 1.3650 was driven by robust UK economic figures from late 2025. We saw UK Retail Sales in December 2025 unexpectedly rise by 0.4%, beating forecasts of a decline. This positive momentum suggests the underlying UK economy has more resilience than previously thought.\nFollowing that period, the US Federal Reserve did hold interest rates steady in its January meeting, but the commentary was interpreted as less dovish than anticipated, causing the pair\u2019s rally to pause. Recent US data from last week showed Initial Jobless Claims ticking up slightly to 218,000, continuing a trend of a gradually cooling, but not collapsing, labor market. This supports the view that the Fed can afford to be patient before signaling any definitive pivot towards rate cuts.\nOutlook and Strategy\nMore recent data from our side in the UK showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December 2025 held firm at 3.9%, resisting the expected drop to 3.7%. This persistent inflation reinforces the market belief that the Bank of England will be one of the last major central banks to cut rates. This policy divergence is the primary factor that should continue to support the pound against the dollar.\nGiven this backdrop, we should consider positioning for further GBP strength, while managing the risk of short-term pullbacks. Buying GBP/USD call options with a March 2026 expiry and a strike price around 1.3750 offers a defined-risk way to capture potential upside. This strategy allows us to benefit if the bullish trend resumes following the current consolidation.\nFor a more conservative approach, a bull call spread could be implemented by selling a higher-strike call, perhaps at 1.3900, against the purchased 1.3750 call. This lowers the initial cost of the trade but caps the maximum profit, making it suitable for a scenario of a steady, grinding move higher. Historically, such policy divergences, as seen between the Fed and ECB in 2022, can lead to sustained, but not explosive, currency trends.\nImplied volatility is expected to increase as we approach the Bank of England\u2019s meeting in early February. This makes selling premium, as in the bull call spread, more attractive now. Traders should monitor volatility levels closely, as any significant spike could present better entry points for long-volatility strategies or indicate heightened market uncertainty."

The Pound Sterling (GBP) edges higher against the US Dollar (USD) on the stronger-than-expected UK Retail Sales and Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) data. These upbeat reports have led some analysts to predict a potential delay in further Bank of England (BoE) rate cuts.\nOn the USD\u2019s front, concerns over the Federal Reserve (Fed) independence and worries about another US government shutdown could weigh on the US Dollar. US President Donald Trump could announce the name of the Fed\u2019s next chairman sometime in January. Traders worry that the US central bank would lose its independence after the appointment of a Trump candidate as Fed Chairman.\nMarkets might turn cautious ahead of the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday. The US Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at its policy meeting on Wednesday, following three consecutive cuts at the end of 2025. Traders will closely monitor Fed press conference following the policy meeting, as it could provide important clues for the months ahead. Any hawkish remarks from Fed officials could underpin the Greenback and act as a headwind for the major pair.\nTechnical Analysis:\nIn the daily chart, GBP/USD holds well above the rising 100-day EMA at 1.3385, maintaining a firm bullish bias. The average slopes higher and pullbacks would be expected to hold above it. RSI(14) prints at 72, overbought and prone to a pause in momentum. Initial resistance aligns with the upper Bollinger Band at 1.3656, while the 20-day middle band offers first support at 1.3480.\nBollinger Bands widen, underscoring rising volatility as price pushes beyond the upper band and leaves the advance stretched. If momentum fades, a pullback could target the mid-band, with deeper support at the lower band at 1.3306. Holding above the band breakout would keep the topside bias intact, though the setup carries elevated snapback risk.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direc"

                "body": "Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Surges as Risk Appetite Returns Ahead of AU CPI\nThe Australian dollar has been the standout performer in FX this past week, rallying sharply against all major peers. Gains versus the Japanese yen and US dollar have been particularly strong, with neither AUD/USD nor AUD/JPY showing any meaningful signs of a bearish reversal so far. Improving risk sentiment and renewed focus on domestic inflation risks have combined to put the Aussie firmly back on traders\u2019 radar.\nView related analysis:\n- ASX 200 Holds Gains as Jobs Data Fails to Derail Risk Rally\n- Australian Dollar Rallies as Trump Eases Tariff Fears, Wall Street Rebounds\n- US Dollar Slips on Trump Tariffs: EUR/USD, USD/JPY Price Action Setups\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Stuck as Geopolitics and US Data Loom\nWhy AUD/USD Is Rallying as Risk Appetite Improves and RBA Hike Bets Return\nImproving risk sentiment \u2014 helped by easing geopolitical and tariff concerns tied to recent US\u2013Greenland headlines \u2014 has allowed traders to refocus on domestic fundamentals and the potential for further policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia. A rally in base metals is reinforcing expectations of a pickup in global growth, adding another tailwind for the Australian dollar. Crucially, the Aussie\u2019s broad-based strength shows this is not simply a US dollar story, suggesting underlying demand for AUD is building earlier than expected.\nSource: TradingView\nNo Change Expected from the Fed\nMarkets have been pricing in no change from the Federal Reserve for some time, and there is little reason to expect otherwise. Despite President Trump\u2019s persistent efforts to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, US not cooling quickly enough to justify rate cuts.\nAs a result, the Fed is unlikely to deviate materially from its current guidance at this meeting. Updated economic projections were released in December, and incoming data since then has only reinforced expectations for policy to remain on hold.\nQ4 CPI Takes Centre Stage for RBA Policy\nSource: ABS, LSEG\nDomestically, Australia\u2019s economic calendar needs little over-analysis, with Wednesday\u2019s Q4 CPI report clearly the focal point. Governor Michele Bullock has made it clear that this inflation print is the key swing factor for the February policy meeting. The Bank has deliberately adopted a wait-and-see stance, and Q4 CPI represents the final major data input before a decision is made on whether policy needs to tighten again.\nFollowing this week\u2019s strong employment figures for December, any heat in CPI data \u2014 reflected through a firmer trimmed mean or persistently sticky services inflation \u2014 would materially lift expectations that the RBA could still deliver a rate hike as soon as February.\nAUD/USD Correlations\nTraditional correlations with the Australian dollar have re-emerged amid macro-driven volatility, with gold, the New Zealand dollar (NZD) and the Chinese yuan (CNH) showing a strong positive relationship, alongside a clear inverse correlation with the US dollar (USD) index.\nSource: LSEG\nAUD/USD Futures Positioning \u2013 COT Report\nThe slight decline in net-long exposure fails to capture the explosive move higher in the Australian dollar, as the report was compiled at Tuesday\u2019s close \u2014 missing the Aussie\u2019s 2.4% rally into Friday. With AUD/USD extending gains again on Monday, there\u2019s a strong chance futures traders are already net-long the pair. And if asset managers aren\u2019t there yet, they\u2019re likely very close to flipping to a bullish net-long stance.\nSource: CFTC, CME, LSEG\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThere is little need to overcomplicate the technical picture while the Australian dollar remains in the midst of a strong, fundamentally driven move. Unless global sentiment reverses sharply and expectations for an RBA hike fade, pullbacks are likely to be favoured by AUD/USD bulls.

Traders now await the December Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due Wednesday for further clues on the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) policy outlook.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) draws support against the US Dollar (USD) as government bond yields have grown more attractive, with policy-sensitive three-year bond yield rising to 4.27%, the highest level since November 2023, supported by confidence in Australia\u2019s top-tier credit rating and the central bank\u2019s hawkish policy outlook.\nAustralia\u2019s strong PMI data reinforced the likelihood of a tighter monetary policy from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), supported by employment data. RBA policymakers acknowledged that inflation has eased significantly from its 2022 peak, though recent data suggests renewed upward momentum. Headline CPI slowed to 3.4% YoY in November but remains above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target band.\nThe AUD/USD pair could recover ground as the US Dollar (USD) comes under pressure from rising political uncertainty, with the US government heading toward a potential partial shutdown. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has vowed to oppose a funding package that includes appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, leaving Congress facing a January 30 deadline to avert a shutdown.\nTraders may also turn cautious amid uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve (Fed). US President Donald Trump said last week he would soon announce his nominee to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, fueling speculation that the next chair could favor faster interest rate cuts. Focus now shifts to Wednesday\u2019s Fed policy announcement.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can"

The balance of risks currently favors further AUD strength over USD. Meanwhile, the dollar is soft, with the DXY trading near recent lows. Concerns over Fed independence, uncertainty about the next Fed chair, and the risk of a partial government shutdown are weighing down market confidence.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about ETF brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nThe Fed is expected to keep rates on hold after three cuts in late 2025. This limits the scope for a clearly hawkish surprise at this meeting. Data releases such as ADP employment and consumer confidence may tweak expectations at the margin. However, political noise and leadership uncertainty are doing more damage to USD sentiment than the macro data for now.\nThe Australian side, on the other hand, looks much more hawkish. It has been more than 3 years since Australian government bond yields were this high. This shows that investors trust Australia\u2019s creditworthiness and believe the RBA may still need to raise rates. On the other hand, the data from the US has been strong, with strong PMI and labor numbers. Inflation has dropped to 3.4% YoY, but it remains above the RBA\u2019s target range of 2% to 3%.\nWednesday\u2019s CPI is the key near-term catalyst for AUD/USD. Traders will focus on the trimmed mean and services inflation. Any upside surprise would raise the odds of a February RBA hike and likely push AUD/USD higher. Even a slightly softer print may not be enough to unwind hike pricing, given the recent strong employment data.\nGlobal risk sentiment also supports the Aussie. Easing geopolitical and tariff concerns, along with a rally in base metals, has encouraged demand for pro-cyclical FX. AUD has outperformed across the board, not just against USD. Unless the Fed surprises markets with a clearly hawkish message or US political risks recede, dips in AUD/USD are likely to be bought, with risks skewed to the upside into CPI.\nAUD/USD Technical Forecast: Pullback Before an Upside\nThe AUD/USD consolidates gains above 0.6900, with the RSI indicating extreme overbought conditions.

                "body": "USD/JPY Breaks Down \u2013 Was it Intervention? What Comes Next?\nIt was a cascading sell-off in USD/JPY to end last week and that\u2019s led to an extension in the move so far this week. It didn\u2019t take long for the accusation of intervention to take over on social media and it seems many have assumed this as an almost foregone conclusion, although I would like to point out a reasonable doubt. And, perhaps more importantly, I\u2019d like to put the argument in the proper place as spending any time debating whether or not it was intervention-fueled without the ability for any nearby proof one way or the other can obfuscate from what matters most, and that\u2019s trying to get on the right side of the next move.\nTo open this week Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi said that she won\u2019t comment on specific market moves, which isn\u2019t out of tune for Japanese policymakers around such events. It\u2019s not often until we get a look at BoJ money market data that we can legitimately deduce whether it was an intervention.\nI had spoken on this topic a week ahead of last week\u2019s sell-off, pointing out a conversation that seemed important between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama. Katayama had remarked that she spoke with Bessent and they both had a vested interest against \u2018one-sided\u2019 moves in the currency, and this makes sense. The US has long pushed for a weaker US Dollar, and the Japanese Yen weakness that had taken over after Takaichi\u2019s election in October seemed problematic for Japanese inflation expectations and Japanese government bond yields.\n\u201cThe intervention threat is real here and, longer-term, something from last week could take on more importance, and this was specifically Finance Minister Katayama mentioning that she had spoken with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and that they both had a similar desire, widely read to mean that they both wanted to see the spot rate in USD/JPY to ease. Since then, we\u2019ve seen a couple of different support hits from prior resistance in USD/JPY, but each has so far led to a lower-high.\u201d\nThis is important because this has a price action component that led into what happened last week, and this is further why I question whether an actual intervention took place.\nBut, also speaking to that is the way that the USD/JPY pair traded around the BoJ meeting and into last week\u2019s close.\nThere was an initial shock of weakness in the pair when the BoJ opened the door to more rate hikes, but the pair then went on to recover a bit. And it was around the US open, after the Core PCE data had been released that the pair started to get hit really hard, and the selling intensified into the close and kept through the next weekly open.\nUSD/JPY 30-Minute Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/JPY What Matters Now\nAt this point whether the initial spark or even the hastening of the move was driven by intervention is less important than what happens from here \u2013 and that\u2019s whether longer-term longs use bounces to wiggle out of long positions. This is what could drive an even deeper sell-off in the pair and create more of a carry unwind type of scenario.\nPositioning remains the most important aspect of price movements because even the most bullish news will fail to drive prices if buyers aren\u2019t hitting the bid and creating more demand. And if we do end up in a situation where the market is heavily long \u2013 even with representative fundamental environment backing such a move, we can see the other side of that trend show up quickly.\nThis is what explains the sell-offs in Q4 of 2022 and 2023, when the carry trade was in full bloom but the Ministry of Finance had ordered interventions to defend 150.00 in 2022. And then in 2023, bulls didn\u2019t even want to dare a re-test of the prior high at 151.95. And then, in 2024, with US fundamentals remaining strong, buyers eventually mustered the strength to run a break, fueled at least in-part by stops on short positions sitting above the p"

That's a big warning about potential intervention.\nIn addition, on the weekend Japan PM Sanae Takaichi warned officials stand ready to act against \u201cspeculative and highly abnormal\u201d market moves as the yen weakens and bond yields rise.\nOfficials appear to be escalating from verbal warnings to operational signalling, increasing intervention risk into thin-liquidity sessions and the market is taking heed. USD/JPY longs and yen shorts in general have been a popular and increasingly crowded trade over the past eight months and it looks like a race to the exits that's continuing in early trade.\nThe comments from Takaichi were made during the leaders' debates and an election is coming in February. There's no doubt she doesn't want markets (including the bond market) to get disorderly during the campaign so that heights the risk of intervention. At the same time, she's campaigned on more fiscal spending and you can't fool the bond market forever."

                "body": "FX Daily: Suspected USD/JPY intervention adds to weak dollar moment\nSuspected intervention to sell USD/JPY, plus US authorities reportedly getting involved, has prompted a near 3.5% drop since Friday morning. This move has caught the dollar at a weak moment, and pairs like EUR/USD and USD/CHF have taken out key levels. This is not a fundamentally driven dollar move, but the dollar risk premium can stay elevated\nUSD: Dollar risk premium to stay elevated\nSuspected Japanese intervention to sell USD/JPY has come at a weak time for the dollar after last week's geopolitical fracturing. From what we understand so far, Japanese authorities may have intervened on Friday when USD/JPY pushed above 159 after the Bank of Japan policy meeting. The big kicker, however, was widespread discussion that at the London close at 17:00 GMT on Friday, the Federal Reserve started asking banks in New York about their position sizes in USD/JPY. This was seen as akin to a 'rate check', where a central bank might be preparing the market for physical intervention. That the Fed was allegedly doing this and not making clear that this activity was purely on behalf of Japanese authorities \u2013 i.e., that the Fed was not acting purely as an 'agent' \u2013 has led to understandable suggestions that the US might be on the verge of joint intervention with Japan. This is something we discussed in this month's FX Talking.\nThe prospect of bilateral Japan-US intervention is understandably a more powerful one than mere passive intervention from Tokyo alone. Why would Washington want to get involved? We see two reasons: a) the weak yen was adding to last week's JGB sell-off and indirectly driving US Treasury yields higher. If there is any financial instrument more important than the stock market to the White House right now, it is US Treasuries. And b) the strong USD/JPY was potentially unwinding the work of US tariffs on Japan and giving Japanese manufacturers a competitive advantage.\nHowever, this is not a fundamentally driven move. Yen real interest rates are still negative, and the snap Japanese election on 8 February could still see more pressure emerge on JGBs and the yen. And away from the geopolitical risk premium being attached to US assets, the dollar's fundamental story has not deteriorated. Plus, we suspect this week's FOMC meeting could prove slightly dollar bullish.\nNo doubt, Japanese and potentially US authorities, too, like this constructively ambiguous approach to FX intervention. Traders will be bracing for activity at both market opens and closes now. An upside gap in USD/JPY at 155.65 may now prove intraday resistance. But for the dollar sell-off to continue like this, we will probably need to see some poor domestic US news. Away from the FOMC, this will heighten scrutiny on earnings releases from US Big Tech this Wednesday and Thursday.\nThis yen intervention story has weighed heavily on DXY, where the prospect of up to $100bn of sales (that's what Tokyo sold in summer 2024) has caught the dollar at a weak moment. DXY has an upside gap to 97.42 (now resistance) and has a bias to last year's lows at 96.20/35 \u2013 but really needs some fundamental backing for these moves to sustain.\nChris Turner\nEUR: Go with the flow\nWe had not been expecting this kind of EUR/USD strength this quarter, but it seems the combination of last week's geopolitical developments and potentially large dollar sales from Japan has sent EUR/USD through major resistance at 1.1800/1810. The three themes we mentioned on Friday are generally supportive for the euro. Continued strong flows into emerging market equity ETFs support the global growth theory, while surging gold and the Swiss franc are maintaining the dollar debasement narrative.\nThere may also be a little macro support to the euro story, too. Eurozone PMIs are edging higher \u2013 most importantly in Germany. Another good reading from the German Ifo index can prove mildly EUR/USD supportive and could drag EUR/USD back to major resistance "

However, the upside for the pair might be limited, as the Federal Reserve (Fed) uncertainty and worries about another US government shutdown could exert some selling pressure on the US Dollar (USD) against the Canadian Dollar (CAD). The Fed and Bank of Canada (BoC) interest rate decisions will be the highlights later on Wednesday.\nThe BoC is widely anticipated to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 2.25% at its January meeting on Wednesday as inflation remains within the target range. The US central bank is also expected to stand pat on Wednesday, although it\u2019s wrestling with different issues, including US President Donald Trump's attempts to undermine the central bank\u2019s independence and questions about who will replace Jerome Powell as chair when his term ends in May.\nTrump said last week that he would soon announce his pick for the next Fed chair to replace Chair Jerome. Speculation about the next Fed Chair might weigh on the Greenback as markets expect a nominee who would favor faster interest rate cuts.\nThe US government is heading for a partial shutdown as the top Democrat in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, vows to oppose a funding package that includes appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. Congress faces a January 30 deadline to fund the government or risk a partial government shutdown, which could drag the USD lower against the CAD.\nOn the other hand, renewed Trump\u2019s tariff threats might cap the upside for the Loonie. Trump on Saturday threatened to slap 100% tariffs on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal with China, raising fears of a renewed trade war.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capi"

                "body": "The Canadian Dollar (CAD) is confronting challenges driven by trade concerns and monetary policy expectations. US tariff threats linked to Canada\u2019s relationship with China have introduced market volatility, despite reassurances from Canadian officials. While extreme trade measures are not imminent, the atmosphere keeps the Loonie reactive to political developments.\nMonetary Policy Expectations\nMonetary policy is under scrutiny as the Bank of Canada is expected to keep rates steady. Market analysis will focus on the BoC\u2019s statements for insights into balancing trade risks with domestic economic performance. The US economic calendar, featuring data on growth and inflation, plays a role in USD/CAD movements with potential impacts on the Fed\u2019s policy direction.\nRecent market movements have seen the CAD slow after a streak against the falling Greenback. Despite the US Dollar\u2019s ongoing weakness aiding the Loonie, resistance remains around 1.3600, with market dynamics suggesting limited potential for rapid gains in the near term.\nThe CAD is influenced by interest rates set by the BoC, Oil prices, trade balance, and overall market sentiment. Economic stability in both Canada and the US also significantly affects the Canadian Dollar. Inflation data can lead to rate adjustments, possibly boosting the CAD by attracting more capital inflows.\nThe Canadian dollar is currently navigating a mix of trade uncertainty and anticipation around central bank policy. We\u2019ve seen headline risk increase after renewed US tariff talk, even as officials try to manage the situation. For traders, this environment of political noise means implied volatility on USD/CAD options will likely stay high, creating opportunities for strategies that can profit from price swings.\nInterest Rates and Inflation\nWe anticipate both the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady this week, but their messaging will be critical. Canada\u2019s latest inflation data from December 2025 came in at a stubborn 2.9%, which was slightly hotter than the 2.6% core inflation figure recently reported in the US. This small divergence could lead the Bank of Canada to sound more cautious about future rate cuts than the Fed, potentially putting upward pressure on the USD/CAD pair.\nWe cannot ignore the price of oil, which continues to act as a supportive floor for the loonie. WTI crude has been consolidating firmly above $82 per barrel, a level supported by the consistent OPEC+ production discipline we saw throughout the second half of 2025. This underlying strength in energy prices should limit the extent of any significant Canadian dollar weakness in the coming weeks.\nFrom a technical perspective, the USD/CAD pair has found support around the 1.3700 level. Looking at recent positioning data, we\u2019ve noted that speculative net short positions against the Canadian dollar grew by over 15,000 contracts in the final quarter of 2025. This crowded trade setup suggests a risk of a sharp reversal, where any positive Canadian news could trigger a rapid move lower in USD/CAD toward the 1.3600 handle."

                "body": "On Monday, January 26, the US dollar against the Canadian dollar traded near 1.3680 during the European session, hovering around the lower boundary of a recent retracement channel. At present, there is neither a clear signal of reversal nor momentum for unilateral accelerated decline; the market appears to be in a 'silent period' awaiting the unveiling of key variables. This deadlock results from the interplay of multiple factors: central bank policy expectations, energy price trends, and geopolitical trade risks taking turns to influence traders' decisions, making them hesitant to bet on a direction.\nThe most anticipated event at the moment is the upcoming interest rate decision by the Bank of Canada. The market widely expects the policy rate to remain unchanged at 2.25%, with the real focus not on 'whether to act or not', but on 'why not to act'. If the central bank continues to emphasize that the current interest rate level is appropriate and that it will take time to verify inflation returning to target, this would essentially be sending a dovish signal. In such a case, market expectations for subsequent interest rate hikes would be further postponed, diminishing the interest rate differential advantage and naturally reducing the attractiveness of the Canadian dollar, making it easier for the US dollar against the Canadian dollar to move closer to 1.3600. Conversely, if the statement reveals concerns about external shocks\u2014such as a slowdown in global demand or an escalation in trade friction potentially dragging down the economy\u2014though seemingly cautious, it might suppress expectations of rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar, limiting further downward movement of the exchange rate.\nAs a commodity currency, the fate of the Canadian dollar has always been closely tied to oil prices. Currently, West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices are stable near $61.10, marking the second consecutive trading day of gains, providing some support to the Canadian dollar. Fundamentally, the tightening situation on the supply side is intensifying; combined with disruptions in certain regional supplies, the volatility center of oil prices is more likely to shift upwards in the short term. This is undoubtedly beneficial for an energy-exporting country like Canada, helping to improve trade terms and boosting confidence in the domestic currency through enhanced corporate profits and fiscal revenues.\nTechnical indicators flash yellow: Market positioning enters a critical phase\nFrom a technical chart perspective, the US dollar against the Canadian dollar is at a delicate position. On the daily chart, the downtrend from the previous high of 1.3927 remains unbroken, and after the price returned below 1.3700, it once again tested lower levels, indicating persistent selling pressure above. Notably, a significant horizontal resistance area has formed near 1.3800, and without strong macro catalysts, it will be difficult for the exchange rate to effectively break through and stabilize in this region. This indicates that the current market lacks sufficient buying confidence to initiate a meaningful rebound.\nBelow, the key support level to watch is the previous low at 1.3641. The current exchange rate is already operating close to this area, and further downside space is narrowing. Regarding technical indicators, while momentum indicators have not triggered a clear reversal signal, a pattern of 'unable to fall but unable to rise significantly' is forming. This means that even if there is potential for testing lower points in the short term, a sustained crash is unlikely.\nFuture direction hinges on the 'harmony' of three major variables\nLooking ahead, whether the US dollar against the Canadian dollar can break the deadlock critically depends on whether three core variables converge. First is the stance of the Bank of Canada\u2014how it explains its decision to 'maintain the interest rate unchanged' will directly affect the market's pricing rhythm for future "

                "body": "GBP/JPY fell close to 210.40, following Japan\u2019s warning of intervening to support the Yen against speculative activity. The Bank of Japan held interest rates at 0.75%, with encouraging UK data bolstering the Pound last week.\nThe pairing experienced nearly a 1% decline, as the Yen strengthened due to Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi\u2019s comments addressing speculative movements. The Yen emerged as the strongest against the US Dollar, with a change of 1.14%.\nStatements From Takaichi\nTakaichi stated that the government will act against speculative market fluctuations, but did not specify exact levels. The Bank of Japan maintained its 0.75% interest rate and hinted at possible future rate hikes.\nJapanese Yen\u2019s performance is influenced by economic factors, BoJ policy, bond yield differentials, and risk sentiment. The Bank\u2019s previous ultra-loose monetary policy weakened the Yen, but recent policy changes have provided some support.\nThe gap in US-Japanese bond yields previously favoured the US Dollar, but recent interest-rate adjustments are reducing it. The Yen often attracts safe-haven investments, gaining value in turbulent times.\nLast week, upbeat UK Retail Sales and PMI data supported the Pound which now shows mixed performance. Retail Sales grew by 0.4% month-on-month.\nImpact Of Past Events\nWe saw a similar situation play out last year in 2025, when the GBP/JPY cross fell towards 210.40 on mere verbal warnings from Japanese officials. The threat of intervention alone was enough to cause a significant sell-off. This created a new level of caution in the market that persists today.\nToday, with GBP/JPY trading closer to 205.50, that memory is still fresh and relevant. Since those events in 2025, the Bank of Japan has followed through on its hawkish hints, raising its key interest rate to 1.00% to combat persistent inflation which hit a multi-decade high of 3.5% late last year. This has fundamentally altered the interest rate differential that once heavily favored the Pound Sterling.\nFor derivative traders, this means the environment for shorting GBP/JPY volatility may be over for now. The narrowing yield gap suggests less appeal for carry trades, which could remove a key pillar of support for the pair. We should be looking at strategies that benefit from either a range-bound market or a further decline in the currency cross.\nThe key lesson from 2025 was the power of \u201cjawboning,\u201d which creates sudden spikes in volatility. Implied volatility on GBP/JPY options has remained elevated since then, currently sitting around 11.5% for 3-month contracts, compared to an average of 9% in late 2024. This presents an opportunity for those selling premium, but it carries the significant risk of sharp, unpredictable moves.\nLooking at bond yields, the differential between 10-year UK Gilts and Japanese Government Bonds has also tightened significantly. The spread has compressed by over 50 basis points in the last twelve months, from roughly 3.5% to just under 3.0% today. This reduction in yield advantage for the Pound reinforces the case for a lower ceiling on the GBP/JPY exchange rate.\nGiven this, we should consider using options to hedge against downside risk if holding long Pound positions. Buying put options on GBP/JPY can provide protection against another sudden yen-strengthening event, like the one we saw threatened in 2025. Any rallies back toward the 210.00 level should be viewed with extreme skepticism."

Zama said the sale cleared at $0.05 and was oversubscribed by 218%.\nZama added that its auction app was the most-used application on Ethereum by transaction count on Jan. 24, ahead of USDT, USDC and Uniswap. The project also said Total Value Shielded (TVS) topped $100 million within three days \u2013 its public Dune dashboard shows TVS at roughly $117.4 million as of Monday.\nZama said the sale used a sealed-bid auction, meaning people could choose a price publicly but keep the size of their bids private. The project said this was meant to reduce bots and copycat trading during the sale.\nThe method chosen by Zama comes as privacy has become a growing talking point in crypto, especially as more financial activity moves onchain.\nWhile some U.S. regulators have pushed for stronger crypto privacy tools, others globally have taken a tougher stance \u2013 including Dubai\u2019s financial regulator, which recently banned privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) from use on regulated exchanges.\n\u201cAfter studying more than a hundred TGEs, we found that auctions offer the best balance of fair distribution, price discovery, and capital efficiency,\u201d Zama\u2019s post reads. \u201cIn a Dutch auction, the clearing price isn't the highest bid, it's the lowest price at which a bid gets filled. Confidentiality is critical: when participants can see others' bids, price discovery becomes distorted as people react to one another rather than bidding what they truly believe.\u201d\nThe company said claims will open Feb. 2, with ZAMA tokens distributed as standard ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. The company said the token will be used to pay fees on the Zama Protocol and can be staked to earn rewards.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

                "body": "- Stablecoin issuers earned around $5B in 2025\n- Ethereum remained the dominant network for stablecoins\n- Increased DeFi use boosted on-chain stablecoin demand\nIn 2025, stablecoin issuers collectively earned nearly $5 billion in revenue from the supply of stablecoins deployed on Ethereum, according to blockchain analytics firm Token Terminal. This marks a significant increase compared to previous years and highlights Ethereum\u2019s continued dominance in the stablecoin economy.\nThe revenue is largely generated from interest earned on reserves, especially during a time of elevated interest rates globally. As stablecoins like USDT (Tether), USDC (Circle), and DAI (MakerDAO) saw wider adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), trading, and payments, issuers enjoyed substantial passive income from the assets backing these tokens.\nDeFi and On-Chain Activity Fuel Demand\nThe surge in revenue is a result of the growing utility of stablecoins in DeFi applications, including lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and yield farming protocols. With over $100 billion in stablecoin transaction volume flowing through Ethereum in 2025, the network has become the backbone for stable-value assets in crypto.\nIssuers benefit as they receive inflows when users mint stablecoins by depositing fiat or crypto collateral. They then invest those reserves in safe, interest-generating assets like U.S. Treasuries. The result? A reliable stream of income without needing to charge users directly.\nEthereum Remains the Top Choice for Stablecoins\nWhile other blockchains like Solana and Tron are gaining traction, Ethereum remains the top network for high-value stablecoin activity due to its established DeFi ecosystem and security. Despite higher fees compared to rivals, Ethereum\u2019s robust infrastructure and institutional trust make it the preferred network for stablecoin deployment.\nThis $5B milestone signals the growing importance of stablecoins not just as digital dollars, but as powerful financial tools driving real revenue for issuers\u2014and positioning Ethereum as the financial layer of the internet."

Slothana ($SLOTH), a project that by all traditional metrics should have struggled in the current market, is currently staging one of the most confusing\u2014and inspiring\u2014grassroots movements in crypto history.\nThe narrative is supposed to be simple: The price dips, and the community dissolves. But for the 23,000+ holders of $SLOTH, the script has been flipped.\nThe \"Anti-Panic\" Phenomenon\nOver 600 days after its launch, the Slothana community has done the unthinkable: they stayed.\nInstead of panic selling, the core community\u2014forged in the fires of a grueling market\u2014has hardened into a diamond-handed collective. What started as a standard speculative play for thousands of presale buyers has evolved into a fascinating social experiment in digital resilience.\n\"We all came here chasing a quick win,\" admits one long-time community member. \"But when the hype settled and the official channels went quiet, the people who were left realized we actually shared a vision. We stopped looking at the chart and started looking at the chat. That\u2019s when the real project started.\"\nFrom Bagholders to Builders\nWith the original developers remaining silent, the community has effectively seized the destiny of the project. This is not a formal DAO, neither is it a CTO, it is something pretty unique that has yet to get its own three letters title, NAP?\n- Grassroots Marketing: The community successfully crowdfunded its own PR campaign to reignite momentum\u2014a rarity for a project operating without official dev backing.\n- Self-Made Ecosystem: Community developers and creatives have built their own onboarding tools, including a dedicated LinkTree and the \"Slothonomics\" educational hub, designed to guide newcomers through the ecosystem.\n- The \"Slow\" Philosophy: In a market obsessed with speed, $SLOTH holders have embraced their mascot\u2019s nature. The \"Slow and Steady\" mantra has transformed from a meme into a legitimate investment thesis, creating a psychological safe harbor for investors tired of the high-stress, 24/7 anxiety of the crypto market.\nThe Verdict\nSlothana represents a paradox in the current market landscape. It is a memecoin with no promised tech roadmap, yet it possesses the one asset every billion-dollar project is desperate to buy but cannot manufacture: unshakeable loyalty.\nFor investors, $SLOTH is no longer just a bet on a token; it is a bet on a community that has proven it cannot be shaken by market volatility. In a world of fleeting trends, the Slothana community is proving that the strongest utility in crypto isn't code\u2014it's culture.\nWebsite: www.slothana.com\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

In this article, we\u2019ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question \u201cHow high can SOL go in 2026 and beyond?\u201d and we\u2019ll try to answer that.\nOverview\nSolana price prediction: Technical analysis\nSolana price analysis: SOL recovers to $120\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- Solana price analysis shows slight recovery as price returns to $124\n- The altcoin gained 1.9% of its value across last 24-hours.\n- Support for SOL/USD is at $125.\nAs of January 26, the Solana price analysis reveals slight recovery as the price returns to $124 after a brief dip below the $120.\nSolana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls below $120\nThe one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline has continued into 2026 with the price falling below the $130 mark this week. Moreover, after failing to climb past $128 the price was headed down below $120 but finds support at the $118 level that has enabled recovery back to the $124 level where it faces resistance.\nThe distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is widening, leading to increased volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $150.59. The indicator\u2019s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $119.49.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the neutral area and trades close to the mean level. The indicator\u2019s value has increased to index 39.91, and its upward curve suggests a bullish support forming at the level. If buying activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected.\nSOL/USD 4-hour price chart\nThe four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows steady bearish activity as the price crashes below the $130 mark. The altcoin\u2019s price declined to $118 but quickly rose to the current $124.\nThe Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $131.11, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $119.20, indicating support.\nThe RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 41.87, the RSI curve is pointing higher, suggesting bearish market sentiment at the level. The level of the index suggests room for further movement in either direction across the short-term. We can expect further increase if buying activities persist for a few consecutive candles.\nSolana technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat "

This project brings Solana\u2019s high speeds, low costs, and smart contracts support to the Bitcoin blockchain.\nSince the presale kicked off, it has raised $30 million to launch the scaling solution, setting the stage for a successful launch.\nBitcoin Hyper Presale Is Bringing Solana Speeds to the Bitcoin Blockchain\nBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a red-hot crypto presale bringing Solana\u2019s powerful tech to Bitcoin.\nThis unlocks a new era of speed, scalability, and passive income potential for BTC holders.\nFor the first time, Bitcoin users will be able to do more than just HODL.\nWith Bitcoin Hyper, they\u2019ll be able to earn yield, stake, lend, and trade assets using fast and efficient smart contracts.\nAll of this happens without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nBy combining Solana\u2019s low-cost infrastructure with Bitcoin\u2019s massive network, Bitcoin Hyper makes it possible to launch Bitcoin-native DeFi apps, NFT platforms, and advanced payment solutions.\nAt the center of it all is the $HYPER token.\nMore than $30 million has already been raised, and investor interest continues to grow.\nDemand for the token is expected to rise as the Hyper L2 gains traction, giving early backers a major advantage.\nTo buy $HYPER before the presale ends, head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect a compatible wallet like Best Wallet.\nYou can swap USDT, USDC, or ETH, or use a bank card to purchase tokens quickly and easily.\nVisit the Official Bitcoin Hyper Website Here- XRP Price Prediction: XRP Is Crashing Fast \u2013 Is This the Beginning of a Total Breakdown to Zero?\n- XRP Price Prediction: $1.88 Triple-Bottom Support as ETF Money Pulls Back \u2013 What\u2019s Next?\n- New ChatGPT Predicts the Price of XRP, Bitcoin and Dogecoin By the End of 2026\n- Ethereum Price Prediction: $3,000 Rejected, But On-Chain Data Tells Another Story\n- Bitcoin Price Prediction: Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Kiyosaki Ignores Pr"

                "body": "US stock futures were mixed in early trading on Tuesday, January 27, as markets considered upcoming earnings, the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision, and tariff headlines.\nSeveral of the Magnificent Seven, including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA), are on the earnings calendar this week. Optimism about strong earnings boosted buying interest in tech stocks.\nMeanwhile, fresh tariff threats and uncertainty ahead of the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision and press conference bolstered demand for safe-haven assets. Gold climbed 1.35% to $5,077 in early trading.\nDespite the mixed morning, expectations of a Fed rate cut in H1 2026, a strong US economy, and sentiment toward upcoming earnings support a bullish medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.\nUS President Trump turned his attention to South Korea in the early hours of Tuesday, January 27, announcing:\n\u201cSouth Korea\u2019s legislature is not living up to its deal with the United States. President Lee and I reached a Great Deal for both countries on July 30, 2025, and we reaffirmed these terms while I was in Korea on October 29, 2025. Why hasn\u2019t the Korean legislature approved it? Because the Korean legislature hasn\u2019t enacted our historic trade agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean tariffs on autos, lumber, pharma, and all other reciprocal tariffs, from 15% to 25%.\u201d\nThe latest tariff announcement followed Trump\u2019s recent threats of tariffs against eight European NATO members and Canada. These threats underscored the ever-present risk of an escalation in geopolitical tensions.\nDespite gold\u2019s rise, the latest tariff threat failed to spook the Asian markets. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI rallied 1.99% in morning trading.\nWhile trade developments are key, upbeat Chinese economic indicators lifted sentiment. Industrial profits increased 5.3% year-on-year in December after falling 1% in November, signaling a shift in the supply-demand backdrop. Rising profits could lead to job creation and increased domestic demand, supporting a positive global economic outlook.\nThe Hang Seng Index joined the broader Asian markets in positive territory, advancing 1.15% to 27,074.\nWhile Chinese economic indicators lifted sentiment, the stronger yen and elevated 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields were headwinds. This week, USD/JPY plunged from 155.344 to a low of 153.302 before reclaiming 154. The sharp fall in USD/JPY fueled speculation about an unwind of yen carry trades into US assets, as seen in mid-2024.\nMarket concerns about Japan\u2019s 240% debt-to-GDP ratio and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s fiscal spending plans increased the risk premium for holding JGBs. 10-year JGB yields have climbed to their highest level in decades, weakening the yen.\nHowever, intervention warnings from the Japanese government and the Fed sent USD/JPY below 155, a key support level. This morning, USD/JPY steadied, climbing 0.13% to 154.337, easing market jitters.\nUS futures saw mixed performances in the Asian morning session on January 27. The Dow Jones E-mini dropped 90 points, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini climbed 112 points and 13 points, respectively. Market optimism toward the Mag-7\u2019s upcoming earnings sent the Nasdaq and S&P 500 higher.\nLater Tuesday, US consumer confidence data and corporate earnings will influence buying interest in US stock futures. Economists expect the CB Consumer Confidence Index to rise from 89.1 in December to 90.9 in January. Typically, rising confidence indicates a pickup in consumer spending, bolstering the US economy. For context, private consumption accounts for around 65% of US GDP.\nHowever, corporate earnings will be key to the near-term trends for US index futures. On January 27, United Health Group (UNH), Boeing (BA), General Motors Company (GM), Texas Instruments (TXN), and American Airlines (AAL) are "

Silver futures jumped 6.5% to roughly $108 an ounce after earlier hitting a new record high of above $117 an ounce.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of global currencies, was 0.6% lower at 97.03. The greenback slid further against the yen after Japanese and U.S. officials signaled they were prepared to intervene to stop a slide in the Asian currency.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury\u2014which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans including mortgages\u2014slipped below 4.22% from Friday's close above 4.23%. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $87,600, up from overnight lows around $86,000. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, was 0.4% lower at $60.80 a barrel.\nIn corporate news, Intel (INTC) shares finished down 5.7% to lead Nasdaq decliners. The stock had plummeted 17% Friday after the chipmaker issued a soft outlook and executives warned that supplies could hit a low in the current quarter.\nTesla (TSLA) stock fell 3% ahead of its quarterly results Wednesday. Apple (AAPL) shares rose 3% ahead of its earnings report Thursday.\nCoreWeave (CRWV) stock surged 6.3% on an expanded partnership with AI darling Nvidia (NVDA). The world's most valuable public company invested $2 billion in CoreWeave stock, reflecting its \"confidence in CoreWeave's business, team and growth strategy as a cloud platform built on NVIDIA infrastructure,\" it said. Nvidia shares ended down 0.6%.\nShares of major U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) were modestly lower after a massive storm across much of the country forced the carriers to cancel more than 20,000 flights over the weekend and Monday. JetBlue Airways (JBLU), which has a large presence in hard-hit New York and Boston, finished down nearly 4%.\nUSA Rare Earth (USAR) stock advanced almost 8% after it struck a deal with the U.S. government. The company will receive $1.6 billion in federal funding in exchange for issuing the Commerce Department 16.1 million shares of stock and about 17.6 million warrants. In addition, USA Rare Earth raised $1.5 billion in private sector investment via a PIPE transaction.\nHow Much Traders Expect Tesla to Move After Earnings\nTesla is set to report its latest financial results after the market closes on Wednesday, with traders anticipating a sizable move from the electric vehicle maker's stock following the results.\nOptions pricing suggests traders expect Tesla's (TSLA) stock could move about 5% in either direction by the end of the week. A shift of that size from Monday's close around $435 could push the stock back up to $459, about 6% off December's record, or drag it down to $412.\nDuring the company's earnings call, investors will likely be listening closely to hear what CEO Elon Musk has to say about Tesla's developments in self-driving cars and robotics, which the CEO has previously sug"

Trump has hinted he could name his choice of replacement for Powell as soon as this week, with BlackRock's (BLK) Rick Rieder tapped as the favourite.\nStocks shook off anxiety at the increasing likelihood of a government shutdown and new tariff threats by president Donald Trump.\nOver the weekend, Senate Democrats vowed to oppose a funding package that includes financing for the Department of Homeland Security. This followed the fatal shooting by ICE agents of a man named Alex Pretti in Minnesota.\nDemocrats warned that they will not vote for a $1.2tn package to fund federal government operations due to how immigration enforcement is playing out.\nTrump, meanwhile, levied fresh threats of a 100% tariff on Canadian imports as its prime minister Mark Carney said on Sunday his country had no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China, which had been a cause of contention for Trump.\nInvestors moved their attention to precious metals and haven assets in response to yet more uncertainty for one of the world's largest economies.

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is locked in a classic late?cycle mood: German blue chips are holding up in a resilient, choppy uptrend, but every push higher feels nervous, crowded and fragile. Instead of a clean melt?up, we are seeing a grinding, stop?hunt style market \u2013 red dips get bought aggressively, but follow?through on the upside keeps stalling as soon as traders try to chase the move. Think less rocket to the moon, more anxious staircase higher with sudden air?pockets.\nPrice action is telling a clear story: German bulls are not dead at all \u2013 they keep defending the uptrend on every meaningful pullback \u2013 but bears are circling, waiting for any macro shock from the ECB, the euro, or weak industrial data to trigger a sharp flush. This is pure risk?on versus macro reality, and the tension is building.\nThe Story: What is actually driving this DAX mood right now?\n1. ECB & Rates \u2013 The Heartbeat of the DAX\nThe European Central Bank remains the central character of this drama. After that brutal rate hiking cycle, the ECB has slid into a more cautious, data?dependent stance. Inflation in the eurozone has cooled from its extremes, but it is not comfortably low. That leaves traders in permanent speculation mode:\n- Will the ECB start cutting more aggressively to support growth?\n- Or stay tighter for longer to avoid a second inflation wave?\nFor the DAX 40, this is huge. German exporters, industrials and automakers are extremely sensitive to financing costs and global demand. When the market thinks cuts are coming sooner, DAX sentiment flips risk?on, with traders rotating into cyclicals, autos and industrials. When hawkish comments or hot inflation data hit the tape, we see fast, algorithm?driven selling and profit taking.\n2. German Economy \u2013 Recession Fears vs. Industrial Muscle\nThe macro backdrop in Germany is still mixed. Manufacturing surveys have been wobbling between weak and slightly less weak. Order books are not empty, but they are nowhere near a boom. Energy in Europe is more stable than during the 2022 panic, yet prices are still structurally higher than pre?crisis, squeezing margins in heavy industry and chemicals.\nMarkets know this. That is why every slightly better?than?feared German PMI or industrial production release can spark a relief rally in the DAX \u2013 it tells traders that recession risks are already heavily priced in. But when numbers disappoint, the narrative flips back to \u201cGermany \u2013 the sick man of Europe 2.0\u201d, and the index trades like a risk?asset, not a safe haven.\n3. Euro vs. Dollar \u2013 The FX Undercurrent\nDo not underestimate the euro. A stronger EUR versus USD is usually a headwind for big DAX exporters (think autos, machinery, chemicals) because their products become more expensive in dollar?based markets. A weaker euro, on the other hand, acts like a hidden stimulus for German corporates, juicing overseas revenues when translated back into euros.\nRight now the euro is stuck in a broad, indecisive range against the dollar. That means no clear turbo boost for exporters, but also no pure FX disaster. However, if the Fed moves faster on cuts than the ECB, the euro could strengthen and quietly eat into export competitiveness \u2013 something equity traders will price into DAX valuations quickly. Flip it around: if the ECB blinks first and cuts harder, the euro could soften, and suddenly the export story becomes the bulls\u2019 favorite narrative again.\n4. Sector Stories \u2013 Autos, Tech, Industrials\n- Autos (VW, BMW, Mercedes?Benz): The German auto complex is in a structural battle. EV competition from the US and China is intense"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is currently locked in a tense, emotional zone \u2013 think grinding consolidation, frustrated breakouts, and sudden intraday reversals. Instead of a clean, explosive trend, traders are watching a choppy battlefield where German blue chips are tugged between global tech optimism and lingering European recession fears. Bulls are trying to defend the uptrend, bears are using every macro headline to push for a deeper correction, and volatility keeps spiking around key events.\nThis is classic late-cycle behavior: powerful rallies are followed by sharp pullbacks, then sideways chop as institutions rebalance, hedge funds fade extremes, and retail traders chase the wrong candles. German giants in autos, industrials, and financials react aggressively to any hint about European growth, energy costs, and the next ECB move.\nThe Story: What is actually driving this DAX mood swing right now?\n1. ECB policy: higher for longer vs. growth reality\nThe European Central Bank remains the dominant macro driver. Markets have shifted from obsessing over rate hikes to debating how long rates will stay elevated. Rate-cut fantasies have been pushed out as inflation in the euro area remains sticky in some segments, even while growth indicators cool down.\nThis \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d narrative is a double-edged sword for the DAX. On one side, it pressures valuation multiples, especially in rate-sensitive sectors like real estate, utilities, and some growth names. On the other side, the fact that the ECB is not in full panic mode signals that systemic risk is still contained. Traders are pricing in a scenario where inflation normalizes slowly while the eurozone avoids a full-blown meltdown. That supports banks and some cyclicals, but caps how aggressively the index can rip higher.\n2. German industrial data: fragile but not collapsing\nGermany\u2019s industrial engine has been sputtering, but not completely stalling. Recent manufacturing and factory order numbers paint a picture of a struggling but stabilizing environment: weak export demand, especially from China, tension in supply chains, and cautious corporate investment. Yet, the data is not screaming total disaster. It\u2019s more like a grinding slowdown rather than a spectacular crash.\nFor the DAX, this translates into a tug-of-war inside the index:\n- Export-heavy industrials and machinery names feel the pressure from weaker global demand and a still-sensitive energy landscape.\n- Some defensive sectors and quality growth stories attract dip buyers who expect Germany to survive this slowdown and eventually benefit from any global recovery or rate-cut cycle.\n3. Energy prices and the German cost base\nEnergy remains a structural overhang for German equities. Even though the wild spikes seen during the peak of the energy crisis have eased, Europe \u2013 and especially Germany \u2013 still faces a higher cost base compared with many global competitors. That compresses margins for energy-intensive industries and keeps long-term investors cautious on some old-economy names.\nHowever, the absence of new energy shocks has reduced tail-risk panic. Markets are no longer trading every gas headline like the end of the world. Instead, investors are increasingly differentiating: strong balance sheets, pricing power, and diversified revenue streams are rewarded; high-debt, low-margin players remain under pressure.\n4. Euro vs. US dollar: FX as a stealth catalyst\nThe euro-dollar pair is quietly influencing the DAX mood. When the euro weakens against the dollar, it tends to support German exporters by making their goods more compe"

German blue chips are oscillating in a nervous range, flirting with important zones again and again without delivering a clean breakout or a decisive crash. For day traders, it is a playground.

It is a pure macro cocktail right now:\n1. ECB vs. Growth \u2013 the central bank overhang\nMarkets are still obsessed with the ECB. Traders are constantly repricing how many rate cuts they expect for the year, and that directly hits the DAX, especially financials and interest?sensitive sectors. When ECB communication sounds cautious on inflation, the mood cools: bank stocks wobble, rate?sensitive growth names lose steam, and the index leans towards a defensive stance. When the tone turns slightly more dovish, the market immediately tries to price in a friendlier liquidity environment and German bulls jump back in.\nThe core problem: the euro area is stuck between stubborn inflation pressures in services and fragile growth in industry. Germany, as the manufacturing heart of Europe, is caught right in the middle. If the ECB cuts too slowly, growth suffers. If it cuts too aggressively, inflation fears return and bond yields start misbehaving again. The DAX is the scoreboard for this entire dilemma.\n2. German industry: from superstar to under review\nThe old German model \u2013 cheap energy, strong exports, and a booming auto sector \u2013 is being stress tested. Energy prices, while off the extreme peaks, are still structurally higher and less predictable than they were in the pre?crisis era. That eats into margins for heavy industry and chemicals. Add weaker global demand and doubts about China\u2019s long?term growth path, and you get a DAX that has lost its automatic \u201cGerman efficiency\u201d premium.\nManufacturing data continues to send mixed signals: periods of slight stabilization are frequently followed by renewed softness. Whenever purchasing managers\u2019 indices or factory orders miss expectations, the DAX reacts with quick waves of selling, particularly in cyclical segments. The index feels like it is constantly testing whether the German economy is just in a temporary soft patch or at the beginning of a more structural downshift.\n3. Euro vs. Dollar \u2013 the FX undertow\nThe EUR/USD relationship is another hidden driver. A stronger euro can hurt exporters in the short term but signals some confidence in the region. A weaker euro, often triggered by relatively tighter policy or stronger data out of the US, can support export revenues for DAX giants but also sends a message that investors prefer US assets. This back-and-forth in FX is feeding into foreign flows: global funds are constantly deciding whether to overweight Wall Street megacaps or rotate selectively into European value and industrial plays.\nAs long as the euro trades in a choppy band, the DAX is likely to remain a rotational market: fast money comes in on dips, then bails out on every spike of uncertainty.\n4. Sector rotation: from autos to tech-lite and back\nWithin the index, we see a fascinating internal battle. The classic German story \u2013 autos, industrials, and chemicals \u2013 is colliding"

S&P 500 futures (ES=F) hovered just below the flatline, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) inched up 0.1%.\nDuring Monday\u2019s regular session, stocks moved higher to start the week, supported by gains in major technology names. Shares of Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) advanced ahead of their earnings reports later this week.\nEarnings season ramps up significantly in the days ahead, with more than 90 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. That slate includes several members of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven,\" with Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) set to release results on Wednesday, followed by Apple on Thursday.\nInvestors are also bracing for the Federal Reserve\u2019s first policy decision of the year. While the Fed is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady in a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, traders will be watching closely for signals on the timing of future rate cuts.\nMeanwhile, investors are grappling with new risks from Washington. President Trump said late Monday that tariffs on South Korean products \u2014 including autos, pharmaceuticals, and lumber \u2014 would be raised to 25% from 15%. Trump cited delays in South Korea\u2019s legislature approving a trade agreement reached with the US last summer.\nA government shutdown is also looming as Senate Democrats are attempting to block a bill funding the Department of Homeland Security following federal agents killing Alex Pretti, an American citizen, in Minneapolis.\nOn the economic calendar, Tuesday brings updated readings on consumer confidence and home prices. Corporate earnings due Tuesday include results from General Motors (GM), American Airlines (AAL) and Boeing (BA).

Metro\u2019s board of directors unanimously approved an underground heavy-rail option of the multibillion-dollar Sepulveda Transit Corridor project, which offers an alternative to the increasingly crowded 405 Freeway.\nThe option, which was pushed forward by Metro\u2019s planning and programming committee last week, would go from Van Nuys to Sherman Oaks, pass under the mountains and Bel-Air, stop at UCLA and ultimately end at the E Line\u2019s Expo/Sepulveda Station.\nAlthough it is considered one of the most significant transit projects in the country, billions of dollars have yet to be secured, and questions remain about its timeline.\nSupport for the project\nDespite the project being the subject of multiple Metro community meetings and eliciting thousands of remarks for and against various proposals, public comment was overwhelmingly supportive when Metro\u2019s board approved the plan last week.\nThe busy corridor and solutions to improve it have been under discussion for decades, The Times\u2019 Colleen Shalby wrote. Ethan Elkind, a rail expert and director of the climate program at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment at UC Berkeley, told her that a variety of political and logistical factors have slowed the project\u2019s progress: a focus on downtown transit, opposition to high-capacity transit in the San Fernando Valley and geological challenges in the Sepulveda Pass.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of land,\u201d Elkind said. \u201cAnd the more land you have to go through, the more expensive it is, the more logistically challenging it is.\u201d\nBut L.A. County leaders have been supportive of the project.\nLindsey Horvath, L.A. County supervisor and Metro board member, said the project would be a historic development for the Los Angeles region, affecting drivers who commute through the Sepulveda Pass along the 405.\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Nithya Raman said that construction for the project would create hundreds of thousands of jobs and that revenue from ridership would help local businesses.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to accept sitting in traffic as our only choice,\u201d she said, \u201cand this is our pathway forward.\u201d\nConcerns over funding\nThe Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., which has been a vocal critic of some of the project\u2019s routes, ultimately supported the current recommendation.\nThe association\u2019s vice president has expressed concerns over funding of the project, however.\n\u201cWe still have not heard from Metro how they\u2019re going to pay for this thing,\u201d Bob Anderson told The Times. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to know every financial detail, but we do need to know where they\u2019re going to get the funding stream that feeds it and how much the financing is going to cost us.\u201d\nThe estimated cost of the project has ballooned since 2016, when Los Angeles County voters approved transit improvements between the Valley and the Westside under Measure M.\nThe project was slated as $6 billion, then grew to an estimated $9.4 billion to $13.8 billion with a completion goal of 2033. Metro does not have an estimate for the current modified proposal.\nThe transit agency cited the need for reliance on state, local and federal funding to fill the shortfall and has raised the idea of private-public partnerships \u2014 similar to proposals for the state\u2019s underfunded high-speed rail project.\nBut it did not have a specific plan for how that money would be obtained or how it would affect the project\u2019s schedule.\nToday\u2019s top stories\nIs California\u2019s proposed billionaire tax smart policy?\n- California\u2019s proposed billionaire tax would impose a one-time 5% levy on residents whose worth is north of $1 billion.\n- Critics cite failed European wealth taxes as cautionary tales, while the measure\u2019s archite"

                "body": "^N225 Today January 27: Yen Spike Pressures Nikkei After 1.8% Drop\nNikkei 225 today slipped 1.8% as a fast yen surge hit shares of Japanese exporters and stirred talk of BoJ intervention risk. The move comes ahead of the Fed decision and major U.S. earnings, keeping FX and policy in focus for Tokyo. The ^N225 remains up year to date, but near-term direction hinges on currency swings and global guidance. We outline the catalysts, the technical picture, and practical steps for investors in Japan.\nYen Spike Pressures Exporters and Sentiment\nA rapid yen rebound squeezed auto, tech, and machinery names that benefit from a weaker currency. When the yen climbs, revenue translated from overseas falls in yen terms, and margin outlooks tighten. That dynamic drove broad declines in index heavyweights, pulling risk appetite lower in Tokyo. The shift in FX also tightened financial conditions, keeping traders cautious about Nikkei 225 today and the week\u2019s calendar.\nStronger yen rekindled chatter about a potential Ministry of Finance action via the BoJ if moves become disorderly. At the same time, Japanese government bond yields eased as investors sought safety, a setup that often pressures equities. Reports highlighted these cross-currents, with yen strength lifting JGBs while stocks fell, according to WSJ and Yahoo Finance.\nTechnical Picture: Key Levels and Signals\nEven after today\u2019s drop, the index trades above its 50-day average near 50,898 and well over the 200-day around 43,540, keeping the broader uptrend intact. Average true range near 761 points signals active day-to-day swings. With a recent year high at 54,487, bulls will watch whether buyers defend higher lows. That context frames risk around Nikkei 225 today in the sessions ahead.\nRSI near 59 shows momentum cooled from hot conditions, while ADX around 16 indicates no strong trend. Price sits near the upper Bollinger area, with the middle band near 50,586. A deeper retrace toward that band would be normal after a quick rise. Traders may fade extremes but wait for confirmation, especially with currency-led volatility shaping Nikkei 225 today.\nGlobal Cues: Fed, Dollar, and U.S. Earnings\nThe Fed\u2019s message on inflation and cuts can sway the dollar and, in turn, the yen. A softer dollar often boosts the yen, which can weigh on Japanese exporters. Stronger U.S. data can flip that script. We expect FX-led swings to dominate tape action around Nikkei 225 today, so investors should monitor policy tone and rate path expectations closely this week.\nU.S. tech earnings drive global risk sentiment and chip supply chains tied to Japan. Guidance on AI spending, cloud capex, and consumer demand can ripple into local chip equipment, electronics, and auto suppliers. A beat-and-raise backdrop may cushion dips, while cautious outlooks could amplify FX pressure. These external cues add another layer of direction for Nikkei 225 today.\nStrategy: Positioning for Japan-Focused Portfolios\nWe prefer balanced exposure between exporters and domestic demand names when yen volatility spikes. Consider currency-hedged vehicles if keeping global allocations, or use simple hedges to reduce FX drag. For stock pickers, look for firms with natural hedges and pricing power. Keep position sizes disciplined while spreads widen. This approach helps navigate Nikkei 225 today without taking binary FX bets.\nKey catalysts include Tokyo earnings updates, any BoJ or MoF language on FX moves, and U.S. macro prints. Liquidity around the cash open and pre-close can magnify swings, so use limit orders. If the index re-tests the 50-day area, watch breadth and volume for clues. Staying data-led can improve entries and exits as Nikkei 225 today finds its footing.\nFinal Thoughts\nA sharp yen rebound knocked the index 1.8% lower, pressuring Japanese exporters and reviving intervention talk. The broader uptrend remains intact above the 50-day and 200-day averages, but near-term direction hinges on FX swings and upcoming policy and earning"
