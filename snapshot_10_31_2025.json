                "body": "Gold Price Consolidates Just Under US$4,000 as Fed Cuts Rates\nThe Fed made a 25 basis point cut to its benchmark interest rate amid rising inflation, slowing jobs growth and tariff impacts.\nThe US Federal Reserve held its seventh meeting of 2025 from Tuesday (October 28) to Wednesday (October 29) amid growing division between doves and hawks as job market growth slows and inflation concerns rise.\nThe central bank met analysts\u2019 expectations by lowering the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to the 3.75 to 4 percent range. It marks the second time this year that the Fed has cut interest rates.\nInterest rates haven\u2019t been below 4 percent since September 2022.\nThe Federal Reserve Board of Governors was reportedly split between those concerned with preventing a further slowdown in the US labor market and those fearing the fight against inflation is far from over.\nLowering rates in turn lowers the cost of borrowing, which can provide businesses with more runway to grow their workforce. However, increasing available money supply by easing access to borrowing can also increase inflation.\nSeptember consumer price index data shows inflation rose to 3 percent for the 12 months ending in September after rising 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Despite this higher inflationary environment, a weakening labor market has become the focus of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.\nThe ongoing US government shutdown has delayed the release of key economic data, including the September US jobs report, which was originally slated for publication on October 3.\nUntil the government funding legislation is passed, all economic reports are on hold and the Fed is essentially flying blind when it comes to planning the best course of action for the country\u2019s economy.\nFilling in the gaps, CNN said financial data firm FactSet reported that the US added 50,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.3 percent. While economists expect a pickup in jobs this time of year when the summer ends; however, compared to last year\u2019s 240,000 jobs, this September\u2019s gains are significantly weaker.\n\u201cAlthough official employment data for September are delayed, available evidence suggests that both layoffs and hiring remain low, and that both households\u2019 perceptions of job availability and firms\u2019 perceptions of hiring difficulty continue to decline in this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market,\u201d said Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\u201cThe downside risks to employment appear to have risen in recent months.\u201d\nAt the same time as its interest rate decision, the Fed announced a stop to its quantitative tightening activities as of December 1, 2025. For the past three years, the independent government agency has been working to reduce its balance sheet from US$9 trillion in 2022 to US$6.6 trillion today.\nThe move comes after recent stress signals in the short-term lending markets.\nThe next Fed interest rate decision will come on December 10, the last Fed meeting for 2025. In his speech to reporters, Powell strongly suggested another rate cut this year is not necessarily a given.\n\u201cIn the committee\u2019s discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,\u201d he said. \u201cA further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\u201d\nBy the end of the year, US President Donald Trump intends to announce a replacement for Powell, whose term expires in May 2026. Trump criticized the Fed and Powell in particular, saying they haven't lowered rates quickly enough.\nOn Monday (October 27), US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent announced a shortlist of candidates to replace Powell, including Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder.\nThe gold price rebounded nearly 2 percent to reach US$4,031.10 per ounce in the lea"

                "body": "Gold Price Forecast: XAU/USD grinds north of $4,000 despite broad US Dollar strength\nXAU/USD Current price: $4,002.60\n- The US Dollar stands strong across the FX board following major central banks\u2019 decisions.\n- The United States government shutdown continues with no resolution in sight.\n- XAU/USD showing some tepid bullish signs, not yet out of the woods.\nSpot Gold managed to recover some ground on Thursday, trading around the $4,000 mark at the time of writing. The advance was limited, however, by broad demand for the US Dollar (USD). Following the Federal Reserve (Fed) hawkish interest rate cut on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) decided to leave rates unchanged as widely anticipated. However, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered some dovish remarks that sent the Japanese Yen sharply lower, while providing additional impetus to the USD.\nThe Greenback also benefited from headlines indicating that the United States (US) and China reached a trade deal, de-escalating recent tensions. US President Donald Trump met Chinese leader Xi Jinping and agreed on rolling back some of their recent punitive actions. Trump announced it would immediately reduce fentanyl-related tariffs to 10%, and that China will resume buying soybean and agricultural products. Trump also mentioned they reached an agreement on chips and rate earths, although without much detail.\nOther than that, the European Central Bank (ECB) also announced its monetary policy decision, leaving interest rates unchanged, as widely anticipated. President Christine Lagarde repeated that the central bank is in a good place and showed no urge to modify the monetary policy.\nFinally, it is worth remembering that the US government remains on pause, amid the lack of funding. The US Senate seems in no rush to agree on a bill, which is costing the well-being of thousands of federal employees.\nXAU/USD short-term technical outlook\nTechnical Analysis:\nIn the 4-hour chart, XAU/USD is currently trading at around $4,002, holding on to solid intraday gains. A bearish 20 SMA slides south at $3,973, sitting just above the 200 SMA, and both are below the current level, providing support. The 100 SMA at $4,109 is marginally easing and acts as immediate resistance. At the same time, the Momentum indicator stands just above its 100 line, suggesting the bearish impulse is losing traction. As for the RSI, it remains flat around 49, reflecting the absence of directional strength despite the intraday bounce. A decisive clearance of the 100 SMA resistance at $4,109 would unlock additional upside, whereas failure to top that level keeps risks skewed toward a pullback to the 20 SMA support at $3,973 ahead of $3,956.\nIn the daily chart, a bullish 20 SMA rallies above the longer ones, suggesting buyers still hold the broader grip; the 20 SMA stands at $4,080 and now acts as immediate resistance. The 100 SMA is also bullish, advancing to $3,578, while the 200 SMA rises to $3,340, both of which underpin the long-term bullish bias. Finally, the Momentum indicator has managed to bounce from its recent lows, but remains within negative levels, while the RSI indicator has recovered to 51edging back toward neutrality; the uptick hints at tentative buying interest.\n(This content was partially created with the help of an AI tool)\nPremium\nYou have reached your limit of 3 free articles for this month.\nStart your subscription and get access to all our original articles.\nAuthor\nValeria Bednarik\nFXStreet\nValeria Bednarik was born and lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In 2024, consumption was approximately 4 million tons, led by Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, which together accounted for 61% of regional consumption. Production in the region reached 4.4 million tons, with Turkey being the dominant producer, responsible for 40% of the total output. The trade landscape is characterized by Turkey's overwhelming dominance in exports (93% share) and a complex import network led by Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. Key trends include steady per capita consumption growth in countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel, and fluctuating but generally stable import and export prices.\nKey Findings\n- Market is projected to reach 4.6M tons in volume and $7.7B in value by 2035\n- Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia are the largest consumers, constituting 61% of the market\n- Turkey is the dominant producer and exporter, accounting for 40% of production and 93% of exports\n- Regional production of 4.4M tons outpaces consumption, making the Middle East a net exporter\n- Import prices saw a moderate increase to $1,607 per ton while export prices declined to $1,278 per ton\nMarket Forecast\nDriven by increasing demand for refined sunflower-seed or safflower oil in the Middle East, the market is expected to continue an upward consumption trend over the next decade. Market performance is forecast to retain its current trend pattern, expanding with an anticipated CAGR of +1.3% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market volume to 4.6M tons by the end of 2035.\nIn value terms, the market is forecast to increase with an anticipated CAGR of +3.0% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market value to $7.7B (in nominal wholesale prices) by the end of 2035.\nConsumption\nMiddle East's Consumption of Refined Sunflower-Seed Or Safflower Oil\nIn 2024, the amount of refined sunflower-seed or safflower oil consumed in the Middle East reached 4M tons, approximately mirroring the previous year's figure. The total consumption volume increased at an average annual rate of +1.6% over the period from 2013 to 2024; the trend pattern remained consistent, with somewhat noticeable fluctuations being observed throughout the analyzed period. The pace of growth appeared the most rapid in 2017 when the consumption volume increased by 7.8%. The volume of consumption peaked at 4.2M tons in 2022; however, from 2023 to 2024, consumption stood at a somewhat lower figure.\nThe size of the market for refined sunflower-seed or safflower oil in the Middle East declined to $5.5B in 2024, approximately mirroring the previous year. This figure reflects the total revenues of producers and importers (excluding logistics costs, retail marketing costs, and retailers' margins, which will be included in the final consumer price). Overall, consumption showed a relatively flat trend pattern. As a result, consumption attained the peak level of $17.7B. From 2021 to 2024, the growth of the market failed to regain momentum.\nConsumption By Country\nThe countries with the highest volumes of consumption in 2024 were Turkey (949K tons), Iran (801K tons) and Saudi Arabia (675K tons), together accounting for 61% of total consumption.\nFrom 2013 to 2024, the most notable rate of growth in terms of consumption, amongst the main consuming countries, was attained by Saudi Arab"

Oil prices climbed too, with West Texas Intermediate up 0.7% to $60.55 a barrel and Brent crude rising 0.9% to $64.96. The momentum came after US commercial crude supplies dropped by 6.9 million barrels \u2013 a much bigger decline than analysts expected, according to Bloomberg. Oil services shares were the standouts, with ProPetro surging 46% after upbeat results and National Energy Services Reunited rising 14% on news of a multibillion-dollar contract with Saudi Aramco. Oil refiners like Valero and Phillips 66 also gained ground, helped by positive management updates and earnings beats.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Energy momentum is back in the spotlight.\nA sharper-than-expected slide in crude inventories sent energy stocks higher, as shrinking supplies tend to bolster oil prices and attract investor interest. Companies like Phillips 66 and Valero benefited from upbeat results and leadership changes, while oil services firms saw even bigger moves: National Energy\u2019s Aramco contract sent shares up 14%, and ProPetro jumped 46% on strong earnings. These rapid swings highlight how supply data and operational updates can quickly reshape sentiment across the industry.\nThe bigger picture: Supply shifts set the tone for global energy.\nThis rally underscores how global oil markets hinge on US supply signals. With inventory data often surprising analysts, price swings remain a central theme for commodity investors. Even as energy stocks run hot, the subdued gain in utility companies hints that some investors are still leaning toward stability. With ongoing volatility in crude supplies, the sector's returns are likely to stay in the spotlight for anyone watching the broader resource markets.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

Some Indian refiners have paused purchases of Russian fuel following the US blacklisting of two major Russian producers last week. Earlier in the week, however, Indian Oil Corp said that the company is \"absolutely not going to discontinue\" its purchases of Russian crude.\nThe boss of TotalEnergies, meanwhile, said on Thursday he thinks that the oil market is underestimating the impact of the sanctions.\nTraders are keeping a close eye on next moves by India and China, top buyers of Moscow's supplies, for clues on impacts to global balances.\nUS President Donald Trump said China would buy more US energy as part of a wider trade truce but investors are still waiting to see signs that the purchases will materialize. China last imported US crude oil in May and liquefied natural gas in February, according to Customs data.\nOffering a ceiling to prices, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday tempered expectations for another December rate cut as Fed officials navigate a slowing labor market and above target inflation. That stoked worry that the second-largest crude importing economy won't get a boost from lower rates just as excess supplies are expected to hit the market.\n\"The quarter percentage point cut in interest rates was within expectations, however the Fed Chairman's comments are a near-term pressure point for crude,\" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial. WTI front-month futures will be met with technical support at the $58.18 level, he added.\nCrude remains on track for a third monthly decline, the longest losing run since the third quarter of last year.

The International Energy Agency has warned that the surplus in 2026 will be a record, though Saudi Aramco has struck a more positive tone. Oversupply in 2026 is a \"highly credible scenario,\" Shell Plc CEO Wael Sawan said in an earnings call Thursday.\nThe OPEC+ producers' group, meanwhile, will hold discussions on Sunday about output policy.

                "body": "EUR/USD defends 1.1550-40 support as USD consolidates post-FOMC gains, lacks follow-through\n- EUR/USD edges higher on Friday as the USD consolidates the post-FOMC gains.\n- The Fed\u2019s hawkish tilt could underpin the USD bulls and cap gains for the major.\n- ECB\u2019s on-hold decision and uncertain outlook warrant caution for the EUR bulls.\nThe EUR/USD pair attracts some dip-buyers during the Asian session on Friday and, for now, seems to have snapped a two-day losing streak back closer to the monthly low, around the 1.1550-1.1540 horizontal support. Spot prices, however, lack bullish conviction and currently trade around the 1.1575 region, up less than 0.10% for the day.\nThe US Dollar (USD) consolidates its strong gains registered over the past two days, to highest level since early August set on Thursday, and turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the EUR/USD pair. Any meaningful USD depreciation now seems elusive in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) hawkish tilt. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushed back against market expectations for another interest rate cut in December, which, along with reviving safe-haven demand, should help limit deeper USD losses.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB), on the other hand, held its key deposit facility rate steady at 2% for the third consecutive time on Thursday and said that inflation remains close to the 2% medium-term target. The ECB, however, warned that the Eurozone's economic outlook remains uncertain amid global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions. Moreover, policymakers are divided on future rate cuts, which, in turn, might hold back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the Euro (EUR) and cap the EUR/USD pair.\nHence, it will be prudent to wait for some follow-through buying before positioning for a further intraday move higher. On the other hand, a sustained break below the 1.1550-1.1540 strong horizontal support will be seen as a fresh trigger for bearish traders and pave the way for deeper losses. Nevertheless, the EUR/USD pair seems poised to register losses for the second consecutive week and remains at the mercy of the USD price dynamics. Hence, speeches from influential FOMC members should provide a fresh impetus later this Friday.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro.

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar Slides to 1.162 as Powell\u2019s Hawkish Fed and Weak Eurozone Data Sink the Euro\nThe euro fell 0.35% to 1.162 after the Fed cut rates to 4.00% but struck a hawkish tone. Flat German GDP, easing inflation, and DXY strength at 99.21 weighed on sentiment, with traders eyeing 1.1540 as critical support before next week\u2019s ECB and U.S. data | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD (Euro to U.S. Dollar) Tests 1.162 Support as Fed Cut, ECB Caution, and Trade Truce Reshape Outlook\nThe EUR/USD pair trades near 1.1620, down 0.35% intraday, as volatility spikes after the Federal Reserve\u2019s 25-basis-point rate cut and weak Eurozone data. The Fed lowered its benchmark range to 4.00%, but Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s warning that inflation progress \u201cis not yet guaranteed\u201d fueled a broad U.S. dollar rally, driving the Dollar Index (DXY) to 99.21, its highest since August. Meanwhile, the ECB\u2019s cautious tone and flat Eurozone GDP readings have left the euro vulnerable, with traders eyeing 1.1540\u20131.1560 as the next critical support zone.\nFed Cut Sparks Dollar Surge, Weighing on EUR/USD\nDespite the rate cut, Powell\u2019s comments signaled hesitation for future easing, crushing market optimism. Traders slashed December cut odds to 70% from 90%, reinforcing the dollar\u2019s strength. As a result, EUR/USD extended its decline below 1.1640, erasing early gains. The DXY gained nearly 0.6%, while U.S. Treasury yields steadied around 4.18%, maintaining upward pressure on the greenback. The hawkish tone shifted sentiment sharply, with risk assets pulling back and gold also losing its footing near $3,972.\nEurozone Data: Flat Growth and Soft Inflation Deepen Pressure\nEurope\u2019s macro picture offered no relief. Germany\u2019s GDP stagnated at 0.0%, narrowly avoiding contraction, while German CPI rose 0.2% and Spanish inflation eased to 2.9%. Combined with the ECB\u2019s deposit rate hold at 2.00%, this confirmed an economy struggling to regain momentum. ECB President Christine Lagarde warned that inflation risks persist but stressed that \u201cgrowth conditions remain fragile.\u201d The euro\u2019s limited yield advantage versus the dollar continues to suppress demand, pushing EUR/USD toward its lowest levels since early October.\nTechnical Breakdown: 1.1620 Key Pivot, 1.1540 Target in Focus\nTechnically, EUR/USD faces strong rejection near 1.1640, aligning with the 200-period EMA at 1.1642, which has capped all recent rebound attempts. The 50-period EMA at 1.1620 now serves as intraday resistance, while the RSI at 45 reflects fading buying momentum. A confirmed break below 1.1580 would expose 1.1545, the October low. The Fibonacci retracement at 0.236 (1.1628) is pivotal \u2014 a close beneath it could accelerate selling toward the 1.15 handle. Conversely, a recovery above 1.1659 may trigger short covering toward 1.1700\u20131.1770, matching the 0.618 retracement of the October downtrend.\nTrump\u2013Xi Trade Truce Offers Temporary Relief to Risk Sentiment\nThe Trump\u2013Xi meeting in South Korea briefly lifted global markets after the U.S. cut tariffs on Chinese imports from 57% to 47%, and China delayed export controls by a year. EUR/USD rebounded to 1.1635 before retracing as monetary divergence overshadowed trade optimism. The event eased geopolitical risk but failed to offset the macro headwinds dominating the euro\u2019s performance. Traders now await Eurozone Core CPI (2.3% forecast) and U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls as the next volatility triggers.\nDXY Momentum and Yield Advantage Keep Dollar in Control\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) trades around 99.13\u201399.21, above both the 50-day EMA (98.89) and 200-day EMA (98.71), signaling firm bullish control. The RSI near 59 reflects healthy demand without overbought pressure. A sustained move above 99.21 could open the path toward 99.47\u201399.78, reinforcing the bearish tilt in EUR/USD. With U.S. 10-year yields holding near 4.18%, dollar support remains structural rather than speculative.\nRead More\n-\nInvesco QQQ ETF Hits $633 as Tech Surge and Fed\u2019s Hawkish Cut Power"

There were two dissenters with Miran again calling for a 50 basis-point cut by Schmid backed no change in rates.\nThe Fed also announced that the bond-selling programme would be suspended from December 1st.\nFed Chair Powell stated that a December cut was not a foregone conclusion. He also noted that there was a wide range of views on the outlook for the next meeting.\nING commented; The Fed has cut rates again, but given tensions between its inflation goal, which remains above target, and its employment goal, it has warned that a December rate cut is not guaranteed. We still think they will end up lowering rates further.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) currency strategist Carol Kong noted the high degree of uncertainty. \"Clearly, the FOMC is divided on the policy outlook from here and with the government in shutdown still, I think Powell wants to approach policy more cautiously\"\nShe added; \"We still expect a cut in December, but obviously with Powell's cautious comments, the risk is that a rate cut is delayed to 2026.\"\nThere has also been a shift in Bank of England expectations following recent data and expectations of tax hikes.\nTraders are now pricing in around a 40% chance of a cut next week, but expectations could shift further if momentum gathers pace.\nGoldman Sachs, for example, has changed its BoE forecast and now expects the central bank will cut interest rates at next week\u2019s meeting.\nIn this context, it expects further Pound vulnerability; \"We think that dynamic can continue for sterling, where softer data and a reassessment of Bank of England easing can drive underperformance on European crosses.\nLike this piece?

Join live on Monday\u2019s at 8:30am EST.\nBritish Pound Price Chart \u2013 GBP/USD Weekly\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; GBP/USD on TradingView\nTechnical Outlook: In my last British Pound Weekly Forecast we noted that GBP/USD was testing, \u201cconfluent uptrend support at the median-line and the immediate focus is on a breakout of the October opening-range for guidance. From a trading standpoint, rallies should be limited to 1.3544 IF price is heading for a break lower on this stretch with a close below 1.3267 needed to fuel the next leg of the decline.\u201d Price briefly registered an intraday high at 1.3471 in the following days before reversing sharply lower with Sterling plunging through confluent support yesterday on the heels of the Fed. The decline has extended more than 3% off the October high with price now testing a key pivot zone into the monthly close- risk for inflection off this mark in the days ahead.\nInitial weekly support rests at 1.3140/43- a region defined by the May and July lows, the 2023 swing high, and the 38.2% retracement of the yearly range. Confluent support sits just lower at the 100% extension of the June decline and the 52-week moving average at 1.3080/88. Look for a larger reaction there IF reached with a break / weekly close below exposing the 50% retracement at 1.2944. Note that the 25% parallel converges on this threshold early next month, making it an area of interest for potential downside exhaustion / price inflection.\nWeekly resistance stands back at the July low-week close (LWC) at 1.3280 and is backed closely by the median-line. Broader bearish invalidation is now lowered to the 2024 swing high / September high-week close (HWC) at 1.3434/69- strength beyond this threshold would be needed to suggest a more significant low is in place / threaten resumption of the broader uptrend. Subsequent resistance objectives eyed at the yearly HWC at 1.3648.\nBottom line: Sterling broke below the October opening-range lows yesterday and while the decline does threaten a deeper pullback, the immediate focus is on a reaction off this support pivot into the monthly cross. From a trading standpoint, a good zone to reduce portions of short-exposure / lower protective stops- rallies should be limited to the median-line IF price is heading lower on this stretch with a close below 1.3080 needed to fuel the next major leg of this decline.\nNon-Farm Payrolls will be postponed for a second month amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, and traders will be closely watching Wednesday\u2019s ADP employment report for insight into labor market conditions. Keep in mind that the Bank of England interest rate decision is on tap Thursday, with the central bank widely expected to keep rates unchanged.

The pair holds ground as the US Dollar (USD) struggles amid improving Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut bets. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are now pricing in 71% probability of a Fed rate cut in December, up from 66% the previous day.\nHowever, the GBP/USD pair lost ground as the Greenback received support following comments from the Fed Chair Jerome Powell, noting that the central bank is struggling to balance its dual mandate of controlling inflation and supporting employment due to limited data availability amid the ongoing US government shutdown. Powell cautioned that policymakers may have to adopt a wait-and-see approach until official data reporting resumes. He also added that another rate cut in December is far from certain, emphasizing that the outlook remains uncertain.\nThe US Fed delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 3.75%\u20134.0% in a 10\u20132 vote. The decision was not unanimous, as Fed Governor Stephen Miran supported a larger 50-basis-point cut, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted to keep rates unchanged.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) faced challenges as growing expectations for Bank of England (BoE) rate cuts were fueled by softer inflation data, with the BRC reporting further declines in food price inflation. Additionally, concerns mounted that the upcoming November budget could significantly weigh on economic growth.\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s parliamentary session, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to rule out potential increases in income tax, national insurance, or value-added tax. Meanwhile, reports indicated that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) plans to downgrade the UK\u2019s productivity growth forecast by about 0.3%, a revision that could result in a \u00a320 billion shortfall in public finances.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling.

                "body": "The GBP/USD is stabilising around 1.3200 after recent declines triggered by the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cut of 25 basis points. Despite the expected cut, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on the uncertainty of further easing have strengthened the US dollar, putting pressure on the pound.\nThe UK currency also faces challenges at home, with the possibility of a Bank of England rate cut and concerns about the November budget affecting market sentiment. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has not ruled out tax increases, adding to economic uncertainty.\nKey Technical and Market Challenges\nThe GBP/USD pair dropped to a three-month low after failing to maintain gains, and the 200-day moving average of 1.3239 was breached. The next key level is 1.3141, representing a crucial support point.\nAdditional related content includes analysis of the European Central Bank\u2019s recent decisions and how they contrast with the UK\u2019s economic situation. The article also notes that gold remains below $4,000 amidst US-China trade discussions, and various brokers are reviewed for risk-conscious traders and specific regional markets in 2025.\nNeither the author nor FXStreet are registered investment advisors, and the information should not be considered investment advice.\nGiven the sharp sell-off in the pound, we see the US dollar strengthening on the back of a cautious Federal Reserve. The break below the key 200-day moving average at 1.3239 is a significant bearish signal. This suggests that any small bounces in GBP/USD are likely to be sold into, as the path of least resistance appears to be lower.\nMarket Dynamics and Future Outlook\nThe expectation for a Bank of England rate cut is now firmly priced in, especially after the latest UK inflation data for September 2025 showed a drop to 2.1%, missing forecasts. Adding to this, last week\u2019s retail sales figures showed a surprise 0.5% contraction, pointing to a weakening consumer ahead of the crucial holiday season. This economic softness makes it very difficult for the Bank of England to hold rates steady.\nIn contrast, the US economy continues to show resilience, justifying the Fed\u2019s reluctance to promise more cuts. The last non-farm payrolls report for September 2025 revealed a robust 250,000 jobs were added, and core inflation remains sticky at 2.8%. This divergence between a slowing UK and a steady US economy should continue to fuel the dollar\u2019s strength against the pound.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests buying GBP/USD put options to profit from further downside may be a prudent strategy. With the November UK budget on the horizon and uncertainty over potential tax rises, implied volatility is increasing, making options an effective tool to manage risk. This allows for exposure to a potential drop towards the 1.3141 support level while capping the maximum loss.\nWe\u2019ve seen this script before when political uncertainty weighs on the pound, much like the market reaction to the mini-budget crisis back in September 2022. The refusal by the Prime Minister to rule out tax hikes is creating a similar sense of unease among investors. This historical precedent suggests that fiscal policy concerns can cause sharp, extended declines in Sterling.\nWith the 1.3200 level now acting as a ceiling, we are watching the August 1 low of 1.3141 as the next logical target for bears. A decisive break below this level would open the door for a deeper move towards the psychological 1.3000 handle. The technical picture and the fundamental backdrop are now clearly aligned against the pound in the coming weeks."

                "body": "The Australian Dollar weakens to 0.6550 as the US Dollar strengthens due to a trade truce and hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) comments. A meeting between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resulted in a one-year trade truce, reducing US tariffs on Chinese imports from 57% to 47%. China has agreed to resume US soybean purchases and allow rare earth exports to the US, easing trade tensions and boosting the US Dollar.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%-4.00%. Meanwhile, Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, interpreted as more hawkish, have lifted US Treasury yields. Powell suggested that another rate cut in December isn\u2019t certain, which underpins the US Dollar further.\nReserve Bank of Australia and Inflation\nDomestically, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is unlikely to ease policy further, as Australian inflation rose by 1.3% quarter-on-quarter, surpassing forecasts, reducing expectations of a rate cut. Markets now expect the RBA to maintain its current policy, considering ongoing inflationary pressures.\nUpcoming data, such as Australia\u2019s third-quarter Producer Price Index and China\u2019s Purchasing Managers Indexes, may impact the Australian Dollar. The heatmap indicates the Australian Dollar\u2019s strongest performance today was against the Japanese Yen.\nWe can see how a US-China trade truce and a hawkish Federal Reserve previously pushed the AUD/USD down to 0.6550, overpowering even strong Australian inflation data. This reminds us that the US Dollar\u2019s direction, driven by major global events and Fed policy, often dictates the pair\u2019s movement. These factors can easily outweigh domestic news from Australia.\nCurrent Economic Dynamics\nLooking at today, October 30, 2025, the dynamic is similar but the reasons have changed. The latest US core PCE inflation data released last week came in at a stubborn 3.7%, prompting Fed officials to signal that rates will remain high well into 2026. This contrasts sharply with the policy easing we saw years ago and continues to fuel US Dollar strength.\nMeanwhile, Australia\u2019s economic picture is softer now than it was then. The Q3 2025 inflation report showed a quarterly CPI increase of only 0.8%, which has markets pricing in a 65% chance of an RBA rate cut in the first half of next year. This policy divergence between a hawkish Fed and a potentially dovish RBA is a significant headwind for the Australian Dollar.\nFurthermore, global trade sentiment is fragile, adding pressure on commodity-linked currencies like the Aussie. Iron ore prices, a critical Australian export, have slipped 12% over the past month to $105 per tonne amid fresh concerns over Chinese real estate demand. This is a far cry from the optimism generated by the past trade truce that boosted soybean and other commodity purchases.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests building a bearish bias on the AUD/USD pair in the coming weeks. Buying put options on the Australian Dollar could provide downside exposure while limiting risk if sentiment unexpectedly reverses. With implied volatility on AUD options ticking up, it indicates the market is preparing for a potential move below the 0.6400 support level."

It jumped to a high of 0.6616, up from this month\u2019s low of 0.6441.\nRBA Rate Cut Odds Fall\nThe AUD/USD pair rose after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) published strong inflation data. The report showed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose from 0.7% in Q2 to 1.3% to Q3.\nThis growth translated to an annual growth of 3.2%, much higher than the previous quarter\u2019s 2.1%. It moved much further from the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) target of 2.0%.\nOther inflation gauges also continued to move in the wrong direction. The trimmed mean inflation rose 2.7% to 3.0%, while the weighted mean inflation moved to 2.8% from the previous 2.7%.\nTherefore, these numbers mean that the RBA will likely opt to leave interest rates unchanged in its meeting next week. This is in line with what the bank did in the last meeting.\nTop Forex Brokers\nThe AUD/USD pair rose because the Australian inflation number confirmed a potential divergence with the Federal Reserve, which slashed interest rates by 0.25% on Wednesday.\nThis cut brought rates to between 3.75% and 4%. At the same time, officials noted that they will largely end the quantitative tightening policy in December.\nLooking ahead, the AUD/USD pair will react to the upcoming Donald Trump and Xi Jinping talks in South Korea. A potential agreement will benefit the US, China, and Australia. Australia will benefit because it counts China as the biggest trading partner.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily chart shows that the AUD/USD pair bottomed at 0.6438 earlier this month and then bounced back to 0.6600. It retested the upper side of the Bollinger Bands.\nThe pair\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has jumped above the neutral point at 50, a sign that the bullish trend is gaining momentum. Most importantly, the pair has formed a broadening wedge pattern, which is also known as the megaphone.\nTherefore, the pair will likely continue rising as bulls target the psychological point at 0.6700. A drop below the lower side of the wedge will invalidate the bullish view.\nReady to trade our free Forex signals? Here are the best forex platforms in Australia to choose from."

The Japanese election ushers in a new government of doves, and it is thought that the Bank of Japan will continue to keep a very loose monetary policy, so it does make a certain amount of sense that the Japanese yen gets hammered by other currencies.\nTop Forex Brokers\nFOMC Surprised a Bit\nContrast that with the FOMC meeting that we had on Wednesday, where Jerome Powell stated in the press conference that a December rate cut wasn't necessarily a given. This has driven the US dollar higher against most things, including the Japanese yen, so it all lines up as a central bank outlook differential. Furthermore, we have an interest rate differential between the two currencies because, despite the fact that the Federal Reserve did in fact cut, the reality is that the bond market sat still.\nTherefore, the interest rate differentials are even ignoring the Fed at this point. All things being equal, this is a reasonably sized candlestick. It's explosive, it's strong, but at the same time, it's reasonable. It's not out of control and impulsive. And I think this shows that short-term pullbacks are more likely than not will be bought into in this pair, and I believe that a certain amount of market memory comes into the picture at the 153 yen level as potential support.\nIn fact, I don't even have a scenario at this point where I'm willing to short this pair. I think we have so much more upside. The 155 yen level could be targeted pretty quickly. And then after that, you could be looking at a move to 158 yen.\nWant to trade our USD/JPY forex analysis and predictions? Here's a list of forex brokers in Japan to check out."

The pair loses ground as the Japanese Yen (JPY) advances following Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Trade data.\nTokyo Consumer Price Index rose 2.8% year-over-year (YoY) in October, following the previous 2.5% increase. Core CPI rose 2.8% YoY, up from 2.5% in the previous two months and exceeding market expectations of 2.6%. The figure stayed well above the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) 2% target, strengthening expectations of a gradual move toward tighter monetary policy.\nJapan\u2019s Retail Trade unexpectedly increased by 0.5% year-on-year in September, rebounding from a downwardly revised 0.9% decline in August but coming in below market expectations of a 0.7% rise. Meanwhile, preliminary industrial production grew 2.2% month-on-month, surpassing forecasts of a 1.5% gain and recovering from a 1.5% drop in the previous month. This marked the first rise since June and the fastest pace since February.\nHowever, the USD/JPY pair gained ground as the Japanese Yen faced challenges on Thursday after BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that the economy is recovering at a moderate pace but warned that global trade policies could hinder growth and pressure corporate profits.\nThe BoJ kept interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, in line with expectations, with the decision passed by a 7\u20132 vote as board members Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata again advocated for a hike to 0.75%. The central bank reiterated that it will move toward policy normalization once its economic and inflation targets are met.\nThe US Dollar advanced after US President Trump announced that tariffs on China would be reduced to 47% from the current 57%.

The index is widely considered as a leading indicator of Japan\u2019s overall CPI as it is published weeks before the nationwide reading.

                "body": "The USD/JPY surged to its highest level since mid-February, trading around 154.16 and rising nearly 0.90%. This rise followed the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to maintain its interest rate at 0.50%, leading to a broad weakening of the Japanese Yen.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s decision, reached by a 7-2 vote, reflects a cautious approach amidst the region\u2019s fragile economic recovery. With Japan\u2019s economic data, including the Tokyo Consumer Price Index, due on Friday, the BoJ\u2019s next policy meeting in December could see a rate change, as markets currently assign a 25-30% probability of a hike.\nFederal Reserve Impact\nMeanwhile, renewed US Dollar buying interest emerged after a hawkish 25-basis-point cut by the Federal Reserve. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasised the data-dependent nature of any further rate reductions, leading the US Dollar Index to reach a three-month high of 98.53.\nThe Tokyo Consumer Price Index measures purchase price fluctuations in Tokyo and is usually a precursor to Japan\u2019s nationwide CPI. In general, a high index reading supports the Yen, while a low reading suggests further depreciation. The next data release is scheduled for 30 October 2025, following a previous reading of 2.5%.\nThe policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan is now the main driver, pushing USD/JPY above 154.00. We see this as a clear signal to favor strategies that benefit from a stronger US Dollar and a weaker Japanese Yen in the coming weeks. The path of least resistance for the currency pair appears to be upward.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to hold rates at 0.50% confirms its deeply cautious stance, which continues to pressure the yen. We\u2019ve seen Japan\u2019s real wages remain negative for over 18 consecutive months through September 2025, justifying the central bank\u2019s reluctance to tighten policy further. A weak Tokyo CPI print tomorrow will only reinforce this dovish outlook and likely weaken the yen more.\nTrading Strategy\nOn the other side of the trade, the US Dollar is gaining strength after the Fed\u2019s so-called \u201chawkish cut.\u201d Following Chair Powell\u2019s remarks, fed funds futures now show the market is pricing in only a 35% probability of another rate cut in December, down from over 60% earlier in the week. This repricing should continue to support the dollar.\nOur immediate focus is the Tokyo CPI data scheduled for release in just a few hours. This is a crucial leading indicator for nationwide inflation and could influence the market\u2019s low 25-30% odds of a rate hike at the BoJ\u2019s December meeting. Another soft reading would likely be the catalyst that pushes USD/JPY towards the 155.00 level.\nHowever, we must remain vigilant for intervention risk as the pair moves higher. We remember the Ministry of Finance stepping into the market to defend the yen back in the autumn of 2022 when the rate first crossed 150. Given that we are now four figures higher, verbal warnings could escalate to direct action without notice.\nConsidering this dynamic, buying USD/JPY call options with a one-month expiry is a prudent strategy. This allows us to capture potential upside toward the 155-156 region while strictly defining our maximum risk to the premium paid. It protects our position from a sudden reversal caused by surprise central bank intervention."

The pair appreciated as the US Dollar (USD) received support after Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell's comments lowered expectations for further interest rate cuts.\nThe US Fed delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 3.75%\u20134.0% in a 10\u20132 vote. The decision was not unanimous, as Fed Governor Stephen Miran supported a larger 50-basis-point cut, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted to keep rates unchanged.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the central bank is struggling to balance its dual mandate of controlling inflation and supporting employment due to limited data availability amid the ongoing US government shutdown. Powell cautioned that policymakers may have to adopt a wait-and-see approach until official data reporting resumes. He also added that another rate cut in December is far from certain, emphasizing that the outlook remains uncertain.\nThe USD/CAD pair could face headwinds as the Canadian Dollar (CAD) may receive support from signs that the Bank of Canada (BoC) may be ending its policy easing cycle. The BoC lowered its interest rate by 25 basis points, bringing its policy rate down to 2.25%. The central bank described this level as \u201cabout right if inflation and activity evolve as projected,\u201d hinting that the latest cut may signal the end of its easing cycle.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have"

A negative reading could see the Loonie pare back recent gains as growth concerns resurface.\nHowever, a stronger-than-expected print would reinforce the BoC\u2019s hawkish stance and likely keep GBP/CAD anchored near its current lows.\nWith the UK data calendar empty, Sterling will remain sensitive to fiscal headlines and broader market sentiment as traders position ahead of next week\u2019s developments."

                "body": "The USD/CAD currency pair remains below its 200-day moving average at approximately 1.3950 after the Bank of Canada reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 2.25%. The Bank noted a soft labour market and US trade uncertainties but indicated a pause in further easing, supported by expectations of a stimulative Canadian budget and firm inflation, which bolster the CAD.\nRate Cut Impact\nThe Bank of Canada cut the policy rate to 2.25%, which was 85% anticipated, emphasising the soft Canadian labour market and the impact of US tariffs on the economy. The Bank intends to maintain the rate at 2.25% if inflation and economic activity meet expectations. It predicts GDP growth at 0.75% SAAR in H2, an increase from 0.2% in H1, and sees core inflation slowing to 2.9% in Q4 from 3.2% in Q3.\nThe Bank of Canada is unlikely to lower the policy rate below its estimated neutral range of 2.25% to 3.25%, potentially benefiting the CAD. The Canadian government is set to announce a stimulative budget on 4 November, while underlying inflation remains elevated. The FXStreet Insights Team provides market observations and insights from various analysts.\nThe Bank of Canada delivered a hawkish cut yesterday, trimming its policy rate to 2.25% while signaling it is unlikely to ease further. This action was prompted by a softening labor market, as Canada\u2019s unemployment rate recently rose to 6.4% in the latest data from early October 2025. For now, USD/CAD is holding firm below its 200-day moving average of 1.3950, which is acting as a significant resistance level.\nWe believe the Canadian dollar will remain supported, as the BOC has moved its policy rate to the low end of what it considers neutral territory. With Canada\u2019s government set to deliver a stimulative budget on November 4 and core inflation still well above target, the case for further rate cuts is weak. This suggests options strategies that bet on USD/CAD failing to break higher in the coming weeks could be favorable.\nOptions Strategies\nTraders should consider selling out-of-the-money USD call options with strike prices above the 1.4000 psychological level. This strategy benefits from both time decay and the pair\u2019s inability to push past the strong technical resistance at 1.3950. The signal that the BOC is now on hold should also help contain volatility, making option-selling strategies more attractive.\nThe primary risk remains US trade policy, particularly with ongoing reviews of the USMCA that could lead to new tariffs on Canadian goods. However, we saw a similar situation back in 2019 when the US Federal Reserve\u2019s final \u201cinsurance\u201d rate cut provided a clear floor for the market. The BOC\u2019s move yesterday feels like a similar signal, providing a clearer path for the coming weeks."

The pair has bounced up from three-week lows at 200.57 to reach session highs right above 202.50 at the European session opening times.\nThe BoJ kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% for the sixth consecutive time and reaffirmed its commitment to continue tightening monetary policies if economic projections are met. Investors, however, have been disappointed, as the number of dissenting votes calling for a rate hike remained at two, and have sent the Yen tumbling across the board.\nUeda strikes a dovish note\nBoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's press release has failed to provide any significant support to the Yen. Ueda assessed that economic growth is likely to be modest as trade policies lead to a slowdown in global growth and that underlying inflation will gradually increase, to reach levels in line with the target of price stability in the mid-term.\nThe outlook on monetary policy, however, has been tilted to the dovish side, as the BoJ Governor played down concerns of falling behind the curve with interest rate hikes and said that he has no present ideas about the timing of the next interest rate hike.\nThe Sterling was hammered earlier this week after the UK Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) slashed its productivity growth forecasts for the next five years by 0.3%, which is likely to add a GBP 20 billion hole to the already strained public finances.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation. The BoJ\u2019s policy led to a widening differential with other currencies, dragging down the value of the Yen. This trend partly reversed in 2024, when the BoJ decided to abandon its ultra-loose policy stance.\nA weaker Yen and the spike in global energy prices led to an increase in Japanese inflation, which exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. The prospect of rising salaries in the country \u2013 a key element fuelling inflation \u2013 also contributed to the move.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and copywriter in diverse Forex-related firms, like FXStreet and Kantox."

The surge came after a volatile period in which $470 million exited spot Bitcoin ETFs in a single session following the 25 bps Fed rate cut to the 3.75\u20134.00% range, before buyers aggressively returned as inflation data and macro sentiment improved. The total year-to-date inflows into Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $30.2 billion, lifting combined assets under management (AUM) to approximately $149 billion, representing about 6.7% of Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization.\nInstitutional Rotation: From Outflows to $931 Million Weekly Inflows\nData from multiple asset monitors show a swift reversal from the prior week\u2019s $513 million in outflows to nearly $921 million in net inflows across crypto investment products, of which Bitcoin accounted for the overwhelming share. The shift coincided with softer-than-expected inflation prints\u2014CPI up 0.3% MoM, 3% YoY\u2014that restored confidence in additional Fed easing before year-end. Institutional trading volumes across digital asset ETFs surged to $39 billion for the week, well above the 2025 average of $28 billion, signaling renewed institutional participation. The U.S. market led with $843 million in inflows, while Germany-based funds attracted $502 million, marking one of their largest weekly inflows ever recorded.\nFed Policy, Rate Sensitivity, and ETF Liquidity Patterns\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s second consecutive rate cut triggered a brief liquidity shock across all asset classes as Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s hawkish tone tempered optimism for further easing in December. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped momentarily to $109,000, before stabilizing above $110,000 as ETF flows absorbed panic selling. The sharp $470 million ETF outflow on October 29 reflected algorithmic de-risking rather than long-term redemptions. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC led withdrawals with $164 million, ARK Invest\u2019s ARKB followed with $143 million, and BlackRock\u2019s IBIT reported $88 million in outflows. Grayscale\u2019s GBTC shed $65 million, while Bitwise\u2019s BITB saw only $6 million withdrawn, confirming that institutional portfolios continue to rotate rather than liquidate exposure.\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC Maintain Dominance in Holdings\nDespite temporary volatility, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains the leading fund globally, holding over 805,000 BTC, valued near $87 billion at current spot prices. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC retains second position with approximately 295,000 BTC, and Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, now converted to a spot ETF, manages roughly 270,000 BTC after months of redemptions. Collectively, U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs now control more than 1.5 million BTC, equivalent to about 7.1% of total circulating supply. Analysts emphasize that such concentration is tightening available supply in the open market, reinforcing Bitcoin\u2019s long-term scarcity narrative.\nCross-Asset Divergence: Ethereum and Altcoin ETFs Show Weakness\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs benefited from the macro tailwinds, Ethereum (ETH-USD) investment products posted $169 million in weekly outflows, marking the first decline in over a month. U.S.-based Ethereum spot ETFs alone recorded $243.9 million in outflows, partially offset by inflows in Europe and Asia.

                "body": "The Fusaka upgrade is a significant event for Ethereum, and it's happening on December 3, 2025. This upgrade is going to focus on scalability and security, introducing features like Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) and increasing the gas limits. Basically, it means more transactions can get through, and users may pay less for them. By increasing the block gas limit from 45 million to 150 million, Fusaka is designed to help Ethereum handle more transactions in each block, which is a plus for the whole ecosystem.\nHistorically, upgrades like these have had effects on Layer 2 (L2) solutions and the market as a whole. With Fusaka, we might see a boost in Total Value Locked (TVL) across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. After extensive testing, the Ethereum Foundation has confirmed the deployment, and there are many eyes on how this will play out for developers and investors.\nWhat Changes Will We See in Gas Fees After the Upgrade?\nExpectations are that the Fusaka upgrade will significantly impact gas fees, especially for small fintech startups in Asia. With improved network scalability and increased transaction throughput, gas fees should go down, particularly on Layer 2 solutions. A new rule will cap the gas limit per transaction at about 16.78 million gas, which should help prevent any single large transaction from taking up all the block space, leading to fairer fees.\nAlso, the higher block gas limit could potentially double Ethereum's transaction speed. This is essential for startups that rely on lower costs, as it might cut transaction expenses by up to 60% on Layer 2 platforms, so they can operate more affordably.\nWhat Should Startups Expect in the DeFi Landscape?\nFor crypto-native businesses, the Fusaka upgrade is both a challenge and an opportunity. They need to be ready, which means updating their infrastructure to fit the new framework. They'll need to ensure their smart contracts and nodes can work with the new data structures, like Verkle Trees, and that their systems can handle the increased block gas limit.\nStartups should also invest in better analytics and monitoring tools for spotting suspicious trading patterns. Unfortunately, this upgrade doesn\u2019t come with new safeguards against market manipulation, so that remains a concern. To succeed in this more scalable but intricate DeFi market, startups should focus on enhancing their operational capabilities and compliance measures.\nWhat Regulatory Challenges Could the Upgrade Bring?\nThe Fusaka upgrade could pose regulatory challenges for crypto-friendly SMEs, especially in Europe. With regulations constantly changing, navigating compliance will become even trickier. They\u2019ll have to deal with requirements like the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and anti-money laundering rules, all of which could differ from country to country.\nStartups might face operational challenges in implementing due diligence and monitoring to meet EU AML standards. The complexities of tax compliance related to crypto payroll and payments could also require professional advice. As Fusaka boosts Ethereum's scalability, startups will need to invest in compliance systems and legal expertise to manage these risks.\nWill This Upgrade Widen the Gap in the Crypto Market?\nWhile the Fusaka upgrade aims to make Ethereum more efficient, it may also create disparities between established DeFi protocols and newcomers. The technical demands of the upgrade might favor well-resourced players, leaving new entrants at a disadvantage.\nThe need for node operators to update their software and maintain compatible infrastructure could restrict participation for smaller or newer players. Established protocols might take advantage of Fusaka's improvements, potentially widening the competitive gap with new entrants.\nAdditionally, the focus on scalability might lead to centralization risks, where only larger players can afford to run full nodes effectively. This could leave smaller startups marginaliz"

                "body": "Transaction fees remained at historic lows throughout the surge, demonstrating the network's enhanced scalability following recent protocol upgrades.\nNetwork activity on Ethereum reached 1.6 million daily transactions on Tuesday, marking a near one-month high, last observed before October's market crash that triggered $19 billion in liquidations. Transaction fees remained at historic lows throughout the surge, demonstrating the network's enhanced scalability following recent protocol upgrades.\nGas fees averaged just 0.16 gwei, translating to approximately $0.01 per transaction, according to blockchain\ndata aggregator Milkroad. Token swaps cost slightly more at $0.15, while non-fungible token sales averaged $0.27 in transaction fees.\nActive addresses on the network peaked at 695,872 on Saturday, reaching monthly highs\naccording to crypto intelligence platform Nansen. The increased activity occurred without the fee spikes that characterized previous periods of high network demand, which represented one of Ethereum's biggest criticisms in past cycles.\nThe Pectra upgrade deployed in May has doubled blob capacity for layer-2 networks, reducing L2 transaction fees by approximately 50%. The upgrade offloads more transactions from the mainnet to further reduce costs across the Ethereum ecosystem.\nDencun, Ethereum\u2019s previous major upgrade deployed on March 13, 2024, managed to cut\nlayer-2 transaction fees while offloading additional transactions from the L1. Average Ethereum transaction fees decreased by 95% in the year following Dencun's implementation, according to reports.\nThe low costs contrast sharply with previous high-activity periods when demand frequently sent fees soaring. The stable fee environment during peak activity signals a more mature and scalable infrastructure ready for advanced real-world use cases.\nBoth protocol upgrades were specifically designed to lower transaction costs and expand network throughput. The combination of Dencun and Pectra has transformed Ethereum's cost structure, enabling the network to handle significantly higher\ntransaction volumes without proportional increases in user fees.\nThe network's ability to maintain sub-dollar transaction costs while processing 1.6 million daily transactions demonstrates the effectiveness of Ethereum's scaling solutions. This development addresses long-standing concerns about network accessibility and positions Ethereum for broader adoption across\ndecentralized applications and DeFi protocols.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).

                "body": "What to know:\n- Most Solana ecosystem sectors have underperformed SOL over the past 90 days.\n- DEX volumes stagnated since Q3 2025, while average FDV-to-revenue ratios compressed.\n- EtherFi\u2019s neobank card usage tops $1M/day, but heavy unlocks (~$1M/day) add persistent sell pressure.\n- Over 90% of EtherFi\u2019s revenue still comes from restaking, limiting valuation support.\n- Ore\u2019s PoW mining upgrade added SOL-funded buybacks (90% burn / 10% staker rewards), making emissions net negative.\n- Ore has risen to 7th in Solana network revenue, outperforming peers like Pump and Meteora.\n- Context - not cheap multiples - explains relative performance. Fundamentals justify moves but rarely anchor them.\nWhen Fundamentals Lag Price\nOver the past 90 days, most sectors within the Solana ecosystem have underperformed SOL itself.\nSource: dashboards.wtf\nDEX volumes across Solana have stagnated since early Q3 2025. At the same time, average FDV-to-revenue ratios for Solana DEXs have compressed - reflecting a market that\u2019s repricing in line with muted fundamentals. If valuations aren\u2019t cheap relative to growth or usage, there\u2019s little basis for sector-level outperformance versus SOL.\nBeyond Solana: EtherFi and the \"Neobank\" Meta\nThe same logic applies outside Solana. EtherFi, a leading player in the \u201cneobank\u201d meta, has seen solid traction - with daily card spend volumes averaging around $1 million.\nYet, its token (ETHFI) has fallen roughly 66% versus BTC over the past year, largely due to heavy unlock schedules, with around $1 million worth of ETHFI unlocking daily.\nThat translates to ~1% of its daily volume, as per CoinDesk Data - generating a persistent source of sell pressure. Even assuming a 1% take rate on card activity, EtherFi\u2019s implied annualized card revenue is just $3.6 million before accounting for cashback incentives.\nIn other words, the fundamentals don\u2019t justify price resilience - especially when the core revenue stream remains restaking-related (restaking still accounts for >90% of Ether.fi\u2019s revenue). If investors aren\u2019t bullish on that segment, a lower price-to-revenue ratio alone doesn\u2019t make the token \u201ccheap.\u201d In other words, context is what gives fundamental metrics meaning.\nWhen Fundamentals Do Align\nContrast this with Ore, a proof-of-work-style protocol on Solana that has climbed to 7th place in network revenue, according to DefiLlama. Ore launched as a fair-launch experiment in 2024, letting users earn ORE tokens by solving lightweight on-chain hash puzzles - mimicking the fairness of PoW mining but without the energy cost. The initial version was purely inflationary and contributed to network congestion on Solana.\nSource: DefiLlama\nThe protocol recently updated its mining mechanism, introducing a reward pool that distributes SOL from each mining round into automatic ORE buybacks - with 90% of the purchased tokens burned and 10% distributed to stakers. Each round functions like a mini lottery, where miners compete to solve puzzles for variable rewards. This has boosted activity and hence revenue - which more or less fits within Solana\u2019s \u2018gambling meta\u2019 i.e. a reflexive system betting on speculation.\nComparing Ore v/s other \u2018gambling meta\u2019 proxies, it screens well - with lower multiples relative to peers like Pump and Meteora (i.e. the other tokenized plays that act as memecoin beta proxies on Solana) on an FDV-to-revenue basis.\nMoreover, Ore\u2019s emission-to-buyback ratio is net negative, meaning buy pressure exceeds dilution. Here, fundamentals actually explain outperformance, providing a rational basis for the token\u2019s rally.\nContext Matters\nValuation ratios alone rarely explain performance. Once token unlocks, revenue mix, and emission mechanics are considered, sector-level underperformance versus base tokens like SOL looks justified.\nEven when fundamentals do align with price action - as in Ore\u2019s case - sustainability is another question. The relatively recent \u201cgambling meta\u201d led by Pok\u00e9mon TCG\u2019s CARDS peaked near $700M FDV be"

Yesterday, all three indexes set fresh intraday highs soon after markets opened, but only the Nasdaq finished higher after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said an additional interest-rate cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion\u2014far from it\" after the central bank trimmed its key rate by a quarter point.\nAfter the bell Wednesday, tech giants Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported quarterly results. Shares of Alphabet rose 2.5% to a record high after it surpassed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, but those of Meta and Microsoft were down roughly 11% and 3%, respectively, to pull indexes lower.\nTwo additional Magnificent Seven members, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) reported results shortly after the bell Thursday. Shares of Apple finished the regular session up 0.6% at a record high, while those of Amazon were down roughly 3%. Both stocks jumped in after-hours trading in response to the quarterly reports.\nIn addition to big tech earnings, investors pondered President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, early Thursday. Trump said the U.S. would lower tariffs on Chinese goods by 10% in exchange for China taking \"very strong action\" on chemicals used to produce fentanyl. China also agreed to ease restrictions on rare-earths exports and purchase \"tremendous amounts\" of U.S.-produced soybeans, Trump said.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 4.09% at 4 p.m. ET, while the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, advanced 0.3% to 99.54.

The social media giant also lifted the low end of its 2025 capital expenditure forecast and said expenses would grow \"significantly faster\" next year, raising concerns about its steep spending on artificial intelligence. Meta shares tumbled 11.3%.\n- Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock fell 18.2%, the most of any S&P 500 component, after the fast-casual burrito chain reported lower-than-expected third-quarter revenue and reduced its full-year forecast for comparable-restaurant sales.

                "body": "New York, NY \u2013 October 30, 2025 \u2013 The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) found itself in a tug-of-war today, as investors grappled with a barrage of mixed signals stemming from the latest round of big tech earnings reports and ongoing, nuanced developments in US-China trade relations. The blue-chip index experienced a session marked by volatility, reflecting a market attempting to price in both robust corporate performance from some tech giants and cautionary outlooks from others, all while weighing the unpredictable landscape of global trade.\nToday's trading underscored a prevailing theme in late 2025: a market highly sensitive to individual company fundamentals within the influential technology sector and the geopolitical currents dictating international commerce. The confluence of these factors has created an environment where swift, decisive movements are often counteracted by opposing forces, leaving the Dow in a state of cautious anticipation.\nUnpacking the Day's Influences: Earnings and Trade Dynamics\nThe day's narrative was heavily influenced by a series of earnings reports from major technology players, some of which are direct components of the Dow, and others that significantly impact broader market sentiment. For instance, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), a bellwether for consumer technology and a Dow component, reported stronger-than-expected services revenue growth, providing an initial uplift to the index. This positive news suggested resilience in consumer spending and a successful diversification beyond hardware sales. However, this optimism was partially offset by a more cautious outlook from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), another Dow heavyweight, which, despite solid cloud computing performance, signaled potential deceleration in enterprise software spending in certain international markets, citing global economic uncertainties. This mixed bag of results created divergence within investor sentiment, preventing a clear upward or downward trend for the broader index.\nSimultaneously, the market closely watched developments concerning US-China trade relations. While no dramatic breakthroughs or escalations occurred today, reports emerged of stalled progress in certain sector-specific trade negotiations. Sources indicated that discussions around intellectual property protections and access to specific technology markets had reached an impasse, leading to concerns about the potential for renewed friction. This news tempered enthusiasm generated by positive earnings, particularly impacting industrial and semiconductor stocks with significant exposure to the Chinese market. The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA), a major exporter, saw some pressure, as did chipmakers like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), both of which are highly sensitive to global trade stability and demand. The timeline of events leading up to this moment has been characterized by a series of on-again, off-again dialogues between Washington and Beijing, with each pronouncement or lack thereof sending ripples through the financial markets. Key stakeholders involved include multinational corporations navigating complex supply chains, consumers facing potential price adjustments, and governments striving to balance economic growth with national security interests.\nCompanies on the Front Lines: Winners and Losers\nThe mixed signals emanating from earnings and trade had a direct and varied impact on Dow components. Companies with strong domestic consumer bases and robust service-oriented businesses, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), appeared to be relatively insulated or even benefited from their strong earnings and less direct exposure to immediate trade disruptions. Apple's ability to pivot towards recurring revenue streams, for example, showcased a strategic resilience that resonated positively with investors today, despite broader market jitters.\nConversely, industrial giants and technology firms deeply embedded in global supply chains felt the brunt o"

The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent and the Dow Jones slid 0.2 per cent.\nIn London, WPP was the biggest faller, down 16.5 per cent, after a profit warning from the advertising company.\nStandard Chartered was one of the risers after the emerging markets-focused bank nudged full-year profit forecasts higher after posting better-than-expected third-quarter results.\nThe pound weakened further against the dollar to $1.3141, gold was up 1 per cent but remained below $4,000 an ounce, and UK bond yields rose across the curve.\nECB leaves interest rates unchanged\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has kept interest rates unchanged for a third meeting in a row today.\nThe governing council said inflation remained close to the 2 per cent medium-term target and its assessment of the inflation outlook was broadly the same.\nIt said the economy had continued to grow despite the challenging global environment, with a robust labour market and solid private sector balance sheets.\n\u201cHowever, the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions,\u201d the council said. It said it was \u201cnot pre-committing to a particular rate path\u201d, leaving the door open to further policy easing as the US tariff regime fully works its way through the economy.\nIrene Lauro, a Eurozone economist at Schroders, said: \u201cToday\u2019s interest rate hold from the ECB signals its confidence that its policy stance is working.\u201d\nThe president of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, will speak at a press conference this afternoon.\nJump in companies facing financial distress\nThe latest quarterly Red Flag Alert report by Begbies Traynor has revealed a 78 per cent rise in the number of firms in \u201ccritical\u201d financial distress to 55,530 in the third quarter of 2025, compared with a year earlier.\nIt represented a 12.6 per cent increase against the quarter to June, showing a sharply worsening situation for more than 6,000 businesses.\nJulie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said the woes of many British businesses \u201cshows the UK economy is in real trouble\u201d.\nConsumer-facing businesses have come under particular difficulties from rising labour costs and an uptick in inflation.\nPrinces expected to price float at bottom of range\nNewPrinces, the Italian-owned business that makes Princes tuna and Napolina pasta, is expected to price its London initial public offering at 475p, the bottom of its marketed range, according to terms seen by Reuters and Bloomberg.\nThe company, which will be known as Princes Group, expects to raise about \u00a3400 million in the deal, giving it a valuation of about \u00a31.2 billion.

So far this FTSE 100 rally appears impervious to any selling. Whether that survives more tech earnings tonight is another matter.\u201d\n4.10pm: FTSE climbs out of the red\nThe FTSE 100 has fought back to just above flat, as we wind down to the close.\nStandard Chartered is top of the late-afternoon risers, up 3.4%, followed by utilities and insurers.\nAmong the index heavyweights, oil giants Shell and BP, engine maker Rolls-Royce, drugmaker GSK and banks Lloyds and Barclays are all green now.\nThe London index is the only one of the major Eurpean benchmarks in green.\nUS stock indices remain mixed, with the Dow up 0.5% but the S&P and Nasdaq down 0.3% and 0.8%.\nMarket analyst Fawad Razaqzada at StoneX says he thinks US stocks will resume their climb soon, shrugging off Fed chief Jerome Powell\u2019s cautious messaging.\n\"The Fed\u2019s stance wasn\u2019t exactly unexpected. A bit of hesitation from policymakers isn\u2019t enough to derail what remains a solid uptrend in equities,\" Razaqzada says.\n\"Interestingly, markets barely flinched even as Powell struck a somewhat more hawkish note \u2013 a clear sign that the AI earnings narrative is what\u2019s really propping up the S&P 500, rather than hopes of easier monetary policy.\"\nWhile tech earnings have been mixed so far, revenues \"remain resilient\", he says.\n\"With Apple and Amazon still to come, we\u2019ll soon find out whether the tech-led rally still has legs \u2013 or if investors begin searching for a fresh catalyst.\"\n3.12pm: Lloyds, Santander and Barclays the biggest account losers\nBank switching data showed that Santander UK was the worst affected, losing just over 23,000 accounts in the past quarter, followed by Barclays with 18,330.\nLloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY) lost 9,400 accounts and subsidiary Halifax saw 14,750 switch away, meaning the UK's largest lender was the biggest loser in the quarter.\nThis is out of a total of over 265,000 current account switches in the last three months, according to the Current Account Switching Service (CASS).\nLenders with an ethical edge seemed to be winners, with Nationwide Building Society picking up the most customers, welcoming 54,347 new accounts, followed by Co-operative Bank, with 9,175.\nAt the bottom of the table was Santander, which lost more than accounts.\n2.50pm: ECB says little\nThe ECB press conference provided \"thin gruel\", says Pantheon Macroeconomics's Claus Vistesen.\nLagarde repeated that the ECB \"is in a good place\", adding that the governing council will act to ensure it \"continues to stay in a good place\".\nVistesen says journalists gave Christine Lagarde a bit of a pass today, pressing the president very little on the ECB\u2019s next steps.\nAs for the tone of Lagarde\u2019s comments, \"we think it tilted slightly dovish in light of this week\u2019s data. In short, the ECB sees fading downside risks to growth, primarily due to greater clarity on trade tensions, while policymakers still see downside risks to inflation stemming from potential euro appreciation, financial market volatility, and tariffs.\n\"These are offset by upside risks tied to trade fragmentation and supply-side bottlenecks caused by tariffs.\"\nLargade's comments support Vistesen's vi"

Economists say the region\u2019s resilience\u2014despite global trade tensions and persistent geopolitical risks\u2014has kept the ECB cautious about hinting at any early rate cuts. Germany\u2019s inflation slipped to 2.3% in October, narrowly beating forecasts as fiscal measures helped ease price pressure. The country\u2019s steady unemployment rate hints at underlying economic strength, but not all signs are positive. Volkswagen posted a \u20ac1.07 billion third-quarter loss, dragged down by a major restructuring charge at Porsche AG and ongoing US tariff pressure. That sent Volkswagen\u2019s stock down nearly 2%, with Porsche AG shares falling over 3%.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Investors watch for signs of momentum.\nWith growth prospects muted and the ECB sticking to a data-driven plan, investors are cautious and markets remain hesitant. Volkswagen\u2019s setback underlines the challenges facing global manufacturers, where tariffs and higher costs can quickly flip profits to losses. If inflation or company expenses creep up again, more German giants could come under pressure\u2014keeping market watchers extra alert.\nThe bigger picture: Stable policy in uncertain times.\nWith the ECB holding firm and new trade deals doing little to shift the dial, Germany and the broader eurozone are treading water. While base effects are helping keep inflation in check for now, analysts warn that ongoing fiscal stimulus could stir up new price pressures down the line. Global trade tensions and uncertainty mean Europe\u2019s focus will likely stay on stability\u2014a waiting game rather than a growth story.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "source": "FinancialContent",
                "url": "https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-30-germanys-dax-stumbles-as-volkswagens-ev-woes-and-economic-stagnation-cast-a-shadow",
                "body": "Germany's benchmark DAX index experienced a notable slip in late October 2025, concluding a challenging period for the nation's financial markets. The decline was primarily driven by a combination of disappointing third-quarter earnings from automotive giant Volkswagen, which reported its first operating loss in five years, and a broader landscape of stagnant economic data pointing to a fragile recovery for Europe's largest economy. This confluence of corporate underperformance and macroeconomic headwinds has injected a fresh wave of uncertainty into the German stock market, raising concerns about the health of its crucial export-oriented industries and the overall economic sentiment across the Eurozone.\nThe immediate implications of this downturn are palpable, with investors grappling with heightened anxieties regarding Germany's susceptibility to global trade fluctuations and the formidable challenges facing its pivotal automotive sector amidst an expensive transition to electric vehicles. As the DAX 40 closed just below the flatline at 24,139 points on October 30, 2025, marking a 0.04% loss for the day and extending a three-day decline that saw the index shed 0.78%, the market is clearly signaling a need for a re-evaluation of growth prospects and corporate strategies in the face of persistent global and domestic pressures.\nDissecting the Downturn: Volkswagen's Setback and Broader Economic Headwinds\nThe catalyst for much of the market's recent unease stemmed directly from Volkswagen Group (FWB: VOW) (OTCMKTS: VWAGY), which unveiled its third-quarter 2025 financial results on October 30, 2025. The automotive behemoth reported an operating loss of EUR 1.3 billion (approximately $1.52 billion), a stark reversal that marks its first quarterly loss in half a decade. This significant setback was largely attributed to substantial impairments and write-downs totaling EUR 5.1 billion, primarily linked to its ambitious electric vehicle (EV) expansion plans at its luxury sports car subsidiary, Porsche AG (FWB: P911). Compounding these internal challenges, the ongoing impact of U.S. import tariffs on some of Volkswagen's most profitable brands further eroded its bottom line. Despite these profitability woes, the company did manage to report a 2.3% year-on-year increase in sales revenue, reaching EUR 80.3 billion, indicating continued demand but at a higher cost of doing business. Following the announcement, Volkswagen's shares initially fell by approximately 1.7% to 1.9%, exerting downward pressure on the broader DAX index, though some reports suggested a degree of investor resilience later in the day as the market digested the specifics of the write-downs.\nBeyond Volkswagen's corporate struggles, a series of broader economic data points painted a picture of stagnation and fragility for the German economy in late 2025. The nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) recorded zero growth in Q3 2025, from July to September, narrowly averting a technical recession after a 0.2% contraction in the preceding quarter. This performance fell short of analyst expectations for modest expansion and highlighted significant vulnerabilities. A key factor in this stagnation was a noticeable decline in crucial exports, a cornerstone of the German economy, largely due to a slowdown in global trade activity and the persistent drag of higher U.S. tariffs. Manufacturing output also suffered, with a 4.3% drop in August, and the vital motor vehicle and parts sector experiencing a sharp 18.5% decrease, partly influenced by holiday-related factors.\nFurther exacerbating concerns, inflation remained stubbornly elevated, easing only slightly in October to 2.3% from 2.4% in September, still higher than the anticipated 2.2%. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, remained even higher at 2.8% in September, suggesting entrenched cost pressures. While the Ifo Business Climate Index showed a marginal improvement in October, rising to 88.4 from 87.7, this "

They finished the day 0.2% higher.\nAerospace and defense company Airbus, meanwhile, reported a strong third quarter late on Wednesday amid Europe's rush to build out its defense capabilities. Its results came in above analyst estimates, with revenue jumping 14% to 17.8 billion euros ($23.5 billion) and operating profit up 42% at 1.75 billion euros.

Shares of U.S.-listed firms Critical Metals, USA Rare Earth and Energy Fuels rose in premarket trade on Thursday.\nChinese and Hong Kong markets fell overnight, reversing earlier gains, after the meeting concluded, while other Asia-Pacific markets were mixed.\nInvestors were also digesting comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He indicated, at the end of the Fed's two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, that a rate cut in December was far from a \"foregone conclusion.\"\nThe Fed cut the benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points, as expected, to bring it to 3.75%-4%\nU.S. stocks were mixed Thursday as investors digested a batch of Big Tech earnings.

                "body": "Major stock indexes declined Thursday as investors digested several big tech earnings reports, with more set to be delivered after the bell.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down a respective 1.6%, 1%, and 0.2%. Yesterday, all three indexes set fresh intraday highs soon after markets opened, but only the Nasdaq finished higher after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said an additional interest-rate cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion\u2014far from it\" after the central bank trimmed its key rate by a quarter point.\nAfter the bell Wednesday, tech giants Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported quarterly results. Shares of Alphabet rose 2.5% to a record high after it surpassed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, but those of Meta and Microsoft were down roughly 11% and 3%, respectively, to pull indexes lower.\nTwo additional Magnificent Seven members, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) reported results shortly after the bell Thursday. Shares of Apple finished the regular session up 0.6% at a record high, while those of Amazon were down roughly 3%. Both stocks jumped in after-hours trading in response to the quarterly reports.\nIn addition to big tech earnings, investors pondered President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, early Thursday. Trump said the U.S. would lower tariffs on Chinese goods by 10% in exchange for China taking \"very strong action\" on chemicals used to produce fentanyl. China also agreed to ease restrictions on rare-earths exports and purchase \"tremendous amounts\" of U.S.-produced soybeans, Trump said.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 4.09% at 4 p.m. ET, while the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, advanced 0.3% to 99.54. Bitcoin was trading around $106,500, well off the day's high of $111,800. Gold futures were trading up 0.9% at $4,040 an ounce, while West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures slipped 0.3% to $60.30 a barrel.\nIn corporate news, shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which Wednesday became the first company to be worth $5 trillion, were ended 2% lower. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares sank 17% after it cut its comparable-restaurant sales outlook as it said customers are making fewer visits, and Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) stock plummeted more than 25% after the company issued a weak outlook following soft same-store sales.\nEli Lilly (LLY) stock closed up nearly 4% after the maker of popular weight-loss drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro lifted its full-year outlook following stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, and Align Technology (ALGN) stock advanced roughly 5% after the company reported better-than-expected results.\nNoteworthy S&P 500 Movers on Thursday\nDecliners\n- Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms (META) reported third-quarter earnings per share that fell significantly shy of analysts' forecasts, reflecting the impact of a $16 billion one-time tax charge related to the One Big Beautiful Bill. The social media giant also lifted the low end of its 2025 capital expenditure forecast and said expenses would grow \"significantly faster\" next year, raising concerns about its steep spending on artificial intelligence. Meta shares tumbled 11.3%.\n- Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock fell 18.2%, the most of any S&P 500 component, after the fast-casual burrito chain reported lower-than-expected third-quarter revenue and reduced its full-year forecast for comparable-restaurant sales. The company pointed to declines among 25- to 34-year-old customers who make less than $100,000, a key cohort that Chipotle says is turning to at-home food options amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n- Shares of EMCOR Group (EME) dropped 16.6% after the mechanical and electrical construction specialist posted its third-quarter results.

                "body": "S Korea announces lowering of tariffs as part of new US trade deal\nThe US and South Korea have reached a broad trade deal, both countries have said following talks between their leaders.\nSouth Korea's presidential aide, Kim Yong-beom, said the two sides will reduce reciprocal tariffs from 25% to 15%, as was agreed earlier this year.\nSouth Korea will also invest $350bn (\u00a3265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding, Kim said.\nUS President Donald Trump, who is currently on a week-long trip in Asia, said the deal was \"pretty much finalised\" at a dinner following the discussions, which lasted almost two hours. He did not give further details.\n\"We had a tremendous meeting today with South Korea\", Trump said of his discussions with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, adding that \"a lot was determined\".\n\"We discussed some other things to do with national security et cetera. And I think we came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"\nBoth sides had played down the prospect of a breakthrough ahead of Wednesday's talks - disappointing many in South Korea's electronics, chip and auto industries, which had been hoping for some clarity amidst the tariff chaos.\nTrump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which Lee managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn in the US and buy $100bn worth of liquified natural gas.\nBut the White House later increase its demands as part of the trade talks, with Trump pushing for cash investments in the US.\nBoth countries have historically been key allies - but tensions spiked after hundreds of South Koreans were detained in an immigration raid in the US last month.\nTrump will next meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in on Thursday on the sidelines of a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) which is taking place in Gyeongju.\nChina's foreign ministry has confirmed the meeting, which will take place in the city of Busan on Thursday, a short flight away from Gyeongju.\nThe US president said on Wednesday that he was \"looking forward\" to the meeting.\n\"We've been talking a lot over the last month and I think we're going to have something that's gonna be very, very satisfactory to China and to us.\"\nThis will be the two leaders' first face to face meeting since Trump assumed office in 2025 and imposed tariffs on every country in the world.\nAddressing a group of CEOs in Gyeongju on Wednesday, Trump said that he believes the US is \"going to have a deal\" with China and it will be \"a good deal for both\".\nHe also praised the Apec countries for making the global trading system, which he said had been \"broken\" and \"in urgent need of reform\", fairer.\n\"Economic security is national security,\" Trump says. \"That's for South Korea, that's for any country.\"\nGolden crowns and grand orders\nAhead of Wednesday's talks with President Lee, Trump had been greeted by an honour guard and gifts that included a golden crown.\n\"I'd like to wear it right now,\" Trump had said of the crown.\nHe also received the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decoration.\nHe's the first US president to receive the award, which was given \"in recognition of his contribution to peace on the Korean Peninsula\", the South Korean presidential office said.\nBoth leaders took part in a working lunch - which was followed by a private meeting in the afternoon.\nTrump's arrival in South Korea had been preceded by North Korea test-firing surface-to-air cruise missiles.\nThe US president had expressed interest in meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but noted on Wednesday that his team had been unable to arrange this during his trip.\nNoting the long-standing tensions between North and South Korea, Trump said \"we will see what we can do to get that all straightened out\".\nAnd outside the summit venue where both leaders were meeting, a small anti-Trump group of protesters gathered on Wednesday afternoon, with some shouting anti-Trump slogans.

                "body": "- Share via\n- Whether you\u2019re a singing novice or an aspiring professional, everyone is welcome at the Gardenia Supper Club\u2019s open mic night.\n- Over the past 25 years, regulars have formed a community around their love of jazz, cabaret and the Great American Songbook.\nElliot Zwiebach was 62 years old when he sang in front of a live audience for the first time.\nThe retired reporter had always loved show tunes, but he\u2019d never considered singing in public before.\n\u201cI sang for my own amusement, and I wasn\u2019t very amused,\u201d he said recently.\nBut one night, after attending a few open mic nights at the Gardenia Supper Club in West Hollywood as a spectator, he got up the nerve to step onto the stage and perform a tune backed by a live band.\nFor his first song, he picked the humorous \u201cHoney Bun\u201d from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \u201cSouth Pacific.\u201d It was frightening and he didn\u2019t sing well. And yet, the following week he came back and did it again.\nSixteen years later, Zwiebach, now 78, is a core member of what the event\u2019s longtime host Keri Kelsey calls \u201cthe family,\u201d a group of roughly 25 regulars who sing jazz standards, show tunes and other numbers from the Great American Songbook at the longest-running open mic night in L.A.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much like a community,\u201d Zwiebach said on a recent evening as he prepared to sing \u201cThis Nearly Was Mine,\u201d another song from \u201cSouth Pacific.\u201d \u201cEveryone knows everyone.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an unofficial saying: \u201cSo goes WeHo, so goes California, so goes the nation.\u201d\nFor 25 years, the small, L-shaped Gardenia room on Santa Monica Boulevard has served as a musical home for a diverse group of would-be jazz and cabaret singers. Each Tuesday night, elementary school teachers, acting coaches, retired psychoanalysts, arts publicists and the occasional celebrity pay an $8 cover to perform in front of an audience that knows firsthand just how terrifying it can be to stand before even a small crowd with nothing more than a microphone in your hand.\n\u201cYou are so vulnerable up there with everyone staring at you,\u201d said Kelsey, who has hosted the open mic night for 24 years and once watched Molly Ringwald nervously take the stage. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the most joyous experience in the world.\u201d\nThe singers are backed by a live, three-piece band led by guitarist Dori Amarilio. The rotating group of musicians \u2014 a few of them Grammy winners \u2014 arrive not knowing what they will be playing that night. Some singers bring sheet music, others chord charts. And there are those who just hum a few bars and allow the musicians to intuit the key and melody enough to follow along. Poet Judy Barrat, a regular attendee, usually hands the evening\u2019s piano player a copy of the poem she\u2019ll be reading and asks him to improv along with her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally freeform,\u201d said Andy Langham, a jazz pianist who toured with Natalie Cole and Christopher Cross and often plays the Gardenia. \u201cI read the stanzas and try to paint pictures with the notes.\u201d\nThe Gardenia, which opened in 1981, is one of the few venues in L.A. specifically designed for the intimacy of cabaret. The small, spare room has table service seating for just over 60 patrons and a stage area beautifully lit by an abundance of canned lights. Doors open at 7 p.m. on Tuesday nights, but those in the know line up outside the building\u2019s nondescript exterior as early as 6 p.m. to ensure a reasonable spot on the night\u2019s roster of singers. (Even though there is a one-song-per-person limit, the night has been known to stretch past 12 a.m.) Nichole Rice, who manages the Gardenia, takes dinner and drink orders until the show starts at 8:30 p.m. Then the room falls into respectful silence.\n\u201cThis is a listening room,\u201d said singer-songwriter Steve Brock, who has been attending the open mic night for more than a decade. \u201cI\u2019ve been to other rooms where I\u2019m competing with tequila or the Rams. Here, when anyone goes up in front of that microphone, everyone stops.\u201d\nOn a recent Tuesday night, the show began as it always does"

The Japanese currency has come under pressure as expectations receded that the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut its policy interest rate in December.
