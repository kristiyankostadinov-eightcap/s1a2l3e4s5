                "body": "The price of gold was trading at $4,400 per ounce as of 9:15 a.m. Eastern Time today. That\u2019s a $3 decrease from yesterday and a $1,794 increase from a year ago.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an investment that is not tied directly to the variance of inflation, gold may be the right choice. In general, gold as an asset is typically expected to increase in value over time. One of the most common ways to purchase and manage gold is through a gold IRA, which can serve as a steadying force in a portfolio amid volatile markets. This may also be a good choice for those who want to invest in gold without the challenge of having to make storage arrangements for physical gold bullion.\nHistorical gold price chart\nGold is not always a home run investment. In a strong economy, stocks can perform better in the short and long term. From 1971 to 2024, the stock market delivered average annual returns of 10.7%. Gold delivered an average annual return of 7.9% over the same period.\nHowever, during times of economic uncertainty, gold is a solid option as a risk-averse investment. For this reason, some may prefer to think of it as a store of value as opposed to an investment in the way that stocks and bonds are.\nWhat does \u201cspot gold\u201d mean?\nThe spot gold price is the price to buy or sell gold immediately in an over-the-counter trade. This is an effective way for investors to monitor the demands and trends of gold investment at that time. Simply stated, a higher spot gold price means there is higher demand for gold in the marketplace. Notably, unlike futures contracts, the spot price is for an immediate sale.\nWhen the future price is higher than the spot price, it is called contango. This is common when investing in commodities that have a high storage cost. When the futures price is lower than the spot price, it is called backwardation.\nThere are plenty of different factors that can impact the spot price, which is why that figure is constantly shifting up and down. Those looking to invest in gold need to be able to deal with this level of price fluctuation.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for December 25, 2025.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.18% for December 25, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for December 25, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for December 25, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for December 25, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for December 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of platinum for December 29, 2025.\nWhat is price spread in gold trading?\nA price spread is the difference between an asset\u2019s offered purchase price vs. the price offered to sell it.\nSimilarly, in gold investing, the two key terms are ask price and bid price. The ask price is how much it costs to buy the gold, while the bid price is how much it can be sold for. Bid prices are always lower than ask prices.\nThe lower the spread between these two prices, the more liquid the market is. If there is a relatively small spread, that means the demand for gold is on the rise.\nHow to invest in gold\nIf investing in gold immediately leads to an image of Scrooge McDuck olympic diving into a pile of coins, that\u2019s only half right. While there are opportunities to buy physical gold bars, coins or jewelry, gold is often traded as exchange-traded funds (ETF).\nJames Taska, a fee-based financial advisor, said, \u201cThere is a great debate as to whether paper gold is as useful as the physical. From a financial advisor\u2019s viewpoint, it is much easier to rebalance a client\u2019s allocation of gold if it is owned as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the spread when attempting to buy/sell gold can be quite variable and wide.\u201d\nSome of the most common ways to invest in gold include:\n- Gold bars: Often referred to as bullion, this is a popular gold investing method. Offered on a per gram or ounce basis, other qualities including purity, weight, and manufacturer are typically st"

                "body": "Surging silver and gold slide after CME raises margin requirements\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Silver and gold futures fell sharply Monday after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest trading floors for commodities, asked traders to put up more cash to make bets on precious metals with prices surging this year.\nThis year, gold futures are up 65% and silver has more than doubled.\nThe CME raised margin requirements for gold, silver and other metals in a notice posted to the exchange\u2019s website Friday. These notices require traders to put up more cash on their bets in order to insure against the possibility that the trader will default when they take delivery of the contract.\nExchanges sometimes boost margin requirements when a commodity or other security goes on a significant run. In its notice, the CME said it was raising margin requirements \u201cper the normal review of market volatility.\u201d\nSilver futures tumbled 8% early Monday while gold slid 5%\nSilver prices have skyrocketed this year, topping records dating back to the early 1980s when traders tried and failed to corner the silver market. Supplies have dwindled, with production at major mines slowing. At the same time there\u2019s been an increased industrial need for silver for solar panels as well as data centers.\nSilver futures were roughly $30 an ounce at the beginning of 2025, and briefly touched $80 an ounce before the CME\u2019s announcement.\nGold futures have risen due in part to geopolitical uncertainty and fears that a bubble is forming in some stock markets.\nThe new requirements for traders dragged down almost all major goldminers as well on Monday. Newmont, the world\u2019s largest goldminer, was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500, falling 6%. Smaller goldminers like Vista and Anglogold and Gold Fields, fell even more sharply. ."

                "body": "Gold\u2019s late-year rally has accelerated in December 2025, with spot prices holding firmly above the $4,200\u2013$4,300 zone as traders recalibrate expectations for US interest rates, the dollar, and global risk. In the space of a few sessions, the market has digested a Federal Reserve rate cut, a fresh warning from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) about \u201cexplosive\u201d price behavior in both US equities and gold, and a surge in silver that many analysts say is pulling precious metals higher as a complex. Bank for International Settlements+3Federal Reserve+3Reuters+3\nSo what\u2019s the most realistic gold price forecast for the rest of December 2025\u2014and what would it take for XAU/USD to break to new highs or slip into a sharper pullback before year-end?\nWhere gold stands in mid-December 2025\nGold has spent the second week of December grinding higher and testing levels last seen in late October. On Friday, December 12, spot gold rose to about $4,293 per ounce after touching a seven-week high earlier in the session, while US gold futures settled around $4,328. Reuters\nThat move followed a strong post-Fed reaction earlier in the week. On Thursday, December 11, Reuters reported spot gold up about 1.2% near $4,280, its highest level since October 21, with the US dollar sliding to an eight-week low\u2014conditions that typically support dollar-priced commodities like gold. Reuters\nFrom a weekly-technical perspective, FXStreet\u2019s weekly note said gold added roughly 3% over the week, briefly flirting with the $4,350 area before settling around $4,330. FXStreet\nThe biggest December driver: the Fed cut rates\u2014by 25 bps, but with a split vote\nThe macro catalyst that mattered most for gold this month was the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy decision.\nOn December 10, the Fed cut the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50%\u20133.75%, while noting inflation \u201cremains somewhat elevated\u201d and emphasizing it would assess incoming data and risks when considering further moves. Federal Reserve\nImportantly for market psychology, the decision wasn\u2019t unanimous. The Fed statement shows three dissenters: one favored a larger 50 bps cut, while two preferred no change. That kind of split can increase uncertainty\u2014and uncertainty often helps keep safe-haven bids alive in gold. Federal Reserve\nFXStreet\u2019s coverage echoed the same core takeaway: the Fed delivered the widely expected 25 bps cut to 3.50%\u20133.75%, but the voting split and forward-looking uncertainty kept traders focused on what happens next rather than treating the move as \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d FXStreet\nWhy rate cuts matter for gold (and why this cut didn\u2019t end the debate)\nGold doesn\u2019t pay interest. That\u2019s why it often benefits when interest rates (and especially real yields) are falling, because the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of holding bullion declines.\nReuters\u2019 December 12 market wrap captured the current narrative: the Fed delivered its third quarter-point cut of the year, but signaled caution on further easing until more data arrives\u2014leaving traders to keep repricing the path of policy rather than locking in a single scenario. Reuters\nThe result is a market that can still move sharply on each major data print\u2014because the direction of yields and the dollar can shift quickly if traders believe the Fed is done cutting, or conversely, if they see a faster easing cycle ahead.\nThe new complicating factor: BIS warns of \u201cexplosive\u201d behavior in gold and US equities\nIn the last few days, the most talked-about \u201crisk\u201d headline for gold hasn\u2019t been geopolitical\u2014it\u2019s been valuation and positioning.\nOn December 8, BIS published analysis noting that a statistical test frequently used to detect \u201cexplosive\u201d price behavior suggests both the S&P 500 and gold have entered \u201cexplosive territory\u201d in recent months\u2014something the BIS says has happened simultaneously only once in at least the last 50 years. Bank for International Settlements\nThe BIS also stresses a key nuance that matters for anyone using the \u201cbu"

The stock traded between $91.70 and $92.72, with about 5.3 million shares changing hands.\nThe move matters now because year-end trading has been dominated by commodity swings and geopolitical headlines, with thinner liquidity amplifying sector moves. The S&P 500 and other major U.S. indexes finished lower on Monday, even as oil-linked names held up better than the market. Reuters\nOil settled more than $1 a barrel higher after Russia accused Ukraine of targeting President Vladimir Putin\u2019s residence, while tensions in Yemen kept supply-disruption risks in focus. Brent settled at $61.94 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) \u2014 the main U.S. crude benchmark \u2014 ended at $58.08, Reuters reported. Reuters\nOil prices eased slightly early Tuesday after the previous session\u2019s jump, but traders remained focused on supply-risk headlines and the 2026 balance. \u201cPrice direction is likely lower going into Q1 of 2026 as there is a growing oil glut on the market,\u201d Marex analyst Ed Meir said. Reuters\nA delayed weekly report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed crude inventories rose by 405,000 barrels to 424.8 million in the week ended Dec. 19. Gasoline inventories jumped 2.86 million barrels, while stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma \u2014 the delivery point for WTI futures \u2014 rose by 707,000 barrels, the EIA said. Reuters\nOutside the U.S. market close, ConocoPhillips also drew attention in Australia after partner 3D Energi said drilling at the Charlemont-1 exploration well was temporarily paused following significant gas shows above the primary target. ConocoPhillips Australia is the operator evaluating potential adjustments to the well design and holds a 51% operating interest, the ASX update showed. Company Announcements\nConocoPhillips\u2019 gains came alongside strength in other large oil producers, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, as crude prices rallied. MarketWatch\nFor investors, the near-term debate is whether geopolitics keeps a risk premium in crude, or whether expectations for looser supply-demand conditions push oil lower into early 2026. That matters for ConocoPhillips because it is an upstream producer \u2014 meaning its results tend to move with oil and gas prices more directly than refiners or pipeline operators.\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s session, traders will be watching whether COP can hold near Monday\u2019s range if crude remains firm, or whether a softer oil tape pulls the group back. Monday\u2019s high and low levels are likely to remain the first reference points for short-term positioning.\nThe next company-specific catalyst comes Feb. 5, when ConocoPhillips is set to release fourth-quarter 2025 results before the market opens and host a webcast at noon ET covering 2026 guidance items, the company said. ConocoPhillips\nInvestors typically zero in on production volumes, capital spending plans and shareholder returns on that call, along with any commentary on how management is planning around commodity prices. Until then, crude moves and inventory headlines are likely to keep COP trading in tandem with the oil market."

Gasoline inventories jumped 2.86 million barrels, while stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma \u2014 the delivery point for WTI futures \u2014 rose by 707,000 barrels, the EIA said. Reuters\nOutside the U.S. market close, ConocoPhillips also drew attention in Australia after partner 3D Energi said drilling at the Charlemont-1 exploration well was temporarily paused following significant gas shows above the primary target. ConocoPhillips Australia is the operator evaluating potential adjustments to the well design and holds a 51% operating interest, the ASX update showed. Company Announcements\nConocoPhillips\u2019 gains came alongside strength in other large oil producers, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, as crude prices rallied. MarketWatch\nFor investors, the near-term debate is whether geopolitics keeps a risk premium in crude, or whether expectations for looser supply-demand conditions push oil lower into early 2026. That matters for ConocoPhillips because it is an upstream producer \u2014 meaning its results tend to move with oil and gas prices more directly than refiners or pipeline operators.\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s session, traders will be watching whether COP can hold near Monday\u2019s range if crude remains firm, or whether a softer oil tape pulls the group back. Monday\u2019s high and low levels are likely to remain the first reference points for short-term positioning.\nThe next company-specific catalyst comes Feb. 5, when ConocoPhillips is set to release fourth-quarter 2025 results before the market opens and host a webcast at noon ET covering 2026 guidance items, the company said. ConocoPhillips\nInvestors typically zero in on production volumes, capital spending plans and shareholder returns on that call, along with any commentary on how management is planning around commodity prices. Until then, crude moves and inventory headlines are likely to keep COP trading in tandem with the oil market."

The pair remains steady as US Dollar (USD) moves little amid market caution ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes due later in the day, which could offer insights into the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) 2026 outlook.\nThe EUR/USD pair may gain ground as the Greenback faces challenges amid ongoing expectations of two more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026. The CME FedWatch tool shows an 83.9% probability of rates being held at the Fed\u2019s January meeting, up from 80.1% a week earlier. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut has fallen to 16.1% from 19.9% a week ago.\nThe US central bank lowered interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at the December meeting, bringing the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. The Fed delivered a cumulative 75 bps of rate cuts in 2025 amid a cooling labor market and still-elevated inflation.\nThe Euro (EUR) may face challenges as risk sentiment increases due to the uncertain Ukraine-Russia situation. Russia\u2019s foreign minister said Moscow\u2019s negotiating stance would shift following alleged strikes on President Vladimir Putin\u2019s residence.\nHowever, the downside of the Euro could be restrained as markets reflect diverging policy paths between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve. The ECB held rates steady in December and signaled they are likely to remain unchanged for some time, with President Christine Lagarde noting that elevated uncertainty makes forward guidance on future rate moves difficult.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, "

                "body": "Concurrently, the European Central Bank (ECB) has opted to maintain interest rates. They have adopted a cautious approach, reacting to macroeconomic data as it emerges.\nEuropean Central Bank\u2019s Cautious Approach\nData indicators, including inflation, GDP, and trade balance, are pertinent to the Euro\u2019s valuation. Strong economic performance can enhance the Euro\u2019s appeal to foreign investments, influencing monetary decisions by the ECB.\nWe are watching the EUR/USD pair hold firm near 1.1770 as the market anticipates more rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central bank\u2019s reduction of 75 basis points throughout 2025 has put significant pressure on the dollar. The upcoming release of the FOMC minutes today will be the key driver for currency movements heading into the new year.\nThe Fed\u2019s dovish stance is a response to a cooling U.S. economy, where November\u2019s unemployment rate edged up to 4.0%. Although the most recent inflation report showed the Consumer Price Index at a slightly elevated 3.1%, the Fed appears more focused on supporting the job market. This suggests the path of least resistance for the dollar is downward, creating a favorable environment for the euro.\nIn contrast, the European Central Bank is maintaining a steady policy, holding its key interest rate at 4.00%.\nECB\u2019s Policy and Economic Impact\nWith Eurozone inflation proving sticky at 3.5% in the latest Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices reading, the ECB is not in a position to consider cuts. This policy divergence between a cutting Fed and a holding ECB is the main factor supporting a higher EUR/USD exchange rate.\nGiven this outlook, we believe a prudent strategy involves using options to position for further euro strength while managing risk. Buying EUR/USD call options with strike prices around 1.1850 or 1.1900 for expiration in January or February 2026 allows for profiting from a potential rally. This approach limits potential losses to the premium paid, which is valuable during thin holiday trading.\nHowever, we must acknowledge the risk posed by surprisingly strong U.S. economic data, like the recent Pending Home Sales report which hit its highest level since February 2023. If today\u2019s FOMC minutes reveal a less unified front on future rate cuts, the dollar could see a sharp, albeit likely temporary, recovery. This reinforces the appeal of using options with defined risk rather than holding outright long positions."

                "body": "Itai Smidt | Dec 29, 2025 02:15PM ET\nThe EUR/USD rate is trading around 1.1760\u20131.1780 after failing to extend above the 1.1800\u20131.1808 zone last week. Price is digesting a strong December rally in ultra-thin year-end liquidity. On the macro side, three Fed cuts in 2025 have pushed the funds rate down to 3.50%\u20133.75%, with futures still pricing two to three additional cuts in 2026. That path keeps real yields under pressure and, structurally, caps the USD on rallies.\nAt the same time, markets are reacting to mixed geopolitical headlines. Trump\u2019s comments that a Ukraine peace deal is \u201ca lot closer\u201d help the EUR through reduced war risk in Europe, but escalation around China\u2013Taiwan lifts safe-haven demand into the USD. Add Trump\u2019s renewed global tariff push and looming recession chatter, and EUR/USD is caught between a softer rates backdrop and periodic risk-off spikes that temporarily support the dollar. Thin holiday volumes amplify every headline, which is why a 30\u201340-pip swing around 1.1760 can happen on relatively modest news flow.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) trades close to 98.00\u201398.10, stabilizing after bouncing from 97.73\u201397.80 support. Technically, the 2-hour chart shows a fragile recovery: the 50-EMA sits near 98.12 and acts as first resistance, while the 100-EMA around 98.55\u201398.60 is the more important ceiling. The move is also capped by the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the prior downswing around 98.12, which is why upside attempts stall in that area.\nIf DXY can push through 98.25, the next magnet is 98.55, and above that a squeeze toward 99.00 cannot be ruled out. Failure to clear 98.25 keeps the door open for another retest of 97.75. For EUR/USD, a DXY rejection at 98.25\u201398.55 supports a rebound back above 1.1800, while a clean break higher in the index would pressure the pair toward 1.1700 and potentially lower.\nThe EUR remains underpinned by a relatively less dovish ECB versus a Fed that has already cut 75 bps in 2025 and is signalling further easing in 2026. Markets still expect at least two Fed cuts next year, while the ECB is moving more cautiously. This policy divergence is why EUR/USD is still trading near a three-month high just above 1.1800, despite a firm DXY around 98.00.\nEurozone growth is far from impressive, but the combination of slower US labour markets, a 4.3% annualised US GDP that markets see as unsustainable, and persistent political risk in the US keeps medium-term pressure on the USD. That backdrop makes deep EUR/USD dips toward 1.1700 more likely to attract buyers rather than trigger a trend reversal, unless macro data or the Fed narrative shifts decisively back toward tighter policy.\nSpot EUR/USD has declined for four consecutive sessions, sliding from a peak just above 1.1800 (around 1.1805\u20131.1808) to the current 1.1760 area. This is a controlled pullback, not a collapse. The pair is still trading inside an ascending channel on both the 2-hour and 4-hour charts.\nOn the 2-hour view, buyers are actively defending the lower boundary of that channel around 1.1750. Every dip into the 1.1750\u20131.1760 band meets demand, confirming it as short-term support. On the 4-hour chart, the retracement looks like a classic pause after a strong rally rather than the start of a new downtrend. As long as the pair stays above 1.1750, the path of least resistance remains higher.\nThe daily chart for EUR/USD still leans bullish despite the pullback. Price is holding above the nine-day EMA, now rising through 1.1757, and the 50-day EMA at 1.1673. The nine-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA, a configuration that usually indicates a healthy uptrend, with the faster average acting as dynamic support.\nMomentum indicators confirm that view. The 14-day RSI sits near 63.9, above the 50 midline, down from overbought levels but still comfortably in bullish territory. This shift from above 70 to the low 60s is exactly what you want in an uptrend that is cooling its momentum without breaking. The pair is also sitting on an ascending tr"

This movement coincides with anticipations of two more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026.\nAttention is drawn towards the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes, set to be released on Tuesday, providing insights into the Fed\u2019s 2026 policy projections. The US central bank reduced the federal funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, adjusting the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%.\nMarket Expectations\nThe CME FedWatch tool currently indicates an 81.7% chance of rates being maintained at the Fed\u2019s January meeting, an increase from 77.9% the previous week. Meanwhile, the possibility of a 25-basis-point rate cut has decreased to 18.3% from 22.1%.\nRecent US labour market data presented mixed outcomes, with Initial Jobless Claims falling to 214K, surpassing the 223K forecast. Conversely, Continuing Jobless Claims increased to 1.923 million, while the four-week average of Initial Claims slightly declined to 216.75K.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) reduced its policy rate by 25 bps to 3.75%, amid ongoing inflation concerns. Inflation dropped to 3.2% in November, but remained above the BoE\u2019s 2% target, with UK GDP growing by 0.1% in Q3.\nGiven the current situation on December 29, 2025, the primary focus for us is the diverging outlook between the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The market is pricing in more aggressive Fed rate cuts for 2026, which is weighing on the US Dollar and pushing GBP/USD higher. We should position for continued, albeit potentially volatile, upside in the pair.\nThe Fed\u2019s dovish stance is supported by cooling inflation and a softening, yet not collapsing, labor market. With US Core PCE inflation, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge, having fallen to 3.1% in November 2025, the 75 basis points of cuts delivered this year appear justified. The upcoming FOMC minutes are critical, as they will reveal how deep the consensus runs for further easing in 2026.\nBank of England\u2019s Stance\nConversely, the Bank of England is in a tougher spot, making Sterling the more attractive currency for now. The close 5-4 vote for their rate cut earlier this month highlights significant concern over UK inflation, which at 3.2% remains stubbornly above target amid flat economic growth. This internal division suggests the BoE\u2019s path to further cuts will be much slower and more cautious than the Fed\u2019s.\nFor derivative traders, this points toward buying GBP/USD call options, perhaps targeting strikes around the 1.3650 level for the coming weeks. This strategy allows us to capture potential upside while defining our maximum risk. The premium paid is the most we can lose if the dollar unexpectedly strengthens.\nWe should also consider that key data releases, like the FOMC minutes tomorrow, could increase short-term volatility. The mixed signals from recent US jobless claims data show the economic picture is not perfectly clear. Therefore, for those less certain of direction, buying a short-dated straddle could be a viable strategy to profit from a large price move in either direction.\nLooking back, we can see parallels to the 2010-2012 period, where currencies backed by even slightly less dovish central banks tended to outperform. The current dynamic, with the BoE constrained by inflation while the Fed has more room to cut, fits this historical pattern. This reinforces the view that the path of least resistance for GBP/USD is likely higher moving into early 2026."

The Pound Sterling (GBP) strengthens against the US Dollar (USD) as the Bank of England (BoE) guided that monetary policy will remain on a gradual downward path.\nThe UK central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75% at its December meeting. Governor Andrew Bailey said during the press conference that rates are likely to continue on a gradual downward path, but \"how much further we go becomes a closer call\" with each cut. Money markets believe the BoE will deliver at least one rate cut in the first half of the year and are pricing in nearly a 50% probability of a second before the year-end, according to Reuters.\nTraders continue to price in the prospect of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026, following a quarter-point reduction delivered at the December meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes will be published later on Tuesday. Trading volumes are expected to remain thin ahead of the New Year holidays.\nTechnical Analysis:\nIn the daily chart, GBP/USD holds well above the rising 100-day EMA at 1.3335, preserving a bullish profile. It also remains north of the 20-day average, underscoring trend support. RSI (14) sits at 69.87 near overbought. The upper Bollinger Band at 1.3550 caps the immediate advance. A daily close above that barrier would extend the climb, while the bias stays bullish above the EMA.\nBollinger Bands have narrowed modestly as price holds just beneath the upper band, signaling reduced volatility alongside persistent buying pressure. Initial support aligns with the 20-day middle band at 1.3410, followed by the lower band at 1.3270. A pullback into the mid-band would meet buyers, while a break lower could expose the lower boundary and slow the uptrend\u2019s momentum.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool)\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling.

The currency pair is steady as markets consider the differing rate approaches of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England (BoE) amid lower liquidity during the holiday period.\nThe Pound shows little support despite expectations of BoE\u2019s gradual monetary easing in 2026. UK inflation, which was 3.2% in November, remains above the 2% target but has eased from its July to September peak of 3.8%. The BoE recently lowered interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75%, although further cuts appear limited as rates near a neutral level.\nEconomic Growth and Rate Expectations\nThe BoE expects near-flat growth as the UK GDP increased by 0.1% in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the US Dollar is slightly rebounding, with expectations for a quicker easing cycle from the Fed next year. The CME FedWatch tool indicates a 70% chance of at least 50 basis points of cumulative rate cuts.\nThe Fed\u2019s projections suggest limited cuts by 2026 with the Federal Funds Rate around 3.4%, contrasting with market expectations. Speculation on US monetary policy has increased due to President Trump\u2019s comments favouring lower rates, with attention now on the upcoming FOMC Minutes release.\nThe percentage changes of the British Pound against various currencies show it was strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nDiverging Monetary Policies\nAs we head into the new year, the primary focus is on the diverging paths of the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. With GBP/USD consolidating around 1.3490 in thin holiday trading, this divergence will likely create opportunities in the coming weeks. The key is to position for a potentially stronger pound against a dollar weighed down by expectations of faster rate cuts.\nThe Bank of England\u2019s caution is justified by inflation that, while easing to 3.2%, remains stubbornly above target. We remember the inflation shock of 2022-2023, and that memory is forcing the BoE to be gradual, as shown by their recent narrow five-to-four vote to cut rates. This slow pace of easing should provide underlying support for the pound, especially as UK wage growth, last reported by the ONS at 5.7%, continues to add to domestic price pressures.\nConversely, the market is aggressively pricing in Fed rate cuts for 2026, anticipating at least 50 basis points of easing. This sentiment persists despite the Fed\u2019s own projections suggesting a much shallower cutting cycle. This tension between market expectation and official guidance is a weak point for the dollar, especially after we saw US Core PCE, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, fall to an annual rate of 2.8% in November 2025, giving doves more ammunition.\nGiven this setup, we should consider strategies that benefit from potential GBP strength against the USD. Buying GBP/USD call options or call spreads for late January or February 2026 could be an effective way to play a potential breakout above 1.3500 with defined risk. Implied volatility may be relatively low during this holiday period, making options an attractive tool before the first major data releases of the new year.\nThe immediate catalyst will be the FOMC minutes released this Tuesday, which will be scrutinized for any signs of a dovish shift among policymakers. We should look for any discussion that validates the market\u2019s aggressive rate-cut pricing over the Fed\u2019s official dot plot. Following that, the first US and UK inflation reports in mid-January will be critical in either confirming or challenging the current policy divergence narrative."

                "body": "AUD/USD stalled at the beginning of the final trading week of 2025, falling below 0.6700 as market activity slowed down during the holiday period. Despite this, core influences are expected to remain stable moving into 2026, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) set to increase interest rates, supporting the Australian Dollar, while the Federal Reserve appears to lean towards more dovish policies.\nInterest rate differentials between the RBA and the Federal Reserve are expected to extend further, potentially boosting the Australian Dollar and weakening the US Dollar. The Federal Reserve\u2019s latest Meeting Minutes are in focus, with rate markets predicting at least two interest rate cuts from the Fed by September, aligning with the Fed\u2019s dot plot that suggests moderate easing over the next two years.\nFactors Influencing The Australian Dollar\nThe Australian Dollar is influenced by several factors, including RBA interest rates, the price of iron ore, the health of the Chinese economy, and Australia\u2019s trade balance. High interest rates and positive trade balances tend to support the AUD, while weak Chinese economic performance or falling iron ore prices can negatively affect it. Moreover, Australia\u2019s robust export market, particularly in iron ore to China, plays a role in the currency\u2019s valuation.\nThe widening gap between central bank policies is the main story for us right now. The RBA is holding its cash rate firm at 4.85% to fight inflation, while the Fed just cut its rate to a 4.25-4.50% range. This policy split strongly suggests the Aussie dollar will outperform the greenback as we head into 2026.\nRecent data backs this view, with US job growth in November 2025 slowing to just 95,000 and core PCE inflation cooling to 2.5%. In contrast, Australia\u2019s Q3 2025 CPI was a hot 3.8%, giving the RBA every reason to maintain its hawkish stance. This fundamental economic data is what\u2019s driving the expected currency move.\nWe should consider buying AUD/USD call options with expirations in late February or March 2026 to capitalize on the expected rally. This strategy offers a defined risk while providing exposure to significant upside potential once trading volumes return in January. Strike prices around the 0.6750 or 0.6800 level could offer a good balance of probability and reward.\nCommodity Prices And Their Impact\nThe outlook is further supported by strong commodity prices, as iron ore continues to trade above $130 per tonne. This strength comes from China\u2019s recent efforts to stimulate its economy, boosting demand for Australia\u2019s key export. A healthy commodity market provides a solid foundation for the Aussie dollar\u2019s strength.\nThis setup feels familiar, reminding us of the 2009-2011 period when a similar policy divergence occurred. Back then, the RBA\u2019s aggressive rate hikes following the global financial crisis sent the AUD/USD soaring while the Fed was easing. History suggests that when these conditions align, the trend can be powerful and sustained."

The Aussie pair gives back its intraday gains as the Australian Dollar (AUD) faces profit-booking after rallying for weeks, with the US Dollar (USD) trading broadly calm.\nAustralian Dollar Price This Month\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies this month. Australian Dollar was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Australian Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent AUD (base)/USD (quote).\nThe AUD has outperformed in past few weeks amid growing expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could raise interest rates in 2026. RBA hawkish expectations are backed by rising Australian inflationary pressures. Australian monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) rises at a faster pace of 3.8% year-on-year (YoY) in October.\nAs of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades flat around 98.00.\nThe US Dollar flattens ahead of the release of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes on Tuesday. Investors will pay close attention to the FOMC minutes to get fresh cues on the United States (US) interest rate outlook.\nIn the policy meeting, the Fed reduced interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75% and signaled that there will be only one in the entire 2026. On the contrary, the CME FedWatch tool shows the odds of the Fed reducing interest rates at least 50 bps in 2026 are 73.3%.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting fo"

                "body": "USD/JPY weakened as the Japanese Yen gained strength after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) hinted at policy tightening in 2026. The pair dipped close to 156.00, following the BoJ\u2019s December meeting summary, which showed members supporting gradual rate hikes due to ultra-low real rates and inflation risks linked to foreign exchange.\nOne BoJ member advocated for steady rate increases to stay ahead of economic trends, while another highlighted Japan\u2019s low real policy rate. Additionally, government stimulus and positive real wage growth were discussed for the coming years. Meanwhile, USD faced pressures with prospects of the Federal Reserve (Fed) implementing two rate cuts in 2026.\nThe Fed and Interest Rates\nThe Fed recently cut interest rates by 25 basis points in December, targeting a range of 3.50%\u20133.75%, after a cumulative 75 basis points reduction in 2025. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there is an 81.7% probability of rates being maintained at the Fed\u2019s upcoming January meeting, with an 18.3% chance of a rate cut.\nThese developments underscore the evolving economic landscape and shifting currency values, highlighting the ongoing intricacies within financial markets. The Japanese Yen, in particular, is influenced by the BoJ\u2019s policies, bond yield differentials, and broader risk sentiments.\nWith the Bank of Japan signaling a tighter policy for 2026, we are seeing the fundamental driver for a strong dollar against the yen begin to weaken. This shift comes as the Federal Reserve is expected to continue its rate-cutting cycle, which began with the 75 basis points of cuts delivered during 2025. The USD/JPY pair is already reacting, trading around 156.20 and showing signs of further downward pressure.\nThe interest rate differential, a key factor for the pair, is actively narrowing and supports this outlook. We\u2019ve seen the spread between the US 10-year Treasury yield, now at 3.6%, and the 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield, which has risen to 1.1%, shrink by over 100 basis points in the past year. This compression reduces the appeal of carrying the US Dollar over the Japanese Yen, suggesting the path of least resistance is lower for the currency pair.\nStrategies in Current Market Conditions\nFor options traders, this environment points toward buying put options on USD/JPY to position for a continued decline. Given the clear directional bias, strategies like put spreads could also be effective to reduce the upfront cost of the trade. The increasing policy uncertainty has also pushed one-month implied volatility to a six-month high of 11.2%, making options pricing a critical factor in strategy selection.\nThose trading futures should consider establishing short positions, targeting a move below the psychological 155.00 level in the coming weeks. The consensus view is strengthening around a weaker dollar, especially since Japan\u2019s core inflation has remained above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for over 20 consecutive months, last reported at 2.7% for November 2025. This persistent inflation gives the BoJ a clear mandate to continue its path toward policy normalization.\nHowever, we must remain cautious ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes due this Tuesday. Any surprisingly hawkish details in the minutes could challenge the narrative of two more rate cuts in 2026 and cause a sharp, albeit likely temporary, rebound in USD/JPY. The CME FedWatch tool already shows the probability of a January rate hold has firmed to over 81%, so the market is sensitive to any shifts in Fed sentiment."

The Summary of Opinions published today reaffirmed the tightening bias, with one member stating that further increases are needed to \"avoid falling behind the curve\" and another noting that there remains a \"considerable distance to the neutral\". [2]\nThe central bank retains scope for further tightening as core inflation remains well above the 2% target, while elevated wage growth is expected to persist into the next fiscal year. In addition, the US-Japan trade agreement to lower tariffs and the government's sizeable fiscal stimulus could support the economy.\nThis hawkish bias is supporting the yen, alongside recent currency intervention warnings from Japanese officials. These include comments from the Finance Minister, who stated that \"we are always ready to act\" in a Bloomberg interview last week [3]. Meanwhile, the USDOLLAR is weighed down by the Fed's December rate cut and its easing bias [4], as the US economy and labour market face tariff-related headwinds.\nThese monetary policy dynamics are pressuring USD/JPY, leaving the pair vulnerable to a break below the 200-day EMA, which would challenge the upside momentum. However, the downside appears technically well protected, with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the ascending trendline from the September lows following. This creates scope for a recovery and keeps the 2025 peak in play.\nThe Bank of Japan may have raised rates but maintained its slow and gradual approach, while economic headwinds may limit the extent of further tightening. Moreover, the US central bank remains on a cautious easing path, with the latest Summary of Economic Projections pointing to just one rate cut in 2026.\nNikos Tzabouras\nSenior Financial Editorial Writer\nNikos Tzabouras is a graduate of the Department of International & European Economic Studies at the Athens University of Economics and Business.

In 2025, the Fed delivered three interest rate cuts of quarter-to-a-percent.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation. The BoJ\u2019s policy led to a widening differential with other currencies, dragging down the value of the Yen. This trend partly reversed in 2024, when the BoJ decided to abandon its ultra-loose policy stance.\nA weaker Yen and the spike in global energy prices led to an increase in Japanese inflation, which exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. The prospect of rising salaries in the country \u2013 a key element fuelling inflation \u2013 also contributed to the move.\nAuthor\nSaga"

Uncertainty also returned over efforts to end the war in Ukraine after alleged strikes on President Putin\u2019s residence.\nAdditionally, Saudi air strikes in Yemen and Iran\u2019s declaration of a \u201cfull-scale war\u201d with the United States (US), Europe, and Israel have heightened fears of wider instability, while Trump warned of further strikes if Iran resumes rebuilding its nuclear programme.\nTraders interpreted recent Bank of Canada (BoC) communications as noncommittal on further tightening, with a growing bias toward holding rates steady or potentially cutting next year, adding to downward pressure on the Canadian dollar (CAD) as expectations for additional hikes fade.\nThe USD/CAD pair struggles as the US Dollar (USD) faces challenges amid ongoing expectations of two more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026. Traders are likely to focus on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) December Meeting Minutes due later in the day.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative "

                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/trading-around-1-3680-usd-cad-faces-challenges-beneath-1-3700-while-oil-boosts-the-canadian-dollar/",
                "body": "The USD/CAD currency pair faces difficulties trading below 1.3700 as the Canadian dollar gains strength from stable Oil prices. During Asian trading hours, the USD/CAD was around 1.3680, influenced by Canada\u2019s position as a leading crude supplier to the US.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil prices held steady, trading at about $57.80, following a 1.6% gain in the prior session. Geopolitical tensions, including Venezuela\u2019s Oil shutdowns and Ukraine\u2019s ongoing conflict, contribute to the currency dynamics.\nInterest Rates And USD CAD\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s recent communications suggest a likelihood of maintaining current interest rates, impacting the CAD negatively. Meanwhile, expectations surround the Federal Reserve\u2019s potential rate cuts in 2026, which could further influence the USD/CAD pair.\nSeveral factors such as interest rates, Oil prices, and Canada\u2019s economic health drive the Canadian dollar. The Bank of Canada aims to maintain inflation between 1-3% by adjusting rates, with higher rates usually benefiting the CAD.\nOil prices also affect CAD value significantly, with rises generally leading to increased demand for the currency. Economic indicators like GDP and unemployment rates further influence the currency\u2019s strength.\nWith USD/CAD holding below the 1.3700 level, the main driver is the strength in oil prices, which directly supports the Canadian dollar. West Texas Intermediate crude is holding firm around $82 a barrel, bolstered by the recent OPEC+ decision in early December 2025 to maintain production cuts into the new year. This price stability provides a strong floor for the loonie.\nGeopolitical Tensions And Oil Prices\nGeopolitical tensions continue to place a risk premium on crude oil, preventing any significant price drops that would weaken the Canadian dollar. We are seeing continued supply concerns from Venezuela and persistent instability in the Middle East. These factors are likely to keep oil prices supported well into the first quarter of 2026.\nOn the other side of the pair, we see developing weakness in the US dollar as markets anticipate a more dovish Federal Reserve. We\u2019ve seen US inflation cool, with the November 2025 CPI data showing a drop to 2.8%, moving closer to the Fed\u2019s target. This reinforces the market\u2019s pricing of at least two interest rate cuts in 2026.\nHere in Canada, a similar cooling trend is evident, though inflation remains a bit sticky at 3.1%, giving the Bank of Canada reason to pause. This neutral stance from the BoC, when contrasted with an expectedly dovish Fed, creates a fundamentally bearish outlook for the USD/CAD pair. Looking back, this is a very different policy environment than the aggressive hiking cycle we saw from both central banks in 2022 and 2023.\nGiven the market\u2019s focus on the FOMC minutes later today, we are seeing elevated implied volatility in USD/CAD options. This suggests options are pricing in a significant move, but the direction depends entirely on the Fed\u2019s tone. A confirmation of a dovish outlook could cause volatility to collapse and the pair to drift lower.\nFor the coming weeks, selling call spreads with a strike price above the 1.3750 resistance level could be a viable strategy to capitalize on the range-bound price action and high volatility. This approach profits if the pair stays below that key level. Alternatively, traders could wait for the post-announcement volatility crush to establish longer-term bearish positions at a better price."

                "body": "Over the past five trading sessions, USD/CAD price action has maintained a consistent bearish bias, leading the pair to post a short-term decline of close to 1% as the final market oscillations of 2025 approach. Selling pressure has remained firm, largely because indecision around U.S. interest rate policy has allowed a structural weakness in the U.S. dollar to persist. This environment has supported a steady appreciation of the Canadian dollar. As long as this perception of U.S. dollar weakness remains in place, USD/CAD is likely to continue exhibiting a dominant bearish bias over the coming trading sessions.\nThe Federal Reserve Continues to Show Indecision\nAs the end of 2025 approaches, the Federal Reserve\u2019s probability outlook continues to reflect uncertainty heading into the first quarter of 2026. For the January 28 decision, markets assign a probability of over 80% that interest rates will remain unchanged. However, the outlook for the March 18, 2026 meeting is more divided: there is a 47% probability that rates stay at the current 3.75% level, while a probability close to 44% already prices in a 25-basis-point rate cut, which would bring the policy rate to around 3.50%. This distribution highlights the lack of a clear market consensus on the direction of U.S. monetary policy in 2026, reinforcing a broader sense of indecision surrounding the Federal Reserve.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nThis uncertainty around U.S. monetary policy has begun to weigh on the strength of the U.S. dollar, as expectations of lower rates reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments and limit the formation of solid short-term demand for the currency. This weakness has been clearly reflected in the DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against other currencies. In recent sessions, the DXY has moved away from the 100-point area and is now trading below 98, levels not seen since October 2025, confirming a significant weakening of the U.S. dollar toward year-end.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nCanada, meanwhile, maintains a neutral interest rate outlook heading into 2026. For its next policy decision, scheduled for January 28, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep rates unchanged at the current 2.25% level, with no meaningful surprises anticipated by the market. Inflation data have not shown a sufficiently sharp slowdown to justify rate cuts during the early months of 2026.\nWhen contrasting a hesitant Federal Reserve, which continues to exert downward pressure on the U.S. dollar, with a more stable stance from the Bank of Canada, this dynamic appears to be supporting a strengthening Canadian dollar toward the close of 2025. As long as this expectations gap remains in place, selling pressure is likely to continue dominating short-term USD/CAD price action.\nUSD/CAD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- The bearish trend remains firmly in place: Since late November 2025, USD/CAD has sustained a downward trendline, gradually pushing price closer to the year\u2019s lows. So far, no meaningful bullish corrections have emerged that would threaten this technical structure, leaving it as the primary technical reference for the pair. However, toward year-end, a growing sense of neutrality has begun to appear on the chart, which, if sustained, could open the door to short-term bullish corrections.\n- RSI: The RSI remains below the neutral 50 level, suggesting that average momentum over the past 14 sessions continues to favor sellers. That said, the indicator has reached the oversold zone, near the 30 level, which could be signaling a potential imbalance in momentum and open space for short-term corrective rebounds in USD/CAD.\n- MACD: The MACD histogram is oscillating close to the neutral zero line, reflecting neutral momentum in short-term moving averages. If this lack of directional strength persists, it could facilitate the emergence of technical rebounds in the short term.\nKey Levels:\n- 1.37220 \u2013 Key resistance: The nearest upside barrier and a "

Concerns about potential Bank of Japan (BoJ) intervention are restraining Yen bears. Despite this, the broader GBP/JPY trend remains upward, with pullbacks attracting buyers.\nCurrent Market Reversal\nThe Yen is recovering losses against its main competitors, causing a nearly 100-pip reversal on the GBP/JPY, now trading near 210.50 after hitting session highs at 211.43. The Japanese Yen\u2019s depreciation last week was influenced by speculation regarding the BoJ\u2019s interest rate hikes amid concerns over Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal policies.\nFinance Minister Satsuki Takayama issued a strong warning about the Yen, suggesting Tokyo could act against speculation. This week\u2019s low trading volumes could provide opportunities for Japanese authorities to intervene.\nTechnical analysis shows GBP/JPY around 210.49, with recent rejections at 211.50 \u2013 211.60 levels. Support is near 210.05 and 208.90. The MACD indicates building bearish momentum, while the RSI is at 48.03, reflecting a neutral stance after previous overbought levels. Resistance targets are 211.59, 212.75, and 214.38.\nToday, the Yen is strongest against the New Zealand Dollar. Percentage changes in major currencies are shown in a heat map, reflecting the relative performance of the JPY.\nMarket Risks and Strategies\nWith GBP/JPY pulling back from multi-year highs near 211.60, we see the immediate risk shifting towards a potential snap decline. The verbal warnings about intervention from Japanese officials, combined with thin holiday trading, create a risky environment for holding leveraged long positions. This pullback towards 210.50 should be viewed as a warning shot rather than a simple dip to buy.\nThe underlying fundamental picture still favors a stronger pound, which is why this pair has climbed so high. We have just seen fresh data showing UK wage growth for the three months to November 2025 holding firm at 4.2%, keeping the Bank of England\u2019s hawkish stance intact. In contrast, Japan\u2019s national core CPI for November came in at a subdued 1.7%, giving the Bank of Japan no urgent reason to abandon its ultra-low interest rate policy.\nWe have to remember the precedent set in the autumn of 2022, when the Ministry of Finance stepped in forcefully after similar warnings, triggering a massive yen rally. Back then, authorities spent over \u00a59 trillion yen, causing pairs like USD/JPY to drop sharply by several hundred pips in a matter of hours. The current language from Tokyo is eerily reminiscent of that period, suggesting the 211-212 level is being treated as a line in the sand.\nFor the next few weeks, we should consider using options to trade the building tension. Buying volatility seems prudent, as a major move is likely in either direction. A long straddle, involving the purchase of both a call and a put option with a January 2026 expiry, would position us to profit from a large price swing regardless of whether intervention causes a crash or the uptrend resumes explosively.\nAlternatively, for those of us who believe the uptrend will eventually win out, constructing a bull call spread offers a risk-defined way to stay long. One could buy a call option with a 211.50 strike and simultaneously sell a call with a 214.00 strike for a February 2026 expiration. This strategy significantly lowers the initial cost and caps the risk if the pair turns south, while still offering upside if the old highs are broken."

The intraday band sits near $86,800\u2013$90,200, with 24-hour turnover around $45\u201349 billion and a monthly range between roughly $84,000 and $93,000.\nThe market is still about 30% under the October peak near $126,000, consolidating in an expensive post-halving range where price is increasingly driven by ETFs, corporates and options flows, not retail alone.\nThe zone around $90,000\u2013$90,180 is the dominant supply band. Every approach to that region in recent weeks has triggered fast rejections and failed closes above it on higher time frames. This confirms it as a high-volume distribution area and the current ceiling for BTC.\nBelow that, price is pressing into the Point of Control (POC) of the current range, the area with the highest traded volume. If BTC establishes acceptance below this POC, liquidity thins out quickly and a full rotation toward the $80,000 range low becomes the natural next move. Structurally, repeated failures at $90k with lower highs and forced defenses lower down create a range that is still intact but skewed bearish until a clean break above resistance appears.\nThe traditional four-year halving narrative is losing dominance. In 2025, the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 has averaged around 0.52, up from about 0.23 in 2024. A correlation over 0.5 means BTC now behaves like a high-beta tech proxy rather than a purely independent macro hedge.\nLarge asset managers already describe 2026 as the beginning of an \u201cinstitutional era\u201d where the path of BTC is tied more to equity risk, liquidity conditions and portfolio rebalancing than to the halving clock alone. That change supports deeper adoption but also ties BTC more tightly to macro drawdowns.\nOn the policy side, the U.S. environment for Bitcoin is shifting from hostile ambiguity to regulated integration. The CLARITY Act divides authority between the SEC and CFTC, and sets a framework for classifying and supervising digital assets. Backers claim it pulls crypto \u201cinto the regulated economy\u201d and gives banks, brokers and advisors a workable rulebook for BTC exposure; critics argue it weakens investor protection by trimming SEC reach.\nIn parallel, the GENIUS stablecoin law creates the first full federal structure for payment stablecoins. Forecasts call for stablecoin circulation to exceed $1 trillion by 2026, more than triple current levels, as banks, fintechs and payment processors adopt or issue stablecoins. For BTC, that means deeper, regulated fiat rails that make large-scale allocation, hedging and custody materially easier.\nOutside the U.S., Europe is moving toward a strict but supportive digital-asset regime, with focus on programmable money, tokenized securities, and audited infrastructure. The direction is clear: on-chain systems must look and behave like institutional-grade markets.\nAs tokenized equity and credit platforms develop toward Nasdaq-style secondary markets, Bitcoin is positioned as the primary collateral and reference asset. The more regulated tokenization and on-chain finance expand, the stronger the structural case that BTC remains embedded in the financial system instead of remaining a fringe experiment.\nSince spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in 2024, aggregate U.S. spot BTC products have at times bought more than twice the daily newly issued Bitcoin, steadily absorbing free float. One flagship Bitcoin trust ETF has attracted roughly $25 billion in net inflows during 2025, and its issuer lists it as a core strategic theme.\nAnalysts now expect more than 100 new crypto ETFs in 2026, spanning altcoin baskets, multi-asset structures and leveraged products, with potential net inflows above $50 billion. At the same time, the latest data show weekly ETF outflows of roughly $780 million, which has helped push BTC back from the $90k area into the high $80ks. Even so, the cumulative ETF stack remains large and sti"

                "body": "NEW YORK, December 29, 2025, 16:47 ET \u2014 After-hours\nStrategy Inc (MSTR) shares were last down 2.2% at $155.39 in after-hours trading on Monday after the company disclosed another bitcoin purchase funded by selling new shares. SEC\nThe move matters because Strategy has positioned itself as a \u201cBitcoin Treasury Company,\u201d tying its equity more tightly to bitcoin\u2019s swings than most U.S. software stocks. Strategy\nInvestors have also become more sensitive to dilution \u2014 when issuing new stock reduces existing shareholders\u2019 ownership percentage \u2014 as Strategy continues to tap capital markets to accumulate the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was down about 0.3% at $87,248 in late trade.\nA Form 8-K filing showed Strategy bought 1,229 bitcoin between Dec. 22 and Dec. 28 for $108.8 million, paying about $88,568 per coin including fees. The company said its holdings rose to 672,497 bitcoin, acquired for $50.44 billion at an average cost of $74,997. SEC\nThe same filing said Strategy sold 663,450 class A common shares during the period, raising $108.8 million in net proceeds, and had about $11.7 billion still available for issuance and sale under its common-stock at-the-market program. An \u201cat-the-market\u201d program lets a company sell stock into the open market over time rather than in a single large offering. SEC\nStrategy also reported no sales under its at-the-market programs for four series of preferred shares during the week. Preferred shares are securities that typically pay dividends and rank ahead of common stock in the capital structure. SEC\nExecutive chairman Michael Saylor hinted at the update ahead of the filing, posting \u201cBack to Orange\u201d on X, a reference to the company\u2019s bitcoin purchase chart. FinanceFeeds\nCrypto-linked U.S. stocks also eased, with Coinbase down 1.3%, Marathon Digital off 1.1% and Riot Platforms down 1.8% in late trade.\nStrategy\u2019s shares traded between $155.00 and $162.85 during Monday\u2019s session, underscoring the stock\u2019s tendency to swing more than the underlying token. Traders often describe $155 as a near-term \u201csupport\u201d level \u2014 a price area where buying sometimes emerges after a drop.\nBeyond day-to-day bitcoin moves, investors are focused on how quickly Strategy continues to raise capital to keep accumulating. The company says it uses proceeds from equity and debt financings, along with cash flows from operations, to build its bitcoin position. Strategy\nIndex-related headlines are another swing factor heading into early 2026. MSCI has said it will decide by Jan. 15 whether to exclude companies whose digital-asset holdings represent 50% or more of total assets from some benchmarks, a review that has put \u201cdigital asset treasury\u201d firms under scrutiny. Reuters\nFor now, traders are watching two moving parts: bitcoin\u2019s next directional move and the pace of Strategy\u2019s stock issuance to fund purchases. Weekly filings have become a regular checkpoint for investors tracking whether the company is buying, pausing, or stepping up capital raising. SEC"

                "body": "Ethereum TVL holds firm as DeFi capital consolidates across the market\nEthereum\u2019s role at the centre of decentralised finance appears to be strengthening, even as total DeFi capital pulls back from recent highs.\nData from DeFiLlama shows that total value locked [TVL] on Ethereum remains structurally elevated compared with prior cycles, despite recent volatility.\nAt the same time, broader ecosystem data from Sentora indicates that overall DeFi TVL has retraced from multi-year peaks. This points to consolidation rather than a broad-based exit from the sector.\nTogether, the two datasets suggest that capital is becoming more selective, concentrating around core infrastructure rather than dispersing across the wider DeFi landscape.\nEthereum TVL signals structural resilience\nThe Ethereum TVL chart highlights a familiar pattern of boom, contraction, and recovery since 2020. However, unlike previous cycles, the post-2022 drawdown did not reset activity to prior lows.\nInstead, Ethereum\u2019s TVL has established a significantly higher base, with renewed expansion expected through 2024 and into 2025, before the latest pullback. As of this writing, the Ethereum TVL stands at approximately $68.6 billion.\nThis matters because Ethereum hosts the bulk of DeFi\u2019s critical primitives, including stablecoins, lending markets, liquid staking, and restaking protocols. Even as speculative activity cools, these layers continue to anchor capital on the network.\nThe persistence of Ethereum TVL suggests that usage is increasingly driven by infrastructure demand rather than short-term yield chasing.\nCapital appears willing to remain deployed through periods of market uncertainty, provided it sits in systems perceived as robust and liquid.\nTotal DeFi TVL reflects consolidation, not retreat\nIn contrast, Sentora\u2019s snapshot of total DeFi TVL across all chains shows a more visible retracement. After climbing to multi-year highs earlier this year, total TVL has pulled back to roughly $182 billion.\nCrucially, the composition of that TVL has shifted. Aave, Lido, EigenLayer-linked protocols, and major liquid staking platforms dominate the rankings, while smaller or experimental protocols capture a shrinking share of capital.\nThis divergence between Ethereum TVL stability and broader DeFi contraction suggests that investors are not abandoning decentralised finance outright.\nInstead, they are concentrating exposure in protocols and networks viewed as essential rather than optional.\nInstitutional rails shape the next phase\nForward-looking commentary from SharpLink\u2019s Joseph Chalom provides additional context for this shift.\nChalom argues that stablecoin adoption, tokenised real-world assets [RWAs], and institutional participation are laying the groundwork for the next stage of crypto growth, with Ethereum emerging as the primary settlement layer.\nAccording to this view, stablecoins act as an institutional on-ramp, allowing firms to build crypto-native systems before expanding into tokenised funds, money markets, and onchain credit.\nThat progression lowers the activation energy for broader adoption, favouring networks with proven security and deep liquidity.\nIf stablecoin and RWA growth accelerate as projected, Ethereum\u2019s existing dominance in these areas positions it to capture a disproportionate share of future DeFi flows. Chalom predicts that the Ethereum TVL will 10x in 2026.\nWhat the data is really saying\nTaken together, the charts do not point to a DeFi downturn so much as a recalibration. Total DeFi TVL is no longer expanding indiscriminately. However, Ethereum\u2019s TVL suggests that the network continues to function as the sector\u2019s financial backbone.\nCapital is still onchain, but it is becoming more disciplined, favouring infrastructure over experimentation.\nThat dynamic may produce fewer explosive rallies in headline TVL, but it also implies a more durable foundation for long-term growth.\nFinal Thoughts\n- Ethereum\u2019s TVL resilience suggests DeFi capital is consolidat"

Almost all of its pending cases were dropped, and it backed out of several ongoing court disputes.\nTrump has made it his mission to boost the U.S. crypto industry, and Atkins has declared that same mission the top priority at the SEC, which was established as an independent federal regulator not meant to operate under the direct management of the White House.\nWaters, who has at times been an active negotiator on crypto legislation while also sharing industry criticism, said Atkins \"frames the agency\u2019s agenda as an instrument of the administration.\" She also noted its many policy shifts have been executed through staff statements rather than formal rules. That's routinely been the case for the crypto industry, which has enthusiastically embraced many of these statements as clarifying the agency's position in the absence of clear digital assets laws. \"This approach flouts the SEC\u2019s legal obligations under the Administrative Procedure Act, excludes the vital role public comment provides in identifying issues, and hides from congressional and public view precisely what interests are influencing SEC decision-making, so that we cannot weigh the motives of those parties molding SEC policy,\" said Waters, who requested that Atkins come to testify before the House panel.\nRead More: U.S. SEC chief warns watchdogs need to be limited in tapping crypto's power to snoop\nMore For You\nState of the Blockchain 2025\nL1 tokens broadly underperformed in 2025 despite a backdrop of regulatory and institutional wins.

                "body": "In 2025, Solana received a new, atypical source of demand. Treasury companies and exchange-traded funds focused on SOL accumulated nearly 5% of the token\u2019s circulating supply over the year. The combined reserves of these entities exceed 28 million SOL and are becoming a factor that the market will take into account in 2026 as well.\nPart of these assets is already involved in staking and supporting validators. This means it is not just about passive holding, but about growing influence on the Solana ecosystem from within.\nWho bought SOL and how much\nSolana\u2019s treasury reserves expanded throughout 2025, but new purchases stopped in December.\nAccording to analysts, strategic entities, including treasury companies and ETFs, have formed reserves of more than 20 million SOL. At current prices, their combined value is about $2.6 billion.\nOf this amount, about 9.5 million SOL are already staked. Such a volume of delegation strengthens the positions of validators working with large holders and increases their role in Solana\u2019s network economy.\nAlthough the pace of purchases throughout the year was uneven, the very fact that almost 5% of the supply is concentrated in the hands of a limited group of players changes the token\u2019s ownership structure.\nTreasury companies slowed down purchases\nBy the end of the year, treasury companies focused on Solana had effectively stopped increasing their reserves. In December, there was no net inflow of SOL to their balances, despite the token\u2019s price decline.\nAt the same time, interest in such companies on the stock market decreased. After the peak hype in the third quarter, the shares of most players went into correction.\nForward Industries, the largest of such entities, still shows about 40% growth for the year, but its quotes have noticeably rolled back from the September high of $39. At the same time, the value of its SOL reserve is estimated at $871 million, while the company\u2019s market capitalization has dropped to $608.8 million. This indicates a cooling of interest in \u2018proxy investments\u2019 through shares.\nA similar trend is observed among other participants. Solana Company, which owns about 2.3 million SOL, has not been able to recover its share price after a sharp drop. The former biotech company trades around $2.78, which is incomparable to the March peak. DeFi Dev Corp, the third largest treasury entity with a reserve of about 2.19 million SOL, ends the year near $5.76, having lost most of its value from the yearly high.\nFocus on yield within the ecosystem\nAmid a lack of new inflows, treasury companies are increasingly dependent on Solana\u2019s internal economy. The main sources of income are staking, validator rewards, and commissions from ecosystem applications.\nThis model can work provided the SOL price remains relatively stable. However, it makes companies more sensitive to changes in network activity and the real profitability of applications, rather than speculative token growth.\nETFs continue to buy\nUnlike treasury companies, Solana ETFs maintain positive inflow dynamics. Over the past three weeks, the funds have mostly recorded net purchases.\nAt the moment, ETFs have accumulated about 7.86 million SOL, and total assets under management have exceeded $1 billion. This level is considered important, as after reaching it, funds may review their fee structure.\nAt the same time, ETFs remain a less stable source of long-term demand. Unlike treasury companies, funds can quickly change their positioning when market conditions change.\nPrice lags, attention remains\nDespite the concentration of supply and growth in on-chain activity, SOL still trades within a range.

Instead, they are evolving in parallel, each specializing in different strengths.\nHadick described the two networks as \u201cmore like two Facebooks,\u201d serving different communities and use cases rather than one replacing the other.\n1/ New data confirms: @Ethereum is the #1 ecosystem for new developers in 2025. pic.twitter.com/ZThdbGDf0X\n\u2014 Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 15, 2025\nEthereum Holds the Core Economy\nEthereum has long been the home for most decentralized finance applications and stablecoins, making it the backbone of on-chain economic activity. According to industry data, Ethereum hosts over 80 percent of stablecoin liquidity, supporting assets like USDC and DAI that enable everyday DeFi trading and lending. This centralization of value has created a robust ecosystem where developers and institutions feel confident building complex applications.\nA real world example can be found in decentralized exchanges. Platforms such as Uniswap and Curve primarily operate on Ethereum, benefiting from deep liquidity and a wide base of active users. That concentration of activity reinforces Ethereum\u2019s role as the go-to network for financial products that require reliability and broad adoption.\nDragonfly Partner: Ethereum and Solana Are More Like Two Facebooks\nOn December 24, Dragonfly general partner Rob Hadick said in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box that as asset tokenization accelerates and on-chain economic activity continues to expand, a single blockchain is\u2026 pic.twitter.com/oQIkq7JMMk\n\u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 28, 2025\nSolana Focuses on Speed and Efficiency\nIn contrast, Solana is optimized for high-frequency transactions and fast settlement. Hadick noted that Solana\u2019s design makes it ideal for use cases where speed matters, such as gaming, NFT marketplaces, and microtransactions. The network has already processed billions of dollars in transactions with low fees, attracting developers who need efficiency at scale.\nRecent trends highlight Solana\u2019s rise in areas where throughput is critical. For example, some NFT projects and crypto games have shifted to Solana to handle large volumes of small, rapid transactions that would be costly or slow on Ethereum. This approach complements Ethereum rather than competing directly, creating a scenario where both blockchains can thrive simultaneously.\nSolana ecosystem today\n2026 feels even bigger. pic.twitter.com/eVseREQZrU\n\u2014 Jack.poor \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf2 (@RealJackPoor) December 29, 2025\nCoexistence Over Competition\nHadick\u2019s analogy of \u201ctwo Facebooks\u201d captures the emerging reality in crypto. Just as different social networks appeal to distinct audiences without fully replacing one another, Ethereum and Solana are carving out unique roles in the digital economy. For investors, the takeaway is clear: diversification across blockchains may be as important as diversification across assets.\nDisclaimer\nThe information provided by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

European exporters are particularly upset, with an EU spokesperson warning \"this decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nDomestically, the reaction is mixed. US steel companies like Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics (Nasdaq: STLD) are trading higher, with shares up about 12% each in the premarket. The broader Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), however, is trading down 0.3% premarket.\nMeanwhile, trade negotiations with China are on the rocks once again. Last week President Trump accused China of reneging on unspecified trade commitments, prompting the Chinese to level similar accusations against the U.S. A call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, expected to take place later this week, could either help or hurt\nFor now, the situation just remains unsettled.\nEarnings\nThe Campbell's Company (Nasdaq: CPB) reported an earnings beat this morning, and guided higher for the rest of 2025, sending the stock up modestly premarket.\nAdvertisement\nScience Applications International (Nasdaq: SAIC) reported mixed earnings, with sales on target but profits less than expected. SAIC stock is down more than 6% premarket.\nAnalyst Calls\nDow Jones Industrial Average component company Boeing (NYSE: BA) won an upgrade to buy from Bank of America this morning. Setting a price target of $260 a share, BofA analyst Ronald Epstein observed that President Trump is using Boeing as a tool in trade negotiations, accepting orders for Boeing planes (which helps the U.S. balance of trade) in exchange for U.S. tariffs concessions. The analyst cited \"recent deals struck in the UK (32 aircraft orders), Qatar (210 aircraft orders), UAE (28 aircraft orders), and China (removing the ban on BA aircraft), as setting a precedent for future global trade negotiations, to BA's benefit.\"\nAt least one of those deals now looks at risk, however.\nRetirement planning doesn\u2019t have to feel overwhelming.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets, with the S&P 500 futures down by 0.3 percent.\nProfit taking may contribute to initial weakness on Wall Street, as some traders look to cash in on recent gains going into the end of the year.\nPartly reflecting renewed strength among tech stocks, the Dow and the S&P 500 ended last Wednesday's trading at record closing highs before edging slightly lower last Friday.\nA pullback by big-name tech companies may weigh on the markets, as shares of Oracle (ORCL) are tumbling by more than 2 percent in pre-market trading.\nShares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU) are also seeing notable pre-market weakness after posting strong gains last week.\nOverall trading activity may remain somewhat subdued, however, as some traders are likely to remain away from their desks ahead of the New Year's Day holiday on Thursday.\nShortly after the start of trading, the National Association of Realtors is due to release its report on pending home sales in the month of November.\nPending home sales are expected to increase by 0.8 percent in November after jumping by 1.9 percent in October.\nAfter trending higher for several sessions, stocks showed a lack of direction over the course of the trading day on Friday. The major averages spent the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line before eventually closing slightly lower.\nThe S&P 500 reached a new record intraday high in early trading before closing down 2.11 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 6,929.94.\nThe Dow also edged down 20.19 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 48,710.97, while the Nasdaq slipped 20.21 points or 0.1 percent to 23,593.10.\nDespite the choppy trading on the day, the major averages all posted strong gains for the week. While the S&P 500 shot up by 1.4 percent, the Dow and the Nasdaq both jumped by 1.2 percent.\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.4 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index crept slightly higher and South Korea's Kospi surged by 2.2 percent.\nThe major European markets have also turned mixed on the day. While the German DAX Index is down by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.1 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.2 percent.\nIn commodities trading, crude oil futures are surging $1.41 to $58.15 a barrel after plunging $1.61 to $56.74 a barrel last Friday. Meanwhile, after jumping $49.90 to $4,552.70 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are tumbling $84.30 to $4,460.40 an ounce.\nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 156.26 yen versus the 156.54 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Friday. Against the euro, the dollar is trading at $1.1767 compared to last Friday's $1.1771.\nby RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com"

Near all time highs but low volume notable.\n- DAX: Flat to slightly positive; German bund yields stable near recent lows.\n- CAC 40: Similar pattern; defensive sectors outperform.\n- Drivers:\n- No major Eurozone macro data today.\n- ECB rate expectations unchanged; markets pricing cuts mid-2026.\n- Geopolitical tone (Ukraine peace signals) weighing on oil, supporting risk sentiment.\nGermany (DAX)\nGermany 40 is trading near 24,288.5 after rejecting the upper trendline close to 24,482.2, signaling a loss of bullish momentum. The chart shows a break below the ascending trendline, which had supported the rally from the late-November low. Fibonacci retracement levels highlight key zones: 78.6% at 24,118.7, 61.8% at 23,818.5, and 50% at 23,673.0. The inability to hold above the trendline suggests a potential corrective move toward 23,818.5 or 23,673.0 if selling pressure persists. A decisive recovery above 24,118.7 would be required to restore bullish control and target the previous high at 24,482.2.\nMomentum indicators reinforce the weakening outlook. MACD is flattening near the zero line, indicating fading bullish momentum and a possible bearish crossover. Stochastic RSI at 30.49 is near oversold territory, hinting at a short-term bounce but without confirmation. If price fails to hold above 23,818.5, downside targets include 23,349.8 and the prior swing low at 22,489.4. The technical bias has shifted to neutral-to-bearish unless price reclaims 24,118.7 decisively, making the next sessions critical for trend validation.\nCommodities\n- Oil: WTI ~$57.8, Brent ~$60.6, both down ~2\u20133% on Ukraine peace progress headlines.\n- Gold: Takes a breather to ~$4,460 after running up to ~$4,550. Silver Spot also down ~5.5% to ~$75 after briefly breaking through ~$82.\n- Agricultural: Mixed; corn and wheat flat, cocoa and cotton slightly higher.\nBonds\n- U.S. Treasuries: 10-year ~4.13%, 2-year yields slightly lower; curve stable.\n- German Bunds: Yields near recent lows; no major moves expected today.\n- UK Gilts: Flat; liquidity thin.\nKey News\n- Ukraine peace talks optimism pressuring crude and defensive companies.\n- No major economic releases in U.S. or Eurozone today.\n- Fed and ECB policy expectations unchanged; rate cuts priced for mid-2026.\nOutlook for Today\n- Equities: Quiet, low-volume trade; mild positive bias in Europe.\n- Commodities: Oil to remain under pressure; metals sideways possibly taking a short breather.\n- Rates: Stable; no catalysts until January.\n- Volatility: Expected to remain low.\nUpcoming\n- Dec 30: Continued thin trade; year-end rebalancing.\n- Jan 2: Full reopening; U.S. and Eurozone data flow resumes; focus on Q4 earnings and central bank tone.\nSafe Holidays,\n-Philip Papageorgiou \u2013 Market Analyst\n--X ex Twitter: PhilipForexCom\nStoneX Europe Ltd may make third party material available on this website which may contain information included but not limited to the conditions of financial markets.

                "body": "US stock futures steadied on Tuesday, December 30, 2025, as market focus shifted from the Bank of Japan to the US Federal Reserve.\nChanging market sentiment toward the BoJ\u2019s monetary policy outlook clashed with hopes for a March Fed rate cut, signaling a narrowing US-Japan rate differential. The BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions sent hawkish signals, pushing 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields higher. 10-year JGB yields neared last week\u2019s 2.1% in morning trading on Tuesday, tempering demand for risk assets.\nDespite rising bets on multiple BoJ rate hikes, lower US borrowing rates would boost corporate earnings, supporting a bullish medium-term price outlook.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the key technical levels traders should watch.\n10-year JGB yields climbed to 2.07% in morning trading, edging closer to last week\u2019s 2.1%. The BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions from the December Monetary Policy Meeting resonated, weighing on sentiment. Notably, the Nikkei 225 fell 0.28%, extending its losses from the previous day, despite USD/JPY reclaiming 156.\nYen carry trades have remained profitable under current US-Japan rate differentials. However, a higher-than-expected BoJ neutral interest rate and a dovish Fed rate path would likely reverse yen carry trades, drying up short-term liquidity and triggering a sharp sell-off of risk assets.\nThe BoJ continues to signal a broad neutral interest rate range of between 1% and 2.5%. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda recently told parliament that he would announce a neutral interest rate once the range narrowed, leaving uncertainty about the number of rate hikes needed to achieve monetary policy normalization.\nThe risk of yen carry trade unwind is likely to continue influencing risk appetite. However, the US economic outlook and the Fed\u2019s rate path remain key for US equity futures. Lower US borrowing costs would improve corporate profits and equity valuations. Furthermore, lower rates loosen credit conditions, another key bullish ingredient for US stock futures.\nFor context, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini slid 11.7% from July 31 to August 5 in response to the BoJ\u2019s rate hike and cut to JGB purchases on July 31, 2024. However, the recovery was swift, boosted by expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts in H2 2024. Fast forward to December 2025, and markets are expecting the next Fed Chair to support lower interest rates, a boon for US risk assets.\nUS futures edged lower during the Asian morning session on Tuesday, December 30. The Dow Jones E-mini and the Nasdaq 100 E-mini dropped 1 point and 5 points, respectively, while the S&P 500 E-mini slipped by half a point.\nLater on Tuesday, the Chicago PMI and FOMC members\u2019 speeches will influence risk sentiment. Economists expect the Chicago PMI to rise from 36.3 in November to 39.5 in December. A higher print would ease concerns about a sharp economic slowdown, lifting sentiment.\nHowever, Fed speakers will likely have a greater influence on US equity futures. Growing support for a March Fed rate cut would likely drive demand for risk assets, supporting a bullish short- to medium-term price outlook.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a March Fed rate cut fell from 53.3% on December 26 to 52.3% on December 30. A March cut and a new Fed Chair in H2 2026, favoring lower rates, would reinforce the constructive short- to medium-term bias.\nDespite Tuesday\u2019s sell-off, the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini traded above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs signaled a bullish short- to medium-term bias, affirming the positive outlook.\nNear-term trends will hinge on US data, the FOMC Meeting Minutes, and BoJ rhetoric. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook is cautiously bullish, considering the BoJ and Fed signals, alongside technicals. Furthermore, expectations of an incoming Fed Chair supporting low interest rates reinforce the positive m"

                "body": "Shares of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) lost 2.59% over the past five trading sessions after gaining 3.53% the five prior. A rally that began in early summer has pushed the stock into the green on the year, but the AI-induced sell-off that began in late October and carried deep into November tempered Tesla\u2019s performance this fall. Overall this year, the stock is up 25.29 in 2025%.\nWhen the company reported Q3 earnings on Oct. 22, 2025, it announced quarterly revenue of $28.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year (YoY). However, earnings of 50 cents per share missed analysts\u2019 estimates of 54 cents per share. Concerningly, quarterly net income fell 37% YoY to $1.37 billion.\nTesla\u2019s stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk\u2019s role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk\u2019s friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla\u2019s outlook remains clouded.\nIn any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let\u2019s check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it\u2019s a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term.\nTesla\u2019s Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along\nFor a stock that\u2019s fallen significantly, I\u2019d expect the growth narrative to have been severely impacted. Tesla\u2019s latest quarterly earnings results were not incredible. Yet, I do think that the sell-off is mostly a mere correction to make up for the euphoric melt-up experienced in the back half of last year. Indeed, investors got too far ahead of themselves when it came to Tesla\u2019s most ambitious growth drivers. Now that investors are taking a step back, we\u2019ll have to wait and see if Tesla can advance such drivers meaningfully.Undoubtedly, Tesla has a front-row seat to the AI revolution. More specifically, it\u2019s one of the frontrunners in physical AI (or robotics, if you prefer). In a prior piece, I highlighted Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas\u2019 view that TSLA stock was akin to an embodied \u201cAI ETF\u201d given the numerous AI projects going on behind the scenes.\nThough Tesla\u2019s AI efforts are exciting, it\u2019s important to note that being too soon to a trend could have a drastic negative impact on the stock. As investors reset expectations and become more critical of how firms spend money on AI, Tesla will need to deliver more substance if it\u2019s to convince investors to punch their ticket to the stock well ahead of time. Personally, I think Tesla\u2019s been investing in the right areas, but will competitors beat Tesla to market in certain categories?\nThe most notable drivers, I believe, that will drive Tesla stock in the coming years are the Cybertruck (as well as self-driving capabilities and the impact on the robotaxi market) and its Optimus robot. Of course, there\u2019s also the rumored \u201cModel Q\u201d entry-level offering. But until we get more clarity on that driver, I consider it to be more of a \u201cwild card.\u201d\nBull Case for Tesla\u2019s Share Price\nCybertruck: The Cybertruck stole the show during Tesla\u2019s robotaxi event. While it would be a sci-fi dream for many to have a fairly reasonably priced robotaxi producing passive income for its owners, I do think Musk\u2019s "

                "body": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s final meeting of 2025 has delivered exactly what Wall Street expected on paper \u2013 a third quarter\u2011point rate cut \u2013 but the message around it is anything but simple. Stocks have pushed toward fresh highs, bond yields are slipping, and index futures are flashing a more cautious tone as investors digest what many are calling a classic \u201chawkish cut.\u201d\nOn Thursday, December 11, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were trading near record levels, even as futures on those same indexes pointed modestly lower earlier in the day and tech stocks lagged. 1News+1\nAt the center of the move: a divided Fed, delayed economic data after a historic government shutdown, and growing political pressure ahead of a leadership change at the U.S. central bank. Reuters+1\nWhat the Fed Just Did \u2014 And Why It\u2019s Being Called a \u2018Hawkish Cut\u2019\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point, bringing the federal funds target range down to 3.50%\u20133.75%. It was the third rate cut of 2025, aimed at supporting a softening labor market after months of slowing job growth. Reuters+1\nBut the details of the decision made it clear this was no simple pivot back to ultra\u2011easy policy:\n- Split vote: The decision featured rare open disagreement. Two policymakers voted against cutting rates, arguing there was no need to ease now, while another dissented because he wanted a larger, half\u2011point move. 1News+1\n- A pause signal: New projections show Fed officials see only one additional quarter\u2011point cut in 2026 and one more in 2027, effectively signaling a pause after this move unless the data deteriorate. Reuters\n- Inflation still \u2018somewhat elevated\u2019: The Fed\u2019s statement pointedly noted that inflation remains above target, even as the labor market shows downside risks, underscoring the narrow path between fighting price pressures and avoiding unnecessary damage to jobs. Reuters+1\nComplicating the picture: the Fed is flying partially blind. A 43\u2011day U.S. government shutdown delayed key indicators, pushing the November jobs report to December 16 and inflation data to later in the month. Reuters+1\nFed Chair Jerome Powell stressed that another rate hike is \u201cnot the base case,\u201d but he also refused to pre\u2011commit to further cuts, telling markets the path ahead will depend heavily on incoming data once the statistical fog lifts. Reuters+1\nWall Street\u2019s Two\u2011Day Whiplash: Rally First, Then a Softer Open\nWednesday: Relief Rally After the Decision\nOnce the Fed announcement hit and Powell\u2019s press conference began, markets did what they often do when uncertainty clears \u2014 they rallied.\n- The Dow jumped about 1.05%, or nearly 500 points, to roughly 48,058.\n- The S&P 500 gained around 0.67% to just under 6,887.\n- The Nasdaq Composite climbed roughly 0.33%. Reuters\nAt the same time, Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar fell, as investors cheered a cut that seemed supportive of growth without hinting at an imminent policy reversal. Reuters+1\nOne portfolio manager described it as \u201cmusic to both the bond market and the stock market\u2019s ears,\u201d reflecting relief that the Fed wasn\u2019t shutting down the prospect of future easing altogether, even while projecting just one cut in 2026. Reuters\nThursday Morning: Futures Turn Lower\nBy Thursday morning, however, the sugar high was fading.\nFutures on major U.S. indexes slipped as investors shifted from celebrating \u201ca cut\u201d to parsing the implications of \u201ca hawkish cut\u201d:\n- Dow futures were about 0.1% lower.\n- S&P 500 futures fell roughly 0.5%.\n- Nasdaq 100 futures dropped close to 0.8%. Investopedia\nThis pullback came after cash indexes had already approached or set record highs, suggesting traders were locking in gains and reassessing the Fed\u2019s relatively stingy 2026 outlook.\nCorporate news added its own twists. A disappointing earnings report from Oracle and concerns about stretched AI valuations dragged the Nasdaq and several big\u2011name tech stocks lower, even as blue\u2011chip Dow components like Visa"

                "body": "Japan Stocks Today, December 30: Nikkei Seen Range-Bound Into Year-End\nThe Nikkei year-end close is likely to be range-bound as Japan stocks today trade between 50,400 and 51,000, with the 26 December intraday band at 50,527\u201350,941 also in focus. Profit-taking in AI and chip names may cap rallies, while solid earnings sentiment supports dips. The Tokyo stock market outlook hinges on BoJ meeting opinions at 8:50 JST and USD/JPY near 156. We expect tight liquidity and quick rotations into the close. Traders will watch for moves around major futures roll levels and large options strikes into the afternoon.\nOpening Cues: Policy and FX\nBoJ meeting opinions at 8:50 JST are the day\u2019s first key signal. Investors will parse tone around inflation, wage growth, and bond purchase guidance to gauge near-term rate bias. A steady stance would favor banks and cyclicals; a cautious tone on inflation could support growth shares. Previews point to a firm but limited session into the Nikkei year-end close, consistent with local commentary source.\nUSD/JPY near 156 tends to lift exporters\u2019 margins and equity sentiment, while importers and utilities may lag on cost worries. If the yen softens further, large-cap autos and machinery could provide index support. A quick yen bounce would likely cap rallies and steer flows to defensives. We see FX sensitivity shaping intraday swings around the Nikkei year-end close more than single-stock news.\nKey Levels and Trading Range\nTraders flag 50,400\u201351,000 as today\u2019s working range, with the 26 December intraday band at 50,527\u201350,941 a useful guide for fades and bounces. Liquidity is thin into the Nikkei year-end close, so price can test edges quickly. Local desks also expect small moves and two-way action, aligning with the Tokyo stock market outlook source.\nAbove 51,000, watch for quick stops toward 51,100\u201351,200, then signs of exhaustion. Below 50,400, 50,200\u201350,250 could attract dip buyers if FX is stable. Without strong catalysts, failed breaks may dominate, so we prefer reactive trades over predictions. Momentum into the Nikkei year-end close often fades late in the day, making risk control and position sizing more important than usual.\nSectors: AI Profit-Taking vs Earnings Support\nRecent gains in AI and semiconductor-linked names invite profit-taking as funds lock in results before the break. We expect choppy trading with offers on strength and buying on pullbacks in quality leaders. If flows rotate, financials, machinery, and logistics can hold the tape steady. That balance supports a stable Nikkei year-end close with a bias to range trading.\nSolid earnings guidance from domestic demand plays has underpinned dips in retailers, travel, and services, while utilities and pharmaceuticals offer ballast when growth wobbles. Japan stocks today likely see support on pullbacks in these groups, especially if rates stay steady. This mix can offset tech consolidation and keep the Nikkei year-end close near the center of today\u2019s band.\nPractical Playbook for the Session\nPlan for reactive trades at the edges: fade moves toward 50,400 or 51,000 when momentum stalls, and respect stops just beyond those lines. Keep position sizes light and trim into strength. Use VWAP and five-minute highs and lows to confirm turns. This suits the Tokyo stock market outlook and the likely pace into the Nikkei year-end close.\nMark the BoJ opinions release at 8:50 JST, then watch FX and rates into the afternoon auction. Liquidity can drop quickly after lunch. Keep a simple watchlist: exporters for yen moves, banks for policy tone, defensives for reversal risk. Reassess if price leaves 50,400\u201351,000 with volume, as that would challenge a calm Nikkei year-end close.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis session looks set to deliver a contained, two-way trade shaped by policy signals and currency moves. We expect the working band around 50,400\u201351,000 to hold unless BoJ commentary surprises or USD/JPY swings sharply. Profit-taking in AI shares should be balanced "

                "body": "Japan Stocks Set to Finish Year with Robust Gains\nThe Nikkei 225 rose 114 points, or 0.2%, to 50,417 in early trade on Tuesday, the final trading session of the year, helped mainly by gains in utilities and energy-related stocks.\nThe uptick followed losses in the prior session, after the Bank of Japan\u2019s December summary meeting revealed that many board members saw scope for further rate hikes, following the board's decision to lift its policy rate to a 30-year high of 0.75% in mid-December.\nSelective buying emerged in heavyweight Toyota Motor (0.6%), along with solid gains from Fujitsu (1.8%) and Murata Manufacturing (1.2%).\nFor the full year, the Nikkei is on track to surge about 28%, marking its third straight annual advance, underpinned by Japan\u2019s ongoing economic recovery, resilient corporate earnings, and easing global trade headwinds.\nMeanwhile, the broader Topix edged lower after a modest rise previously, but is still set to post a solid gain of around 23% for the year, also extending its winning streak to three years."

                "body": "Japan\u2019s market dipped after the BoJ signaled a split on further tightening, while company news lifted Itochu and Japan Tissue Engineering but hit Nishi-Nippon Railroad.\nabout 23 hours ago \u2022 1 min\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei fell after the Bank of Japan showed it\u2019s split on whether to keep raising interest rates.\nWhat does this mean?\nThe Nikkei 225 slipped 0.44% after the BoJ\u2019s summary of opinions highlighted real disagreement following December\u2019s rate hike to 0.75%, its highest level in roughly 30 years. Some policymakers think rates are still too low once inflation is factored in, keeping the door open to further tightening. Others warned against moving too fast and pushed for flexibility. That uncertainty matters because higher borrowing costs and a more volatile yen can quickly change profit expectations for exporters, lenders, and debt-heavy domestic firms.\n*..\n*Why should I care?**\nFor markets: Higher rates reshuffle the pecking order.\nEven at 0.75%, Japan\u2019s policy rate is a regime change after decades of ultra-cheap money. If hikes continue, companies reliant on domestic borrowing or discretionary spending could feel the pinch, while firms with pricing power may cope better if inflation sticks around. The day also showed how stock-specific news can overwhelm the index: Itochu rose on a report that its Itochu-Shokuhin unit plans to expand frozen fruit exports abroad, while Nishi-Nippon Railroad fell on talk it\u2019s exploring housing projects in India.\nZooming out: Japan Inc is hunting growth beyond its borders.\nWith Japan\u2019s population aging and shrinking, more firms are forced to look overseas for new customers \u2013 the reported India real estate interest is one example. At the same time, healthcare is becoming a bigger earnings driver: Japan Tissue Engineering jumped after saying its cartilage therapy JACC will be covered by national health insurance from January 1, 2026. For biotech, reimbursement decisions can be the difference between a breakthrough on paper and real revenue.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
