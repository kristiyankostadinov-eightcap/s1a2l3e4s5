                "body": "Iranians Turning to Gold as Inflation Runs Rampant\nIranians are turning to gold as sanctions and government policy destroy their currency.\nThe average inflation rate in Iran has climbed to over 40 percent (based on CPI) on an annual basis. According to an AP report, gold has become the most trusted hedge against this rapid devaluation of the rial.\nThe rapid increase in the local gold price reflects the inflationary environment. Last week, the price of a gold coin in Iran exceeded 1.2 billion rials for the first time in the country\u2019s history.\nStill, people are buying. A gold and jewelry merchant told the AP he has never seen such high demand for gold.\n\u201cIn the past two weeks, I\u2019ve sold 6 kilos (13.2 pounds) of gold to ordinary people \u2014 a new experience for me. People are rushing to buy because they fear their savings will lose value.\u201d\nWage earners are quickly exchanging their rapidly devaluing fiat currency into real money. A grandfather told the AP that he sees gold as \u201cthe best way to preserve value.\u201d\n\u201cWhenever I make money, I turn it into gold,\u201d Behzad Rashvand said.\nAudio equipment salesman Hamid Safari has adopted a similar strategy.\n\u201cWhenever I have enough money to save, I immediately convert it into gold. Throughout history, gold has not only held its value but also increased in worth. We should learn from history if we want to build a better life.\u201d\nFatemeh Parsa invested her inheritance in real estate. Now she regrets that decision.\n\u201cWith global gold prices rising, I sometimes wish I had bought gold instead \u2014 my assets would have grown much more than real estate. Now, it seems that investing in silver could be valuable, especially for my children\u2019s future.\u201d\nSome Iranians turned to cryptocurrency to keep ahead of inflation, but that has proved problematic because the U.S. government has cracked down on Iranian crypto sellers. The U.S. slapped sanctions on two Iranian financiers, along with more than a dozen individuals and firms in Hong Kong and the UAE, for coordinating the purchase of $100 million in cryptocurrency that was used to facilitate oil sales by the Iranian government.\nIranians have not only turned to gold as an inflation hedge. They value its portability. Many Iranians fled Tehran to the countryside during the 12-day war with Israel. The influx of people overwhelmed rural infrastructure, and ATMs quickly ran out of cash or broke down.\nGold solves this problem because it is easy to transport. According to the AP, people have learned from history.\n\u201cMany who fled the cities during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war took whatever they could with them. And in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, those allied with the shah and his government fled Iran with whatever they could carry. Back then, the rial hit an all-time high of 120 to $1, which saw money-changing shops inundated and people buying gold, jewelry, rugs and other assets to spirit abroad.\u201d\nA 49-year-old fabric importer told the AP he is liquidating his assets and turning them into foreign currency and gold.\n\u201cIn an emergency, I need to be able to carry my assets with me if I have to leave.\u201d\nIranians are following a universal strategy. When government money fails and the financial system breaks down, they turn to gold. For instance, Indians used their vast gold savings to make ends meet during the COVID lockdowns, and Turkish citizens are currently gobbling up gold to shield themselves from their government\u2019s relentless devaluation of their money.\nAmericans aren\u2019t facing the kind of borderline hyperinflation currently gripping Iran and Turkey, but their government is also devaluing their currency by design. Keep in mind that inflation is the plan. The stated objective is to erode the purchasing power of the dollar by 2 percent every year. Currency depreciation is considered a feature of a fiat monetary system \u2013 not a bug.\nWhether your government is stealing your money\u2019s purchasing power slowly or all at once, the only way to protect your wealth over time is to exchange your f"

                "source": "VT Markets",
                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/anticipating-the-federal-reserve-meeting-gold-remains-steady-above-4200-as-the-week-concludes/",
                "body": "Gold Prices Stable\nGold prices remain stable between $4,200 and $4,250, with anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut next week. As of now, the XAU/USD is trading at $4,216, after reaching a high of $4,259 earlier in the week. The Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the Core PCE Price Index, has been largely unchanged, remaining close to 3%. This, combined with cooling jobs data and previous comments from the Federal Reserve, points towards a potential rate cut.\nA poll conducted by Reuters reveals economists have largely factored in a December rate cut, suggesting room for Gold prices to rally. The probability of a rate cut next week is reported at 87.2% by the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool. The US Dollar Index is steady, while the 10-year Treasury yield has risen to 4.141%. Core PCE, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in September, with the yearly core PCE easing to 2.8%.\nIn technical analysis, Gold might settle in the $4,200-$4,250 range leading up to the Federal Reserve meeting. A breakout could see prices head to $4,300, while a drop below $4,200 may find support at various moving averages. Central banks are major Gold holders, with factors like geopolitical unrest influencing prices. Gold is priced in dollars, so currency fluctuations affect its value.\nFederal Reserve Meeting Anticipation\nAs of today, December 6th, 2025, gold is holding strong above the $4,200 level while we all wait for the key Federal Reserve meeting next week. With the market pricing in an 87.2% probability of a rate cut, the path of least resistance appears to be upwards. This high expectation is providing a solid floor under the current price, preventing any significant sell-offs.\nThe Fed has cover to make this move, as inflation has been cooling for months. We\u2019ve seen Core PCE fall steadily from the 3.5% levels back in the spring of 2025 to the current 2.8%. This trend, along with the recent Non-Farm Payrolls report showing job gains of just 95,000, suggests the economy is slowing enough to justify easier monetary policy.\nFor derivative traders, this suggests positioning for a potential breakout using call options or bull call spreads. The options market is already skewed bullish, with call options at the $4,300 strike for the January 2026 expiry trading at a significant premium. A dovish signal from the Fed could easily push prices toward the all-time high of $4,381.\nHowever, we must be cautious of a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event, as this rate cut is widely anticipated. We all remember the sharp $150 drop in the summer of 2024 when a guaranteed cut didn\u2019t happen, so a hawkish surprise could be painful. Hedging long positions with puts struck below the $4,124 support level could be a prudent strategy.\nUnderlying support remains strong from continued central bank buying, which has been a consistent theme since the major purchases we saw back in 2022. The latest World Gold Council data for Q3 2025 confirmed another 250 tonnes were added to official reserves globally. This persistent demand provides a long-term structural tailwind for gold.\nTechnically, the price is coiling tightly in the $4,200-$4,250 range, building up energy for its next move. A decisive break above daily highs of $4,259 would be the trigger for a rally, while a surprise drop below $4,200 would target the 50-day moving average near $4,059."

                "body": "The oil and gas industry could save more than US$320bn in the next five years by further digitalising operations in five key areas, according to Rystad Energy research\nThe five key areas highlighted are drilling optimisation, autonomous robotics, predictive maintenance, reservoir management, and logistics optimisation.\nThe oilfield services (OFS) business ecosystem is expected to undergo a significant transformation as continued merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, new business partnerships with technology firms, and greater software integration drive digital-first business strategies for key OFS players.\n\u201cWe estimate that US$320bn is a modest figure, as broader digital adoption across other business domains could generate even greater value. To realise this, executives will need to deliberately prioritise digital transformation by fostering a less risk-averse business culture,\u201d said Binny Bagga, senior vice president, Supply Chain.\nRystad notes that digital revenue streams offer more stable, resilient growth trajectories that are less exposed to the volatility of upstream capex. SLB expects its digital division\u2019s margin to reach 35% on a full-year basis in 2025, while Viridien\u2019s digital, data and environment (DDE) segment generated US$787mn, growing 17% and delivering adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of US$458mn last year.\n\u201cThe investment community is increasingly valuing energy-technology narratives, with service companies that clearly articulate technology-driven and recurring-revenue strategies often commanding higher valuation multiples than those tied solely to equipment cycles. However, such premium valuations hinge on demonstrated scalability. Emphasising digitalisation is a direct pathway to creating lasting shareholder value,\u201d Bagga said.\nNevertheless, widespread adoption of digital oilfields faces significant barriers, including substantial upfront costs for hardware, software, ongoing maintenance and cybersecurity, which impact smaller firms or those operating with legacy infrastructure in particular. To mitigate these challenges, mid-tier companies are selectively enhancing their offerings with targeted digital capabilities, while smaller niche players and specialised software vendors focus on delivering modular, custom solutions.\nA marked trend in digital investment is the growing use of partnerships with technology firms, which complements internal capability building and acquisitions in the digital space. These have increased significantly, with the most significant growth observed in the past two years among leading companies such as SLB, Halliburton, NOV and Baker Hughes. This pattern highlights a clear industry shift toward digital transformation, with large suppliers actively accelerating their collaborations with technology partners in recent years."

                "body": "The announcement that Kevin Hassett is expected to be the next Fed Chair brought with it a bearish drive to the US Dollar. The current Director of the National Economic Council was named by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as the likely next nominee to head the Central Bank a week earlier and that helped to rally equities and drive a sell-off in the Dollar, and that theme continued through this week as President Trump said that he already knew who he was going to name. When asked if it was Hassett, he didn\u2019t verbally confirm but did seem to smile, and given Hassett\u2019s history, this could be widely-inferred as a dovish push for the Federal Reserve.\nOf course, the FOMC is not a dictatorship so the big question is whether Hassett will be able to push a dovish agenda and given where rates markets are currently, it seems that there\u2019s at least some expectation that he\u2019ll be successful. Right now, the bulk of expectation for next year is for the Fed to finish the year after another 50 or 75 bps in cuts in 2026 (assuming a cut next week, as well). And this stands in contrast to the Fed\u2019s own Summary of Economic Projections from the September meeting that wasn\u2019t quite so dovish.\nOf course, the linchpin to this argument rests with inflation data and given the government shutdown were\u2019 still operating with a bit of opacity; but provided that inflation doesn\u2019t shock surprisingly to the upside, it would seem the Fed has an open door to push more softening into next year as we move towards mid-terms later in 2026.\nIn the US Dollar, the 98.98 level was in-play for most of the week after holding as support in the prior week. Given the calendar with the big event ahead for next week, this can be perceived as profit taking or squaring up ahead of the announcement; so there could possibly be qualification for a bullish argument. But the big test for that will be whether buyers can punch through lower-high resistance that\u2019s formed on the four-hour chart, and I\u2019m particularly drawn towards the prior zone from 99.33-99.56 for a test there.\nUS Dollar Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD Weekly\nFrom the weekly chart, if we do see a close above 98.98 that could be qualified as defense and that would speak to the bullish argument. But, as I\u2019ve been saying for months, I think the directional drive behind DXY will rest with the Euro and whether EUR/USD can punch through resistance.\nThere was similarly a test of higher-highs in the pair this week as USD tested lower-lows, but in each scenario trends failed to form and prices quickly pulled back.\nAs such, I want to continue focusing directional USD setups elsewhere, in GBP/USD for USD-weakness and USD/JPY for USD-strength, explained further below.\nUS Dollar Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nI\u2019ve been saying that I think the key for USD trends rests with the Euro, and I remain of that mind.

That said, the door isn\u2019t quite closed for EUR/USD bulls to make a run as there\u2019s bullish structure on the four hour chart that remains in place given the higher-low at 1.1500 and the higher-high that just printed this week.\nThe 1.1593 level that was in play during the Tuesday webinar is now a big line in the sand for bullish EUR/USD themes on short-term charts.\nEUR/USD Four-Hour\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/USD\nGBP/USD remains my favored market for USD-weakness.

                "body": "\"We jumped the gun\": Morgan Stanley reverts back to call for December Fed rate cut\n- In 2026, the euro is expected to grow modestly, while the yen is the favourite.\n- The main outsider is the franc, while the Fed may help the dollar.\nHas the euro grown too eagerly? The EUR/USD rally was driven by accelerating European inflation and business activity, as well as confidence that the ECB\u2019s rate-cutting cycle was nearing its end, a belief in peace in Ukraine, and expectations of a Fed rate cut. However, political problems in Germany and the growing likelihood of a pause in US rate cuts in January have slowed down the main currency pair.\nReuters experts see limited growth potential. They forecast the EUR/USD to rise to 1.17, 1.19, and 1.20 in one, three, and 12 months. Moreover, the dollar\u2019s growth in the short term is now considered possible by around 30% of respondents compared to 6% a month earlier.\nThe main factor in the growth of EUR/USD since the end of the year has been the reversal in expectations for the key rate in December. They have gone from less than a 30% probability immediately after the publication of the minutes of the October FOMC meeting to almost 90% now.\nInvestors seem to have forgotten about the \u2018hawks.\u2019 But the need for compromise for Jerome Powell opens up the potential for the US dollar to strengthen. Another DXY growth impulse is reasonably possible after the rate cuts in September and October.\nReuters experts consider the Japanese yen to be the main favourite, and the Swiss franc to be the outsider. Experts expect the USD/JPY to fall by 7.5% in a year due to divergence in monetary policy. The futures market sees a 90% probability of an overnight rate hike on 19 December to 0.75%, the highest since 1995. Bloomberg insiders claim that Kazuo Ueda will signal a continuation of the normalisation cycle if economic forecasts are realised.\nThe unexpected reluctance of consumer prices in Switzerland to rise in November is putting pressure on the National Bank, as is the slowdown in core inflation to its lowest level since August 2021. The SNB has previously stated that it would like to avoid a return to negative interest rates. Still, the official forecast of 0.4% CPI growth in the fourth quarter is unlikely to materialise. As a result, the chances of a return to negative interest rates are increasing, putting pressure on the franc.\nThe FxPro Analyst Team\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

                "body": "EUR/USD Weekly Forecast: Bulls pray for a dovish Fed\n- EUR/USD comes under pressure after hitting new two-month peaks around 1.1680\n- The US Dollar remains on the back foot, always on the back of speculation of Fed rate cuts.\n- The Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to trim its interest rates next week.\nIn the last few days\u2026\nEUR/USD has finally taken a breather after a pretty energetic climb. The pair broke above 1.1680 in the second half of the week, reaching its highest levels in around two months before running into some selling pressure. Even so, it has gained almost two cents from the late-November dip just below 1.1500 the figure.\nThis whole upswing has closely shadowed the US Dollar (USD) moving in the other direction. Indeed, the US Dollar Index (DXY) slipped back below 99.00, a terrain we hadn\u2019t seen since late October, as traders keep adjusting expectations around the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) plans.\nAt the same time, both US Treasury yields and German 10-year bund yields have rebounded, with the latter advancing toward multi-week highs near 2.80%.\nBets for a dovish Fed and a prudent ECB underpin the uptick\nThe US Dollar\u2019s weakness comes down to a growing belief that the Fed could deliver another 25-basis-point cut at its December 10 meeting. There\u2019s also increasing speculation that the next Fed Chair may come from the dovish side of the spectrum and be more aligned with the White House, which adds to the pressure on the Greenback as we turn the page into December.\nMarket pricing currently leans heavily toward a cut next week, and traders think the Fed could have delivered around 82 basis points of easing by the end of 2026.\nMeanwhile, in Euroland, the European Central Bank (ECB) has taken a more cautious stance. Rates were held unchanged at 2.00% for a third consecutive meeting in late October, after hefty 200 basis points of cuts earlier in the year. Inflation has steadied, growth isn\u2019t far off expectations, and for now, policymakers see no real urgency to act again.\nECB President Christine Lagarde has acknowledged that global risks have calmed a bit, in part because US-China tensions have softened, but she also stressed the high levels of uncertainty still hanging over the outlook.\nThe latest Accounts showed a broad consensus to stay put. Markets seem to agree: December 18 is widely expected to bring another hold, with only the mildest moves priced in over the course of 2026.\nShutdown\u2019s dark clouds\nWhile monetary policy has been the main driver, politics has chimed in, too.\nThe US government may be back open after a 43-day shutdown, but the respite looks brief. Lawmakers simply pushed the next funding deadline to January 30, so another showdown is already pencilled into the diary.\nThis time, the narrative shifted: Democrats highlighted the strain on healthcare costs for roughly 24 million Americans, while Republicans criticised the disruption to incomes and benefits, pointing to a national debt now surging past $38 trillion and expanding by about $1.8 trillion every year.\nIn other words, the fiscal story is far from resolved, and that uncertainty can easily keep the Dollar on edge.\nTech corner\nEUR/USD\u2019s rally has slowed right around the 1.1700 region. A move above the December 4 high at 1.1682 could reignite upward momentum, potentially opening the way toward the October 17 peak at 1.1728 and even the October 1 high at 1.1778.\nIf the pair loses altitude instead, the November 21 low at 1.1491 is the first area to watch, seconded by the November 5 trough at 1.1468, which is propped up by the 200-day SMA at 1.1461. Below that lies the August 1 low at 1.1391 before bigger support kicks in around 1.1210 from May 29 and 1.1064 from May 12.\nMomentum indicators still paint a cautiously constructive picture: the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and magnitude of recent price moves, is sitting near 56, comfortably above the midpoint of 50. That suggests the market still has some positive momentum and "

The UK\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) raised the country\u2019s GDP forecast for 2025 to 1.5% from the previous forecast of 1%.\nPound Sterling, however, capitalized on the absence of any major tax burden on households, as the Labour Party stuck to its self-imposed rule of avoiding fresh borrowings for day-to-day spending, as explained by FXStreet\u2019s Analyst Sagar Dua.\nAcross the Atlantic, the USD faced headwinds from persistent dovish expectations for the US Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) December monetary policy meeting and beyond.\nA flurry of unimpressive US data releases kept the bets for a 25 basis points (bps) December Fed rate cut elevated around 90%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool.\nEarlier in the week, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Services PMI showed little improvement in November at 52.6 versus 52.4 in October, while the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) said that US private payrolls unexpectedly declined by 32K in November, following a revised 47K increase. Analysts estimated a job gain of 5K.\nData on Thursday showed that the Initial Claims for state unemployment benefits fell 27,000 to a seasonally adjusted 191,000 for the week ended November 29, the lowest level since September 2022.\nHowever, data published by Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that employers reported 71,321 job cuts in November, its highest level for that month since 2022. Mixed US economic data did little to alter markets\u2019 expectations of a Fed rate cut this month.\nFurther weighing on the USD were US President Trump\u2019s repeated comments that he has \u201calready decided\u201d who will replace Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in May 2026.\nFollowing his recent references and media reports, markets considered White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett as Trump\u2019s top pick for the next Fed Chair.\nHassett has endorsed Trump\u2019s calls for lower rates on several occasions as the head of the National Economic Council (NEC).\nHeading toward the weekend, the pair held its bullish streak after the delayed September US annual core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 2.8%, against the expected increase of 2.9% in the same period.\nMeanwhile, the University of Michigan (UoM) preliminary Consumer Sentiment climbed to 53.3 in December, compared to November\u2019s 51 and 52 forecast. The one-year Consumer Inflation Expectations declined to 4.1% in December after reporting 4.5% in November.\nFocus on Fed policy announcements and UK GDP\nIt\u2019s a relatively busy week, in terms of economic events, with the Fed policy announcements on Wednesday likely to stand out.\nA 25 bps rate cut by the Fed is almost certain, and hence, all eyes will be on the US central bank\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the so-called Dot Plot chart, for fresh insights on the interest rate path for 2026.\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s words at the post-policy meeting press conference will also hold weight, having a significant impact on the USD and the GBP/USD pair.\nAhead of the Fed event risk, Tuesday\u2019s US JOLTS Job Openings and the ADP Weekly Employment Change data will be eagerly awaited.\nLater in the week, the monthly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the "

The market has priced in a near-certain 25-basis-point cut by the Fed next week, while expectations for a BoE easing cycle are also firming. This rare alignment\u2014dual rate cuts on both sides of the Atlantic\u2014has left Cable (GBP/USD) in a holding pattern, defying its typical directional bias.\nPound Sterling (GBP) Balances Between UK Easing Bets and Dollar Weakness\nAfter testing 1.3384, its highest level since late October, GBP/USD retreated to 1.3325, consolidating gains from November\u2019s rally. The pair remains resilient despite both central banks shifting toward policy accommodation. The UK Autumn Budget initially boosted optimism, pushing the pound higher as fiscal measures were viewed as growth-supportive. However, economists now see a clear signal that the Bank of England is preparing for its first rate cut since early 2024, with 90% market probability priced in for a 0.25% reduction at the next meeting.\nThe BoE\u2019s challenge lies in cutting rates without reigniting inflation. The latest CPI reading cooled to 3.9%, down from 4.3% in October, while core inflation slowed to 4.4%. Wage growth has softened to 6.2% YoY, marking the slowest pace in ten months. These trends give policymakers the cover they need to ease, especially as real income pressure lingers. Sterling\u2019s strength against the dollar is therefore being tempered by growing conviction that the UK\u2019s rate cycle has peaked.\nUS Dollar (USD) Faces Structural Weakness Ahead of Fed Cut\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) continues to hover around 98.90, its lowest in five weeks, reflecting broad expectations of a Federal Reserve pivot. Futures markets now assign 89\u201392% odds of a 25-basis-point cut at the December 10 FOMC meeting, lowering the target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. This comes as the Fed grapples with a weakening labor market\u2014Nonfarm Payrolls rose only 85,000 versus the 150,000 forecast\u2014and core PCE inflation cooled to 3.2%, reinforcing the dovish narrative.\nJobless claims improved sharply to 191,000, their lowest since September 2022, but traders have largely dismissed this strength as a lagging indicator, emphasizing instead the downward trajectory in aggregate employment momentum. The U.S. federal shutdown delay in data reporting has left the macro picture incomplete, but traders remain confident that monetary easing is imminent. This structural dollar softness has kept GBP/USD anchored near its upper range despite intermittent pullbacks.\nDerivative and Options Flows Reinforce Sterling Upside Bias\nPositioning in the options market reveals a growing conviction toward a stronger pound. Traders have accumulated call positions on GBP/USD at strike levels of 1.3400 and 1.3450, with expirations extending into January 2026. The structure indicates expectations for a post-Fed breakout, echoing patterns seen in the 2019 easing cycle, when multiple preemptive rate cuts drove the dollar lower for several months. Implied volatility for the December 10 window has spiked to 10.8%, suggesting traders anticipate a sharp directional move once policy clarity emerges.\nRead More\n-\nCGDV ETF Surges to $43.64 as Dividend CAGR Hits 21.7% Signals Upside Toward $50\n05.12.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRPI and XRPR Fall with XRP-USD at $2.06 as $887M XRP ETF Inflows Fail to Break Resistance\n05.12.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Blasts Through $5.24 as NG=F Ignites a 35-Month High on Cold Weather and Record LNG Demand\n05.12.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast -"

From a trading standpoint, a good zone to reduce portions of long-exposure / raise protective stops. Losses should be limited to 6569 IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a close above the upper parallel / 6653 needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\nKeep in mind we get the release of the RBA and FOMC interest rate decisions next week. The focus will be on the Fed\u2019s updated Summary of Economic Projections, and the interest rate dot-plot will be critical as investors adjust the outlook for monetary policy next year.

A decisive close above this area would open the door toward this year\u2019s peak at 0.6707, marked on September 17, which also stands as the year-to-date high and the highest level since October 2024. Beyond that, the psychological 0.6800 mark becomes the next bullish target if momentum continues to build.\nMomentum indicators reinforce the improving tone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is holding near 68, approaching overbought territory but still reflecting firm upward momentum. Meanwhile, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has climbed toward 19, signalling that trend strength is beginning to recover after a subdued period.\nEconomic Indicator\nRBA Interest Rate Decision\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the RBA is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is usually bullish for the Australian Dollar (AUD). Likewise, if the RBA has a dovish view on the Australian economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is seen as bearish for AUD.\nRead more.Next release: Tue Dec 09, 2025 03:30\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 3.6%\nPrevious: 3.6%\nSource: Reserve Bank of Australia\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and commodities market.

                "body": "The AUD/USD pair has risen near a two-month high of 0.6620. The Australian Dollar outperforms, suggesting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may tighten monetary policy to address inflation expectations.\nData shows the Australian Dollar (AUD) surged 1.15% against the US Dollar (USD) this week. Canadian Dollar fell by 1.15% against AUD, while the Euro (EUR) dropped by 0.80%.\nAustralian Household Spending Growth\nAustralian household spending grew to 1.3% in October from September\u2019s 0.3%, boosting RBA hawkishness. In contrast, the US Dollar is subdued as there\u2019s confidence the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon.\nOn Friday, AUD/USD trades at 0.6622, with technical indicators suggesting continued bullish momentum. Positive trends exhibited by a 20-day Exponential Moving Average slope and a strong 14-day Relative Strength Index reading signal potential further gains.\nThe US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision is keenly watched. Probabilities indicate an 87% chance of a rate cut by 25 basis points in December, which could affect the USD. Federal Reserve seeks to keep inflation at 2% and maintain full employment through its monetary policy decisions.\nThe AUD/USD is showing significant strength, nearing 0.6620 after an eleven-day run. We see this as a result of differing monetary policies between Australia and the United States. This divergence presents a clear opportunity for the coming weeks.\nOutlook and Strategy\nWe believe the Reserve Bank of Australia will remain hawkish, especially with recent data supporting their stance. For instance, Australia\u2019s Q3 2025 inflation report showed core inflation at 3.1%, stubbornly above the RBA\u2019s target range. Governor Bullock\u2019s recent comments about taming inflation expectations only reinforce our view that another rate hike isn\u2019t off the table.\nOn the other side, we see the US Dollar weakening as the Federal Reserve prepares to cut rates next week. The latest November jobs report showed unemployment ticking up to 4.2%, and recent CPI data has inflation cooling towards 2.5%, giving the Fed ample reason to ease policy. Markets are pricing in an 87% chance of a rate cut, which is a powerful headwind for the dollar.\nGiven this outlook, we are considering buying AUD/USD call options to capitalize on the expected upward move. A January 2026 call option with a strike price around 0.6700 could offer good leverage if the pair breaks its recent highs. This strategy limits our downside risk to the premium paid, which is prudent ahead of a major central bank decision.\nWe must, however, remember the lessons from late 2023 and early 2024. Back then, the market also aggressively priced in Fed rate cuts, but a resilient US economy forced the Fed to delay, causing the dollar to rebound sharply. A similar surprise from the Fed next week could quickly unwind this entire AUD/USD rally.\nTechnically, the pair is in a clear uptrend, holding well above the 20-day moving average at 0.6542. This level should act as our line in the sand; a daily close below it would signal a potential reversal and a reason to exit long positions. Our primary target remains the September high of 0.6660, which we will watch as a key resistance level."

                "body": "USD/JPY Outlook: The Yen Attempts to Gain Ground Amid a Possible BOJ Policy Shift\nOver the past five trading sessions, USD/JPY has accumulated a decline of more than 0.6% in favor of the Japanese yen, as the currency begins to strengthen following recent comments from the Bank of Japan, which suggest a more aggressive monetary policy stance toward year-end. For now, selling pressure remains dominant in the short term, and this bias could continue if a more restrictive policy is confirmed by the BOJ and if U.S. dollar weakness persists.\nIs the Bank of Japan Changing Its Stance?\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s final meeting of the year will take place between December 18\u201319, and although it was initially expected that the interest rate would remain at 0.5%, this outlook has shifted after recent statements from the central bank. The BOJ governor noted that the institution is prepared to evaluate a possible rate hike at the December meeting, given persistent inflationary pressure linked to wage increases as well as rising import costs due to the yen\u2019s depreciation, which could be contributing to imported inflation.\nInflation data supports these concerns: from the 2.7% low in August, inflation has climbed to 3.0% in October, raising doubts about the BOJ\u2019s ability to reach its 2.0% target in the short term. In response, the board is reportedly considering a 0.25% rate hike, an unexpected move from a central bank known for maintaining one of the lowest interest rates in the world.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nIn this scenario, a potential shift toward a more restrictive monetary policy could strengthen the yen, as a higher interest rate would increase the yield on Japanese bonds, attracting foreign capital. This could sustain yen demand heading into late 2025 and generate continued selling pressure on USD/JPY in the weeks ahead.\nThe Dollar Shows No Recovery\nIn the United States, expectations of lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve have prevented the dollar from recovering. A more dovish stance from the Fed has reduced the appeal of the U.S. fixed-income market, decreasing foreign interest in holding dollars consistently.\nThis weakness is clearly reflected in the DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against other assets and is currently trading below the 100-point zone, signaling a sustained decline in dollar strength over recent sessions.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nIf the DXY continues to weaken below this reference level, dollar demand may remain limited, allowing the yen to continue gaining ground and maintaining persistent selling pressure on USD/JPY.\nUSD/JPY Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Aggressive Uptrend Comes to an End: Since early October, USD/JPY had sustained an aggressive bullish trendline, reaching levels near the yearly highs around 158 yen per dollar. However, a recent bearish movement has broken through that trendline, and if selling pressure continues, a dominant bearish bias may begin to take shape in the short term.\n- RSI: The RSI maintains a consistent downward slope and is moving closer to the 50 neutral level, indicating that bearish momentum could strengthen further in the short term. If this pattern persists, more consistent selling pressure could continue influencing USD/JPY.\n- MACD: The MACD shows a histogram consistently oscillating below the zero line, indicating that the dominant strength in short-term moving averages remains bearish. If the histogram continues below zero, a stronger bearish bias could emerge in the coming sessions.\nKey Levels:\n- 158.207 \u2013 Key Resistance: This level corresponds to the yearly highs and represents the most important bullish barrier for 2025. A sustained move above it could reactivate the aggressive bullish trendline that dominated prior sessions.\n- 155.000 \u2013 Nearby Barrier: A psychological neutrality zone. As long as the price remains around this level, a short-term sideways range may develop.\n- 153.300 \u2013 Main Support: This level represents the strongest "

The USD\u2019s yield advantage has continued to erode. However, downside risks from a Fed rate cut already appear largely priced in. In fact, the USD could find support if the Fed pairs the cut with more hawkish rhetoric. We expect the Fed to signal that the pace of rate cuts will likely slow next year and become increasingly data-dependent. A more prolonged pause at the start of next year could help limit further downside for the USD. Meanwhile, the JPY has been buoyed by signals from the BoJ that it plans to resume rate hikes this month. Policymakers in Japan will be hoping that a BoJ rate hike alongside a Fed rate cut will help reverse the sharp weakening trend in the JPY. Otherwise, pressure will continue to build for another round of intervention to support the currency\nUSD WEAKENS FOR 2ND WEEK AHEAD OF FOMC MEETING\nSource: Bloomberg, 14:45 GMT, 5th December 2025 (Weekly % Change vs. USD)\nTrade Ideas:\nWe are closing our long EUR/GBP and short CAD/CHF trade recommendations.\nWeekly Calendar:\nThere is busy schedule of G10 central bank policy meetings scheduled for the week ahead including: i) the RBA on Tuesday, ii) the BoC and Fed on Tuesday, and iii) the SNB on Thursday.\nShort Term Regression Modelling:\nOur BEER fair value model indicates that USD/JPY is trading above its estimated equilibrium, signalling that the pair is overstretched and expensive. Historically, short-term rate differentials have been the dominant driver of USD/JPY price action, but their influence has diminished recently confirming a structural shift in the currency\u2019s dynamics.\nFX Views\nUSD/JPY: Weighing up risks ahead of Fed & BoJ policy meetings\nThe USD is on track to weaken for a second consecutive week ahead of the Fed\u2019s final policy meeting of 2025. After twice failing to break above the 100.00 level in November, the dollar index has retreated into the 96.000\u2013100.00 trading range that has persisted since Q2. Recent price action suggests the USD continues to consolidate at weaker levels following the sharp sell-off in the first half of this year. The correction lower over the past couple of weeks has been driven by a dovish repricing of Fed rate expectations, with the U.S. rates market now almost fully pricing in a third consecutive rate cut in the week ahead.\nThere has been no strong pushback from Fed officials against rate-cut expectations since New York Fed President Williams stated on 21 November that he still \u201csees room for a further adjustment in the near term to the target range for the federal funds rate to move the stance of policy closer to the range of neutral.\u201d His comments sent a strong signal that the Fed leadership remains inclined to deliver one final rate cut this year, encouraged by signs of a loosening labour market. However, the FOMC appears increasingly divided over the need for further easing. After Fed Governor Jeffrey Schmid voted to hold rates steady at the October meeting, it would not be surprising to see more dissents next week. Several officials, including Chicago Fed President Goolsbee and St. Louis Fed President Musalem, have indicated they favour leaving rates unchanged. But we are not expecting significant changes to the FOMC\u2019s updated projections for the economy or the policy rate.\nTo push through a rate cut, Fed leadership may need to pair it with more hawkish guidance. We expect the updated communication to signal that the pace of rate cuts will likely slow next year, while emphasizing that the path remains highly data-dependent. A rate hike at the January FOMC meeting is already seen as unlikely by the U.S. rates market, and current pricing suggests roughly a 50:50 probability of another cut by March. By the January meeting, the Fed will have greater clarity on "

The multi-session decline is not the product of a single catalyst but a convergence of pressures that are finally reversing the rate-differential dominance that pushed the pair to record highs earlier this year. Traders are now confronting a macro environment where the Federal Reserve is preparing a third consecutive rate cut while the Bank of Japan signals its clearest intent yet to raise interest rates at the December 18\u201319 meeting. That reversal in directional bias has triggered the fastest two-week JPY recovery since September, reinforced by repeated failures of USD/JPY to regain momentum above the 100-hour SMA and the 155.40 intraday barrier.\nUSD/JPY Reacts To Fed\u2019s Third Cut Expectations As Yield Advantage Compresses Sharply\nThe weakening USD has driven the bulk of the pair\u2019s recent retreat. The USD index has dropped into a 96.000\u2013100.000 band after twice failing to maintain levels above 100.00 in November. Rate markets are now pricing with roughly ninety percent probability that the Fed will cut again at the upcoming meeting. Initial jobless claims falling by twenty-seven thousand to 191,000 and Challenger job cuts declining fifty-three percent to 71,321 helped prevent a deeper USD slide, yet did not reverse the overall bearish shift because traders remain convinced that the FOMC is committed to easing policy further. The market is even split on whether another cut arrives by March, meaning the path of least resistance still leans toward reduced USD carry advantage. These adjustments compress the rate gap that previously propelled USD/JPY toward 158.00. The pair\u2019s inability to respond to stronger US labor prints confirms how dominant policy expectations have become over shorter-term economic beats.\nBoJ\u2019s Pivot Strengthens JPY As Ueda Prepares Investors For December Lift-Off\nJapanese policy dynamics have transformed materially. Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled that the BoJ will weigh the pros and cons of raising rates this month, and Reuters sources subsequently confirmed that a hike is likely unless a major shock intervenes. This marks the most hawkish positioning from the BoJ in years, reinforced by the Q4 Tankan survey and the government\u2019s decision not to obstruct monetary tightening even under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s expansive fiscal agenda. The result has been a rapid surge in JGB yields across the curve: ten-year yields at the strongest levels since 2007, twenty-year yields at highs last seen in 1999, and thirty-year yields printing fresh historical records. These moves compress the global rate differential, traditionally the foundation of yen-funded carry trades. As carry unwind risk grows, USD/JPY becomes increasingly vulnerable to sharper downward adjustments than witnessed during standard retracements.\nUSD/JPY Tracks Yen Momentum Despite Domestic Weakness As Fiscal Risks And Bond Movements Dominate Capital Flows\nJapan\u2019s macro data has not been favorable. Household spending fell 2.9 percent year-on-year in October, missing expectations for a gain and marking the fastest contraction in nearly two years. Under normal circumstances, such weakness would undermine the yen. Instead, investors have looked past domestic softness because sovereign yield dynamics overpower consumption data in FX pricing. Concerns about Japan\u2019s fiscal trajectory, elevated bond yields, and anticipation of the first real rate hike since the normalization experiment of 2024\u20132025 sustain demand for the curre"

The decline marks the largest single-day, and single-week declines since May, with USD/CAD plunging nearly 2.2% off the November highs.\nA break of the July uptrend highlights the threat for further weakness in the days ahead with more significant support now in view at 1.3734/69- a region defined by the 2025 low-week close (LWC) and the 61.8% retracement of the advance off the yearly lows. Note that the lower parallel of the June pitchfork converges on this threshold into the close of the year- look for a larger reaction there IF reached. A break / weekly close below this critical range would be needed suggest a more significant high is place and a larger trend reversal is underway. Subsequent support objectives rest with the 78.6% retracement at 1.3669 and the 2025 close-low at 1.3583.\nInitial resistance is now eyed with the 2023 high at 1.3899 and is backed by the 2022 swing high at 1.3978- note that former channel support converges on this threshold over the next few weeks. Ultimately, a breach / weekly close above the 52-week moving average near this week\u2019s high at 1.4010/15 would be needed to mark uptrend resumption (bearish invalidation). Critical resistance remains with the 50% retracement of the yearly range and the February LWC at 1.4167/84.\nBottom line: USD/CAD remains vulnerable after plunging through multi-month uptrend support with weekly momentum dropping to the lowest levels since August. From a trading standpoint, rallies should be limited to the 1.39-handle IF price is heading lower on this stretch- look to reduce short-exposure / lower protective stops on a stretch towards 1.3734.\nKeep in mind we get the release of both the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve interest rate decisions next week. The BoC is widely expected to leave rates unchanged with the recent labor data fueling speculation that the central bank may look to hike in 2026.

                "body": "The British Pound\u2019s upward movement against the Japanese Yen has slowed just below the resistance level of 207.35. Protective stances by Japanese authorities have lent support to the Yen, with GBP/JPY forming an ascending triangle pattern, often suggesting a bullish process.\nThe Pound has increased by roughly 3.5% since early November. However, recent actions have failed to breach the 207.35 mark, hindered partly by Japanese warnings to prevent excessive Yen weakening. Japanese officials, including Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara, have reaffirmed intentions to address excessive volatility for the Yen.\nTechnicals Driving GBP/JPY\nThe GBP/JPY currently forms an ascending triangle with its peak at 207.35. If the pair moves above this level, it may target the 2024 peak at 208.15, following a 127.2% Fibonacci extension, with further projections at 209.15 and 210.30. Conversely, a downward movement could find support at the triangle\u2019s base near 205.85, close to recent lows at 205.20 and 204.30.\nThis week\u2019s currency changes show the Yen as strongest against the US Dollar. The heat map outlines currency fluctuations, with the Japanese Yen seeing changes of -0.31% against the Pound, 0.79% against the Euro, and 0.75% against the Swiss Franc.\nGiven the Pound\u2019s rally against the Yen has paused below the 207.35 resistance level, we see this as a critical decision point. Price action is forming an ascending triangle, which typically suggests the prior uptrend will continue. Traders should be watching for a decisive break above this resistance in the coming weeks.\nThis pattern suggests positioning for a bullish move, potentially using call options with a strike price above 207.50 to capture a potential breakout. The fundamental backdrop supports this, as the interest rate differential between the UK and Japan remains significant. Recent data from November 2025 showed UK inflation persisting at 3.1%, keeping the Bank of England on a hawkish footing, while the Bank of Japan maintains its ultra-low rate policy.\nMarket Trends and Risk Management\nHowever, we must respect the threat of intervention from Japanese officials. We saw how effective their intervention was back in 2022, and while no action has been taken in recent months, their verbal warnings have provided a floor for the Yen. A protective strategy would be to purchase put options with a strike below the triangle\u2019s base of 205.85 to hedge against a sudden, intervention-driven drop.\nThe market seems to be testing the resolve of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance, as the carry trade continues to be profitable. As long as the Bank of England holds rates firm and the Bank of Japan hesitates on significant policy tightening, the path of least resistance for GBP/JPY remains upward. The positive UK services activity figures from earlier this week add another layer of support for the Pound.\nLooking ahead, we are closely watching for the upcoming UK CPI data and the next Bank of Japan policy meeting later this month. Any sign of weakening UK inflation or a more aggressive stance from the BoJ could invalidate the bullish setup. Therefore, any long positions should be managed with tight risk parameters around the key 205.85 support level."

It should in fact be stronger if this was the key driver.\n\"USDJPY has become structurally more sensitive to foreign developments than domestic ones,\" it adds.\nThe analysts argue that this flow dynamic makes the currency increasingly responsive to global risk sentiment rather than to domestic monetary settings.\n\"The yen has increasingly traded on global risk sentiment and foreign fixed-income flows, not domestic policy expectations,\" says JP Morgan. \"The domestic rate channel has weakened significantly.\"\nThe report warns that even a December rate hike at the BoJ would not fundamentally change these drivers because Japanese rates would remain low by international standards as the BoJ is judged unlikely to embark on an aggressive tightening cycle, limiting the scope for policy-led currency support.\nJP Morgan continues to expect a gradual narrowing of U.S.\u2013Japan yield spreads in 2025, but says the adjustment will be slow and insufficient on its own to generate a near-term yen reversal.\nThe bank maintains a neutral stance on USDJPY for the coming month, with a gradual move lower expected only in the middle of 2025 as U.S. yields decline and equity inflows stabilise."

The latest session delivered a sharp $194.6 million wave of outflows across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, reversing the tentative stabilization seen earlier in the week. The withdrawals were disproportionately concentrated in BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF, which alone shed $112.9 million, followed by Fidelity\u2019s FBTC with $54.2 million in redemptions. Additional outflows from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, VanEck\u2019s HODL, and Bitwise\u2019s BITB completed a day that exposed how fragile ETF demand has become as BTC-USD trades at $91,227, only days after a liquidity flush briefly forced price into the mid-$84,000 range.\nETF Trading Activity Contracts as Arbitrage Pressure Forces Unwinds Across BTC-USD Instruments\nThe drop in ETF flows coincided with a noticeable collapse in trading activity. Cumulative spot Bitcoin ETF volume shrank from $5.3 billion on Tuesday to $4.2 billion on Wednesday before falling further to $3.1 billion the following day. The deterioration reflects a market that has shifted from aggressive positioning to risk minimization, especially as the spread between Bitcoin futures and spot compressed below breakeven. Once the basis trade lost profitability, arbitrage desks were forced to unwind exposure simultaneously. This unwind required selling both ETF units and underlying BTC holdings, intensifying short-term pressure at a time when market liquidity was already thin. These mechanical exits accelerated BTC-USD\u2019s slide from the $96,000 rejection area back toward the $91,000 pivot, reinforcing how leverage remains a dominant driver of intraday price behavior.\nStructural BTC-USD Supply Signals Remain Supportive Despite Front-Loaded ETF Weakness\nShort-term ETF outflows stand in contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s broader structural backdrop. Exchange balances have fallen to approximately 1.8 million BTC, the lowest level since 2017. This contraction highlights persistent absorption by long-term holders, sovereign entities, custodial institutions, and large funds using off-exchange storage. Despite the pessimism around ETF flows, this long-duration accumulation has kept BTC-USD above critical structural levels such as the True Market Mean, and it has prevented deeper breakdowns following the week\u2019s $84,000 liquidity event. To re-establish trend strength, market watchers emphasize the importance of breaching the $96,000 to $106,000 range, which represents the confluence zone where prior cycles transitioned from consolidation to acceleration.\nIBIT\u2019s $2.7 Billion Five-Week Outflow Run Redefines Market Leadership Within Bitcoin ETFs\nThe most dramatic development in the ETF complex has been the continuous withdrawal streak from IBIT, BlackRock\u2019s flagship Bitcoin ETF and the dominant liquidity hub for institutional BTC exposure. Over the most recent five-week window, IBIT has experienced over $2.7 billion in outflows \u2014 a record-long redemption streak since the product launched in January 2024. An additional $113 million exited on December 4, positioning IBIT for a potential sixth straight week of net withdrawals. This is particularly notable considering IBIT\u2019s peak, when assets under management surpassed $71 billion during the Q1-Q3 2025 Bitcoin rally that propelled BTC-USD past $109,000 and later toward the $125,100 all-time high reached on October 5.\nThe October 10 liquidation event \u2014 which erased more than $1 trillion in aggregate crypto market value \u2014 represented the turning point for institutional sentiment.

                "body": "Today Ethereum (ETH 3.74%) is priced at about $3,100 per coin, well below its highs of about $4,800 from earlier this year. That price comes just as the network was poised to ship its Fusaka upgrade earlier this week, and as spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. continue to pull in institutional capital.\nDo those strengths, among others, make Ethereum the single best cryptocurrency to buy while it's under $4,000 today, or is there a better option?\nThis network is (still) attacking the pain points that kept people away\nPerhaps the biggest argument in favor of buying Ethereum at any price is that when you buy Ethereum, you're buying exposure to the single biggest and most important platform for decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset tokenization, and smart contract finance. Despite this year's volatility, Ethereum still hosts the largest pool of total value locked (TVL) into DeFi of any chain, with $65.6 billion.\nFusaka, the chain's newest update, is designed to reinforce that position by making the network's gas fees cheaper for users and more scalable in real usage for decentralized app developers and operators. In particular, Layer-2 (L2) rollup networks are expected to see their transaction costs fall by roughly 40% to 60%, which should help them to take on some additional traffic and relieve even more congestion on the main Ethereum network. Fusaka also adds a mechanism that makes fees less likely to surge during busy periods. Taken together, these structural changes could make Ethereum's perennial bad habit of meteoric fee spikes during periods of heavy network load a thing of the past, which could in turn make its user experience a lot less frustrating.\nCRYPTO: ETH\nKey Data Points\nBut if you are thinking of buying Ethereum at $3,100 on the expectation that Fusaka will instantly turn it into a low-fee paradise like Solana, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. If it's anything like past updates, including the Pectra package launched earlier this year, improvements to gas fee economics will be incremental and will still leave the chain with dramatically higher fees than some of its competitors.\nIs there a better investment?\nSo is Ethereum the best cryptocurrency under $4,000?\nIf you want a single growth-oriented crypto investment centered around exposure to the growth of DeFi and/or smart contract finance, the only real competitor to Ethereum is Solana. Solana is faster and cheaper to use, but its DeFi segment is far smaller with only $8.7 billion in TVL. And considering that capital tends to beget inflows of more capital, it's presently hard to say that Solana is clearly a better option based on the above criteria.\nBut if you're starting a new crypto portfolio from zero, and you're not too concerned about which drivers the upside is going to come from, Bitcoin is probably the better core holding for you. Ethereum has many more moving parts, many more competitive threats, and much more technology risk compared to Bitcoin. But buying Ethereum is still a reasonable second position for investors who already own some Bitcoin and who are comfortable taking on more complexity in exchange for potential extra upside.\nIn practice, that means Ethereum under $4,000 is somewhat attractive to purchase, but only if you size your position appropriately (which means for now, keeping it on the small side) and are prepared to hold through another full cycle of upgrades, ecosystem development, and a lot of competitive jostling along the way. If you can do that, the odds look favorable that today's price will eventually look cheap in hindsight."

                "body": "DeFi landscape has been marked by impressive growth, yet persistent volatility remains a defining feature as 2025 draws to a close. The ecosystem hit a record $237 billion in total value locked (TLV) in Q3 2025, but the exuberance was short-lived. By late November, the total TVL had contracted by $55 billion, falling to $123 billion.\nDespite these sharp fluctuations, DeFi participation has not only held steady but has gone way up. Over 14.2 million wallets were engaged in the ecosystem this year, and Ethereum continues to capture around 63% of all DeFi activity.\nThis high level of participation can be seen as a testament to DeFi\u2019s potential. However, according to some experts, the volatility has exposed a fundamental challenge: the constant need to react to market conditions, placing success out of reach for most users.\nUsers have been expected to continuously monitor liquidity ranges, adjust positions, and navigate shifting arbitrage opportunities. This has created a paradox where, despite the claim that money grows on its own, DeFi participants are actually burdened with time-consuming, manual tasks to optimize their returns.\nOne example of this view is Ron Bodkin, a former Google executive who now leads the team for AI Agent Protocol Theoriq. Bodkin claims that he has watched the burden on everyday users increase as DeFi has scaled.\n\u201cMost people came to DeFi hoping their money would work for them,\u201d Bodkin says.\n\u201cBut somehow it turned into them working for their money: checking charts at midnight, adjusting ranges in between meetings. It\u2019s kind of backwards and wears users down.\u201d\nAccording to Bodkin, real passivity won\u2019t come from asking users to do even more but from rethinking how yield is managed altogether. This sounds less like the yield-chasing days of past cycles and more like a search for tools that don\u2019t depend on users being glued to their wallets.\nBringing AI Into DeFi Without the Black Box Problem\nTheoriq\u2019s new protocol, AlphaVault, fits into a broader shift toward more autonomous forms of DeFi management. In the past year, more projects have started experimenting with the overlap between DeFi and AI (sometimes called DeFAI), using agents to help automate routine decisions and keep up with fast-moving markets.\nIt\u2019s the kind of experimentation that has slowly moved from hackathon curiosity to something protocol teams now discuss as part of long-term roadmaps. Bodkin adds:\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more interest in AI across DeFi, but the real challenge is making sure people can understand and trust what those agents are doing. Transparency has to grow alongside automation, or none of this scales the way people hope.\u201d\nAlphaVault is among the DeFi vaults experimenting with using specialized AI agents to manage user capital directly. Instead of relying on simple, rule-based compounding tools, it uses a multi-agent system built to adjust to changing market conditions. This setup was tested under real pressure during Theoriq\u2019s testnet, which processed more than 65 million agent requests across 2.1 million wallets.\nAccording to the team, one of the key differences with it and other AI Agent protocols is how it handles transparency and safety. Earlier attempts were often criticized for hiding how decisions were made.\nAlphaVault approaches this with \u201cpolicy cages\u201d, which are smart-contract rules that define exactly what an agent is allowed to do, from asset types to position sizes. These boundaries are meant to give users a clearer sense of how the system operates and reduce the risks seen in earlier AI experiments.\nAt launch, AlphaVault is integrating with established, trusted partners in the Ethereum yield space. These include Lido\u2019s stRATEGY vault, curated by Mellow Protocol, and Chorus One\u2019s MEV Max, powered by StakeWise.\nThese partnerships allow AlphaVault to allocate capital into established Ethereum yield strategies that have been used across the ecosystem. The idea is to give users a way to earn returns without constantly che"

To read full editions, subscribe.\nCrypto markets are ending the week on a muted note, with BTC giving back part of its rebound and equities largely flat ahead of next week\u2019s FOMC meeting. Against this backdrop, Solana ecosystem tokens showed remarkable relative strength.\nBTC retraced part of its recent rebound on Thursday, closing down -1.38%, though it remains up nearly 10% from Monday\u2019s $84,000 intraday low. As seen below, the S&P 500 and gold were flat on the day, while the Nasdaq slipped -0.14%.\nOn the macro front, Kevin Hassett now appears to be the frontrunner for Fed Chair, with Polymarket pricing his nomination at roughly 75%. Currently the Director of the National Economic Council and a close Trump ally, Hassett\u2019s appointment would mark a clear shift toward tighter alignment between Fed policy and the administration\u2019s economic agenda. As for the current Fed, a December rate cut is almost certain just five days ahead of the final FOMC meeting of the year, with the CME FedWatch tool assigning an 87% probability to a 25 bps cut.\nRegarding cross-sector performance, the only three crypto-related indices that were positive on the day were Miners (+6.1%), Solana Eco (+1.8%), and Crypto Equities (+0.9%). Even with Thursday\u2019s bounce, the Miners index is still down 28% over the past 30 days, making it the worst-performing index after Memecoins (-33%).\nLooking at Solana ecosystem tokens, amongst the top 10 components on our index, CLOUD (Sanctum) was the best-performer yesterday (+13%). The move comes after Forward Industries launched its own LST (fwdSOL) powered by Sanctum earlier this week. Back in May, DeFi Dev Corp. launched dfdvSOL, also using Sanctum\u2019s infrastructure.\nInstead of natively staking SOL and losing liquidity, an LST enables Solana DATCOs to earn staking yield while distributing their liquidity into other DeFi applications to expand yield earnings. Working with Sanctum, DATCOs can easily design and deploy their own LSTs to fulfill their mandate of increasing SOL per share. The Forward Industries team has bootstrapped fwdSOL with ~25% of their SOL holdings (represented by over 1.7 million fwdSOL), leading to an all-time high of 13.1 million SOL locked in Sanctum LSTs.\nGet the news in your inbox.

This is no longer a distant dream. Plume, a blockchain built for regulatory-compliant real-world assets (RWA), has just announced a pivotal move to bring its institutional-grade real-world asset yields to the Solana network. This integration bridges a crucial gap, offering crypto natives a trusted gateway to yields backed by real economy assets.\nWhat Are Real-World Asset Yields on Solana?\nSimply put, real-world asset yields are returns generated from tangible, off-chain investments like government bonds, corporate credit, or receivables. Traditionally, these are accessed through banks or brokers. Plume\u2019s initiative tokenizes these assets, allowing them to be held and traded on-chain. By bringing this to Solana, users can now tap into these yields with the speed and low cost the network is famous for. This is a significant step for decentralized finance (DeFi), moving beyond purely crypto-native yields to include those from the broader global economy.\nWhich Vaults Are Coming to Solana?\nPlume isn\u2019t starting small. The project is onboarding five established \u201cNest\u201d vaults to the Solana ecosystem, each backed by major traditional finance names. This provides immediate credibility and a diverse range of yield sources. Here are the vaults making the leap:\n- nBASIS & nALPHA: Backed by assets from Hamilton Lane and BlackOpal, focusing on institutional private credit.\n- nTBILL: Collateralized by short-term U.S. Treasury bills, offering a government-backed yield option.\n- nWISDOM & nOPAL: Featuring assets from WisdomTree and Securitize, providing access to a basket of institutional investment strategies.\nEach vault represents a different slice of the real-world economy, from private equity to secure government debt, all now accessible with a Solana wallet.\nHow Can You Maximize These Real-World Asset Yields?\nAccessing the yield is just the beginning. The Solana DeFi ecosystem is poised to amplify the utility of these tokenized RWAs. Notably, the Solana-based protocol Loopscale has plans to launch a feature that will let users employ leverage using their Nest vault tokens. This means you could potentially use your nTBILL tokens as collateral to borrow and amplify your position, seeking greater returns. However, it\u2019s crucial to remember that leverage increases risk alongside potential reward. This native integration showcases how Solana\u2019s composability can create new financial primitives around real-world asset yields.\nWhy Does This Matter for the Future of Crypto?\nThis move is more than just another protocol launch. It represents a maturation of the crypto space. By offering compliant, tangible yields, projects like Plume address a major criticism of DeFi: the lack of sustainable, non-inflationary income streams. For Solana, it strengthens the network\u2019s value proposition as a home for serious financial innovation beyond speculation. For the average user, it provides a compelling reason to hold assets on-chain, knowing they can generate steady real-world asset yields from a diversified portfolio. This bridges the gap between TradFi reliability and DeFi efficiency.\nConclusion: A New Era for On-Chain Finance\nThe arrival of Plume\u2019s RWA vaults on Solana is a landmark event. It signals a shift towards a more robust, diversified, and sustainable financial ecosystem built on blockchain technology. Users gain access to institutional-grade yield sources with the permissionless access of crypto. While navigating regulatory compliance remains key, this partnership paves the way for a future where the lines between traditional and decentralized finance continue to blur, all powered by the pursuit of genuine real-world asset yields.\nFrequently Asked Que"

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 each advanced 0.2%, bringing their weekly gains to 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The major indexes finished Thursday little changed after seesawing between small gains and losses throughout the day. The Dow and S&P 500 sit within 1% of all-time highs. The Nasdaq has about 2% to climb to set a new record.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.9% in the twelve months through September, in line with expectations. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.8% over the same period, a tenth of a percentage point slower than economists predicted.\nFriday's inflation data and labor market reports from earlier this week will factor into deliberations when members of the Fed's policy committee meet for the final time this year next Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors expect officials to lower their policy rate by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday.\nIn corporate news, Netflix (NFLX) beat out Paramount Skydance (PSKY) in a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). The deal, which values the storied movie studio and its HBO Max streaming service at nearly $83 billion, could reshape the entertainment industry, but is also expected to draw scrutiny from regulators. Netflix stock fell nearly 3%, while Paramount Skydance shares slumped close to 10%. Warner Bros. Discovery stock jumped 6%.\nMajor tech stocks were mixed. Broadcom (AVGO) stock rose more than 2%, while Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOG) each advanced more than 1%. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) inched higher. Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) each slipped about 0.5%. The tech giants have regained some of their losses from a volatile November, but most remain well below their recent highs.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, rose to 4.14% from 4.1% at yesterday's close.\nGold futures declined 0.4% to $4,225 an ounce, while West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, advanced 0.9% to $60.20 a barrel.\nBitcoin fell to $89,400 from overnight highs above $92,000. The cryptocurrency has rebounded from recent lows around $84,000, but remains far from its record of more than $125,000. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, was unchanged at 99.\nNotable S&P 500 Movers on Friday\nAdvancers:\n- Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares surged nearly 13%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the cosmetics retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and hiked its full-year forecasts. The beauty category has seen resilient demand even as economic uncertainty weighs on other retail segments. An increase in transactions and average ticket values from a year ago, along with the acquisition of British luxury cosmetics firm Space NK, and new store openings helped drive Ulta's strong performance.\n- Moderna (MRNA), which derives the bulk of its revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine, saw its stock jump close to 9% following the release of a long-term study in France indicating that the vaccine is safe and effective. The nationwide study reviewed data from around 28 million people and determined that those who received the Moderna or Pfizer (PFE) vaccine had an approximately 75% lower risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with those who were unvaccinated. Pfizer shares climbed about 1%.\n- Medical device maker Cooper Companies (COO) surpassed quarterly earnings forecasts and provided an upbeat outlook.

Both look set to deliver, even if the path proves choppier than the straight-line gains seen in parts of 2024 and 2025.\nCorporate earnings have weathered the storm of higher rates and elevated costs remarkably well. Margins have held up, productivity gains are finally showing through, and revenue growth remains solid across most sectors. The pessimism that dominated much of 2022 and 2023 has proven misplaced, with companies demonstrating pricing power and operational efficiency that exceeded expectations.\nThe AI investment boom is beginning to translate into tangible benefits. While sceptics focus on the massive capital expenditure, the productivity gains are becoming visible in corporate results. This supports both margin expansion and top-line growth, providing a foundation for continued earnings momentum through 2026.\nThe Fed, meanwhile, has room to ease policy without reigniting inflation concerns. Disinflation is sufficiently entrenched that rate cuts can proceed at a measured pace, providing a tailwind for risk assets without requiring an economic crisis to justify them. This 'goldilocks' scenario of growth with easing financial conditions is exactly what equity markets need.\nValuation concerns are overblown. Yes, the market isn't cheap, but it rarely is at the start of sustained bull runs. Elevated multiples reflect strong fundamentals and improving earnings visibility, not irrational exuberance. The concentration in mega-cap tech simply reflects where the growth is, and there's no reason to expect this leadership to falter when these companies continue to deliver.\nMid-term election years bring volatility, but the overall trajectory remains upward. Historical weakness in these periods tends to create buying opportunities rather than signalling sustained declines. With corporate balance sheets strong, share buyback activity robust, and liquidity conditions improving, the path of least resistance is higher.\nPullbacks will happen, as they always do. But the fundamental backdrop of earnings growth, Fed support and solid corporate fundamentals argues for buying dips rather than fighting the trend. The bull market has further to run.\nTechnical analysis\nDow Jones\nWhile 50,000 eluded the Dow Jones in 2025, it staged an impressive recovery from the tariff panic of April. After dropping below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) in March, and then falling to below 37,000, the index recovered its losses and then moved higher, and by mid-August it was at a new record high.\nFor the moment, the progression of new highs and higher lows confirms the solid technical outlook to match the strong earnings and macroeconomic picture.\nDow Jones candlestick chart\nS&P 500\nIt is a similar picture for this index, and the S&P 500's bigger weighting to the tech sector meant that the recovery has been even stronger. The rally since April has been remarkably quiet, with only the November pullback really threatening to disrupt the broader uptrend.\nS&P 500 candlestick chart\nA note on volatility\nApart from March-May, the year has been quite a quiet one overall. Investors and traders alike need to be prepared for the possibility that this will not be the case next year. It is now around eight months since the 20% drop in April, which means we may be closer to the next drop than to the one last April. The \u2018average\u2019 year sees at least one fall of 14% for the S&P 500, and a similar one for the Dow.\nThe quiet period of the last eight months will not last for ever, and it is important to be aware that volatility can return at some point in the new year.\nImportant to know\nThis information has been prepared by I"

                "body": "London, UK \u2013 December 5, 2025 \u2013 The British Pound (GBP) is currently experiencing a robust rally against a weakening US Dollar (USD), marking a significant shift in the global currency landscape. This surge, pushing sterling to a six-week high, comes as financial markets increasingly anticipate aggressive interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, diminishing the dollar's appeal. Simultaneously, the FTSE 100 (UKX), the benchmark index for the UK's largest public companies, continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience and growth, navigating these complex global currents with strategic investor confidence.\nThe immediate implications of this currency dynamic are profound. A stronger Pound makes imports cheaper for the UK, potentially easing inflationary pressures, while a weaker dollar could boost the competitiveness of US exports but make imports more expensive for American consumers. For the FTSE 100, which is heavily weighted towards international companies, the impact will be a mixed bag, with companies earning in dollars facing headwinds, while those with significant UK operations or import needs may benefit.\nDetailed Coverage: The Shifting Sands of Global Finance\nThe British Pound has shown considerable strength, with the GBP/USD exchange rate hovering around 1.3323 to 1.3360 on December 5, 2025. This represents a significant strengthening of 1.41% over the past month and an impressive 4.57% over the last 12 months. This upward trajectory is primarily fueled by a strong market conviction that the US Federal Reserve will initiate interest rate cuts imminently. Domestically, the Pound's ascent has been further bolstered by a reassuring UK budget, which successfully alleviated market anxieties regarding government spending, and an upward revision in the UK's November services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, signaling unexpected economic resilience.\nThe weakening of the US Dollar is largely attributed to mounting expectations of forthcoming interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve. Markets are currently pricing in a high probability, estimated between 87-90%, of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, scheduled for December 9-10, 2025. This anticipated move would lower the federal funds rate to 3.75-4.00%, effectively eroding the dollar's attractive yield advantage. Key factors contributing to these dovish expectations include a weakening US job market, evidenced by an unexpected decline of 32,000 jobs in the November ADP private-sector payrolls report, slowing inflation, and declining consumer confidence. Furthermore, the Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, is trading cautiously near a five-week low around 98.75, having broken key technical support levels, signaling a bearish trend.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) is also expected to cut interest rates in its December meeting, as inflation is projected to return to its 2% target by Spring 2026 and to support a weakening labor market. This anticipated easing path is generally viewed as supportive for the broader UK market. Initial market reactions have seen a clear flight from the dollar, with investors reallocating funds into other major currencies like the Pound and Euro. Equity markets, particularly those outside the US, are seeing increased interest as investors seek diversification away from potentially overvalued US equities and into markets offering better valuations, such as the FTSE 100.\nCompanies Navigating the Currency Currents\nThe current currency dynamics will inevitably create winners and losers among public companies, particularly those listed on the FTSE 100. Companies with significant international revenue streams, especially those generating a large portion of their earnings in US Dollars, will likely face headwinds. For instance, multinational giants like Shell plc (LSE: SHEL) and BP plc (LSE: BP), whose revenues from global oil and gas sales are prima"

                "body": "As global financial markets navigate a complex landscape of shifting monetary policies, the British Pound has emerged as a significant gainer, rallying strongly against a weakening US Dollar. This currency dynamic is largely fueled by escalating market expectations of impending interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, a move that is eroding the Dollar's yield advantage. Concurrently, London's benchmark FTSE 100 index (UKX) has shown resilience, holding near recent highs despite a slight short-term dip, as investors weigh the implications of a stronger domestic currency and global economic shifts.\nThe current environment presents a nuanced picture for investors. While a robust Pound signals confidence in the UK economy and can benefit importers, it poses challenges for exporters. The FTSE 100, a diverse index with significant international exposure, is experiencing mixed signals, reflecting the intricate interplay between currency movements, commodity prices, and global economic sentiment. The anticipation of divergent monetary policies between central banks is setting the stage for significant market adjustments as we head into the new year.\nDetailed Market Movements and the Dollar's Retreat\nAs of December 5, 2025, the financial world is keenly observing a notable divergence in market performance. The British Pound has demonstrated considerable strength, with the GBP/USD exchange rate climbing to approximately 1.3338, a 0.08% increase from the previous session, and reports indicating rates around 1.33458 USD. This rally marks a significant appreciation, with the Pound strengthening by 1.53% over the past month and a substantial 4.69% over the last 12 months against the Dollar. This recent surge has pushed the Pound to a six-week high, surpassing the $1.335 mark, driven by strong market conviction in upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts and an upward revision in the UK's November services PMI.\nIn contrast, the FTSE 100 (UKX), while performing strongly over the longer term, experienced a slight short-term dip. On December 5, 2025, the index closed at approximately 9,703.54 points, a minor decrease of 0.08%, falling to 9683 points and losing 0.28% from the prior session. Despite this marginal decline and a 0.54% drop over the past month, the index remains a robust 16.54% higher than its value a year ago, having reached an all-time high of 9930.09 in November 2025. Intraday trading saw the FTSE 100 fluctuate between 9,710.85 and 9,737.30, with an upward movement towards 9,730 earlier in the day, partly spurred by gains in major UK mining stocks and anticipation of the Federal Reserve meeting.\nThe primary catalyst for the US Dollar's weakening trend is the overwhelming market expectation of imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Investors are pricing in an almost certain 25-basis point (bps) cut, possibly as early as the following week, with further reductions anticipated in 2026. This sentiment is reinforced by cooling US labor market data, including a disappointing ADP private-sector payrolls report showing a decrease of 32,000 against an expected rise of 5,000. This erosion of the US Dollar's yield advantage, coupled with a potential divergence in monetary policy where the Bank of England also faces a split decision on rate cuts, makes the Dollar less attractive. Historically, December has also shown a seasonal tendency for the US Dollar to weaken, aligning with broader end-of-year currency patterns.\nCorporate Impact: Winners and Losers in a Shifting Landscape\nThe rally of the British Pound against a weakening US Dollar presents a mixed bag for public companies, creating both opportunities and challenges depending on their operational models and revenue streams. Companies with significant international earnings, particularly those denominated in US Dollars, are likely to face headwinds. When these Dollar-denominated profits are converted back into a stronger Pound, their value diminishes, potentially impacting repor"

In several sectors, earnings have grown faster than revenues, signalling that firms have been able to preserve pricing power or offset softer sales through productivity gains and operational efficiency improvements.\nSideways trading reflects mixed performance\nChemicals, cyclical manufacturers exposed to China \u2013 and its lacklustre growth \u2013 utilities and real estate (though not heavily represented in the DAX 40) weighed on the German stock index's performance.\nThis and the unwinding of trades where \u2018overvalued\u2019 US AI and technology plays were sold in favour of stock purchases in Europe's largest economy \u2013 such as at the beginning of the year - explain why the DAX 40 has been trading sideways since June of 2025.\nAt the same time the German blue chip index\u2019s peers have been catching up - and in the case of the Nasdaq 100 \u2013 started to outperform the DAX 40 towards the latter part of 2025.\nDAX 40 versus global peers year-to-date performance chart\nUS tariff-induced lower demand for German goods and services as well as unfavourable currency dynamics - particularly with the euro appreciating by around 15% in the first half of the year \u2013 means that exporters with a high share of US dollar (USD)-denominated sales no longer have a natural earnings tailwind.\nAI adoption supports operational efficiency\nMeanwhile, the diffusion of AI-driven automation and digitalisation is gradually filtering into core German industries, providing incremental support.\nWhile Germany is not viewed as a pure technology powerhouse, many DAX names - from industrial automation specialists to advanced manufacturers - are beginning to realise meaningful efficiency gains. These incremental improvements support margins and help cushion the cyclical downturn that has characterised much of 2023-2024.\nThe adoption of automation and digital technologies represents a structural shift that could provide sustained competitive advantages.\nECB easing provides supportive backdrop\nOn the policy front, the European Central Bank (ECB) might at present be reticent - but has scope - to ease further in 2026 without jeopardising its disinflation progress.\nEurozone inflation, which fluctuated between 1.9% and 2.5% during 2025, hovered around its 2% central bank target rate during the second half of the year.\nWith inflation expectations anchored and growth still subdued across the bloc, policymakers have room to "

But at least the Fed will get key data pertaining to the other side of its employment-nurturing, inflation-taming mandate today with the delayed release of the PCE deflator, among the Fed's favoured price statistics, although the data is for September.\nBets on a quarter-point reduction by the rate-setting FOMC on Wednesday have climbed to 87%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, firming over the past week after the private ADP jobs report showed a surprise decline in payrolls for November.\nAlthough weekly jobless claims fell to a three-year low in data on Thursday, economists say the numbers were likely skewed by the Thanksgiving holiday.\nAs a result, the dollar index is languishing near a five-week low, and stock markets globally are getting a tailwind.\nBeyond the near-sure-thing of a Fed cut this month, markets are hungry for clues about possible reductions next year, and that will be a key focus for Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference.\nBut it's not the only lead on the longer-term rates outlook, after President Donald Trump earlier this week presented White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett as a potential Fed Chair when Powell's term ends in May.\nAn FT report said bond investors expressed concerns to the Treasury over the possibility of Hassett as head of the central bank, predicting he would aggressively cut rates to align with Trump's preference for significantly easier policy settings.\nFed officials are in a blackout period ahead of the meeting, but markets - as always - need to be on alert for social media posts by Trump.\nIn Europe today, ECB chief economist Philip Lane chairs a session at a conference on fiscal policy.\nThe most significant data point in the region is UK home prices for November.\nKey developments that could influence markets on Friday:\n-UK Halifax house prices for November\n-ECB's Lane chairs session at ECB-IMF conference in Frankfurt\n-U.S. PCE deflator for September"

                "body": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants.\nThe group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old.\nThe acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status.\nThe move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids.\nThe vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age.\nAll pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative.\nBut test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household.\nThe panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost.\nEight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote.\n\"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,\" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member.\nDr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital.\n\"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,\" he said.\nMeissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure.\n\"We will see hepatitis B come back,\" he said. \"The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.\"\nIn a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is \"reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine.\" The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and \"creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.\"\nMeanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have \"never tested\" the hepatitis B vaccine \"appropriately.\"\nSome committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that "

Dugger has started all five games alongside Jalen Ramsey since joining the Steelers before their Nov. 2 win over the Indianapolis Colts, and he has recorded 1 interception, 4 passes defensed and 23 combined tackles.\nWith Dugger out, the Steelers will likely turn to former Raven Chuck Clark, whom the team signed during training camp.

                "body": "Frank Gehry, masterful architect who transformed L.A.\u2019s urban landscape, dies at 96\n-\nClick here to listen to this article - Share via\nArchitect Frank O. Gehry, who brought an alluringly new kind of shape-making to his profession even as he fundamentally changed the reputation and civic landscape of his adopted hometown of Los Angeles in such projects as the shimmering Walt Disney Concert Hall on Grand Avenue, has died. He was 96.\nGehry, who arrived in L.A. as an aimless teenager just after World War II and went on to become the most famous and one of the most influential architects in the world over a prolific six-decade career, died Friday at his home in Santa Monica following a brief respiratory illness, Gehry Partners chief of staff Meaghan Lloyd confirmed to The Times.\nFrank Gehry, through making concert halls that inspired new ideas, wound up doing more to advance music than anyone else in the 21st century.\nGehry had been widely respected among L.A. architects since the 1970s, but his global fame grew from high-level productivity late in his career. This phase, in which his firm, Gehry Partners, pioneered new ways of using technology to help realize geometrically complex buildings, began with the completion of an ambitious satellite branch of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. It opened to the public in 1997, the year Gehry turned 68.\nThe museum was widely praised for its breathtaking and sinuous profile and dramatic relationship to the Nervi\u00f3n River at its feet. Just as important, it helped reenergize and bring new media attention to architecture. Still looking for direction after the breakdown of the Modern movement and the repeated false starts of a historically minded Postmodernism, the profession badly needed a boost.\nThe new Guggenheim suggested a fresh, dynamic direction: architecture whose appeal resided in the ravishing large-scale curves made possible with digital design software and almost perfectly suited to architectural photography and display in the pages of newspapers and magazines. Suddenly cities and museums were clamoring to hire Gehry \u2014 or some other member of the growing class of top-tier star architects, or \u201cstarchitects\u201d \u2014 to try to replicate the windfall of attention and tourism dollars the new Guggenheim had produced. That windfall even earned its own nickname: the Bilbao Effect.\nOn the heels of the Guggenheim came a series of other triumphs for Gehry. They included the opening in 2003 of the long-delayed Disney Hall, designed before the Bilbao museum but completed after it, and the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College in New York.\nBeyond the Walt Disney Concert Hall, Frank Gehry also designed his own home, Loyola Law School and the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA. What he built here would help him craft a visual language that transformed urban landscapes elsewhere.\nSome critics complained that Gehry\u2019s firm, which had turned into a global powerhouse, was spreading his talents too thin, leading to disappointments such as the Experience Music Project in Seattle, finished in 2000. There were also whispers that Gehry, in an effort to recapture the Bilbao magic, was chasing ill-conceived museum commissions around the world.\nIn projects like the Guggenheim branch in Abu Dhabi, commissioned in 2006, it was suggested that the huge budgets had raced past a clear idea of what the building would mean culturally or even what kind of artwork it would hold. It came as little surprise when the building was plagued by delays. Originally scheduled to open in 2012, the Guggenheim pushed back the opening date on multiple occasions, with 2026 currently serving as the target opening \u2014 20 years after the project was announced.\nBut Gehry always seemed to have a project waiting in the wings to silence his detractors. Disney Hall was his answer to the charge, repeated frequently over the years, that he was more skilled at producing architectural sculpture than answering to practical or functi"

                "body": "By Stella Qiu\nSYDNEY, Dec 5 (Reuters) \u2013 Japan\u2019s Nikkei skidded on Friday, wiping out this week\u2019s gains amid an otherwise subdued Asian session, after weaker-than-expected spending data underscored the scourge of inflation as bets grew that the Bank of Japan would hike interest rates.\nThe Nikkei 225 fell 1.5% and was on track to end the week mostly flat. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 0.1% but was still set for a gain of 0.5% for the week.\nData showed household spending in Japan unexpectedly fell the fastest in nearly two years in October, as inflation ate into people\u2019s spending power. The yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds hit 1.94% early in Asia, its highest since mid-2007.\nThe benchmark yield was on track for a 13.5 basis point rise this week, marking the steepest five-day climb since March, but recent strong auction results suggested the cheap bond prices are drawing buyers into the market.\n\u201cIn previous cycles, moves of that size would have rattled markets. Instead, demand strengthened,\u201d said Nigel Green, chief executive at deVere Group.\n\u201cCapital flows are shifting, long-standing expectations are being tested, and portfolios built around permanently cheap yen now face a very different world.\u201d\nThe yen was last steady at 155 per dollar, well above its 10-month low of 157.9.\nA quarter-point rate hike from the Bank of Japan later this month is now being priced at 75%, after Governor Kazuo Ueda told investors on Monday the central bank would weigh the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of raising interest rates.\nSources told Reuters that the Japanese government is prepared to tolerate a hike in December.\nIn other markets, stocks are mostly steady to end the week. Australia\u2019s resources-heavy shares were little changed. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index lost 0.5%, while South Korea\u2019s shares climbed 0.7%.\nUS INFLATION DATA DUE\nIn foreign exchange markets, the dollar steadied overnight after falling for nine straight sessions as traders awaited U.S. inflation data that could sway a split Federal Reserve.\nThe dollar was off 0.1% on Friday to 99 against its major peers, and down 0.5% for the week.\nThe U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for September is due later in the day \u2013 an outdated reading given the release has been delayed by the U.S. government shutdown. Forecasts are centred on a 0.2% rise in the core measure, leaving the annual rate unchanged at 2.9%.\nThe U.S. non-farm payrolls report will not be released on Friday. Data on Thursday showed jobless claims dived last week, assuaging concerns of a sharp deterioration in the labour market, but that might be due to the Thanksgiving holiday.\nFed funds futures are pricing nearly a 90% chance of a cut next Wednesday. It could be the most contentious decision ever for the Federal Reserve. As many as five of the 12 voting members have publicly said they oppose cutting rates further.\n\u201cTariffs have stalled the improvement in inflation this year, but we remain convinced the disinflationary framework is intact,\u201d said analysts at ANZ.\n\u201cThat framework includes a softening labour market, moderating wage growth, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations \u2026 We think the data will support an FOMC rate cut next week.\u201d\nTreasury yields slipped a little on Friday after rising the previous day. Two-year Treasury yields slipped 1 basis point to 3.519%, having risen 5 basis points overnight, while the 10-year yield fell 2 bps to 4.092%, after gaining 5 bps overnight.\nBrent crude futures were flat on Friday and were set to end the week largely unchanged. [O/R]\nSpot gold prices were set to finish the week 0.8% lower at $4,198 per ounce.\n(Reporting by Stella Qiu; Editing by Tom Hogue)"

Bearish chart signals point to growing downside risks, with key support levels now in play. At the same time, BOJ hawkish bets have driven bond yields to fresh cycle highs, narrowing rate differentials and boosting the yen. If these trends persist, the headwinds for stocks could intensify, making the coming sessions critical for direction.\nBearish Chart Signals Emerge\u2026\nA bearish engulfing candle on our Japan 225 contract coincides with an obvious three-candle evening star pattern in futures, delivering a double dose of bearish signals that point to growing downside risks for Japanese stocks.\nSource: TradingView\nCurrently, long-running uptrend support dating back to the April lows and the 50DMA are in close proximity beneath where the contract trades, making that a key support zone to focus on should the signals from the price action prove reliable.\nIf we see a clean break and close beneath the zone, it would allow for shorts to be established with a stop above the 50DMA to protect against reversal, targeting 48,400 support initially. If that gives way, 47,000, 45,170 and 42,000 were levels that saw plenty of price action either side earlier in the year, putting them on the radar as targets should we see a sustained unwind.\nOf course, if the support zone comprising the 50DMA and uptrend support holds, it would allow for long setups to be considered, targeting 50,580 and 51,500 resistance initially. A stop beneath the 50DMA would protect against reversal.\nRSI (14) and MACD are delivering neutral signals, a departure from what was seen in recent months when upside strength was dominant. While both indicators are gradually moving towards bearish territory right now, the preference remains to let price action and signals determine how to proceed.\n\u2026As Macro Headwinds Build\nFundamentally, you can\u2019t escape that markets interpreted Monday\u2019s speech from Bank of Japan governor Ueda as mildly hawkish, seeing traders move to price in the risk of a 25 basis point hike on December 19 at around 80%. That saw large parts of the Japanese government bond curve rupture higher, with yields for two, five, 10 and 20-year tenors hitting fresh cycle highs, helping underpin gains in the Japanese yen as relative interest rate differentials narrowed with other nations.\nShould the trends from Monday continue, it points to mounting headwinds for Japanese equities, both from a valuation and earnings perspective given how many constituents in the Nikkei derive a large share of revenues from offshore. If the move in JGBs and yen stalls, it may act as a release valve that temporarily reduces downside risks for stocks."
