                "body": "148%+ gains in the bag: New list of AI-picked stocks for Nov will be out TOMORROW\nGold, silver, and mining stocks are not doing much, but at the same time, today\u2019s session is very meaningful.\nThis is the case because of how the precious metals sector is moving lower today, because of what the USD Index is doing, and given how it all fits gold\u2019s big picture. In short, my gold price forecast for November 2025 remains up-to-date.\nGold, silver, and miners moved lower today, and miners are leading the way. Taking a closer look at the most recent upswing reveals that miners were the first to move higher, and silver caught up. This is typical for movement in the precious metals sector, and since silver has already caught up, it seems that the declines can now continue.\nUSD Index Rises as Sentiment Turns\nThe USD Index is moving higher slowly but surely. It started to move higher after the Fed cut rates \u2013 just like it did in September. Back then, it rallied for a few weeks, so it looks like this short-term upswing has only begun.\nBut\u2026 That\u2019s not even the point. The point is that the USD Index declined severely since April while it should have moved higher given the tariff announcements and then their implementation. Instead, the sentiment kept worsening until it moved to the extreme. Remember my Peak Chaos theory? That the markets already discounted the max amount of chaos and that now they are going to reverse? I wrote about that too early with regard to the precious metals market, but it worked like a charm for the USD Index.\nAnyway, just like I wrote yesterday \u2013 when the rally in the USD Index finally becomes obvious to everyone, the PMs can truly slide. And given that we\u2019re about to see a clear monthly gain in the USD Index.\nFrom the long-term point of view, it means that the tiny breakdown below the rising red support line was invalidated and that the move below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement based on the 2008 \u2013 2022 rally was also invalidated.\nIn other words, the USD\u2019s short-term rally is most likely just a small beginning of a huge upswing.\nIt seems that taking profits from the long-term investments and from half of the insurance capital (in gold and silver) when gold was at about $4,150 and silver was above $50 was a great idea.\nWhen the USD Index finally confirms its breakout above 100, things will get really interesting, and many USD bears will be extremely surprised by the outcome.\nHistory May Repeat 2011\nSpeaking of monthly performance, we\u2019re only several hours before the end of the month and we can see that in all likelihood we\u2019re going to see a powerful monthly (!) reversal in gold in the target area that I had featured on Oct. 16.\nQuoting my Oct. 16 Gold Trading Alert:\nOn the above chart, we see that gold moved to \u2013 and even a bit above \u2013 its 1.382 Fibonacci extension based on the 1999 \u2013 2011 bull market.\nIt\u2019s also at \u2013 actually a bit above \u2013 the upper border of its very long-term, rising trend channel. All this while being extremely overbought. And while the USD Index is just waiting to soar.\nAll this creates a situation in which all those recent big gains can be reversed shortly and followed by even bigger and more volatile declines.\nRemember \u2013 we saw something similar in 2011 and back then silver erased two months of gains in one week.\nGold is now \u201cjust\u201d $200 lower than it was when I had written the above and given the monthly reversal that is about to form, the really big declines are just ahead. This would perfectly fit the scenario in which the USD Index rallies profoundly.\nSumming up, gold had a magnificent run-up and so did silver, however, it seems that this rally is over. Fortunately, this creates unique opportunities.\nWhich stocks should you consider in your very next trade?\nThe best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.\nThat's why smart investors use our Stock Screener with 50+ predefined screens and 160+ customizable filters "

                "body": "Gold slips below $4,000, heads for second weekly loss\n- Gold slips modestly on Friday, struggling to attract fresh buying interest.\n- The US Dollar and Treasury yields stay firm after the Fed\u2019s cautious guidance.\n- Technically, the short-term bias is neutral to bearish, but the underlying uptrend remains constructive.\nGold (XAU/USD) drifts lower on Friday after holding above the $4,000 level for the better part of the day as investors reassess the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) monetary policy outlook following this week\u2019s interest rate cut. At the time of writing, XAU/USD is trading around $3,985, down nearly 1.0% on the day and poised for a second straight weekly loss.\nA firmer US Dollar (USD) and steady Treasury yields are capping upside attempts in Gold, as traders scale back expectations of another rate cut this year. In his post-meeting remarks, Fed Chair Jerome Powell downplayed the likelihood of a December rate cut, saying it was \u201cnot a foregone conclusion\u201d and emphasizing that policy decisions will remain data-dependent.\nImproved market sentiment is also weighing on Bullion\u2019s safe-haven appeal after the much-anticipated meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping concluded with positive outcomes. The discussion offered some temporary relief following the recent escalation in trade tensions.\nAgainst this backdrop, Gold\u2019s near-term outlook appears neutral to slightly bearish. However, the broader uptrend remains constructive, with long-term drivers such as central bank demand and geopolitical uncertainty still intact despite the recent correction.\nMarket movers: Markets weigh Fed outlook, ongoing US shutdown\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback\u2019s strength against six major peers, is trading around 99.70 after surging to a three-month high on Thursday. Meanwhile, Treasury yields continue to edge higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield climbing nearly 30 basis points since Wednesday to a three-week high near 4.11%.\n- According to the CME FedWatch tool, market expectations for a December rate cut have dropped sharply over the past week. The probability of a 25-basis-point reduction has fallen from around 91.7% a week ago to roughly 66.8% at present, reflecting a shift toward a more cautious outlook following Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s recent comments.\n- On Thursday, US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in South Korea and agreed to a one-year trade truce until November 2026. Under the deal, the United States (US) will halve its fentanyl-related tariff to 10%, while China will remove its 10-15% retaliatory duties on various US agricultural products and delay the implementation of rare-earth export controls announced earlier this month.\n- The US government shutdown has now entered its fifth week, with no breakthrough after the Senate adjourned on Thursday. Senators are scheduled to reconvene on Monday, but talks remain stalled despite President Donald Trump's urging Republicans to end the filibuster to push funding bills through. The shutdown is already delaying key US economic data releases and raising concerns over its broader economic impact.\n- Looking ahead, next week\u2019s set of US private-sector data, including the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), JOLTS Job Openings, ADP Employment Change, Challenger Job Cuts, University of Michigan sentiment survey, and the New York Fed\u2019s inflation expectations survey, will provide key insights into the labor market and inflation outlook.\nTechnical analysis: XAU/USD capped below $4,050 as sellers defend key resistance\nXAU/USD appears to be entering a consolidation phase following an extended rally and a healthy correction \u2014 a setup that resembles accumulation before the next directional leg.\nOn the 4-hour chart, the metal is facing immediate resistance at $4,020-$4,050, a former support-turned-resistance zone. A sustained move above this area could open"

                "body": "Mumbai, India \u2013 October 31, 2025 \u2013 Precious metals, gold and silver, are experiencing a notable easing on India's Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) today, as a formidable strengthening of the U.S. dollar takes center stage in global financial markets. This downturn underscores the classic inverse relationship between the world's reserve currency and dollar-denominated commodities, making bullion less attractive for international investors and signaling a shift in investor sentiment.\nThe current market dynamics see investors pivoting away from traditional safe-haven assets like gold and silver, drawn instead to the bolstered appeal of the U.S. dollar. This movement is not merely a fleeting trend but a reflection of deeper economic signals, including the U.S. Federal Reserve's cautious monetary policy outlook, which is providing significant tailwinds for the greenback and consequently exerting downward pressure on the price of bullion.\nDollar's Ascent Dents Bullion's Luster\nThe retreat in gold and silver prices on the MCX on October 31, 2025, is a direct consequence of a robust U.S. dollar, which is trading near a three-month high. Gold futures for December delivery on the MCX opened lower, declining 0.29% to Rs 1,21,148 per 10 grams, following a close of Rs 1,21,508 the previous day. Silver futures mirrored this trend, opening 0.47% down at Rs 1,48,140 per kg. By midday, both metals continued their decline, with gold falling around 0.25% to Rs 1,21,200 per 10 grams and silver decreasing by over half a percent. This downward pressure is attributed to a combination of profit-taking by traders and the anticipation of crucial U.S. economic data releases. Earlier in the week, on October 27, MCX gold futures had already fallen by 0.78% to \u20b91,22,490 per 10 grams, and silver futures declined by 1.07% to \u20b91,45,898 per kilogram.\nThe timeline leading to the dollar's current strength is marked by key policy decisions and economic indicators. The U.S. Federal Reserve's October 29, 2025, decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing the benchmark rate to 3.75%-4.00%, was accompanied by cautious commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding future easing. This uncertainty was interpreted as a hawkish signal by the market, tempering optimism in the bullion sector and making the dollar a more appealing investment vehicle. Resilient U.S. economic data, such as stronger-than-expected non-farm payrolls earlier in June 2025, has also played a crucial role in enhancing the dollar's valuation. Furthermore, improved global sentiment, including positive developments in U.S.-China trade talks, has reduced the traditional safe-haven demand for gold, further bolstering the dollar's position.\nKey players in this scenario include the U.S. Federal Reserve, whose monetary policy decisions directly influence currency strength and, by extension, commodity prices. Major central banks globally also play a role through their own monetary policies, which can affect relative currency strengths. On the MCX, traders and institutional investors are the immediate stakeholders reacting to these global cues. Initial market reactions have seen a clear shift from non-yielding assets like gold and silver towards interest-bearing dollar assets, highlighting a renewed confidence in the U.S. economy and its currency. Despite the recent dip, gold had been on a spectacular rally throughout 2025, reaching an all-time high near $4,381.58 earlier in the year and aggressively testing the $4,000 per ounce barrier on October 30, 2025, indicating that the current easing might be a short-term correction within a broader bullish trend for the metal. Spot gold internationally fell 0.5% to $4,004 per ounce on October 31.\nCorporate Fortunes Shift: Miners Brace for Headwinds, Jewelers See Sparkle\nThe current macroeconomic environment, characterized by easing gold and silver prices and a strengthening U.S. dollar, is creating a distinct divergence in fortunes across various indu"

                "body": "Saudi Arabia's unbeatable AI pitch? Having oil and gas to burn\nAt a time when US consumers are frustrated with high energy bills, in part due to data centres, Saudi Arabia is pitching itself as an AI hub with a different message: invest in data centres here, and we will power them on the cheap.\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has one real comparative advantage when it comes to AI, and that is cheap electricity,\u201d Greg Priddy, an energy expert at the Center for the National Interest, told Middle East Eye.\n\u201cBy almost every other metric, it would be better to build centres somewhere else,\u201d he said.\nBut the lure of ultra-cheap energy, thanks to old-school fossil fuels, means Saudi Arabia has a fighting chance to become an AI powerhouse, experts say.\nAI was front and centre during the Future Investment Initiative conference (FII) in Riyadh this week, where Saudi executives said they plan to make the desert kingdom the third-biggest player in AI alongside superpowers China and the US.\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\nSaudi AI company Datavolt is building a $5bn data centre on the kingdom\u2019s Red Sea coast. Meanwhile, Humain, an AI firm owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s $1 trillion Public Investment Fund (PIF), is building data centres from Riyadh to Dammam, that it says will have 6.6 gigawatts of capacity by 2034.\nThat kind of ambition needs to be put into perspective, because it would be laughable in almost any rich, medium-sized western country, experts say.\n\u201cWe are talking about a number that is one and a half times Denmark\u2019s entire electricity use per year,\u201d Pierre Pinson, an expert at Data-centric Design Engineering at Imperial College London, told MEE.\nTo be sure, Saudi Arabia needs to massively expand its electrical grid to feed that kind of power to its data centres, \u201cbut it is developing\u201d, Pinson said. \u201cSay in five years, this is not mission impossible\u201d.\nThe main reason is that Saudi Arabia has vast reserves of fossil fuels.\n'Profitability'\nTo be sure, there are numerous ways to generate electricity, including clean options such as wind and solar, but the amount of power required to run data centres means companies will take anything they can get, experts say.\nData centres are basically sprawling compounds with rows of computers and servers that house AI chips. They need electricity to run and, importantly, to be cooled down. In the US, tech companies are turning to gas turbines to power data centres.\nSaudi Arabia generates about 60 percent of its electricity from natural gas. Because oil is so plentiful in the Gulf state and easy to extract, Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world that still generates electricity by burning crude and fuel oil, which contributes to a little more than one-third of its electricity generation. Solar contributes about two percent to Saudi Arabia\u2019s electricity, but that number is growing fast.\n'You are going to have the lowest-cost energy to build data centres anywhere in the world'\n- Amin Nasser, CEO of Aramco\nAs would be expected in the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, gas prices in Saudi Arabia are very cheap. The price of electricity is also a bargain compared to Europe and even the relatively energy-rich US.\nCommercial electricity prices in Saudi Arabia are anywhere from 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the global average, according to a report by consulting firm Roland Berger.\n\"This significant saving can directly improve data center operators' profitability,\u201d the authors said.\nThe link between Saudi energy and AI was on full display on Tuesday, when state-backed oil giant Saudi Aramco announced plans to acquire a \"significant minority stake\" in Humain.\n\u201cData centres need lower-cost energy,\u201d Amin Nasser, the CEO of Aramco, said last year, in a pitch to the AI industry. \u201cYou are going to have the lowest-cost energy to build data centres anywhere in the world because this is the place for "

That\u2019s down from over $67 per barrel for Brent crude and $62 per barrel for WTI at the end of September.\n\u201cThe market is now watching this weekend\u2019s OPEC+ meeting and discussions of its output policy,\u201d ANZ analysts said in a report, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies significantly lift risks to supply,\u201d which could provide motivation for OPEC+ to agree on another 137,000-bpd production boost for December.\nAccording to Reuters, this would combine with rising non-OPEC supply to continue pressuring oil prices. The publication cited U.S. Energy Information Administration preliminary data suggesting U.S. crude output hit 13.6 million barrels daily in the week to October 24.\nThe prospect of China agreeing to buy more U.S. energy should have had a bullish effect on prices but that effect appears to have been offset by data showing factory activity in China shrank in October by more than analysts expected, falling to the lowest in six months. The PMI reading for the month stood at 49, versus 49.6 expected by economists polled by Reuters.\nAs regards the effect of U.S. sanctions on Russian oil flows and prices, ING analysts wrote that \u201cClearly, the price action suggests that the market is not convinced that we will lose a significant amount of Russian oil supply. Yesterday\u2019s meeting between President Trump and President Xi only served to strengthen this conviction, with Russian oil flows to China apparently not part of broader talks between the two leaders.\u201d\nWarren Patterson and Ewa Manthey added that the implications of these developments were important since China as the only Russian oil buyer that could boost intake if India began to wind down its purchases in line with U.S. demands.\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nIrina is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry."

                "body": "Big Oil leaders Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Shell continue to hike their crude oil production volumes from West Texas\u2019s Permian Basin to the Gulf of Mexico to deepwater Guyana despite concerns of a rising global oil glut as OPEC nations keep exporting more barrels each month.\nThe production increases threaten to further exacerbate a weaker oil price environment predicted to go lower heading into 2026 with the U.S. benchmark hovering near the $60-per-barrel threshold below which companies struggle to maintain profitability. But the biggest players have more scale to remain undeterred by lower commodity prices.\nFor the two largest American players, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, primary growth remains in the still-booming Permian where Exxon churned out a record high of 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, including natural gas volumes. Chevron is the only other company to exceed the seven-figure mark there, coming in at 1.06 million barrels daily.\n\u201cWe set yet another production record,\u201d said Exxon chairman and CEO Darren Woods during the third-quarter earnings call on Friday. \u201cOur Permian production continues to grow well into the next decade. It clearly differentiates us from our competitors, who are talking about reduced investments, peak production, or a shift to harvest mode.\u201d\nExxon\u2019s global volumes grew from 4.63 million barrels of oil equivalent daily in the second quarter to 4.77 barrels a day in the third. Exxon even aims to hit 5.4 million barrels by 2030, driven mostly by the Permian and its pioneering offshore Guyana development.\nChevron\u2019s biggest growth area was the Permian, too, without even trying. Chevron is actively cutting its Permian capital expenditure to save money and keep production there plateaued to 1 million barrels daily. But Chevron still gained almost 60,000 barrels daily from the second quarter.\n\u201cIt really highlights the efficiency gains. The production is an outcome there,\u201d said Chevron chairman and CEO Mike Wirth on his Friday earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to continue to deliver strong performance with fewer [drilling] rigs and fewer completions spreads. We expect to move into 2026 with good momentum.\u201d\nThe strong momentum is expected to run into pricing headwinds as OPEC\u2014led by Saudi Arabia\u2014continues to unwind years of production cuts that kept pricing higher to regain market share and, in an unspoken added benefit, appease President Trump and his outspoken desire for lower prices at the pump.\n\u201cWhat we see at the moment is indeed headwinds on the supply-demand fundamentals going into 2026 and a highly credible scenario that there is an oversupply in 2026,\u201d said Shell CEO Wael Sawan. \u201cI think in the short to medium term, there are headwinds. Longer term, we continue to have strong conviction in crude prices going forward.\u201d\nStubbornly high, world-leading, record U.S. oil production of more than 13.6 million barrels of oil per day isn\u2019t helping. Prices fell, but U.S. volumes plateaued\u2014and even increased a bit\u2014rather than going down.

That\u2019s down from over $67 per barrel for Brent crude and $62 per barrel for WTI at the end of September.\n\u201cThe market is now watching this weekend\u2019s OPEC+ meeting and discussions of its output policy,\u201d ANZ analysts said in a report, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies significantly lift risks to supply,\u201d which could provide motivation for OPEC+ to agree on another 137,000-bpd production boost for December.\nAccording to Reuters, this would combine with rising non-OPEC supply to continue pressuring oil prices. The publication cited U.S. Energy Information Administration preliminary data suggesting U.S. crude output hit 13.6 million barrels daily in the week to October 24.\nThe prospect of China agreeing to buy more U.S. energy should have had a bullish effect on prices but that effect appears to have been offset by data showing factory activity in China shrank in October by more than analysts expected, falling to the lowest in six months. The PMI reading for the month stood at 49, versus 49.6 expected by economists polled by Reuters.\nAs regards the effect of U.S. sanctions on Russian oil flows and prices, ING analysts wrote that \u201cClearly, the price action suggests that the market is not convinced that we will lose a significant amount of Russian oil supply. Yesterday\u2019s meeting between President Trump and President Xi only served to strengthen this conviction, with Russian oil flows to China apparently not part of broader talks between the two leaders.\u201d\nWarren Patterson and Ewa Manthey added that the implications of these developments were important since China as the only Russian oil buyer that could boost intake if India began to wind down its purchases in line with U.S. demands.\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nIrina is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry."

The market continues to reassess its views on the fate of the federal funds rate and is buying the US dollar. At the same time, growing uncertainty is boosting demand for the greenback as a safe-haven currency. The trade deal between the US and Beijing is being compared to a truce with hidden risks of escalation. The Supreme Court\u2019s cancellation of tariffs in November could even trigger chaos in the financial markets.\nThe ECB has no reason to complain about the eurozone economy. In the third quarter, it accelerated from 0.5% to 0.9% year-over-year, thanks to the gradual adjustment of exports to US tariffs, a strong labour market, solid household balance sheets, and a prolonged cycle of rate cuts.\nHowever, risks remain. The Governing Council\u2019s doves warn of a slowdown in GDP and inflation under the influence of high US tariffs and a strong euro. The futures market gives a 40% probability of a deposit rate cut by mid-2026. This puts pressure on EURUSD. The euro could stumble at any moment and fall off the cliff near the 1.1550 mark.\nOn the contrary, the chances of a Fed rate cut in December fell from more than 90% at the start of the week to 67%. At the same time, Treasury bond yields are rising, which is supporting the US dollar.\nUSDJPY managed to restore its upward trend due to the Bank of Japan\u2019s reluctance to signal an increase in the overnight rate in the future. Kazuo Ueda cited uncertainty in the US economy and the need for new wage data, saying he was not afraid of a situation where sluggishness could trigger a surge in inflation.\nThe yen was not helped by the acceleration of consumer prices in Tokyo from 2.5% to 2.8% and verbal interventions. According to Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama, the government is closely monitoring speculative movements on Forex and is ready to intervene. However, such statements only temporarily cooled the bulls\u2019 enthusiasm for USDJPY. Moreover, hedge funds are positioned for the US dollar to rise towards 160 yen.\nThe FxPro Analyst Team\nWhich stocks should you consider in your very next trade?\nThe best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.\nThat's why smart investors use our Stock Screener with 50+ predefined screens and 160+ customizable filters to surface hidden gems instantly.\nFor example, the Piotroski's Picks method averages 23% annual returns by focusing on financial strength, and you can get it as a standalone screen.

                "body": "Frankfurt, Germany \u2013 October 31, 2025 \u2013 The Eurozone is witnessing a significant easing of its headline inflation, a development that is increasingly shaping the trajectory of the EUR/USD exchange rate. With preliminary data for October showing headline inflation at 2.1% year-on-year, inching closer to the European Central Bank's (ECB) 2% target, market dynamics are shifting. This disinflationary trend, coupled with a robust U.S. Dollar, has pushed the EUR/USD pair to around 1.1526, marking a notable weakening trend. Despite the moderating price pressures, the ECB has opted to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 2%, with President Christine Lagarde expressing a cautiously optimistic outlook on the region's economic growth.\nThe current environment presents a complex picture for investors and policymakers alike. While the deceleration in headline inflation offers a sigh of relief, persistent core inflation, which remains at 2.4%, suggests underlying price pressures are not entirely subdued. The ECB's decision to hold rates steady, following a series of cuts initiated in mid-2024, signals a period of watchful waiting, keen to ensure sustainable price stability without stifling nascent economic recovery. Meanwhile, the strength of the U.S. Dollar, partly driven by a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve despite a recent rate cut, continues to weigh heavily on the Euro, making the single currency less attractive in a yield-hungry global market.\nECB Holds Firm as Inflation Nears Target\nThe Eurozone's journey towards price stability has seen notable progress, with preliminary October 2025 headline inflation easing to 2.1% year-on-year, a slight dip from September's 2.2%. This movement brings inflation tantalizingly close to the European Central Bank's (ECB) medium-term target of 2%. However, the picture is not entirely uniform, as core inflation, which strips out volatile components like energy and food, has proven stickier, holding steady at 2.4% in October, slightly above market expectations. This persistence in core prices, particularly in the services sector which recorded a 3.4% annual rate, indicates that underlying inflationary pressures are still at play, albeit gradually receding in other areas such as non-energy industrial goods and energy costs.\nIn response to this evolving economic landscape, the European Central Bank's Governing Council has maintained a consistent and stable monetary policy. At both its September and October 2025 meetings, the ECB unanimously decided to keep its three key interest rates unchanged. The deposit facility rate remains at 2.00%, the main refinancing operations rate at 2.15%, and the marginal lending facility rate at 2.40%. These decisions follow a series of eight rate cuts implemented since mid-2024, which saw the deposit facility rate reduced from 4.00%. The most recent adjustment was a 25 basis point cut on June 5, 2025. This \"on-hold\" stance underscores the ECB's data-dependent approach, refraining from pre-committing to future rate paths and prioritizing a sustained return to its 2% inflation target.\nECB President Christine Lagarde, speaking on October 30, 2025, conveyed a message of cautious optimism regarding the Eurozone economy. She affirmed that the Governing Council is \"in a good place\" from a monetary policy perspective, acknowledging the progress made towards inflation normalization. However, she advocated for continued vigilance and a cautious approach, reinforcing the unanimity behind the decision to hold rates steady. Market analysts largely anticipate the ECB to maintain current rates well into 2026, suggesting that the recent rate-cutting cycle may have concluded for the foreseeable future. Despite this, potential external risks, such as a stronger euro or delays in fiscal stimulus, could still prompt further monetary adjustments if economic conditions warrant.\nThe immediate market reaction has been a continued weakening of the EUR/USD exchange rate.

The pair remains under pressure as the Greenback draws support from the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) hawkish tone after delivering a widely expected 25-basis-point rate cut earlier this week.\nAt the time of writing, EUR/USD is trading around 1.1523, extending losses for the third consecutive day and on track to post its first monthly decline in three months.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, is hovering near three-month highs around 99.80. The index is on course for a second consecutive monthly gain, supported by fading expectations of another interest rate cut this year.\nAs the dust settles from this week\u2019s central bank decisions, policy divergence between the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) has become more pronounced. The Fed delivered a 'hawkish' cut on Wednesday, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4.00% in a 10-2 vote.\nThe move, in line with market expectations, was accompanied by cautious guidance from Chair Jerome Powell, which tempered expectations of another rate reduction in December, a move investors had largely considered a done deal.\nIn contrast, the ECB kept its interest rate unchanged for the third consecutive meeting, citing that inflation remains close to the central bank\u2019s 2% medium-term target and that the Eurozone economy continues to expand despite global headwinds, supported by a resilient labor market.\nThe central bank reaffirmed its data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, emphasizing that it is not pre-committing to any specific rate path and will adjust policy in line with incoming data and evolving inflation dynamics.\nEarlier in the day, comments from Fed officials reinforced the central bank\u2019s cautious stance. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the Fed\u2019s mandates are \u201cin tension,\u201d adding that he supported this week\u2019s rate cut because policy remains in restrictive territory.\nMeanwhile, Cleveland Fed President Beth M. Hammack noted she would have preferred to hold rates steady, emphasizing that the central bank is \u201cnot on a preset course.\u201d Bostic also welcomed Chair Powell\u2019s remarks that a December rate cut is \u201cfar from a foregone move.\"\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today.

The exchange rate dropped below the 1.3200 threshold after the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision call was seen as restrictive, with concerns about rate cuts in December.\nSterling weakened against the US Dollar, reaching near 1.3185, during European trading. The pressure on GBP/USD arose from a stronger US Dollar, boosted by remarks following a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nMarket Conditions and Trends\nThe GBP/USD pair managed to climb above the 1.3200 mark during the Asian session with modest Dollar weakness. However, market conditions remain cautious, leaving limited room for potential gains above this level.\nAdditional currency trends include AUD/USD falling below 0.66 and EUR/USD slipping under 1.16. Meanwhile, Gold prices have risen despite a strong Dollar, and US-China trade relations have seen adjustments to tension levels following recent diplomatic discussions.\nFXStreet advises that market information comes with risks and uncertainties. Investors should conduct thorough research before making decisions. The information provided does not serve as a recommendation for transactions in any financial asset.\nWe are seeing a similar dynamic today as we did back when the Fed executed that \u201chawkish\u201d rate cut under Chairman Powell. The Federal Reserve is signaling it will hold interest rates higher for longer to ensure inflation is fully contained, which is keeping the US Dollar strong. Recent data supports this, as the core PCE price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, came in at 2.8% year-over-year last quarter, still stubbornly above the 2% target.\nStrategic Considerations and Geopolitical Risks\nThis dollar strength comes at a time of weakness for the pound, much like the period discussed. The Bank of England is facing sluggish GDP growth, which was last reported at only 0.2% for the third quarter of 2025, making it difficult for them to match the Fed\u2019s restrictive stance. This policy divergence is putting sustained downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair.\nGiven this environment, derivative traders should consider strategies that benefit from a declining or range-bound pound. We see the potential for GBP/USD to retest its year-to-date lows from earlier in 2025. Buying put options on GBP/USD with strike prices below 1.2000 could provide a favorable risk-to-reward setup for the coming weeks.\nFurthermore, we must not forget the geopolitical risks that mirror the US-China trade tensions mentioned in the past. Current trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing remain a source of uncertainty, and any negative headline could trigger a flight to safety, further boosting the US Dollar. The US trade deficit with China has widened again to over $30 billion per month, highlighting that these trade frictions are far from resolved.\nThe elevated uncertainty suggests that volatility in the GBP/USD pair may increase as we approach the end of the year. The CME\u2019s Sterling volatility index (BRR) has already ticked up by 5% this past month. This makes option-based strategies like put spreads attractive, as they can profit from a downward move while helping to manage the cost of purchasing options outright."

GDP growth for Q2 came in at a weak 0.3%, reflecting stagnation. Despite mounting pressure for stimulus, the BoE is widely expected to hold rates at 4.00% in the November 6 meeting. Market consensus now sees the first BoE rate cut delayed until February 2026, with policymakers fearing further pound depreciation could worsen imported inflation. This combination of sticky prices and slowing growth has revived concerns of stagflation, a toxic mix last seen during the late 1970s.\nFiscal Headwinds Deepen as UK Faces \u00a330B Budget Gap\nThe looming Autumn Budget on November 26 adds another layer of uncertainty. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projects a \u00a320 billion productivity shortfall and \u00a37.2 billion in higher-than-expected borrowing in the first half of 2025, leaving the Chancellor with limited fiscal room. Rachel Reeves is cornered between keeping her no-tax-rise pledge and closing a widening deficit that could exceed \u00a330 billion. Any sign of aggressive fiscal tightening could weigh further on domestic growth expectations and investor sentiment. Sterling traders are now demanding higher yields on gilts, reflecting greater risk premiums to hold UK-denominated assets amid this policy uncertainty.\nTechnical Pressure Builds Below 1.3140 as Market Eyes 1.3080\u20131.3000 Support\nTechnically, GBP/USD has broken through several critical support zones. The 1.3140 region\u2014marking the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 1.2099\u20131.3788 rally\u2014failed to hold, confirming a medium-term bearish continuation. The next layer sits at 1.3080\u20131.3088, aligned with the 100% extension of the June decline and the 52-week moving average. A decisive close below this threshold would open a path toward 1.2940, the 50% retracement of the yearly range. Momentum indicators back the bearish tone: the RSI hovers near 30, showing oversold but not exhausted conditions, while price action remains capped below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. Short-term rebounds toward 1.3200 or 1.3280 are likely to face heavy selling pressure as traders position for deeper downside.\nRead More\n-\nVGIT ETF Climbs to $60.18 as Fed Rate Cu"

                "body": "AUD/USD forecast: Forex Friday | October 31, 2025\nThe US dollar has remained supported post the FOMC rate decision, but as the governments shutdown continues into November, the greenback will find it difficult to maintain those gains without the release of economic data. Among the pairs to watch for a potential reversal is the AUD/USD, which could be pushing higher again soon. The Aussie fell overnight in reaction to the weaker than expected manufacturing PMI data out of China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, while the US dollar remained largely supported following Powell\u2019s slightly hawkish comments in mid-week. Still, the downside risks are likely to be limited for the Aussie. In fact, we maintain a bullish AUD/USD forecast ahead of the RBA rate decision next week and as we head into the final months of the year.\nAUD/USD forecast: No hike expected from RBA\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is set to make a key interest rate decision on Tuesday, November 4. We expect the central bank to hold interest rates unchanged at 3.60% after hot inflation data from Australia earlier this week removed any lingering hopes of a further cut. CPI was 1.3% q/q and 3.5% y/y, both much higher than expected. With the US-China trade relations improving, the Aussie may gain ground further ground in in the weeks ahead, potentially along with risk assets in general. China is Australia\u2019s largest export destination \u2013 so what happens there, matters. That\u2019s why there was a slight negative reaction to the PMI data showing China\u2019s manufacturing activity falling to 49.0 from 49.8.\nADP private payrolls report among US private data highlights\nThe week ahead would have normally been filled with lots of US data releases, including the official jobs report. Well, thanks to the ongoing government shutdown, there won\u2019t be any official jobs data. This will put private sector reports into sharp focus. Among them will be Wednesday\u2019s release of the ADP private sector payrolls report. These are the type of data releases providing guidance for the Fed and traders trying to gauge the health of the US economy. The Fed\u2019s focus has shifted to employment part of its dual mandate and recent weakness here has allowed it cut rates, most recently earlier this week. A December rate cut could also be on the way unless employment improves markedly and inflation heats up. The Fed chair Powell did remind investors that a rate cut then is not yet a foregone conclusion. His warning was enough to send the dollar sharply higher across the board as the markets had incorrectly presumed that it was in fact a foregone conclusion. Anyway, a lot can and will change. The longer the government shutdown continues, the more likely it will be that the Fed will cut rates, and with US-China tariff truce being extended, this should lower input costs and thus reduce inflationary concerns somewhat.\nTechnical AUD/USD forecast and key levels to watch\nDespite the AUD/USD\u2019s pullback, the underlying trend remains somewhat bullish from a technical standpoint. After all, the exchange rate is holding above the 200-day moving average, which is now sloping upwards to provide us with a clear and non-subjective indication about the long-term trend. But what about the short-term trend? Well, this is where things are not very clear with rates being stuck in a sideways range. But the recent break above a short-term trend line and prior resistance in the 0.6500-0.6535 area is a bullish signal. If we now see the AUD/USD hold above this area, then we could see some gains next week, especially if the RBA turns out to be more hawkish than expected. Resistance at 0.6600-0.6625 needs to be taken out though for confirmation.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

The Aussie pair faces selling pressure as the US Dollar (USD) demonstrates strength due to multiple tailwinds such as a decline in Federal Reserve (Fed) dovish expectations, and the announcement of a likely trade deal between the United States (US) and China as soon as next week.\nAt the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades firmly near an almost three-month high of 99.70 posted on Thursday.\nUS Dollar Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies this week. US Dollar was the strongest against the British Pound.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other.

For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote).\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75% in the December meeting has eased to 72.8% from 91.1% seen a week ago.\nTraders trim Fed dovish bets after Chair Jerome Powell stated that the December cut is \u201cfar from assured\u201d. Powell clarified that there were \u201cstrongly different views\u201d in the meeting, and the takeaway is that \u201cwe haven't made a decision about December\", Bloomberg reported.\nOn Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated in an interview on Fox Business Network that the \u201cKuala Lumpur agreement was finished in the middle of the night last night, so I expect we will exchange signatures possibly as soon as next week\".\nThe scenario of the trade deal signing between the US and China is also favorable for the Australian Dollar (AUD), given Australia\u2019s high reliance on its exports to Beijing.\nMeanwhile, receding hopes of more interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) this year are expected to strengthen the Australian Dollar. RBA dovish bets have eased due to accelerating inflationary pressures.\nAfter hotter-than-projected Q3 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released on Wednesday, inflation at the producer level in the third quarter has also come in higher than expectations. Earlier in the day, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the Producer Price Index (PPI) grew by 1% in July-September period, faster than estimates of 0.8% and the prior reading of 0.7%.\nEconomic Indicator\nProducer Price Index (QoQ)\nThe Producer Price Index released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics measures the average changes in prices in the Australian markets by producers of commodities.

                "body": "Australian Economic Overview\nThe Australian Dollar is experiencing pressure due to mixed economic data from China. In October, China\u2019s NBS Manufacturing PMI declined to 49.0, and the Non-Manufacturing PMI slightly rose to 50.1. The result affects the AUD/USD pair, which remains stable at approximately 0.6550, especially given China\u2019s close trade ties with Australia.\nUS Dollar stability is attributed to uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policies. The US Dollar Index remains around 99.50, as market predictions on Fed rate cuts increased to a 71% probability for December, influenced by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s announcements. The Fed implemented a 25-basis-point rate cut, lowering the benchmark to 3.75%-4.0%.\nAustralia\u2019s Q3 inflation figures revealed a 1.0% rise on a quarterly basis and a 3.0% yearly increase, exceeding expectations. This resulted in lowered anticipation for near-term rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia. The AUD/USD maintains a neutral bias with support and resistance levels set between 0.6450 and 0.6630, respectively.\nEconomic factors driving the Australian Dollar include RBA interest rates, iron ore prices, and the Chinese economy\u2019s health. Australia\u2019s trade balance and market sentiment also play critical roles, where risk-on markets tend to positively impact the AUD. As China is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, its economic health directly influences the AUD through trade dynamics.\nGiven the current date of October 31, 2025, we see the Australian Dollar is caught between opposing forces, keeping it range-bound. The Reserve Bank of Australia is feeling pressure from stubbornly high inflation, which recently saw the Q3 Trimmed Mean CPI hit 3.0% annually. This makes it very unlikely for the RBA to consider cutting rates, providing a floor of support for the currency.\nMarket Outlook and Strategy\nHowever, there are clear headwinds capping any significant upward movement for the Aussie dollar. Recent data shows Australia\u2019s unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% last month, and key commodity prices, like iron ore, have recently dipped back toward $110 per tonne. The mixed economic signals from China, particularly the drop in the manufacturing PMI to 49.0, also weigh heavily on sentiment for its largest trading partner.\nOn the other side of the pair, the US Dollar remains firm despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 25-basis-point rate cut. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s cautious comments, combined with a stronger-than-expected Non-Farm Payrolls report for September 2025 that showed a gain of 210,000 jobs, have dampened expectations for another cut in December. The market is now only pricing in a 71% chance of a December cut, a significant drop from over 90% just a few weeks ago.\nThis tug-of-war between a hawkish RBA and a surprisingly resilient US dollar suggests the AUD/USD will remain stuck in its current rectangle pattern between roughly 0.6450 and 0.6630. We remember similar periods of indecision back in 2023 when the market struggled to price conflicting central bank messages. This environment suggests that implied volatility might be undervalued, creating opportunities for traders.\nFor the coming weeks, a good strategy would be to buy volatility through options, such as a long straddle, positioning for a breakout in either direction. The conflicting fundamental drivers make a sharp move more likely once a catalyst emerges. This approach allows a trader to profit from a significant price swing without having to predict its direction.\nAlternatively, traders with a directional bias should use the established range as a guide for entry points. We could consider buying call options or call spreads if the price breaks decisively above the 0.6630 resistance level. Conversely, a sustained drop below the key 0.6450 support would be a strong signal to initiate bearish positions using put options."

The chart below tells the story, with the left-hand pane showing how USD/JPY has been tracking U.S. two-year Treasury yields in recent weeks. It\u2019s clear both have moved in near lockstep, confirmed by the strength of the rolling five-day correlation coefficient in the middle pane.

The relationship hasn\u2019t been as firm over the past month, but it has been strengthening, placing even greater emphasis on events that could shift the U.S. rate outlook for anyone trading USD/JPY.\nISM, ADP, Refunding Key U.S. Events\nWith the U.S. government shutdown still unresolved, markets are again being starved of key data, including a swathe of jobs figures that were due this week such as October non-farm payrolls. In their absence, traders will turn to private surveys and speeches from Fed officials to guide direction. The calendar below has been colour-coded to highlight the most important risk events, with red-shaded items marking those with the highest potential to move USD/JPY.\nSource: TradingView\nWednesday looms as the pivotal day, with the ADP National Employment Report and ISM services PMI both in the red category. While some question the reliability of ADP\u2019s signal, it has generally been a decent lead indicator once the official figures are revised. The ISM services report\u2014offering a near real-time view on activity, prices and orders in the largest part of the economy\u2014now carries even greater weight with no official data available.\nEvents shaded in yellow may still spark volatility, including the ISM manufacturing PMI on Monday. Although manufacturing is a smaller part of the economy, this survey still draws attention, so keep an eye out for any sudden shifts in demand or prices. The Treasury\u2019s quarterly refunding announcements on Monday and Wednesday also deserve close monitoring, given they include borrowing estimates for the current and next quarter along with the intended maturity mix of debt issuance. These details have influenced yields before, and with USD/JPY now so closely tied to the U.S. curve, this release is important.\nWhen Treasury last estimated borrowing needs for Q4, the figure stood at $590 billion. Keep that in mind with the shutdown ongoing. Details on issuance amounts and maturities arrive Wednesday. It seems unlikely Treasury will term out debt issuance given yields remain elevated\u2014especially with the Fed\u2019s quantitative tightening set to end in early December, when proceeds from maturing holdings will be reinvested into short-term debt.

The pair lost 0.3% on Friday after fresh Tokyo inflation data and renewed warnings from Japan\u2019s Finance Ministry reignited expectations of potential market intervention. The move came as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) held rates steady at 0.50%, even as domestic inflation accelerated and political signals pointed to a larger fiscal expansion under new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) traded near 99.80, supported by hawkish Federal Reserve commentary that temporarily capped yen gains.\nTokyo Inflation Surges, Forcing BoJ Into a Tight Corner\nOctober data showed that Tokyo\u2019s core consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8% year-on-year, marking the sharpest increase in four months and surpassing consensus expectations of 2.6%. The broader CPI also printed at 2.8%, up from 2.5% in September. The steady rise in Tokyo inflation, a leading national indicator, reinforces speculation that headline inflation could remain above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target into early 2026. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda acknowledged that \u201cunderlying inflation pressures remain strong,\u201d though he reiterated a cautious stance on further rate hikes. Market pricing via overnight swaps now places a 55% probability of a 25-basis-point increase in December \u2014 up from 50% earlier this week.\nYen Finds Support as Japan\u2019s New Finance Minister Signals Intervention Readiness\nJapan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama issued her strongest warning to date against \u201crapid and one-sided currency moves,\u201d pledging that authorities are \u201cclosely monitoring markets with a high sense of urgency.\u201d The statement, coming after USD/JPY\u2019s surge beyond \u00a5154.40, revived speculation that the Ministry of Finance (MoF) could coordinate with the BoJ for direct intervention should the yen weaken toward \u00a5155.00\u2013\u00a5156.00. Historically, similar remarks have preceded intervention, notably during the October 2022 sell-off when USD/JPY was near \u00a5151.94. Traders now consider the \u00a5155.00 level a \u201cred line\u201d for policy action, especially as domestic inflation builds and political pressure intensifies to defend household purchasing power.\nBoJ Holds Rates at 0.50% But Internal Division Widens\nThe BoJ\u2019s latest policy meeting revealed a 7\u20132 split, with board members Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata advocating for a hike to 0.75%, underscoring growing internal dissent. While the official stance remains accommodative, the bank\u2019s quarterly outlook upgraded both GDP and inflation projections through fiscal 2026, expecting core inflation above 2% well into March 2027. This evolution marks a subtle policy shift \u2014 the BoJ is no longer treating inflation as transitory. Yet Ueda remains cautious, saying, \u201cWe will spend more time assessing wage trends and the impact of higher food and energy costs before deciding the next step.\u201d Market participants read this as a delay tactic, suggesting any rate move may now come in January 2026 rather than December.\nNew Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s Fiscal Push and Market Implications\nPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan\u2019s first female leader, announced plans for an expansive stimulus package exceeding \u00a513.9 trillion ($92 billion) to shield households from rising costs and stabilize small businesses. Her \u201cAbenomics-style\u201d fiscal expansion is designed to support domestic growth but risks weakening the yen further by widening the fiscal-monetary divergence with the U.S. The package includes direct cash transfers, corporate tax cuts, and infrastructure spending, echoing the pro-growth approach of late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. For traders, this fiscal push suggests near-term downward pressure on the yen unless the BoJ counters with a faster normalization pace.\nU.S. Dollar Strength Limits Yen Ups"

                "body": "Canadian Dollar Forecast: USD/CAD Recovers but Which Trend Prevails?\nCanadian Dollar Summary\nThe Canadian Dollar rallied after the BoC rate cut on Wednesday, but that move was short-lived as support showed in USD/CAD at the 1.3900 level and the back-half of the week saw buyers regain control of the pair. This sets up a short-term inverse head and shoulders pattern in USD/CAD and if we do see the larger theme of USD-strength continue the pair could soon be trading at fresh six-month highs.\nUSD/CAD was in breakdown mode through Wednesday morning and the Bank of Canada rate decision helped to provide some fuel for sellers. Despite the bank cutting rates yet again, the prospect of a BoC on hold in the near future prodded a degree of CAD-strength, and when meshed up with a USD driven by the expectation for more cuts in December and into next year, there was a clear shift of weakness from the fundamental drive in USD/CAD.\nThat move continued a sell-off that sparked from a rising wedge formation. There was a minimum of resistance at the 1.4000 handle when buyers were driving the move but once above the psychological level, momentum began to slow at highs even with bulls remaining aggressive on pullbacks. The initial drop below 1.4000 was paused at the 1.3981 level, but sellers went for the break at the Bank of Canada announcement until running into the 1.3905 level that I had highlighted in the webinar on Tuesday.\nUSD/CAD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/CAD Shorter-Term\nI looked at an updated view of the pair on Thursday, and while there remained some bearish items, such as the hold of 1.4000 resistance or the broader rising wedge that price action still remained below, the v-shaped reversal from support was something that demanded respect. And as a continuation of that, buyers have been able to push back above the vaulted psychological level at 1.4000 to find resistance at the familiar 1.4034 level.\nThis brings on the image of an inverse head and shoulders pattern and given the storyline behind the move, the plot fits, as sellers had an open door to drive a break, were thwarted at a key spot of support, and buyers have since regained control with reference to the same levels that were in-play ahead of the initial breakdown move. Next resistance overhead is the 1.4061 level, the same looked at in the Tuesday webinar and the Thursday article, and beyond that is 1.4080 which is the current six-month high in the pair.\nUSD/CAD Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\n--- written by James Stanley, Senior Strategist\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

                "body": "USD/CAD crawls above 1.4000 favoured by a hawkish Fed, risk-off markets\n- The US Dollar extends gains against the CAD and reaches session highs above 1.4000.\n- Dwindling bets of a Fed cut in December and risk aversion are buoying the US Dollar on Friday.\n- A 2% weekly decline in Oil prices is acting as a headwind for the loonie.\nThe US Dollar trades higher against its Canadian counterpart for the second consecutive day on Friday, returning to levels right above the 1.4000 psychological level to retrace losses from previous days, and trading practically flat on the weekly chart. The Hawkish comments by Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell and moderate risk aversion are buoying the Greenback against most of its main peers.\nThe US Dollar bounced from weekly lows at the 1.3890 area following the Fed's monetary policy decision on Wednesday. The bank met expectations and trimmed its Federal Funds rate to a three-year low in the 3.75%-4% range, but Chairman Powell rattled markets, affirming that a December rate cut is far from a done deal, which sent US Treasury yields and the US Dollar higher.\nFurthermore, the framework agreement between US President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping has allowed to extension of the trade truce between the US and China. Trump has pledged to reduce tariffs on Chinese imports in exchange for keeping rare earth trade flowing and resuming purchases of US soybeans, which has provided additional support to the US Dollar.\nAlso on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada trimmed its benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points, to 2.25% and hinted at the end of the easing cycle, although Goverm\u00a1nor Macklem kept all options open, assuring that the central bank will be ready to respond if Canada's economic Outlook changed materially.\nThe Canadian Dollar bounced up following the BoC's monetary policy decision, but has been losing ground over the last two days, weighed by a firmer US Dollar amid a moderate risk-off mood and falling Oil prices, Canada's main export. The price of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) barrel has dropped nearly 2% this week, to levels right above $60.00 at the time of writing, from last week's highs near $62.50.\n(This story was corrected on October 31 at 11:15 GMT to say that Xi Jinping is the Chinese President and not the Chinese Premier, as previously stated.)\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of "

The annual CPI inflation came in softer than the market forecast of 3.1%.\nFollowing the softer-than-expected US inflation data, markets almost fully priced in two interest rate reductions this year, with a 25 basis points (bps) cut each in the October and December monetary policy meetings.\nThis Greenback weakness helped GBP/USD buyers gather some courage to briefly regain the 1.3350 barrier.\nHowever, the pair quickly reversed course and resumed its downtrend after the US Dollar staged a solid comeback against its six major currency rivals on Wednesday, even as the Fed delivered on the expected 25 bps cut.\nThe rebound occurred because, during the post-policy meeting press conference, Fed Chairman Powell noted that policymakers are likely to become more cautious if the current government shutdown deprives them of further job and inflation reports, tempering bets for another rate cut by the Fed at year-end.\nFollowing the Fed event, the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool showed a 72.8% probability of a quarter percentage point Fed rate cut in December compared with a 91.1% chance a week earlier.\nInvestors remained nervous heading into Thursday\u2019s highly anticipated meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea, exerting additional downside pressure on the higher-yielding Pound Sterling.\nOn Thursday, both leaders reached a major trade truce on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in Busan, South Korea. The landmark agreement covers key critical points, including rare earth minerals, fentanyl trade, and semiconductor sales.\nTrump said that \u201ctariffs on China will be 47% down from 57%.\u201d Meanwhile, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry confirmed that Beijing will pause rare earth export controls for a year, adding that \u201cboth sides reached consensus on fentanyl cooperation, expanding agriculture trade.\u201d\nThe US-China trade deal optimism provided extra legs to the USD upswing, in the aftermath of a less dovish Fed, exacerbating GBP/USD\u2019s pain. The currency pair breached critical support levels to reach six-month lows near 1.3115.\nOn the UK side of the equation, the Pound Sterling faced additional headwinds as investors grew increasingly anxious ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s Autumn Budget, due on November 26.\nReuters reported that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to lower productivity forecasts, raising financial stress and boding ill for the British Pound.\nThe GBP was also undermined by the markets\u2019 beliefs that mounting concerns over UK economic growth prospects could persuade the Bank of England (BoE) to resume its easing cycle in December after a rates-on-hold decision expected on Thursday.\nUS ADP jobs data, US ISM PMIs and BoE verdict grab eyeballs\nWith the Fed event and t"

                "body": "London, United Kingdom, Oct 31, 2025, Cryptocurrency markets have always been fast moving, but in 2025, Bitcoin trading has matured into a sophisticated ecosystem that blends institutional discipline with retail enthusiasm. At BrentMarkets.com, Bitcoin Trading Specialist Jennifer Lee has watched this evolution unfold firsthand, from early speculation to structured trading frameworks guided by risk control, liquidity management, and macro awareness.\nAccording to Lee, the modern Bitcoin market is defined by paradox. It is both highly efficient and deeply emotional, capable of absorbing global news within seconds while still reacting to investor sentiment in unpredictable ways. For traders, she explains, the challenge lies in balancing data driven logic with an understanding of human behavior.\n\u201cThe beauty and the challenge of Bitcoin,\u201d Lee says, \u201cis that it\u2019s one of the few assets where fundamentals, psychology, and technology collide in real time.\u201d\nInstitutional Maturity and Market Depth\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility has long been both a risk and an attraction. Yet, over the past two years, the market\u2019s structure has become more resilient. Institutional participation has expanded, with hedge funds, asset managers, and even pension vehicles using Bitcoin exposure to diversify portfolios. This has increased liquidity and reduced the magnitude of intraday swings compared to earlier cycles.\nLee points out that this institutional layer has also changed how traders approach risk. Leverage ratios are now lower on average, and position sizing is increasingly calculated through quantitative frameworks rather than pure speculation. At Brent Markets, the trading team employs a hybrid model that combines technical triggers with macro context, ensuring that signals are confirmed across multiple timeframes before execution.\nThe Halving Effect and Price Dynamics\nOne of the dominant themes in 2025 remains Bitcoin\u2019s recent halving is programmed reduction in block rewards that historically triggers long term price appreciation. While the initial post halving rally brought prices close to record highs, Lee emphasizes that this cycle has been more measured. Liquidity constraints, tighter regulation, and growing derivatives activity have all tempered the usual euphoria.\nBrent Markets\u2019 analysis suggests that Bitcoin is entering a consolidation phase between $62,000 and $68,000, with key resistance near $70,000. However, long-term momentum remains intact, supported by increasing institutional demand, growing ETF inflows, and continued adoption in emerging markets.\nLee\u2019s team also tracks on chain data to evaluate accumulation patterns among large holders. Recent metrics indicate that long term investors, or \u201cwhales,\u201d have resumed steady accumulation, a behavior often associated with medium term bullish sentiment.\nNavigating Regulation and Risk\nWhile price dynamics dominate headlines, regulatory progress may be the more consequential development. Over the past year, clearer frameworks in the U.S. and Europe have begun to legitimize Bitcoin trading infrastructure. Exchanges now operate under stricter capital and transparency requirements, which has improved overall market integrity.\nStill, Lee cautions that regulatory clarity can be a double-edged sword.

Total redemptions across all Bitcoin ETFs reached $490.43 million on October 30, with BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone shedding $290.9 million, its largest daily outflow since August 4. This aggressive pullback followed a prior day\u2019s $471 million withdrawal, pushing the week\u2019s cumulative outflow above $960 million, underscoring how quickly investor sentiment flipped after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s cautious comments on future rate cuts.\nInstitutional Rotation Accelerates as BTC-USD Tests $110,000 Amid Policy Uncertainty\nDespite the outflows, BTC-USD briefly recovered to $110,000, marking a 0.7% rebound from the previous day on the Binance USDT market. However, this bounce masks growing caution. Traders have pivoted sharply following Powell\u2019s assertion that a December rate cut \u201cis not a foregone conclusion,\u201d which sent risk assets\u2014including Bitcoin ETFs\u2014into rotation. Market data from CryptoQuant confirmed a surge in profit-taking and ETF redemptions, with U.S. investor participation falling to its weakest seven-day average since April. The CME futures basis hit multi-year lows, confirming that both institutional and retail traders are trimming exposure rather than adding new capital.\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT Dominance Highlights Concentration Risk in Bitcoin ETF Market\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT remains the dominant force among Bitcoin ETFs, holding roughly 805,000 BTC worth nearly $87 billion, yet its overwhelming size exposes the sector to single-manager risk. Excluding BlackRock, the spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem would show a net year-to-date outflow of $1.27 billion, illustrating that the industry\u2019s health is overly reliant on one firm\u2019s flows. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC reported $46.55 million in daily outflows, while ARK 21Shares\u2019 ARKB and Bitwise\u2019s BITB saw respective redemptions of $65.62 million and $55.15 million. The combined pressure erased a week\u2019s worth of October inflows, although the month still closed positive at $3.61 billion, slightly above September\u2019s $3.53 billion, proving that institutional demand\u2014while cooling\u2014remains structurally intact over the quarter.\nFed Policy and Arbitrage Closure Trigger Redemptions Across Bitcoin ETFs\nThe coordinated outflows were compounded by a narrowing arbitrage window between ETF prices and underlying spot Bitcoin, discouraging authorized participants from creating new units. Traders described this as a \u201cmechanical rotation\u201d rather than panic selling, noting that short-term macro friction from the Trump\u2013China trade policy revisions also discouraged new inflows. Analysts said the short-term ETF selloff reflected closed arbitrage spreads, not collapsing demand. The 7-day 25-delta skew on Deribit options dropped from -0.1 to -8, showing traders paying a steep premium for downside protection. While this metric rebounded modestly, it remains negative\u2014evidence that sentiment, though stabilizing, remains defensive.\nEthereum and Altcoin ETFs Begin Absorbing Institutional Flows as Bitcoin Cools\nThe shift in ETF flows is mirrored by a clear institutional rotation toward Ethereum and alternative assets. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $184 million in daily outflows but continued to outperform on a quarterly basis, attracting $9.6 billion in Q3 inflows, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s $8.7 billion. In parallel, Solana ETFs logged $37.33 million in daily inflows, led by Bitwise\u2019s $BSOL ETF with $36.55 million, marking a th"

The rest of the market will be made up of $750 billion in tokenised equities, and $250 billion in tokenised funds, Kendrick said.\n\u201cThe less liquid segments of private equity, commodities, corporate debt and real estate for the other $250 billion,\u201d he added.\nThe comments highlight the bullishness around tokenised assets from traditional finance. BlackRock, State Street and Deutsche Bank are just some of the financial giants muscling into this space.\nWinners\nKendrick said the DeFi boom is driven by three factors: surging awareness in developed markets, onchain liquidity, and the expansion of onchain lending.\nEthereum has and \u201ckey DeFi protocols like Aave are going to be the winners,\u201d Kendrick said.\nIndeed, Aave, DeFi\u2019s largest lending platform, recently relaunched its institutional platform to capitalise on Wall Street\u2019s growing interest.\nEarlier this week, the Ethereum Foundation rolled out a new institutional platform titled Ethereum for Institutions, a site designed to guide traditional financial institutions in integrating Ethereum\u2019s blockchain infrastructure.\n\u201cClear pathways are essential as institutions build on Ethereum,\u201d the foundation said in its announcement.\n\u2018The main risk\u2019\nThe US government\u2019s drive to regulate the crypto market and to police the industry less strictly than during the Biden years has fuelled the rally. It has seen pro-crypto people be appointed to key government roles, seen a landmark stablecoin bill be signed into law, and Congress seems to be on the cusp of finalising a broad markets bill.\nTo be sure, Kendrick warns that next year presents a massive danger that risks puncturing the growth.\n\u201cThe main risk to this would be if regulatory clarity in the US does not materialise \u2014 a possibility if the US administration is unable to push through regulatory changes before the November 2026 midterm elections, but not our base case,\u201d he said.\nCrypto market movers\n- Bitcoin is down 0.3% over the past 24 hours to trade at $109,906.\n- Ethereum is down 1.5% over the past 24 hours, trading at $3,841.\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n- Why crypto\u2019s red-hot IPO rally risks grinding to a halt \u2014 DL News\n- \u2018Code Is Law\u2019 documentary nails the drama of DeFi hacks \u2014 despite what it leaves out \u2014 DL News\n- Ondo Brings 100 Tokenized Stocks to BNB Chain Platform \u2014 Unchained\n- Ethereum Is Becoming Wall Street\u2019s Favorite & Lido\u2019s the Gateway w/ Izzy & Kean \u2014 Milk Road\n- Ethereum Foundation rolls out new institution-focused site amid Wall Street\u2019s crypto push \u2014 DL News\nLance Datskoluo is DL News\u2019 Europe-based markets correspondent.

Conclusion \u2013 Choosing the Right Mix for Your Portfolio\n- 6. FAQs\nBlazpay Phase 3 is LIVE NOW, offering investors an unprecedented opportunity to enter a top crypto to invest in before the next phase hits. With the seed price set at $0.008, BLAZ is currently available below that, marking the last chance for early adopters to secure massive gains.\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have recently experienced minor dips due to Federal Reserve interest rate announcements, Blazpay provides a low entry point that could deliver explosive returns. Investors seeking the best crypto presale in 2025 are now turning their eyes toward this multichain powerhouse.\nWith over 137 million BLAZ tokens already sold from a total of 157.3 million, the momentum is undeniable. Blazpay\u2019s combination of innovative technology, multichain support, and conversational AI tools positions it as the best crypto coin to buy now for both short-term profits and long-term growth.\nBlazpay Presale Hits Phase 3: Low Entry Point and Strong Momentum\nPhase 3 of Blazpay is officially LIVE NOW, offering investors a rare opportunity to enter at one of the lowest entry points before the public release, with the current price set at $0.009375 per BLAZ. With 139 million tokens already sold out of a total of 157.3 million, and $1M raised during the seed phase, demand is already strong. This marks the final chance to buy before prices move higher in the next phase, and Blazpay\u2019s growth trajectory underscores why it is considered the top crypto to invest in, especially when compared to market giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nMultichain & Conversational AI \u2013 Revolutionizing Crypto\nBlazpay\u2019s multichain support allows users to purchase BLAZ tokens using over 50 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, USDC, BNB, Tron, Solana, and Polygon.\nIntegrating conversational AI, Blazpay enhances user experience by making transactions seamless, intuitive, and fast. This combination of technology ensures that it stands out as the best crypto presale for 2025, delivering utility beyond mere speculation.\n$1,000 Investment Scenario \u2013 Potential Explosive Gains\nInvesting $1,000 at the current Phase 3 price of $0.009375 would secure approximately 106,667 BLAZ tokens. If Blazpay reaches the projected targets of $0.10 per token, that investment could grow to $10,666, a potential 10x return.\nBy comparison, investing $1,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum today would yield far smaller short-term gains given their high entry points and current sideways trading. This is why Blazpay is emerging as the top crypto to invest in for 2025.\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Blazpay\nIn the near term, BLAZ could reach between $0.04 and $0.12 as Phase 3 progresses and more investors enter the market. In a bull-case scenario, driven by widespread adoption of its multichain ecosystem, AI integration, and gamified rewards, the token could potentially reach $0.50 or higher, representing a significant multiple of the current presale price. The combination of a low entry point, high demand, and innovative features positions Blazpay as one of the most promising next big crypto coins to buy now.\nHow to Buy \u2013 Step by Step\nStep 1: Go to the official Blazpay website at www.blazpay.com and visit the Presale section.\nStep 2: Connect your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.).\nStep 3: Choose your preferred crypto and blockchain. Enter the amount or click \u201cMax\u201d and click Buy Now.\nStep 4: Confirm the transaction and enjoy your BLAZ tokens.\nBitcoin Market Snapshot \u2013 Steady Amid Minor Dips\nBitcoin remains a staple for investors with a market cap of $2.15 trillion.

                "body": "Stocks finished higher Friday as Amazon's strong quarterly results boosted the Nasdaq, with major indexes ending the week and month with solid gains.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up a respective 0.6%, 0.3%, and 0.1% to conclude the week.\nYesterday, the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow all ended lower as shares of Meta Platforms (META) sank 11% and Microsoft (MSFT) fell 3% following earnings reports after markets closed Wednesday.\nHowever, strong results from fellow Magnificent Seven member Amazon (AMZN) after the bell Thursday lifted stock indexes Friday. Amazon shares ended up 9.6%, setting an all-time high. Shares of Apple (AAPL)\u2014the world's second-most-valuable company behind only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), with a market capitalization above $4 trillion\u2014finished down 0.4% after the iPhone maker also posted robust results late Thursday.\nShares of Nvidia, which fell back below a $5 trillion market valuation following yesterday's 2% decline, finished down 0.2% following news it is partnering with Samsung and other South Korean firms to deploy 250,000 of its chips across the Asian country. Meta and Microsoft shares fell 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively.\nReddit (RDDT) stock popped 7.6% after better-than-expected results, while Netflix (NFLX) shares rose 2.7% after the biggest streaming company announced a 10-to-1 stock split.\nAmong notable stocks making moves after quarterly results, energy giants Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) shares were up 2.7% and down 0.3%, respectively; cryptocurrency-treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) were up a respective 5.9% and 4.7%; cybersecurity company Cloudflare (NET) surged 14%; data-storage firm Western Digital (WDC) gained 9%; and Rubbermaid parent Newell Brands (NWL) plummeted 28%.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.08% at 5:00 p.m. ET, down slightly from yesterday's close, while the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, advanced 0.2% to 99.75.

Gold futures were little changed at $4,015 an ounce, while West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rose 0.6% to $60.90 a barrel.\nNotable S&P 500 Movers on Friday\nAdvancers:\n- Amazon (AMZN) stock jumped nearly 10% to a closing record after the tech giant reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. Growth in the company's Amazon Web Services business helped drive the strong results. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted Amazon's plans to boost its AI capacity as it benefits from growing demand for AI infrastructure.\n- Shares of First Solar (FSLR) powered over 14% higher to notch Friday's best performance in the S&P 500. Although the solar panel maker's third-quarter earnings per share fell short of estimates, its revenue for the period topped expectations, boosted by demand from developers of U.S. solar projects. First Solar also announced a plan to open a new manufacturing facility in the U.S. with an annual production capacity of 3.7 gigawatts.\n- Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, surpassed quarterly sales and profit forecasts. Coinbase said it saw gains in both consumer and institutional trading volume, bolstered by optimism surrounding the U.S. regulatory outlook for digital assets. CEO Brian Armstrong also highlighted the company's expansion into prediction markets and tokenized assets, under Coinbase's \"everything exchange\" strategy. Coinbase shares added close to 5%.\nDecliners:\n- Shares of DexCom (DXCM) tumbled nearly 15%, suffering the steepest daily decline in the S&P 500. While the maker of continuous glucose monitors for patients with diabetes topped third-quarter sales and profit estimates, DexCom's management team cautioned that 2026 revenue growth could fall short of expectations.

Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nThe government shutdown has stretched into its 31st day, with President Trump proposing that Senate Republicans end the filibuster to help reopen the government.\n\u201cIt is now time for the Republicans to play their \u2018TRUMP CARD,\u2019 and go for what is called the Nuclear Option \u2013 Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW,\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post.\nThe filibuster rule requires 60 votes in the Senate to pass most legislation. Ending it could speed up the passage of legislation, allowing the Republican-controlled Congress to end the shutdown with a simple majority vote.\nMeanwhile, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, who didn\u2019t vote in the October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, expressed her view that the 25 bps rate cut was unnecessary due to inflation risks, a balanced labor market, and a previous rate cut last month.\n\u201cFor those reasons, I did not see a need to cut rates this week,\u201d said Logan at The Evolving Landscape of Bank Funding conference in Dallas. \u201cAnd I\u2019d find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly.\u201d\nFed Bank of Kansas City President Jeff Schmid, the only voting FOMC member to call for an unchanged rate, echoed Logan\u2019s view that inflation risks support an unchanged rate. Schmid said that a 25 bps reduction would have an immaterial effect on the labor market, but could have \u201clonger-lasting effects on inflation.\u201d\nThe Dow Jones is down by 0.18% at the time of writing.\nWhich Stocks are Moving the Dow Jones?\nLet\u2019s pivot to TipRanks\u2019 Dow Jones Heatmap, which illustrates the stocks that have contributed to the index\u2019s price action.\nAmazon (AMZN) is the index\u2019s top-performer after the e-commerce leader\u2019s third-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS topped analyst estimates. In addition, Amazon\u2019s cloud revenue grew by 20.2% year-over-year to $33 billion, marking the fastest pace since 2022. That helped quell fears of investment in AI without a payoff.\nApple (AAPL) reported its earnings as well. The company\u2019s revenue and adjusted EPS came in slightly above their estimates, although comments from CEO Tim Cook helped give AAPL stock a boost.\n\u201cWe expect total company revenue to grow by 10% to 12% year over year, we expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits, year over year, and we expect that that would make the December quarter the best ever in the history of the company,\u201d said Cook.\nElsewhere, Nvidia (NVDA) is muted on the day, despite Hyundai (HYMLF) announcing that it would deploy 50,000 Blackwell GPUs. Caterpillar (CAT) is taking a breather after a solid earnings report and is still up by 8.5% during the past week.\nDIA Stock Moves Lower with the Dow Jones\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) is an exchange-traded fund designed to track the movement of the Dow Jones. As a result, DIA is falling alongside the Dow Jones today.\nWall Street believes that DIA stock has room to rise. During the past three months, analysts have issued an average DIA price target of $525.34, implying upside of 10.61% from current prices. The 31 holdings in DIA carry 29 buy ratings, two hold ratings, and zero sell ratings.\nStay ahead of macro events with our up-to-the-minute Economic Calendar \u2014 filter by impact, country, and more."

But he added, \u201cthe total size of her first two Budgets may surpass them all.\u201d\nMr Kerr also warned that another Budget of this scale would shave 0.3pc of the size of the UK\u2019s already sluggish economy next year.\nThe pound was on track for its worst month since July amid gloom around the Budget and uncertainty over interest rates.\nSterling was down 0.3pc against the dollar to $1.311 today, near its lowest levels since April, as doubts emerged over which way the Bank of England will vote next week.\nThe pound has fallen around 2.3pc versus the US currency in October, which would be its biggest decline since July and the second largest this year.\nMoney markets indicate there is a 29pc chance of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England on Thursday, which analysts at Barclays and Goldman Sachs said they expect to happen.\nChris Beauchamp, an analyst at IG, said: \u201cNext week\u2019s decision is genuinely uncertain, making it one of the more consequential meetings in recent memory.\u201d"

                "body": "The DAX dipped after eurozone inflation met forecasts and core prices held firm, while Puma received a vote of confidence for its long-term strategy.\nabout 12 hours ago \u2022 2 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nGerman stocks stumbled this week, with the DAX down 0.67%, after eurozone inflation numbers came in on target but core inflation stayed more stubborn than markets had hoped.\nWhat does this mean?\nEurozone inflation eased to 2.1% in October, matching expectations and edging closer to the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% goal. But core inflation \u2013 which excludes volatile food and energy prices \u2013 stuck at 2.4%, slightly above forecasts, with short-term core price momentum actually ticking up, mainly due to firm service costs. ING now sees inflation hovering around current levels for months ahead, and the ECB\u2019s forecasts point to only a slow and steady decline. On the ground, German retail sales managed a slim 0.2% gain in September while import prices kept falling, hinting at weak domestic demand. Amid this backdrop, Puma drew positive attention from analysts at Bernstein, who welcomed its fresh multi-year reset strategy for the brand, aiming for a brighter outlook by 2027 after a sluggish quarter.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Inflation jitters keep investors cautious.\nStubborn core inflation and only modest improvement in the headline numbers are making investors wary, keeping pressure on the DAX. With the ECB\u2019s 2025 inflation projection nudged up to 2.1%, and tighter policy likely to stick around, market optimism has stayed muted. Sectors reliant on consumer spending, like retail, may continue to face challenges until inflation shows real signs of cooling off.\nThe bigger picture: Reset strategies point to long-term resilience.\nCompanies such as Puma are setting the tone for how to handle persistent inflation and soft demand by rolling out long-term turnaround plans. Their clear, multi-year approach through 2027 highlights a broader strategy for riding out Europe\u2019s sluggish recovery \u2013 suggesting that those prepared to adapt and play the long game could emerge stronger, even if the wider economic outlook remains shaky for now.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nInsight\nRussell Burns \u2022 about 16 hours ago\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 16 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 9 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

This consolidation continued this week as top constituent companies like Deutsche Bank, Mercedes-Benz, BASF, and Volkswagen published their results.\nThe index also continued to consolidate after the European Central Bank (ECB) delivered its interest rate decision on Thursday. As was widely expected, the bank left interest rates unchanged and pointed to a wait-and-see approach.\nThe DAX Index also reacted mildly to the recent Federal Reserve interest rate decision in which officials decided to cut interest rates by 0.25%.\nSiemens Healthineers\nSiemens Healthineers is one of the biggest companies in the DAX Index that has a market capitalization of over $62 billion. It makes equipment like Medical Imaging Systems, like MRI machines, X-ray systems, molecular imaging, and laboratory diagnostics solutions.\nSiemens Healthineers\u2019 stock has come under pressure this year as it has crashed by 15% from its highest level this year. This retreat happened as the company lowered its forward guidance, citing Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. It expects that its comparable revenue growth will be between 5.5% and 6%.\nCommerzbank\nCommerzbank is another top DAX Index company to watch next week as it releases it numbers. Its stock price has moved into a correction after falling by almost 20% from its highest point this year. It remains about 130% above its lowest level this year.\nCommerzbank stock has jumped in the past few years because of the pursuit from Unicredit, a top Italian bank, which owns about 28% of the company.\nThe stock has pulled back in the past few months as Germany politicians will likely reject the combination. Also, Andrea Orcel, Unicredit\u2019s CEO, has started to feel jittery about the deal as the stock has surged.\nOdds are high that the company will publish strong financial results, mirroring those of Deutsche Bank and other European banks like UniCredit and Barclays.\nRead more: Standard Chartered share price analysis: is StanChart a buy after earnings?\nBMW\nBMW is another top company in the FTSE 100 Index to watch this week as it releases its numbers, which will shed more color on the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nBMW, which also owns brands like Rolls-Royce and Mini, has come under intense pressure in the past few weeks, stalling the recent rebound. It has dropped by about 10% from its highest level this year. It remains about 20% below the highest level in 2024.\nBMW, unlike Volkswagen Group, will likely report a smaller charge because of its presence in the United States, where it runs its biggest plant at Spartanburg, South Carolina. It produces over 400,000 vehicles a year.\nThe other top companies in the DAX Index to watch will be firms like Henkel, Continental, Vonovia, Fresenius, and Daimler Truck. Daimler Truck stock price has crashed by 23% from its highest level this year after Trump proposed more tariffs on heavy trucks.\nRead more: Ford stock C&H pattern points to a surge to $20 as catalysts rise\nThe post Top DAX Index shares to watch: BMW, Commerzbank, Siemens Healthineers appeared first on Invezz\nTop DAX Index shares to watch: BMW, Commerzbank, Siemens Healthineers\nThe DAX Index has remained in a tight range in the past few months.

Burial will be at East Amana Cemetery. Visitation will also be held at Stonebridge Church on Monday, November 3 from 4:00 to 7:00 pm. Powell Funeral Home in Marengo is caring for Carol and her family. Messages and tributes may be left at www.powellfuneralhomes.com.\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be contributed to Lutheran Interparish School, the Wheaton College Foundation, or a children\u2019s Christian ministry of your choice.\nCarol Schuerer Zuber was born December 31, 1957, in East Amana, Iowa, the daughter of Harold and Helen Schuerer. Carol grew up in East Amana surrounded by family and the close-knit Amana community. In 1981, she married the love of her life, Brad Zuber, and together they built their family home across the street from her childhood home. There, they raised their beloved children, Maria and Harry, filling their lives with faith, laughter, and music.\nCarol lived a life devoted to her family, her faith, and her community. She was known for her joyful spirit, her quick laugh, and her ability to make every person she met feel like a lifelong friend. Her energy and passion for the welfare of others was poured out through her gift of hospitality. Carol shared her talents generously, as a Sunday School Teacher, Volunteer German Teacher, Den Mother, Colony Folksingers leader, and so much more. An artist at heart, she built VBS props, Oktoberfest floats, and show choir stage sets of every kind imaginable. She found inspiration everywhere. Her career was in the Amana Society General Store, but truly, she created fun, inspired joy, and built memories. She had a heart for service, giving her time to countless organizations and always lending a hand where it was needed most.\nTo us, she was and always will be the best mother. The light and joy of each day. A heart shining brightly with the love of the Lord. She inspired us and led by example. She always believed the best in others. A leader, a volunteer, a helper, a servant, always putting others first. A constant encourager, a bastion of love and support. A home builder. A barrier breaker. A traveler. The life of every party. An instant friend to all she met. A mother to more than she knew. A caregiver. Humble, kind, and limitless in her compassion. A troublemaker in the best way. A go-getter. A rule breaker. The best letter writer. A teacher. A gifted musician and the most joyful performer. An example of what it means to be a loving spouse. And so much more to so many.\nCarol is survived by her husband of 44 years, Brad Zuber; her children, Maria and her husband Mark Madden and Harry Zuber and his wife Deana Zuber-Hero, her beloved grandchildren Grace and Liam Madden. As well as her brother, Neal and wife Melissa Schuerer and wonderful nieces, nephews, and many friends whom Carol considered family.\nThe contributions of Carol\u2019s life are written on the hearts of all who met her. She found joy in encouraging others, building community, and sharing the love of Christ in everything she did.\nHer family finds comfort in knowing that, as Carol would often remind them, our hope is in our resurrected Lord.\nAll text and images \u00a9 Powell Funeral Homes.

It went up as much as 1.4% during the day and ended the day 0.9% higher at 3,331.83.\nWhat\u2019s behind Japan\u2019s market rally?\nThe rally was powered largely by technology stocks, which continued to dominate Japan\u2019s market momentum. Semiconductor and AI-related companies led the gains, with Socionext jumping nearly 17%, Advantest adding 3.9%, and Hitachi advancing 7.2%. These firms, which carry significant weight in the Nikkei, helped lift the index to its new highs.\nAdditionally, a weaker yen further bolstered sentiment, after the currency slid to a record low against the euro and its weakest level since February versus the US dollar. The decline followed the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to hold interest rates steady, with Governor Kazuo Ueda maintaining a cautious tone that reassured investors the country\u2019s loose monetary policy would continue. Export-heavy sectors benefited as the softer yen improved profit outlooks for major Japanese manufacturers.\nAt home, expectations have been growing for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s new government, which is said to be planning to implement a stimulus package that prioritizes AI and tech advancement.\nMarket experts, such as Naoya Oshikubo of MUFG Asset Management, have pointed out that the 52,000 level is \u201cjust a step on the way higher.\u201d\nUS tech stocks eat up their Wednesday gains\nMajor US stock indexes declined Thursday as investors digested several big tech earnings reports, with more set to be delivered after the bell.

This was as a result of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell saying that another interest rate cut in December \u201cis not a foregone conclusion\u2014far from it\u201d after the central bank cut its key rate by a quarter point.\nAt the same time, Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL), the parent company of Google, all released their quarterly results after the market closed on Wednesday.\nAlphabet\u2019s shares went up 2.5% to a new high after the company made more than $100 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. However, Meta\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s shares declined by about 11% and 3%, respectively, dragging down the indexes.\nApple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), two more members of the Magnificent Seven, reported results soon after the market opened on Thursday. At the end of the regular session, Apple shares were up 0.6% to a new high, while Amazon shares were down about 3%. After the market closed, both prices increased due to the quarterly reports.\nDown 109.88 points, or 0.23%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 47,522.12. Also, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the standard S&P 500 saw declines of 1.6% and 1% respectively.\nThe Nikkei stock market in Japan reached a new all-time high of 52,411.34 today, an increase of 2.1%.

It was the first time the Nikkei index broke into the 52,000 range.\nThe Nikkei\u2019s one-month gain was 16.6%, the second-highest monthly rise since 1976. The record high for the monthly gain was about 20% in Oct. 1990.\nThe Nikkei\u2019s strong performance is seen as stemming from the rise to power of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who has advocated aggressive fiscal expansion.

During this period, Argentina (58%) and Korea (20%) ranked first and second in gains.\nWhile stock prices rose on expectations that the Japanese government would pursue active fiscal policy, the yen weakened. The yen-dollar exchange rate at one point the same day surged to the mid-154-yen-per-dollar level, sending the yen to its lowest level in about eight months since Feb. In response, Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said at a news conference after the Cabinet meeting on the 31st of last month, \u201cWe are watching with high vigilance the excessive volatility and disorderly movements in the foreign exchange market,\u201d in remarks seen as verbal intervention to check the market."
