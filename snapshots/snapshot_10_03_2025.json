                "body": "Gold\u2019s meteoric rise to a record $3,800 per ounce last week is not a short-term anomaly, with multiple structural tailwinds that could sustain the rally well into 2026.\nThat\u2019s according to Aakash Doshi, global head of gold strategy at State Street Investment Management, who has been sharing his insights with InvestmentNews and cites three main reasons why the rally will continue through the end of the year.\n\u201cFirst, inflation remains persistent despite the Fed lowering interest rates, and lower rates make gold a more attractive commodity. Second, the world is entrenched in elevated geopolitical conflict, trade tensions, and economic fragility, building a strong demand for gold. And third, governments and central banks are ratcheting up their gold reserves, shying away from the declining US dollar,\u201d he says.\nDoshi pointed to a confluence of factors that are fueling the latest surge for the precious metal:\nInflationary pressures and shifting monetary policy are central to the story.\n\u201cInflation reduces purchasing power of the US dollar and is a general rise in price of goods and services where gold has traditionally been a hedge,\u201d Doshi says. \u201cGold pays no coupon and is a non-yielding asset, so lower nominal and real yields benefit gold by reducing the opportunity cost.\u201d\nHe says that one of the most striking trends is the shift by central banks.\n\u201cCentral banks went from being net sellers of gold, on average, for four decades into the Global Financial Crisis of 2008/09 to becoming structural net buyers since 2010,\u201d says Doshi. \u201c2025 will be the 16th consecutive year of net central bank gold buying and 2026 will likely be the 17th.\u201d\nHe sees this not only as diversification but as a hedge against the dollar.\n\u201cOfficial sector gold purchases have increased following the 2020/2021 pandemic shock to record levels. This is part of reserve diversification trends for CBs but also holding gold as a bearer asset (no credit risk), and US dollar hedge as the dollar share of reserves slowly declines. This may be exacerbated by trade wars and US retrenchment.\u201d\nAs to whether investors should view the rally as fleeting, Doshi says that the gold market has likely reset higher with $3,000 becoming the new $2,000 earlier in 2025.\n\u201cRight now, $3,500 seems to be decent support and the market is likely to target $4,000/oz this winter,\u201d he suggests. \u201cThe aggressiveness of the recent move higher likely warrants some caution, but a 5\u201310% pullback will likely be bought with record cash on the sidelines.\u201d\nGold is historically less correlated to stocks and bonds and negatively correlated to the US dollar, data over the past 40 years show that gold also tends to realize lower volatility versus equities.\nHowever, Doshi acknowledges the potential for short-term corrections.\n\u201cYes there is always risk for a pullback, especially as gold has been a top performing US dollar denominated macro asset class for the past two years. However, I do think a sell-off will be short lived and shallow without a structural bearish catalyst,\u201d he says.\nComparisons with other traditional hedges favor gold, according to Doshi.\n\u201cStock/bond correlations spiked to multi-decade highs in 2022, enhancing the case for gold in portfolios. While US stock/bond correlations have eased in 2H 2025, they are still historically high. Gold benefits from its diversification attributes in that environment,\u201d he says.\nInvestors looking for signals should keep an eye on US macro data.\n\u201cRight now, US jobs data and inflation data are key, to the extent stagflation risk is rising in the US economy,\u201d Doshi says. \u201cAsset market volatility is also very low across markets. Any sustained vol spike should benefit gold.\u201d\nFinally, on how to invest in gold today, Doshi points to ETFs.\n\u201cPhysically-backed gold ETFs, including the leading SPDR funds (GLD, GLDM), are a very cost-efficient way to get physical gold exposure to a financial screen. These instruments tend to be liquid, transparent, and easy to trade.\u201d\nRising li"

At the time of writing, XAU/USD trades at $3,844, down 0.50%.\nBullion dips below $3,820 after Logan warns on inflation trend\nThe Dallas Federal Reserve's Lorie Logan said that inflation is running above target and trending upward. However, she acknowledged risks on both sides of the dual mandate, saying that the labor market appears fairly balanced but slowing.\nIn the meantime, US economic data releases by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will be halted due to the government shutdown. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that data for the September Nonfarm Payrolls report had been collected and is still likely to be released, according to CNN.\nChallenger Job Cuts for September showed that companies announced plans to fire 54,064 people, less than August\u2019s 85,979. Andy Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said, \u201cRight now, we\u2019re dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases, and a transformative new technology.\u201d\nThe data further justifies the need for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Market participants are pricing in a 99% chance for a 25 bps rate cut at the October 29 meeting, which would bring the fed funds rate to the 3.75%-4% range.\nAhead this week, the economic docket will be absent, except for data to be released by private companies.

US real yields are also down slightly to 1.738%.\n- On Friday, the ISM Services PMI is expected to slow down from 52.0 to 51.7. The Employment sub-component, which could be sought in the case that payrolls are not released, was at 46.5 in August.\n- Wednesday\u2019s data revealed ADP figures for September, which showed that private companies cut 32K people from the workforce, below the 50K estimated to be hired.\n- Business activity in the manufacturing sector improved, as depicted by the ISM Manufacturing PMI. The index increased to 49.1 in September from 48.7 in August, though it was the seventh month that the PMI was in contractionary territory.\n- US job openings inched higher in August, rising to 7.23 million from 7.21 million, suggesting a still resilient labor market. However, the hiring rate slipped to 3.2%, its lowest since June 2024, while layoffs remained at historically low levels.\nTechnical outlook: Gold bulls take a breather ahead of challenging $3,900\nGold price is upwardly biased despite the formation of a \"shooting star\" candle, which is shifting toward an \"evening star\" as the US Dollar rises and Bullion sinks. A daily close below the September 30 open of $3,832 could pave the way for further downside.\nThe first support would be September 30 swing low of $3,793, followed by a test of the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $3,713. Conversely, the XAU/USD could challenge $3,850 ahead of the all-time high at $3,895, before testing $3,900.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed).

                "body": "Asia stocks: Nikkei boosted by tech before PM vote, Hong Kong dips on EV losses\nIn Monday\u2019s Commentary, we alerted readers that the dollar could be setting up for a reversal higher. Furthermore, we noted that if such a turn comes to fruition, some investors may encounter surprises. To wit:\nAs such, investors should examine their portfolios for risks that have developed with the reversal of the previously overbought dollar, to now very oversold.\nSuch reversals are often the thing that surprises complacent investors the most.\nA few readers asked us what assets are most at risk, especially if such a dollar appreciation is rapid. The easy answer is gold, as it, along with many commodities, tends to have a negative correlation with the dollar. The graph below shows the inverse relationship between gold and the dollar over the last three years. Beneath the price graph is the running 50-day correlation. This confirms what our eyes see in the price graph: gold has been rising while the dollar has been declining.\nThe following bar chart examines gold and other, more speculative assets that have performed well recently. This will help further answer the question of which securities are at risk if the dollar turns upward. As shown, on a year-to-date basis, gold, gold miners, and silver exhibit the most negative correlations. Next in line is Bitcoin. Lastly, the better-performing stock market sectors show a negative correlation, albeit one that is less pronounced than that of the precious metals and Bitcoin. Ethereum has the lowest correlation among the assets we chose.\nADP, JOLTS, And Tax Withholding\nIf the government shutdown continues through Friday, the BLS will not release the September employment report. While that report is one of the most important for investors and the Fed, there are plenty of other sources that can help us gauge what has been occurring in the labor markets since the last BLS report. Let\u2019s look at a few of them.\nADP: ADP reported that the number of jobs fell last month by 32k. The market was expecting a gain of 50k. Equally concerning, the prior month was revised lower by 57k jobs to -3k. Three of the last four months have now seen job shrinkage. The only other negative ADP print since COVID was in 2023, when they reported a loss of 53k jobs. This report suggests that the BLS is likely to report negligible job growth when it releases its monthly report. A negative print with further downward revisions would not be surprising.\nJOLTs: Job openings, which soared in 2021-2023, have fallen ever since. At 7.2 million, they are roughly in line with the peak existing before the pandemic. They should be higher given that the economy has grown substantially since then. However, the data can be somewhat flawed, as many companies advertise for employees but do not necessarily fill the jobs. The bottom graph in the second graphic is disturbing. It shows that there are now more unemployed people than job openings. At .98, the ratio is decently below the pre-pandemic rate of 1.25. This data aligns with continuing unemployment claims, which indicate that those recently laid off are having difficulty finding new employment.\nTax Withholding: The second graph below shows that IRS tax withholding, adjusted for wage inflation, has been running slightly above last year\u2019s levels. Assuming that job growth is rising, we would expect a decent gap between the weekly figures for each year. This is evident in the differences between 2022 and 2023, as well as between 2023 and 2024. The fact that 2025 is running barely above 2024 tells us job growth has been minimal.\nTweet of the Day\nWhich stocks should you consider in your very next trade?\nThe best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.\nThat's why smart investors use our Stock Screener with 50+ predefined screens and 160+ customizable filters to surface hidden gems instantly.\nFor example, the Piotroski's Picks m"

The OPEC 12 group hit 28.4 million barrels per day last month, up by 330,000 from August, with Saudi Arabia\u2019s daily output now near 9.85 million barrels. Iraq and the UAE nudged up their own numbers too, while exempt members like Iran, Libya, and Venezuela chipped in another 80,000 barrels combined. However, Nigeria saw a dip of 100,000 barrels per day. Even with these boosts, the bulk of OPEC+ supply cuts will stay in place through late 2025 \u2013 but these cautious hikes suggest the group is looking to fine-tune its grip on the market.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Steady output hikes could steady prices.\nGradual increases in OPEC+ output signal greater confidence in global demand \u2013 but also highlight a balancing act between economic headwinds and price stability. Oil prices have bounced around between $75 and $90 a barrel recently, as traders weigh evolving supply dynamics against concerns over global growth. This measured approach to upping supply, with quotas as guardrails and some countries given wiggle room, could help prevent major price swings and offer a smoother path for energy-reliant industries.\nThe bigger picture: A divided group shapes global supply.\nOPEC+'s deep supply cuts in 2022 helped stabilize prices after the chaos of the pandemic, but flexible production from countries like Iran and Libya keeps adding new wrinkles. This dual strategy \u2013 strict quotas for most, extra room for a few \u2013 gives OPEC+ more leeway to react to shifting demand, but also risks creating long-term volatility if those exceptions gain traction.

                "body": "What is fracking and why is it controversial?\nThe government says it plans to pass legislation to permanently ban fracking for shale gas in England.\nA moratorium on the practice was put in place by the last government but the debate has been reopened in recent weeks after the political party Reform committed to backing fracking if it came to power.\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments continue to remain opposed to the practise.\nWhat is fracking?\nHydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock. It involves drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals at a rock layer, to release the gas inside.\nWells can be drilled vertically or horizontally in order to release the gas.\nWhy is fracking controversial?\nThe injection of fluid at high pressure into the rock can cause earth tremors - small movements in the earth's surface.\nIn 2019, more than 120 tremors were recorded during drilling at a Cuadrilla site in Blackpool.\nSeismic events of this scale are considered minor and are rarely felt by people, but they are a concern to local residents.\nShale gas is also a fossil fuel, and campaigners say allowing fracking could distract energy firms and governments from investing in renewable and green sources of energy.\nFracking also uses huge amounts of water, which must be transported to the site at significant environmental cost.\nWhat has the government said about fracking?\nGovernment policy on fracking has see-sawed over recent years. Former Prime Minister Liz Truss looked to reintroduce the practice, despite local opposition - but this was subsequently reversed by Rishi Sunak who introduced a moratorium.\nIn October 2025, at the Labour Party Conference, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would move to legislate against fracking, banning the practice permanently.\nThis follows a commitment made by the Labour Party in its manifesto and further commitments by PM Sir Keir Starmer in September that the practice would be \"banned for good\".\nBut Reform has said it would seek to allow the practice should it be elected, as part of its \"war\" on renewable developers.\nIn his speech at the conference, Miliband said the practice was: \"Dangerous and deeply harmful to our natural environment.\n\"The good news is that communities have fought back and won this fight before and will do so again,\" he added.\nWhere has fracking taken place in the UK?\nFracking for shale gas in the UK has only previously taken place on a small scale, due to the many public and legal challenges.\nHowever, exploration has identified large swathes of shale gas across the UK, particularly in northern England.\nMore than 100 exploration and drilling licences were awarded to firms including Third Energy, IGas, Aurora Energy Resources and Ineos.\nCuadrilla was the only company given consent to begin fracking.\nIt drilled two wells at a site in Lancashire but faced repeated protests from local people and campaigners.\nIn 2022, the Oil and Gas Authority told Cuadrilla to permanently concrete and abandon the wells.\nCould fracking lower energy bills?\nThe UK can only meet 48% of its gas demand from domestic supplies (this would be 54% if it did not export any gas).\nSome MPs have claimed that restarting drilling at Cuadrilla's two existing wells could be done quickly, and would provide significant supplies.\nCuadrilla claimed that \"just 10%\" of the gas from shale deposits in Lancashire and surrounding areas \"could supply 50 years' worth of current UK gas demand\".\nEnergy experts dispute this, pointing out that the UK's shale gas reserves are held in complex layers of rock.\nMike Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick University, says estimates of how much shale gas the UK has are not the same as the amount of gas that could be produced commercially.\nBut Prof Geoffrey Maitland, professor of Energy Engineering at Imperial College London, has said fracking could provide interim relief.\n\"Although shale"

Kazaks added that uncertainty remains very high and must retain full freedom of action.\nThe EUR/USD pair maintains its position the US Dollar (USD) advances as traders largely dismiss the concerns over the ongoing US government shutdown. The partial US government shutdown will likely delay the release of key US macro including the US September Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report. The US ISM Services PMI and the final S&P Global Services PMI reports are due later on Friday.\nThe shutdown is expected to extend until next week. Senate Democrats are poised to vote against a GOP-backed short-term funding bill again tomorrow, and the Senate is unlikely to meet this weekend.\nThe weakness in the US labor market boosts bets on further Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in a 97% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and a 91% possibility of another reduction in December.\nECB FAQs\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for the region. The ECB primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nIn extreme situations, the European Central Bank can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the ECB prints Euros and uses them to buy assets \u2013 usually government or corporate bonds \u2013 from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Euro. QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The ECB used it during the Great Financial Crisis in 2009-11, in 2015 when inflation remained stubbornly low, as well as during the covid pandemic.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the European Central Bank (ECB) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the ECB stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Euro.\nAuthor\nAkhtar Faruqui\nFXStreet\nAkhtar Faruqui is a Forex Analyst based in New Delhi, India.

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar Steadies at 1.1740 as Shutdown Freezes U.S. Data and Fed Cut Bets Surge\nDollar index capped near 97.75, ADP jobs report shows -32K, Eurozone jobless rate rises to 6.3%, and markets eye 1.1770 breakout for further gains | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Holds 1.1740 as Shutdown Stalls U.S. Data and Investors Eye ECB Clues\nThe EUR/USD pair is trading around 1.1740 after several sessions of compressed volatility. The four-day rally that briefly lifted the euro to 1.1755 has stalled, reflecting a balance between dollar weakness tied to the U.S. government shutdown and softer European fundamentals. Wall Street\u2019s gains and the dollar\u2019s intraday rebound pulled the pair off its highs, but the euro remains resilient above 1.1710 support, consolidating near levels last seen in mid-September.\nGovernment Shutdown Freezes U.S. Data, Fed Rate-Cut Bets Surge\nThe U.S. political standoff has shuttered federal agencies and blocked the release of critical labor data including September nonfarm payrolls, leaving markets without the Fed\u2019s most important input ahead of its October 29 meeting. The shutdown is already costing $400 million daily in lost wages for 750,000 furloughed workers, compounding political dysfunction at a delicate economic moment.\nWith data blackouts, traders are leaning heavily on private surveys. The ADP Employment Report showed a loss of 32,000 private jobs in September, the steepest decline since March 2023, while August was revised down to -3,000 from an initially reported +54,000. That weakness pushed Fed cut bets higher: markets now price a 99% probability of a 25 bp cut in October and an 86% chance of another in December, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch.\nEurozone Macro Weakness: Rising Unemployment, Mixed Inflation Picture\nAcross the euro area, data has been far from encouraging. The Eurozone unemployment rate climbed to 6.3% in August from 6.2%, overshooting expectations of stability. Inflation surprised mildly higher: the September Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) advanced to 2.2% YoY, while core inflation held at 2.3%, suggesting lingering price stickiness even as growth momentum fades.\nThe ECB has stuck with its \u201cmeeting-by-meeting\u201d guidance. President Christine Lagarde called current policy \u201cin a good place,\u201d while Governing Council members emphasized flexibility given balanced risks. For now, markets see the ECB on hold into 2026, with policy only shifting if inflation reaccelerates or growth deteriorates further.\nU.S. Dollar Index Stalls, Technical Levels Define EUR/USD Range\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is oscillating near 97.70\u201397.75, failing to mount a decisive rebound despite the shutdown. Technicals show DXY capped by the 50-day EMA at 97.79 and the 200-day EMA at 97.73, with RSI at 44 signaling waning momentum. For EUR/USD, the range is defined:\n-\nResistance: 1.1770\u20131.1780, a zone tested repeatedly but not broken. Clearing it opens 1.1820 and 1.1880.\n-\nSupport: 1.1710\u20131.1700, reinforced by the 200-period SMA and Fibonacci retracements. A break would expose 1.1650 and 1.1615.\nThe daily chart shows EUR/USD stuck under a flat 20-SMA while holding above a mildly bullish 100-SMA near 1.1600. On the 4-hour chart, RSI sits near 51 and momentum is subdued, suggesting markets await a trigger.\nSpeculative Positioning and Investor Flows\nCFTC data shows net euro longs trimming to 114,000 contracts, their lowest since July, while shorts narrowed to 165,000 contracts. Open interest climbed to a two-week high of 859,000, showing traders are engaged but cautious. ETF flows into euro-based assets have slowed, reflecting hesitation to bet aggressively on the common currency until the U.S. shutdown resolves or clearer ECB signals emerge.\nTrade Tensions Add to Macro Overhang\nThe backdrop of trade remains a wild card. Washington maintains a 30% tariff on Chinese imports, while Beijing keeps 10% duties on American goods. A truce delayed further escalation, but auto tariffs remain unresolve"

                "body": "The EUR/USD has posted two consecutive losing sessions, with a short-term decline of nearly 0.6% in favor of the U.S. dollar. For now, the pair shows a neutral bias, mainly due to political uncertainty in the U.S., which has pushed the market into a sideways pattern and prevented the formation of consistent directional moves. As long as this situation persists, neutrality could continue to dominate in the coming trading sessions.\nWhat\u2019s Happening in the U.S.?\nThe government shutdown has entered its second day, and there is still no clarity on how it will be resolved or how long it might last. Non-essential government activities have been suspended, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees without pay or work, and so far neither the Executive nor the Senate has given clear signs that the situation will be resolved this week.\nThis event reflects a deterioration in political confidence and poses an institutional risk regarding government functionality. If prolonged, it could cause billions in losses to U.S. GDP due to the paralysis of key economic agencies. Although the impact has not yet been strongly reflected in the dollar, a longer shutdown\u2014like the last one, which lasted more than a month\u2014could significantly erode confidence in the currency.\nAnother point to consider is that among the agencies affected by the shutdown are those responsible for releasing employment data, meaning tomorrow\u2019s scheduled Non-Farm Payrolls report could be delayed. Without such key economic indicators, the Federal Reserve would have fewer tools for decision-making, reinforcing expectations that there could still be two more rate cuts before the end of the year. Lower rates reduce the appeal of dollar-denominated assets and could, in the medium term, weaken the currency as an indirect consequence of the shutdown.\nIn conclusion, while the dollar has not yet shown a sharp decline in the face of political risk, if the shutdown continues for several weeks, it would heighten distrust in the greenback\u2014both due to institutional instability and the lack of economic data. In that case, the euro could benefit from more consistent buying pressure in the short term.\nWhat Does the European Central Bank Think?\nThere were also important ECB updates this week. President Christine Lagarde stated that inflation risks in the eurozone are under control and highlighted that the eurozone economy has held up well despite U.S. tariffs. However, she also noted that the central bank would likely maintain a neutral stance in upcoming decisions to prevent inflation from rising again.\nRecent data shows that annual inflation for September rose to 2.2%, up from 2.0% in August, confirming that prices have started to climb again.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nFollowing these remarks, the ECB Watch tool now shows a 98.2% probability that the current 2.00% deposit rate will remain unchanged at the October 28 meeting. This is in line with the ECB\u2019s rhetoric of prioritizing stability without resorting to rate cuts.\nSource: ECBWATCH\nIn this context, it appears the ECB will remain neutral through the rest of the year. This stance contrasts with the more accommodative policy the Fed may adopt, which would reduce the interest rate differential between the two regions. Over time, this dynamic could make dollar investments less attractive while generating buying pressure on the euro, potentially paving the way for a relevant bullish bias in EUR/USD in the coming weeks.\nEUR/USD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Bearish momentum emerges: Since September 17, EUR/USD has been setting progressively lower lows, reinforcing a short-term bearish bias. However, the emergence of indecision candles around key support levels casts doubt on the strength of this move, which is not yet enough to establish a solid downtrend. Unless selling pressure breaks through key barriers, a neutral scenario could prevail in the short term.\n- RSI: The RSI line has crossed below the 50 neutral level and"

Sterling\u2019s resilience comes against a backdrop of broad-based U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) weakness, which slid toward 97.70\u201397.75, pressured by political paralysis in Washington and deteriorating labor data. With the U.S. government shutdown halting economic releases, traders are pricing in a 99% probability of a 25-basis-point Federal Reserve rate cut in October, placing the policy rate in the 3.75%\u20134.00% range.\nLabor Market Data Undermines the Greenback\nU.S. employment signals have sharply weakened. The ADP private payrolls report showed a loss of 32,000 jobs in September, the steepest drop since March 2023, compared to expectations for a 51,000 gain. Even more troubling, August payrolls were revised from a gain of 54,000 to a loss of 3,000, further underlining a reversal in labor momentum. Wage growth at 4.5% year-over-year was not enough to offset the dismal headline, and with official NFP data delayed due to the shutdown, the ADP miss carries even more weight in shaping expectations.\nThe soft data comes alongside continued manufacturing weakness. The ISM PMI rose slightly to 49.1 in September, but remained in contraction for a seventh consecutive month. This mix of weakening labor and persistent industrial malaise has convinced markets that the Fed will need to stay dovish, even if Treasury yields continue to provide a defensive bid for the dollar.\nBoE Signals Restrictive Bias Despite Inflation Cooling Risks\nAcross the Atlantic, the Bank of England\u2019s communication continues to support Sterling. Policymaker Catherine Mann warned that inflation remains sticky, despite a series of prior rate hikes, emphasizing that the BoE must not prematurely loosen policy. Deputy Governor Clare Lombardelli echoed caution, noting that inflation shocks cannot be dismissed as temporary.\nStill, the central bank acknowledged the risk of inflation eventually undershooting the 2% target. For now, UK inflation stood near 4% in September, above the BoE\u2019s comfort zone. This balancing act \u2014 tightening bias without overdoing it \u2014 has given Sterling relative strength against the dollar, allowing GBP/USD to defend the 1.3450\u20131.3500 band even during volatility.\nShutdown Amplifies Dollar Vulnerability\nThe U.S. government shutdown, with lawmakers failing to secure funding, has shut down the release of crucial economic reports, creating a \u201cdata blackout\u201d scenario. Without reliable data, the Fed\u2019s path becomes increasingly uncertain, raising the odds of policy missteps. Historically, periods of fiscal paralysis have driven investors into Treasuries, indirectly supporting the dollar. But this time, with labor and consumption signals already weak, the shutdown amplifies downside risks for the greenback rather than cushioning it.\nRead More\n-\nGPIX ETF vs SPYI ETF: Yield Clash as $52 ETFs Compete for S&P 500 Income Leadership\n02.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRPI vs XRPR: Ripple XRP ETFs Split Paths as XRP-USD Prices Diverge and SEC Approval Looms\n02.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Futures Surge to $3.48 as Storage Miss, LNG Flows, and Early Cold Weather Drive Gains\n02.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Falls Below 147.00 as U.S. Job Losses, Shutdown Risks, and BoJ Hawkish Tilt Drive Yen Strength\n02.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Levels: Cable\u2019s Battle Around 1.3500\nOn the charts, GBP/USD is testing the 1.3500 resistance zone, a key psychological pivot aligned with the 200-period m"

The headline job growth figure has also been close to zero for the past four months, two of which has seen full-time employment slashed by around 40k jobs.\nWhile the jobs market is softening, conditions are not weak enough to justify drastic policy action from the RBA at this stage, though it could pave the way for a cut or two.\nData source: ABS, LSEG\nRBA and Fed Policy Outlook: Rate Cuts Likely in Q4\nA recent Reuters poll shows that 35 out of 38 economists expect a single 25bp RBA cut by December. Meanwhile, RBA cash rate futures are projecting a terminal rate of 3.125% by July 2026, implying around 47.5bp of easing by the start of H2 2026.\nIn my view, the RBA could act as early as November, with trimmed mean inflation now sitting comfortably inside the 2\u20133% target band and the labour market gradually weakening. The timing of a further 25bp cut will depend on how quickly conditions deteriorate, though Q1 2026 looks possible, with Q2 more likely.\nFor the Fed, futures currently imply an 85% chance of a November cut, but the odds of a December move have diminished after Q2 GDP was revised higher to 3.8%. While the US labour market is softening, inflation is also ticking higher, making it harder for the Fed to commit to further easing. This has seen the US dollar rebound from key support levels, as markets reduce expectations of a second December cut. This leaves the RBA\u2013Fed interest rate spread anchored at -90bp, assuming both central banks deliver just one cut in Q4.\nData source: RBA, Fed, LSEG\nRBA, Fed/FOMC Meetings in Q4\n- 20 October"

                "body": "The Australian Dollar (AUD) against the US Dollar (USD) is experiencing a phase of consolidation with a softer underlying tone. Analysts suggest it will trade within a range of 0.6585 to 0.6625 in the short term. The AUD recently surged to a high of 0.6629; however, this increase appears to have been excessive. It settled unchanged at 0.6611, indicating a possible continuation of consolidation.\nOver a longer timeframe, the AUD is expected to remain neutral, fluctuating between 0.6545 and 0.6655. Despite recent market movements, further consolidation is anticipated, suggesting a lower trading range. This aligns with previous forecasts from UOB Group analysts, indicating no change in their outlook. The information is sourced from observations by expert analysts and additional insights from various teams.\nFuture Framework\nFrom our perspective on October 2, 2025, the Australian dollar is likely to remain in a holding pattern against the US dollar for the next few weeks. We expect it to trade within a defined channel, likely between 0.6545 and 0.6655. This suggests that aggressive bets on a major breakout in either direction may not be the most prudent approach right now.\nThis neutrality is reinforced by the actions of central banks, with both the Reserve Bank of Australia and the US Federal Reserve appearing to be on hold. For instance, recent inflation data from last month, September 2025, showed Australian CPI moderating to around 3.4%, giving the RBA room to wait. This mirrors the situation we saw through much of 2024 when both banks paused to assess economic conditions.\nA softer underlying tone for the AUD is also supported by recent economic reports from China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner. Recent PMI figures from September 2025 hovered just around the 50-mark, indicating stalled manufacturing growth. This economic uncertainty in China tends to weigh on commodity prices and, by extension, the Aussie dollar\u2019s upward potential.\nTrading Strategies\nGiven this expected range, strategies that benefit from low volatility could be advantageous in the coming weeks. Traders might consider selling options with strike prices comfortably outside the 0.6545 to 0.6655 range. This approach profits from the currency pair remaining stable and the options expiring worthless.\nThis type of market behavior is not unprecedented; we observed similar periods of consolidation for the AUD/USD back in 2023. During that time, the pair was also caught between competing global economic narratives, leading to extended sideways movement. Recognizing these historical patterns helps manage expectations for the weeks ahead."

The \u201csell America\u201d episode following Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs fractured its historic link to U.S. yields, though shorter-term correlations with Treasury yields and Fed funds pricing are slowly rebuilding.\nU.S. labour market data remains the dominant driver, with payrolls, ADP, JOLTS and jobless claims closely watched alongside the risk of reduced Fed independence. Japan is more straightforward, with inflation and the upcoming LDP leadership vote shaping expectations for BoJ policy. Market pricing points to continued Fed easing and a potential series of BoJ hikes.\nTechnicals reinforce the prevailing range, with momentum now neutral to modestly bullish. Given the environment, sideways trade is favoured.\nUSD/JPY Slowly Rebuilding Rates Link\nSource: TradingView\nThe tight link between USD/JPY and U.S. yields, along with the broader rate differential between the U.S. and Japan, was fractured by Donald Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariff announcement in April. It triggered a \u201csell America\u201d trade that overrode these traditional drivers. The shaded window on the chart above highlights how the pair\u2019s responsiveness to yields and yield spreads collapsed.\nSince then, correlations with U.S. rates have started to re-emerge on shorter horizons, especially against Treasury yields and Fed rate cut pricing. They are not yet back to historic extremes, but the rebuilding link suggests U.S. data will likely be the dominant driver of USD/JPY in Q4.\nWhat also stands out is the lack of correlation with other historic drivers. VIX and S&P 500 futures, once reliable markers of USD/JPY direction through the carry trade channel, have offered little signal recently. With yen funding costs creeping higher, the appetite for risk-sensitive carry trades may be fading, leaving the pair more tightly bound to the ebb and flow of U.S. rate pricing.\nFed, BOJ Pricing in Focus\nSource: Bloomberg\nMarkets have firmed their bets on further Fed easing following a resumption of the easing cycle in September. Swaps imply 100 basis points of cuts by July next year, with two 25-point moves seen as highly likely before year-end. After that, the pace slows to one cut per quarter.\nFor the Bank of Japan, October is in play. A 25-point hike is currently a coin toss, reflecting the two board members dissented in favour of tightening at the September meeting. This is highly unusual for the BOJ, particularly under Governor Ueda, raising the possibility it was designed to prepare markets for a move when the next set of forecasts arrives. By November, the implied probability climbs to just under 80%, with a full hike effectively priced by January. Looking further ahead, another 25-point increase by July is seen as near certain at just under 97%.\nKey U.S. Fundamental Drivers\nThe Federal Reserve has made clear its bias. It is far more sensitive to labour market weakness than inflation overshoots, as shown by the decision to resume its easing cycle in September despite evidence of building price pressures, led by services rather than goods. That places increased weight on the remaining nonfarm payrolls reports this year, even with legitimate doubts over their reliability given the hefty downward revisions of recent years.\nSource: LSEG (U.S. ET shown)\nJerome Powell has already flagged concern that today\u2019s \u201clow firing, low hiring\u201d environment could be a precursor to higher unemployment. That puts other labour market gauges firmly in focus, including JOLTS, weekly jobless claims and the ADP Employment report, with the latter arguably offering a more consistent rea"

After touching 149.90 in late September, the pair reversed sharply, losing nearly 300 pips in a week. The rejection just below the 150.00 psychological barrier highlights how fragile dollar momentum has become in Q4.\nUS Government Shutdown and Labor Market Erosion Weigh on the Dollar\nThe U.S. government shutdown has created a \u201cdata blackout,\u201d with the crucial September Nonfarm Payrolls report unlikely to be published. Investors are left with the ADP private payrolls release, which showed a 32,000 job loss in September, the steepest decline since March 2023. August was revised lower as well, from a gain of 54,000 to a loss of 3,000. Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing PMI printed 49.1, marking seven consecutive months of contraction. These signals add to growing evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing. The CME FedWatch Tool now assigns a 99% probability of a 25 bps rate cut in October, with odds of another in December climbing toward 86%.\nYield Differentials Shrink as U.S. Treasuries Lose Appeal Against JGBs\nThe U.S.-Japan rate spread, a critical driver of USD/JPY, is narrowing. The 2-year U.S. Treasury vs. JGB yield premium dropped to 2.69% from 2.90% in mid-August. The 10-year spread has slid to 2.45%, breaking key support at 2.47%. With Treasuries losing relative appeal, capital is tilting toward yen-denominated assets, providing structural support for JPY appreciation.\nBank of Japan Policy and Domestic Data Bolster Yen\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s recent summary of opinions showed board members openly discussing a 0.25% rate hike as early as October, marking another step in policy normalization. Inflation remains above target, with Japan\u2019s core-core CPI still elevated. The Q3 Tankan survey strengthened to 14 from 13, the best reading since Q4 2024, signaling robust corporate sentiment. Labor data is equally firm, with the unemployment rate holding near 2.3\u20132.4%. Together, these metrics justify a tightening bias, narrowing the policy gap with the Federal Reserve.\nJapanese Politics and Market Sentiment\nThe ruling Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s leadership election on October 4 is pivotal. The outcome will determine Japan\u2019s next Prime Minister and could shift fiscal and monetary priorities. Investors expect continuity in support for gradual BoJ normalization, which has added confidence to yen bulls. Meanwhile, global equity resilience \u2014 with the S&P 500 pushing record highs \u2014 has reduced safe-haven bids for the dollar, leaving USD/JPY vulnerable to downside pressure.\nTechnical Picture: Bearish Setup Intensifies\nTechnically, USD/JPY has broken below both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, now acting as resistance at 147.80\u2013148.10. Price action carved out a five-month ascending wedge, with critical support at 146.30. A decisive break under 146.30 would signal a medium-term bearish breakout, opening the way to 145.20, then 145.00, with deeper risk toward 142.80, the July low. Candlestick patterns reinforce this, as repeated rejections at 148.80 and a string of red candles have shaped a potential \u201cthree black crows\u201d continuation signal. The RSI at 31 indicates oversold conditions, allowing for a short-term rebound, but momentum bias remains lower.\nRead More\n-\nGPIX ETF vs SPYI ETF: Yield Clash as $52 ETFs Compete for S&P 500 Income Leadership\n02.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRPI vs XRPR: Ripple XRP ETFs Split Paths as XRP-USD Prices Diverge and S"

                "body": "The US Dollar has retreated against the Japanese Yen, dropping below 147.00, reaching session lows at 146.75. Market dynamics are being influenced by US government shutdown concerns and disappointing employment data impacting Dollar performance.\nThe Dollar weakness is linked to a 32,000 decline in US private payrolls for September, deviating from the expected 50,000 increase. With August figures revised to a 3,000 drop, pressure mounts on the Federal Reserve to consider easing its monetary policy.\nHawkish Stance of BoJ\nData has increased expectations for a quarter-point interest rate reduction by the Fed in October, with a perceived chance of an additional cut in December now at 86%. Meanwhile, the Yen gains strength from the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) hawkish stance, raising hopes for policy tightening.\nThe BoJ\u2019s policies have previously caused the Yen to depreciate, but speculation arose about potential rate hikes following recent inflation trends. With a new Prime Minister set for election, the BoJ might adjust its ultra-loose policy. Rising Japanese inflation, surpassing the BoJ\u2019s 2% target, also influences policy considerations.\nWe are seeing the US Dollar weaken significantly, with USD/JPY breaking below the key 147.00 level. This is driven by fears of a US government shutdown and poor economic data, which suggests a slowing economy. The market is now focused on the dollar\u2019s inability to hold its gains.\nThe recent ADP report, which showed a 32,000 job loss in September, has amplified concerns that began after last month\u2019s Non-Farm Payrolls also missed expectations. All eyes are now on tomorrow\u2019s official NFP data for September, which could confirm this weakening trend. This has led many to believe the Federal Reserve has no choice but to cut interest rates.\nMarket Reactions and Future Prospects\nBased on current Fed funds futures, the probability of a quarter-point rate cut at the October meeting is now priced at over 90%. This is a sharp increase from just a few weeks ago and reflects the market\u2019s conviction that the Fed must act to support the economy. The chances of a second cut in December are also rising, putting sustained pressure on the dollar.\nMeanwhile, the Japanese Yen is gaining strength on its own merits. The Bank of Japan is signaling a move away from its ultra-loose monetary policy, a major shift that began when it ended negative interest rates back in March 2024. With Japan\u2019s core inflation holding near 2.8% for the past several months, the case for the BoJ to tighten policy further is growing.\nFor derivatives traders, this points toward positioning for further USD/JPY downside in the coming weeks. Buying put options on USD/JPY could be a straightforward way to profit from a continued decline. Given the upcoming economic data and central bank uncertainty, implied volatility is likely to remain elevated, making options strategies attractive.\nLooking back, the move from above 151 in late 2023 to below 147 now marks a clear reversal of the previous trend. The break of this psychological level suggests momentum is with the bears. Traders should watch for a potential move toward the 145.00 support area next.\nHowever, the main risk to this outlook is a surprisingly strong US jobs report or a swift resolution to the government shutdown. Either event could cause a sharp, short-term rebound in the US Dollar. Therefore, managing risk on any short USD/JPY positions is critical."

Separate public consultations by the U.S., Canada and Mexico on the trade pact have begun in recent weeks.\nThe Canadian dollar is set to strengthen over the coming year against its U.S. counterpart as expected Federal Reserve interest rate cuts weigh on the greenback, but uncertain prospects for the USMCA could put that forecast at risk, a Reuters poll found.\nThe Bank of Canada is considering changes to how it measures preferred inflation metrics to give it a better idea of how external shocks are affecting the economy, Deputy Governor Rhys Mendes said.\nCanadian government bond yields moved lower across the curve, with the 10-year down 1.8 basis points at 3.167%."

                "body": "GBP/JPY finds temporary support near 198.00, outlook remains bearish\n- GBP/JPY finds a temporary support near 198.00 as the rally in the Japanese Yen hits a pause.\n- The US government shutdown has increased the safe-haven demand of the Japanese Yen.\n- BoE\u2019s Breeden delivers dovish interest rate guidance, citing economic risks.\nThe downfall in the GBP/JPY pair hits a pause after a three-day losing streak around 198.00 during the Asian trading session on Thursday. However, the outlook of the pair remains bearish as the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese Yen (JPY) has increased, following the United States (US) government closure.\nWashington went into darkness on Tuesday midnight after government funding stopped as Republicans failed to persuade Democrats to support the stopgap bill in voting at the House of Senate. This has forced investors to shift to the safe-haven fleet.\nAnother reason behind the strength in the Japanese Yen is firm expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will remain on its path towards policy normalization. The BoJ Summary of Opinions (SOP) for the September meeting showed that Japan\u2019s central bank will continue aiming towards increasing interest rates if the economy and prices move in line with forecasts.\nHowever, BoJ\u2019s SOP showed that officials are still concerned about a potential economic slowdown due to tariffs imposed by the US, while they were confident that its impact would be temporary.\nMeanwhile, the Pound Sterling (GBP) is broadly under pressure as Bank of England (BoE) Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden has argued in favour of reducing interest rates, citing that higher interest rates for longer could harm economic prospects and push inflationary pressures below the central bank\u2019s target of 2%. \u201cRisks in holding policy too tight for too long could pull inflation below target,\u201d Breeden said on Tuesday.\nBoE\u2019s Breeden was one of seven Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members who voted to hold interest rates steady at 4% in the September policy meeting.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nSagar Dua\nFXStreet\nSagar Dua is associated with the financial markets from his college days.

That rally capped a 10% weekly gain and comes as Washington entered a government shutdown, ETFs absorbed record inflows, and on-chain data revealed mounting liquidity pressure at higher levels. The global crypto market cap rose to $4.17 trillion, up 4% in 24 hours, with Bitcoin holding 56.7% dominance, a reminder of its unmatched position in digital assets. Ethereum (ETH-USD) traded above $4,368, Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP-USD) climbed to $2.96, and Solana (SOL-USD) jumped past $223, but Bitcoin remains the driver.\nLiquidity and Technical Breakout Place $120K in Focus for BTC\nOn the daily chart, Bitcoin decisively reclaimed the $114K support, a level that had capped bulls for weeks. Breaking through $116K triggered a liquidity sweep that forced out shorts, sending price into the $118K zone just below the critical $120K\u2013$124K supply block. Liquidity heatmaps show dense clusters stacked above $120K, suggesting a breakout could fuel liquidation-driven rallies into $124K\u2013$130K.\nThe 4-hour chart confirms this structure. Bitcoin has transformed $114K\u2013$115K into a demand base. As long as bids defend that block, the path remains higher. RSI prints above 62 on daily candles, MACD has crossed into positive territory, and Bollinger bands show expansion with the upper band near $118,300. Despite an RSI spike to 90 on shorter timeframes, historically such \u201coverbought\u201d levels can persist deep into parabolic legs.\nETF Inflows Hit $1.6 Billion in Three Days, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT Emerges as Dominant Player\nFlows into U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs have reignited institutional demand. In just three sessions, ETFs absorbed $1.6 billion net, with BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) accounting for $405 million in a single day. IBIT has now broken into the top 20 ETFs by AUM with $40 billion, up 85% in the last year, and could enter the top 10 by 2026 if the pace persists. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC added $179 million, while the broader market saw $676 million in just one day of October inflows.\nThese inflows offset derivatives market caution. Options skew shows heavy hedging for downside, yet implied volatility remains cheap compared with realized swings. That imbalance suggests room for aggressive positioning if Bitcoin clears $120K.\nOn-Chain Accumulation and Treasury Moves Bolster the Bull Case\nJapanese investment group Metaplanet expanded its Bitcoin treasury, adding 5,268 BTC valued at $623 million at an average $116,870 per coin, bringing total holdings to 30,823 BTC. This accumulation cements its position as the fourth-largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder. On-chain data also highlights steady long-term holder accumulation, now surpassing 298,000 BTC in \u201caccumulation addresses.\u201d The Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) has flipped bullish, implying sidelined liquidity is primed to rotate into Bitcoin.\nWhales and corporate treasuries are not the only force. Retail speculation has intensified via Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a new Layer-2 project on Solana Virtual Machine rails, which has raised $19.7 million in presale. The parallel capital allocation to BTC-linked projects underscores how Bitcoin\u2019s strength drives value across the ecosystem.\nRead More\n-\nGPIX ETF vs SPYI ETF: Yield Clash as $52 ETFs Compete for S&P 500 Income Leadership\n02.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRPI vs XRPR: Ripple XRP ETFs Split Paths as XRP-USD Prices Diverge and SEC Approval Looms\n02.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Futures Surge to $3.48 as Storage Miss, LNG Flows, and Early Cold Weather Drive Gains\n02.10.2025 \u00b7 Tra"

In fact, Bitcoin is estimated to have gained a mind-boggling 11 billion percent from its earliest tracked price of approximately $0.00099. However, throughout the past decade and a half of Bitcoin\u2019s history, there have been several devastating drawdowns of 80% or more. In other words, Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric price rise has not been easy to hold in hindsight. Returns have been anything but steady, instead come in bunches with dramatic volatility in between.\nWhile market timing can be challenging, Bitcoin tends to perform better in some seasons and worse in others. As we approach a new month, it\u2019s worth noting Bitcoin\u2019s robust track record during the month of October and into the fall season. Since its debut in 2010, Bitcoin has been green in October ~73% of the time. Meanwhile, returns have been robust, averaging 29.23%.\nMeanwhile, November is also a strong month historically for Bitcoin. While Bitcoin tends to be less volatile in October than November, November\u2019s average returns are a robust 37.64%. Seasonally speaking, the current time is the optimal moment to buy Bitcoin from a seasonal perspective.\nCrypto Will Benefit from Government Tailwinds\nDuring President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, he was fairly neutral on Bitcoin and the crypto industry. However, after The Trump Organization was allegedly \u2018debanked\u2019 by mainstream banks like JPMorgan, President Trump warmed up to the crypto industry, seeing it as a means of keeping overreaching bans in check. In Trump\u2019s current administration, crypto transformed into a priority. Thus far in his second term, President Trump has appointed a \u2018Crypto Czar,\u2019 fired anti-crypto Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, and passed two pro-crypto bills (the CLARITY Act & the GENIUS Act).\nFor crypto companies like Coinbase, regulatory clarity is a big deal. However, the Trump Administration is striving to do more with crypto than provide clear regulations. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent views stablecoins like Circle Group\u2019s USDC as a means of maintaining dollar supremacy, financing the US debt, and increasing demand for US treasuries.\nMeanwhile, though controversial, Trump and his family have \u2018skin in the game\u2019 with three new crypto-related ventures. Whether you believe such businesses are ethical or not, they ensure that Trump has more than enough motivation to ensure that the crypto industry continues to flourish.\nInterest Rate Cuts Benefit Bitcoin\nAt the last FOMC meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally cut interest rates by 25 basis points after a long period of pause. Interest rate cuts are often a bullish catalyst for crypto assets and proxies such as the iShares Bitcoin ETF and the iShares Ethereum Trust because lower benchmark rates make borrowing cheaper, leading to increased liquidity into risk-on assets. Additionally, lower interest rates can lead to a weaker dollar, making Bitcoin (a hedge against currency debasement) more attractive.\nBitcoin Technical View\nBitcoin has been rangebound since late July. However, on Tuesday, Bitcoin attempted to retake its intermediate-term 50-day moving average. Should the IBIT ETF break out of the current range, the Fibonacci extensions suggest a minimum price target of ~$75.\nBottom Line\nThe stage is set for a significant move higher in Bitcoin. Between the robust historical performance of October and November, the new regulatory clarity and backing from the Trump Administration, and the stimulative effect of interest rate cuts, Bitcoin is full of bullish tailwinds.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have "

On October 2, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Thailand announced its plans to introduce ETFs that include a wider range of cryptocurrencies. This decision follows the growing demand for more diverse investment opportunities in the country\u2019s rapidly expanding crypto market.\nUnder the new plans, the SEC intends to allow local mutual funds and institutions to issue ETFs that include cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana, along with Bitcoin. This shift represents a strategic move to attract institutional investors and provide more options for Thai investors who wish to diversify their portfolios with digital assets. Thailand\u2019s first Bitcoin ETF was approved earlier in 2024, but this new initiative will open the door to a broader selection of cryptocurrencies.\nNew Leadership Drives Continuity in Crypto Policies\nThailand\u2019s recent leadership change sparked concerns that the country\u2019s crypto-friendly stance might shift. The country\u2019s new Prime Minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, took office in September 2025, replacing Paetongtarn Shinawatra.\nWhile Shinawatra\u2019s government had embraced crypto as part of its economic diversification strategy, Charnvirakul\u2019s background in business rather than fintech led to speculation about possible changes in policy.\nDespite these concerns, Charnvirakul has maintained the country\u2019s pro-crypto direction. The announcement of expanding crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin underlines the continuity of the country\u2019s stance on digital assets. A key factor in this policy stability is the retention of Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira, who has remained in his post and continues to support the expansion of digital asset initiatives in Thailand.\nSEC\u2019s Role in Broadening Crypto Asset Investment\nThe Thai SEC\u2019s decision to allow a wider range of digital assets in ETFs is a significant step for the country\u2019s crypto ecosystem. According to SEC Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon, the agency is working to finalize guidelines that will enable local institutions to offer ETFs based on a basket of cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Solana.\nThis approach is expected to attract more investors, particularly young people seeking ways to diversify their portfolios.\n\u201cWe want to have a broader supply of those crypto assets in the ETFs,\u201d said Budsaratragoon. This move aims to address the current limitations, where Thai investors primarily rely on foreign Bitcoin ETFs or direct purchases of cryptocurrencies. The expanded offerings will make it easier for local investors to gain exposure to a range of digital assets without the complexity of directly purchasing and managing tokens.\nAttracting Younger Investors and Diversification\nThailand\u2019s SEC is also targeting younger investors, who are increasingly interested in diversifying their portfolios with cryptocurrencies. The country\u2019s financial regulators are looking to make digital assets more accessible by providing safer and more structured investment opportunities through ETFs.\nBy including a basket of cryptocurrencies, the SEC is catering to the growing demand for exposure to a range of assets, beyond just Bitcoin.\nThis strategic focus on attracting younger investors reflects the broader global trend of increasing interest in digital assets, especially among millennials and Gen Z. These groups are looking for innovative ways to invest, and the SEC\u2019s expansion of crypto ETFs aims to meet that demand while providing additional liquidity to the market.\nFuture Outlook for Crypto ETFs and Digital Asset Growth\nThe SE"

                "body": "October is proving to be one of the most pivotal months of the year for crypto investors as attention zooms in on the upcoming Solana (SOL) spot ETF deadline and the frenetic action around a rapidly rising DeFi altcoin, Mutuum Finance. Solana has already seen added institutional action while it waits for prospective ETF approval, and regulatory go-ahead may trigger a robust leg higher and usher in billions of fresh inflows.\nBut even considering SOL\u2019s positioning, much of the market\u2019s hype remains centered on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a presale project that\u2019s sweeping the DeFi space off its feet. MUTM is now valued at a meager $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale. Mutuum Finance has already recorded over 16,700 holders and raised $16.7 million in pre-launch funds. With whales and retail traders both positioning for Q4, Mutuum Finance could be one of the best-upside altcoins heading into 2026.\nCan Solana (SOL) Reclaim $220 as Bulls Eye Key Technical Levels\nSolana (SOL) is flashing new strength after bouncing off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement near $193, a key technical level that has a tendency to be a launching pad for bull bounce-backs. Price action is currently heading towards a previously broken channel that will serve as near-term resistance, with investors carefully watching for potential short-term correction prior to the next decisive move.\nIf momentum persists and market conditions remain favorable, reclaiming the $220 level seems quite within reach, pointing to a possible prolongation of SOL\u2019s resurgence. As Solana gets back on its feet, investors also look for early-stage, high-potential coins that combine technical innovation with usability, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been a quick-emerging DeFi initiative attracting considerable buzz ahead of the next market cycle.\nMutuum Finance Registers Robust Presale Momentum\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is still trendy in Phase 6 of presale, where it has seen more than 16,700 investors and more than $16.7 million. All this activity is evidence of the increasing faith in the long-term project vision and potential to build the future of decentralized finance.\nIn their continuing commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Security engineers and developers are invited to find vulnerabilities in four levels of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low. This is just one part of Mutuum\u2019s overall initiative to secure its infrastructure and gain the trust of its expanding community.\nDynamic Interest Rates and Optimized Efficiency\nMutuum Finance protocol is a real-time operating algorithmic floating interest rate system that dynamically reacts to liquidity levels. The borrow cost is lowered in times of high liquidity to incentivize lending and the inflow of new capital. The borrow cost increases when liquidity is low, thereby incentivizing new deposits and loan repayments. This self-regulating process discourages over-leveraging and promotes overall ecosystem equilibrium.\nEfficiency is augmented by collateral optimization, particularly for correlated assets. Well-collateralised positions have higher borrowing allowance and more favourable Loan-to-Value (LTV) margins, and reserve factors act as a buffer against market volatility. Volatile assets call for higher reserves to stem exposure to volatility, while less-volatile assets allow for higher borrowing with minimal liquidation risk. LTV margins and liquidation points are dynamically calibrated on the basis of each token\u2019s own volatility profile, spreading the risk equitably across the platform.\nWith its presale success, advanced risk management system, and unwavering commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming a stable and sustainable platform for long-term adoption, growth, and prosperity in decentralized finance.\nPushing Ahead\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to press forward, raising over $16.7 million from over 16,700"

(2,027,817 SOL) stepping on the gas.\nThe token is currently consolidating inside a rising wedge, near the upper end of the band.\nAlthough $SOL did give a breakout on September 10, it was met with strong resistance at $250, which pushed the token back toward the lower band of the ascending wedge.\nNow, however, $SOL is on the verge of a fresh breakout \u2013 one that could quickly propel it to the magic $300 mark.\nEven better? Zoom out to the weekly chart, and you\u2019ll see that $SOL has been consolidating between $250 and $102 since March 2024.\nAfter having already made three failed attempts to break the upper threshold at $250, Solana is now preparing for a fourth attempt.\nAs you might already know, the more a resistance is tested, the weaker it becomes, meaning there\u2019s a strong chance $SOL finally delivers a decisive break.\nAll in all, even on the conservative side, a breakout past $250 could realistically see $SOL hit $500 in the next few months.\nRide Solana\u2019s Surge by Loading up on the Best Solana-Based Altcoin\nHistorically, when Solana does well, it pulls the broader altcoin market along with it.\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a major Layer-1 blockchain and home to a thriving ecosystem of dApps, DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and meme coin launchpads.\nWith Solana poised for explosive gains, now\u2019s the perfect time to add the best Solana meme coins to your portfolio.\nOur #1 recommendation? Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 the firepower behind the upcoming Snorter Telegram bot, a one-stop destination for retail meme coin traders.\nSnorter Helps Traders Swipe Liquidity in the Blink of an Eye\nSnorter Bot is specifically designed to simplify the execution side of meme coin trading for small retail players.\nTypically, it\u2019s the large whales that scoop up all the liquidity in new and trending meme coins, since they use advanced trading algorithms and sophisticated tools.\nWithout these, it\u2019s extremely difficult for small traders to take advantage of market opportunities.\nPlus, using it is as simple as chatting with a friend \u2013 just type in your orders like you\u2019re sending a message. Next, as soon as liquidity appears in a token, the bot executes the trade at lightning speed, putting you on par with institutional traders.\nEven better, you can also copy the trades of profitable blockchain traders, so Snorter Bot helps you learn more about the markets while building a strategy of your own.\nSnorter Offers Top-Notch Security\nSnorter Bot uses MEV-resistant layers to protect you from scams like honeypots, rug pulls, and sandwich attacks.\nEssentially, it sends your transactions privately and directly to validators, preventing frontrunning. The system also monitors price changes in real time and can modify or cancel orders if it detects someone trying to sandwich your trade.\nOn top of that, your transactions are batched together with others, making it nearly impossible for attackers to pro"

Major indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, all posted gains. Investors are watching closely as technology stocks, healthcare, and economic data shape market direction.\nMarkets are responding to a mix of political events, corporate performance, and investor sentiment. Even though the federal government is partially shut down, markets remain surprisingly resilient.\nTrading today saw early volatility as investors digested news of the ongoing government funding gap. However, buying momentum picked up in the afternoon, particularly in sectors seen as growth drivers for the economy. Technology and healthcare companies led the gains, pushing indexes higher.\nInvestor confidence is being supported by positive earnings reports from several major tech companies. Strong quarterly results have highlighted revenue growth, new product launches, and increased adoption of AI technologies. These developments are keeping technology stocks attractive even amid political uncertainty.\nHealthcare stocks also performed well, with pharmaceutical and biotech companies posting gains. Investors are optimistic about new drug developments and upcoming product approvals. This sector\u2019s resilience provides a safe haven for investors seeking stability during uncertain times.\nFinancials, on the other hand, showed mixed results. Some major banks and investment firms saw slight declines as traders weighed interest rate expectations and potential economic slowdown risks. However, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the broader market trend.\nAnalysts point out that short-term shutdowns historically have limited impact on financial markets. While federal furloughs affect hundreds of thousands of employees, most essential services continue, and private-sector businesses operate normally, keeping investor confidence intact.\nEconomic indicators and upcoming data releases remain a major focus for traders. Employment numbers, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve communications could influence market trends in the coming weeks. Investors are carefully watching for signals about future interest rate moves.\nFinally, individual stock movements were notable today. Companies like Nvidia and Microsoft drove tech sector gains, while Nike and Caterpillar benefited from strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, some retail and financial stocks faced minor declines, highlighting selective investor activity.\nOverall, the market\u2019s performance today demonstrates cautious optimism. Investors are navigating a mix of political and economic uncertainty, yet strong corporate earnings and promising sector trends are keeping U.S. stock indexes on an upward trajectory.\nThe stock market started the day cautiously but gained momentum as trading progressed. The S&P 500 closed slightly higher, signaling steady investor confidence. This marks one of the many record closes the index has seen this year.\nThe Nasdaq, driven by technology and AI-related stocks, finished with noticeable gains. Tech companies continue to attract attention due to strong earnings and growth potential, helping push the market upward.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, albeit with smaller gains. While blue-chip stocks are generally stable, individual performances varied, with some companies posting higher returns while others fell slightly.\nOverall, the market\u2019s mixed but mostly positive performance reflects cautious optimism among investors who are weighing both risks and opportunities.\nInvestors know that short-term shutdowns usually do not have a lasting effect on stock prices. Essential government services continue, and financial markets have historically bounced back quickly from such events.\nThe shutdown has led to temporary furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal employees.

Traders believe that Fed will continue to cut rates due to the weakness of the labor market. U.S. President Donald Trump said that thousands of federal jobs could be cut, which will put additional pressure on the labor market. The Non Farm Payrolls report, which was scheduled to be released tomorrow, would likely be delayed due to government shutdown. Analysts expected that the U.S. economy added 50,000 jobs in September. Due to the blackout in government-issued economic reports, traders will focus on any economic data that would be available during the shutdown. Tomorrow, traders will focus on ISM Services PMI report, which is expected to show that ISM Services PMI declined from 52.0 in August to 51.7 in September.\nSP500 managed to stay above the resistance at 6700 \u2013 6710 and is moving higher. In case SP500 climbs above recent highs near the 6740 level, it will head towards the 6800 level.\nNASDAQ is moving higher amid rising demand for tech stocks. Advanced Micro Devices, which is up by 3.9%, is the biggest gainer in the NASDAQ index today.\nFrom the technical point of view, NASDAQ settled above the resistance at 24,750 \u2013 24,800 and is trying to settle above the 24,900 level. A move above 24,900 will push NASDAQ towards the psychologically important 25,000 level. RSI remains in the moderate territory, so there is plenty of room to gain momentum in the near term.\nDow Jones is moving towards the nearest resistance level at 46,600 \u2013 46,700. Strong demand for industrials stocks provides additional support to the Dow Jones index.\nIn case Dow Jones settles above the 46,700 level, it will gain additional upside momentum and move towards the 47,000 level.\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\nVladimir is an independent trader, with over 18 years of experience in the financial markets.

The S&P 500 Index jumped to a record high of $6680 on Wednesday, even as the government shutdown started. It has jumped by 40% from its April lows.\nSimilarly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has jumped to a record high of $24,800, up by 50% from the April lows when Donald Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs, A $10,000 investment in a fund tracking the index in January 2020 would now be worth over $28,000.\nThe Dow Jones Index has also jumped in the past few year. It jumped to a record high of $46,440, also much higher than the April lows of $36,570.\nAI tailwinds have boosted the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones\nThe main reason why the blue-chip indices in the United States have jumped this year is that the macro theme of AI is still dominating Wall Street.\nOne way of checking out how the AI industry is doing well is to look at the top gainers in each of these indices. Palantir, Micron, AppLovin, Lam Research, Intel, Zscaler, CrowdStrike, and Broadcom are the top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 Index.\nSimilarly, Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Palantir, Micron, and Lam Research are also leading the S&P 500 Index.\nNvidia, whose stock is up by 37% this year, is also responsible for most gains in the Dow Jones Index.\nThis growth, and some of the recent announcements, mean that the AI bubble is yet to pop. For example, OpenAI is now valued at over $500 billion, while AI infrastructure companies like Nebius and CoreWeave have received orders worth billions of dollars.\nFederal Reserve interest rate cuts\nThe other key driver for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones is the Federal Reserve. After months of resisting cuts, the bank finally decided to cut interest rates in its September meeting.\nMost notably, officials hinted that they would deliver more cuts in the final meetings of the year. Odds of more cuts jumped after ADP published a weak jobs report on Wednesday.\nThis report showed that the private sector lost 36,000 jobs in September after shedding over 3,000 jobs in the previous month.\nThe stock market does well when the Fed is cutting interest rates as investors normally rotate from bonds to the equity market.\nStrong corporate earnings\nMeanwhile, the three main indices, like the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and the Nasdaq 100 are doing well as American companies published strong results despite Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nThe second-quarter results showed that companies had earnings growth of 11%. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth.\nAnalysts expect that the third quarter earnings will show that companies grew by 7.8%.

                "body": "Frankfurt's benchmark DAX index (XTRA:DAX) closed on October 2, 2025, at 24,422.56 points, just shy of its all-time high, signaling unprecedented buoyancy across the European market. This remarkable performance, driven by a confluence of robust fiscal policies, accommodative monetary stances, and a global tech rally, paints a picture of renewed confidence in the continent's economic resilience. However, while a strong European market typically suggests a surge in industrial commodity demand, the current landscape presents a complex and somewhat contradictory outlook, with certain sectors poised for growth while others face significant headwinds.\nDAX's Ascent: A Detailed Look at Europe's Buoyant Market\nThe DAX's ascent has been nothing short of spectacular throughout 2025, having already surged over 20% year-to-date by May and nearly 22% by July, even breaching the significant 20,000-point mark earlier in the year. The closing figure on October 2, 2025, represented a 1.28% gain for the day and marked the index's fourth-highest close in history, extending a five-day winning streak. This brought it within striking distance of its all-time high of 24,641.50, recorded in July 2025, and merely 0.52% off its record close of 24,549.56 on July 9, 2025. This strong start to October has ignited hopes for a robust year-end rally, shaking off what was perceived as a \"lethargic September.\"\nSeveral potent forces have converged to fuel this impressive rally. Aggressive fiscal stimulus from the German government, notably a \u20ac500 billion plan over 12 years targeting defense and infrastructure, has injected substantial capital into the economy. Concurrently, the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted an accommodative stance earlier in 2025, cutting interest rates to 2% due to slowing inflation, making equities more attractive. Although the ECB held rates steady in late September 2025 amid inflation concerns, the earlier cuts were a significant catalyst.\nGlobally, the technology and artificial intelligence (AI) rally has been a paramount driver, with European chip-related giants like ASML Holding N.V. (AMS:ASML) and ASM International N.V. (AMS:ASM) experiencing substantial gains. Optimism surrounding anticipated interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which began an easing cycle in September 2025, has also provided a crucial tailwind. Furthermore, German stocks are widely considered undervalued compared to international counterparts, boasting a price-to-earnings ratio of 15 against the S&P 500's 21, attracting significant capital inflows from investors reportedly shifting funds from US markets to European equities due to geopolitical uncertainties. Lower energy prices and Germany's strong economic fundamentals\u2014including export-led growth, a stable current account surplus, population growth from immigration, and rising labor participation\u2014have further solidified the positive outlook.\nThe broader European market sentiment around October 2, 2025, was one of \"unprecedented buoyancy\" and \"widespread market strength.\" The pan-European STOXX Europe 600 Index (STOXX:SXXP) reached an intraday record high of 568.5 points on the same day, reflecting renewed confidence. However, this optimism is somewhat tempered by underlying factors. Germany's annual inflation rate climbed to 2.4% in September 2025, complicating future ECB policy. While Eurozone GDP rebounded by 1.4% in Q3 2025, Germany's growth was described as \"fragile.\" The overall Eurozone economic outlook for 2025 remains subdued, with projected growth around 1% due to trade policy uncertainties and a potential US government shutdown. There are also signs that European outperformance might be losing steam as US markets rally, leading some European investors to reconsider US stock ETFs.\nWinners and Losers in a Shifting Landscape\nA strong European market, particularly one buoyed by technology and infrastructure spending, creates a mixed bag for public companies, especially concerning industrial comm"

                "body": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Pennant Group (NASDAQ:PNTG). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Pennant Group with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\nPennant Group's Improving Profits\nIn the last three years Pennant Group's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. It's good to see that Pennant Group's EPS has grown from US$0.64 to US$0.78 over twelve months. This amounts to a 21% gain; a figure that shareholders will be pleased to see.\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Pennant Group remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 31% to US$799m. That's progress.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nView our latest analysis for Pennant Group\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Pennant Group's future profits.\nAre Pennant Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nIt's a necessity that company leaders act in the best interest of shareholders and so insider investment always comes as a reassurance to the market. Pennant Group followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group. To be specific, they have US$41m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 4.7% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture."

Today\u2019s weekly jobless claims report will be the first casualty of the shutdown, whilst tomorrow's nonfarm payroll report is not expected to be released, nor will next week's CPI inflation figures.\nIn effect, this means that the Federal Reserve is operating almost blindly, which, if prolonged, could harm sentiment.\nCorporate news\nTesla is rising 1.7% ahead of the EV's quarterly delivery reports, with analysts warning that the US tax credit expiry may have front-loaded demand.\nApple is rising after Morgan Stanley raised its price target, citing a stronger-than-expected start to the iPhone 17 cycle.\nStellantis has jumped 7% after Morgan Stanley said the carmaker is starting to show a turnaround in its market share, with U.S. sales gaining momentum in September.\nNasdaq 100 forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nThe Nasdaq has risen above 24,780 to a fresh record high at 24,950.

Unemployment in the region rose to 6.3% in August, up from 6.2% in July, although this remains close to record lows. The data is not expected to have a significant impact on the ECB policy outlet.\nThe GBP/USD remains unchanged below 1.35 despite USD weakness, as Bank of England officials have started to express concerns over the cooling UK economic outlook. BoE Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden warned that tight monetary policy conditions could result in inflation undershooting the 2% target.\nOil has fallen 6% so far this week.\nOil is falling for a fifth consecutive session and is already trading over 6% lower so far this week. The price has dropped to its lowest level since early June, as supply concerns linger and US inventories rise.\nOPEC+ is expected to agree to increase oil production by up to 500,000 barrels per day in November, three times the increase agreed for October. The prospect of additional supply is weighing on the oil market.\nMeanwhile, the data on Wednesday showed that US crude oil, gasoline, and distillate inventories rose last week as demand and refining activities decreased. Crude oil inventories rose by 1.8 million barrels in the week that ended September 26.\nOn the other hand, offering some support to the oil market, the G7 finance ministers agreed on Wednesday to take steps to increase pressure on Russia by targeting those who continue to purchase Russian oil.\nThe US has also agreed to supply long-range missiles to Ukraine, which could help with the attack on Russian oil infrastructure."

                "body": "Fundamental Overview\nThe Nasdaq rallied into a new al-time high yesterday following a weak US ADP report and a good ISM Manufacturing PMI release. The rally started soon after the ISM data and that might have been triggered by the higher employment index and lower inflation one. Kind of a goldilocks scenario.\nThe US government shutdown was ignored because it\u2019s always short-lived and never a big deal. But the key part is the context because we have the Fed cutting interest rates. The first half of the year was all about Trump\u2019s tariffs, but the second half is all about the Fed.\nThe focus should be on the labour market data because that\u2019s what \u201cforced\u201d the Fed to start cutting rates and signal two more by the end of the year. If the labour market were to improve in the next months, the Fed would start turning more hawkish and might even hold off on the expected rate cuts. An October rate cut was never in jeopardy; it\u2019s the December one that could be skipped but of course we will need strong labour market data. For now though, the Fed support is bullish for the stock market.\nProblems arise when the economy gets too hot and that's when the Fed support wanes and the central bank starts to work against the market. And this is where we could get the pullbacks (and eventually even a crash).\nRight now, the market is pricing 114 bps of easing by the end of 2026 compared to just 75 bps projected by the Fed. This means that the market is too optimistic. Therefore, a hawkish repricing in those expectations should in theory provide a pullback in all asset classes. So, if you are waiting for a pullback, then wait for US data. If we get strong US data, especially on the labour market side, then we could finally get a decent pullback.\nIn this environment, one can just buy or wait, but definitely not sell (unless one does it for a quick trade supported by a catalyst). Once the market pricing gets back in line with the Fed's projections, then the stock market should restart its rally.\nIn fact, as long as the Fed's reaction function remains dovish, the downside will remain limited. This \"melt-up\" phase will likely go on as long as the Fed remains more focused on the labour market. Once inflation starts to become a serious worry, that's when we will finally get a meaningful correction (or even a bear market if the Fed starts to hike rates). Until then, the pullbacks will just be dip-buying opportunities.\nNasdaq Technical Analysis \u2013 Daily Timeframe\nOn the daily chart, we can see that the Nasdaq broke into a new all-time high yesterday. From a risk management perspective, the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup around the FOMC-low and the major trendline to position for new highs, while the sellers will look for downside breaks to target the 23,023 level. Such a big correction though looks unlikely unless we get a big growth scare or very strong US data that forces the Fed to adopt a more hawkish stance.\nNasdaq Technical Analysis \u2013 4 hour Timeframe\nOn the 4 hour chart, we can see that we have a minor upward trendline defining the bullish momentum on this timeframe. The old all-time high around the 25,028 level will now act as a minor support and the buyers will likely keep on piling in around these levels with a defined risk below the support.

There\u2019s not much else we can add here as the buyers will continue to pile in with a defined risk below the support, while the sellers will wait for a drop back below that level to position for a pullback into the trendline.

Thompson\u2019s death was ruled a suicide, Colorado investigators are re-opening the famed journalist\u2019s case.\nInvestigators initially determined that Thompson, 67, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his Colorado home. Pitkin County Sheriff Michael Buglione said Tuesday that there is no new evidence suggesting foul play, but the Colorado Bureau of Investigation is re-examining the death at the request of his widow, Anita Thompson, in order to \u201cprovide an independent perspective\u201d on the 2005 investigation.\n\u201cWe understand the profound impact Hunter S. Thompson had on this community and beyond,\u201d Buglione said in a statement. \u201cBy bringing in an outside agency for a fresh look, we hope to provide a definitive and transparent review that may offer peace of mind to his family and the public.\u201d\nThe statement added that it\u2019s unclear how long the investigation might take.\nThompson regularly wrote for Rolling Stone magazine and is credited with popularizing the satirical and hyperbolic \u201cgonzo\u201d style of journalism that puts the writer at the center of the story. His most famous books included \u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\u201d and \u201cHell\u2019s Angels.\u201d In 1994, he wrote a damning obituary of Richard Nixon for Rolling Stone, in which he referred to the late president as \u201can American monster.\u201d\nThompson\u2019s ashes were blasted out of a cannon at his Colorado home in 2005. His funeral was attended by several prominent actors and politicians, including Johnny Depp, Sean Penn and John Kerry."

                "body": "The Asian stock market was on track for strong weekly gains on Friday, supported by growing expectations of near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts, which helped offset concerns over a U.S. government shutdown. Despite its impact, including the suspension of scientific research, financial oversight and delays in key economic releases such as Friday\u2019s jobs report, investors have largely brushed off the disruption.\nOne factor behind the muted market response is that past government shutdowns have typically had little lasting effect on economic growth or market performance. Analysts noted that investors seem prepared to allow Washington time to resolve the standoff, though a prolonged shutdown could eventually weigh on sentiment and spark market volatility.\nAI optimism lifts global markets\nIn the Asian stock market, MSCI\u2019s Asia-Pacific index rose 0.39 percent on Friday, approaching the record high it reached on Thursday. The benchmark is on track for a weekly gain exceeding 2 percent and has climbed 23 percent year-to-date. With China and other parts of Asia observing an extended holiday, trading volumes in the region are expected to remain light.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei rose 1.46 percent as of 5:05 GMT, nearing the record high it hit last month. Across Asia, markets were supported by Wall Street\u2019s momentum, where all three major U.S. indexes closed at record highs, driven by strong gains in technology stocks that sustained investor enthusiasm for AI-related investments.\nNasdaq 100 futures were up 0.28 percent, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.23 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.17 percent.\nTaiwan\u2019s tech-focused Taiwan Weighted Index rose 1.31 percent, while South Korea\u2019s KOSPI surged 2.70 percent after chip giants Samsung and Hynix announced partnerships to supply OpenAI data centers earlier this week. However, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was down 0.94 percent.\nIn the European stock market, the STOXX Europe 600 index gained 0.53 percent, while Germany\u2019s DAX rose 1.28 percent.\nRead: Dubai 24-carat gold prices hold at AED463.25 as global rates head for seventh weekly rise\nU.S. dollar set for 0.35 percent weekly decline as Japanese yen gains\nWith official labor market reports on hold, investors are relying on alternative data from public and private sources, which so far suggest a sluggish U.S. job market. The potential delay of key economic indicators poses a challenge for the data-dependent Federal Reserve, leaving it to lean on less comprehensive measures such as ADP employment figures and jobless claims.\nThis lack of clarity could trigger short-term market volatility and make it harder for investors to position themselves with confidence. Nevertheless, market sentiment increasingly reflects expectations that the Fed will continue on its rate-cutting path, with traders nearly fully pricing in a 25-basis-point reduction in October and a total of 114 basis points of easing by the end of 2026.\nDue to the U.S. government shutdown, the U.S. dollar has come under pressure, with the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, holding steady but heading for a 0.35 percent weekly decline, its largest drop since early August.\nMeanwhile, the Japanese yen has emerged as the main beneficiary of the dollar\u2019s weakness, poised for a 1.5 percent weekly gain, its strongest since mid-May. The yen was last largely unchanged at 147.34 per U.S. dollar.\nIn commodities, Brent crude futures were up 35 cents or 0.55 percent to $64.46 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 34 cents or 0.56 percent to $60.82 per barrel. If the market fails to stage a stronger rebound, Brent is poised to settle at its lowest closing level since the week ending May 30, while WTI could finish at its weakest since May 2. On a weekly basis, Brent has dropped 8.3 percent, while WTI was down 7.6 percent.\nSpot gold gained 0.04 percent to $3,846.3 as of 4:29 GMT, after hitting a new all-time high of $3,896.49 on Thursday.

Cautions commentary from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda-- who flagged caution over the economy and trade-- also aided local stocks.\nHong Kong stocks, on the other hand, were hit by sharp losses in electric vehicle stocks, which fell tracking an overnight drop in Tesla. Broader tech stocks also faced some profit-taking after strong gains this week.\nRegional markets took some positive cues from Wall Street, which finished higher overnight as strength in tech and sustained optimism over interest rate cuts helped markets look past an ongoing U.S. government shutdown. The S&P 500 eked out another record high.\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% in Asian trade. Markets were now seeking more cues on the U.S. economy, with a key nonfarm payrolls reading likely delayed due to the government shutdown.\nAsian trading volumes were muted on Friday amid market holidays in China and South Korea. Chinese markets will remain closed until the middle of next week.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 surged 1.6% and was within spitting distance of recent peaks, while the TOPIX added 1.3%.\nTechnology stocks were the biggest boost to the Nikkei, with Hitachi Ltd (TYO:6501) surging 9.5% and topping gains on the index.\nHitachi on Thursday announced a partnership with OpenAI, under which the two will collaborate on energy and storage tech for the AI industry.\nThe news ramped up optimism over more AI development in Japan, and also sparked gains in other AI and tech stocks in the country.\nRenesas Electronics Corp (TYO:6723) rallied 8% and was the second-best performer on the Nikkei behind Hitachi.\nChipmakers Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857) and Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035) rose 3.4% and 2.3%, respectively.\nTech conglomerate and major OpenAI investor SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984) rose 3.6%.\nJapanese markets were also encouraged by the BOJ\u2019s Ueda flagging some caution over the Japanese economy, especially in the face of U.S. trade tariffs and increased overseas uncertainty.\nWhile Ueda did reiterate the BOJ\u2019s stance that interest rates will rise if the economy firms and inflation increases, he flagged increased uncertainties around Japan\u2019s economic outlook. Ueda\u2019s comments suggested an air of caution over the economy that could deter the central bank from raising interest rates immediately.\nFocus in Japan was squarely on a key Liberal Democratic Party vote to be held over the weekend, which will decide the party\u2019s leader and the next Prime Minister of Japan.\nThe vote comes after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba abruptly resigned in September, with markets now looking to a less fiscally conservative successor. Front-runners for the role include LDP veteran Sanae Takaichi, farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi.\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index fell 0.7%, hit by losses in electric vehicle stocks as they tracked an overnight decline in major Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\nBYD Co (HK:1211) fell 4.7%, while Li Auto Inc (HK:2015) and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) fell 4.2% and 2.4%, respectively. The three were among the worst performers on the Hang Seng.\nEV stocks fell tracking a 5% overnight fall in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), as markets largely looked past stronger-than-expected third-quarter delivery figures from the company. While deliveries did hit a record high, analysts said this was largely due to U.S. government tax subsidies on EVs, which are set to be revoked soon by the Trump administration.\nTesla's"
