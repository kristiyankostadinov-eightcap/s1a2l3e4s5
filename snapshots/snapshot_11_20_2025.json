Economists expect an increase of about 50,000 new jobs, but markets are even more tuned in to what these numbers might mean for Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. While the Fed has made small cuts, it\u2019s trying to balance inflation worries with not moving too fast\u2014minutes from recent meetings show policymakers are treading carefully. Expectations for a December rate cut have slipped to 33%, down from 49% just a day before, based on CME\u2019s FedWatch tool. Gold, often a go-to when uncertainty is high or rates are low, found support as political criticism mounted and gold-backed ETFs saw modest inflows. Still, with the dollar remaining firm, gold\u2019s gains have been modest\u2014though other precious metals like silver, platinum, and palladium have also edged up.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Cautious sentiment keeps gold in focus.\nMarket jitters ahead of key US economic releases are helping gold hold its ground, as it tends to shine during uncertainty or low-rate environments. Flows into gold ETFs and broad gains across precious metals suggest investors are hunting for safe havens. While tech earnings like Nvidia\u2019s gave a lift to some stocks, the real test will be how markets respond once the delayed jobs data drops and the Fed reveals its next move.\nThe bigger picture: Shifting rate expectations steer global strategies.\nThe Fed\u2019s cautious approach to cutting rates shows how sticky inflation and economic risks are driving decisions. As markets around the world watch economic data roll in, there\u2019s a clear preference for hedging with gold and other hard assets. Add in political scrutiny, and it\u2019s easy to see why gold demand tends to spike whenever economic signals are mixed or confidence dips.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Gold Price Forecast: XAU/USD Rallies Past $4,100 Amid Fed Rate\u2011Cut Hopes\nGold surged past the $4,100 mark this week, extending a powerful rally that has captivated markets and highlighted growing investor conviction that the Federal Reserve is nearing a pivot toward rate cuts. Spot gold (XAU/USD) rose as high as $4,113 per ounce in intraday trading, supported by softening U.S. economic data, falling Treasury yields, and a pullback in the U.S. dollar. The rally places gold among the year\u2019s top-performing assets, with bullion gaining over 55% year-to-date, fueled by safe-haven flows and expectations of monetary easing.\nThe breakout above $4,100 underscores a market increasingly pricing in a shift in Fed policy amid signs of labor market cooling and subdued inflation. Dovish interpretations of recent economic indicators, including disappointing jobs figures and falling consumer sentiment, have bolstered bets that the central bank could begin cutting rates as early as December. As uncertainty lingers around fiscal policy and global risk sentiment remains fragile, gold\u2019s rise reflects a broadening investor preference for hard assets amid expectations of a looser policy stance.\nWhy Gold Is Rallying: Key Macro Forces at Play\nSource: goldprice.org\nGold\u2019s surge past $4,100 is being powered by a combination of softening U.S. economic data, shifting Federal Reserve expectations and robust central bank accumulation. Recent signs of cooling in the labor market \u2014 including weaker private-sector hiring and elevated jobless claims \u2014 have strengthened the case for a December rate cut. As markets increasingly anticipate looser monetary policy, the appeal of non-yielding assets like gold continues to rise, helping to push XAU/USD to fresh highs.\nGlobal uncertainty is adding another layer of support. Central banks remain aggressive buyers as they diversify away from the U.S. dollar amid geopolitical tensions and long-term reserve strategy shifts. Investor demand is also reinforcing momentum, with inflows into gold-backed funds climbing steadily as traders seek protection from currency debasement and economic volatility. Together, these macro forces have created a powerful tailwind that continues to drive gold\u2019s upward trajectory.\nMomentum Builds: Key Levels to Watch for XAU/USD\nGold\u2019s decisive break above the $4,100 threshold has reinforced its bullish technical structure, with momentum indicators signaling that buyers remain firmly in control. The recent move higher followed a clean rebound from the $4,050 support zone, a level that has repeatedly attracted dip-buyers throughout November. As long as gold holds above this area, market technicians view the broader uptrend as intact.\nOn the upside, the metal is now testing a resistance band between $4,125 and $4,190 \u2014 a zone that previously capped rallies earlier in the month. A sustained close above this region would expose the next targets at $4,252 and the 2025 peak near $4,382. Beyond that, extended Fibonacci projections point toward longer-term upside levels around $4,550 should bullish momentum accelerate.\nIf the market turns lower, initial support sits near $4,100, followed by a deeper technical floor at $4,000. A break below this psychological level could trigger a broader correction, opening a move back toward $3,930. For now, however, the balance of risk still leans to the upside, with trend-following funds and options flow continuing to favor further gains.\nRate-Cut Bets Shape the Near-Term Gold Narrative\nMarkets have grown increasingly convinced that the Federal Reserve will deliver further rate cuts, with traders pricing in nearly a 45\u201350% probability of a reduction in December. This expectation is largely driven by soft U.S. labor-market data \u2014 including weaker private-sector hiring and elevated weekly jobless claims \u2014 which has cast doubt on the strength of the economic recovery. Many see gold as a direct beneficiary: as borrowing costs fall, the opportunity cost of holding non-yield"

                "body": "Previously, we reported that the pivot by Indian refiners away from Russian oil has triggered a spike in oil product prices even as crude prices remain largely unchanged. To wit, ICE Brent-Gasoil crack spreads doubled from the $15-17/bbl range held in the first half of the year, to a 21-month high above $32/bbl, good for a nearly 70% increase in the year-to-date. Gasoil is a middle distillate mainly used in commercial and agricultural sectors for off-road vehicles, machinery, and generators. And now reports have emerged that the distillates market continues to tighten even as crude prices remain weak. According to new data by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), gasoline inventories clocked in at 205.06 million barrels (mb) for the week ending 7th November, 8.2mb lower than the five-year average and the lowest level in 12 years.\nU.S. distillate inventories were 110.91 million barrels, 9.3mb below the five-year average and close to the bottom of their five-year range. U.S. distillate inventories are now at the lowest level since mid-July as we move into the high-demand winter season, which should continue to support product strength. Meanwhile, strength in product cracks continues, with the ICE gasoil-Brent crack now exceeding $34 per barrel (bbl), the highest level since September 2023. The price differential has now stayed above $30/bbl for 10 trading days.\nOil markets, on the other hand, continue to be weak and dominated by bearish supply sentiment, with recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure failing to give oil prices a significant boost. Brent crude for December delivery was trading at $63.32/bbl at 12 pm ET on Wednesday, less than a dollar higher from a week ago, while the corresponding WTI contract was changing hands at $59.28/bbl, up from $58.26/bbl seven days ago. Last week, the port of Novorossiysk, in Krasnodar Krai, was targeted by Ukrainian missiles and drones, with a focus on the Sheskharis oil terminal. The giant terminal has an export capacity of ~2.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), and loadings were suspended for two days. Ukraine\u2019s attacks on Russia\u2019s Black Sea export terminals have, however, highlighted the vulnerability of exports via the southern route.\nRelated: A Trend Break? EIA Sees Jump in Alaska Oil Production in 2026\nAccording to commodity analysts at Standard Chartered, this is particularly important, with the weather closing down the Northern Sea Route via the Arctic over the winter. The winter transit routes to Asia will then be limited to the Suez Canal, taking 10 days longer on average. These longer transit routes have contributed to a 294 million barrels Y/Y surge in seaborne crude to an all-time high of 1.37 billion barrels as of 14 November. Russian crude exports have, however, remained relatively steady, although StanChart has predicted they will slow down sharply after the November 21 deadline for sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft kicks in. The sanctions could also be contributing to the large increase in volumes of oil on water.\nU.S. natural gas prices remain elevated, with Henry Hub gas quoted at $4.55/MMBtu in Wednesday\u2019s session, nearly double in the year-to-date. Expectations of high demand have been driving prices higher, despite inventories remaining elevated. Surging demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, increased domestic power needs from factors like data centers, and strong heating demand have helped prop U.S. gas prices. Meanwhile, production growth has not kept pace with this escalating demand. The production backlog for utility-scale gas turbines has pushed back equipment delivery dates, further straining the supply-demand balance.\nIn contrast, Europe\u2019s gas prices remain depressed, with TFF natural gas futures falling close to an 18-month low at $30.870/MW, with warmer weather expected to lower heating demand. European natural gas inventories have been declining as the continent moves through the shoulder season into prolonged net withdrawals."

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) declined 2.6% to $59.18, while Brent (BZ=F) slid 2.5% to $63.26, extending a three-day selloff triggered by mounting oversupply fears. Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a 4.4 million-barrel rise in U.S. commercial crude inventories last week \u2014 the third consecutive build \u2014 signaling that U.S. refineries are processing less crude into gasoline and distillates as domestic consumption slows. Analysts expect the EIA report to confirm additional stock accumulation, reinforcing the view that demand cannot absorb current output levels.\nChina\u2019s Stockpiling Strategy Masks Weak Refinery Demand\nChina\u2019s crude imports continue to outpace refinery throughput, adding a hidden layer of supply pressure to the global market. Customs figures show imports exceeding refinery runs by 690,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October, the seventh straight monthly surplus. Since March, China has accumulated nearly 900,000 bpd in strategic and commercial reserves, using price weakness in the $63\u2013$65 Brent range to build long-term buffers rather than ramp up production. The strategy temporarily absorbs excess oil from the market but exposes a deeper issue \u2014 real consumption in China remains stagnant, with refiners opting to store crude instead of converting it into fuels.\nOPEC+ Output Growth And Non-OPEC Expansion Flood Markets\nSupply growth from both OPEC+ and non-OPEC producers continues to overwhelm consumption. The Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI) reported global oil demand rising 1.4 million bpd month-on-month, yet exports climbed even faster \u2014 up 1.3 million bpd from August.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s exports hit a seven-month high, and new production gains from the U.S., Brazil, Guyana, and Canada have added over 1.2 million bpd of incremental supply since the spring.\nCrude inventories in JODI\u2019s reporting countries increased 6.4 million barrels in September, while refined product inventories jumped 23 million barrels. This synchronized rise across regions highlights the difficulty of balancing the market, even as OPEC+ members insist that supply discipline will return in 2026.\nU.S. Push For Ukraine Peace Threatens To Release Russian Crude\nReports that the United States is pushing for a peace framework to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine triggered concerns that sanctioned Russian oil could re-enter global supply chains. Sources indicate Washington has drafted a proposal requiring Kyiv to accept limited territorial concessions in exchange for a ceasefire.\nTraders estimate 600,000\u2013800,000 bpd of Russian crude currently stranded in shadow fleets or floating storage could hit markets if sanctions ease. TP ICAP\u2019s Scott Shelton warned that such a scenario could push prices into the low $50s, while Rystad Energy\u2019s Janiv Shah noted that a reduced geopolitical premium would leave investors refocused on weak fundamentals.\nGoldman Sachs Forecasts $53 WTI And $56 Brent By 2026\nGoldman Sachs projects a 2 million bpd surplus by 2026 as deferred projects in Brazil, Guyana, and the U.S. come online, coinciding with OPEC+ unwinding more of its output cuts. The bank\u2019s outlook places WTI at $53 and Brent at $56, citing declining demand elasticity and structural oversupply.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) warns the imbalance could widen if demand in China and Europe underperforms expectations. Hedge fund positioning confirms this sentiment: net long exposure in crude futures has fallen to a nine-month low, showing institutional traders have largely abandoned bullish bets.\nU.S. Production Hits Record 13.3M bpd As Refining Margins Shrink"

The sanctions could also be contributing to the large increase in volumes of oil on water.\nU.S. natural gas prices remain elevated, with Henry Hub gas quoted at $4.55/MMBtu in Wednesday\u2019s session, nearly double in the year-to-date. Expectations of high demand have been driving prices higher, despite inventories remaining elevated. Surging demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, increased domestic power needs from factors like data centers, and strong heating demand have helped prop U.S. gas prices. Meanwhile, production growth has not kept pace with this escalating demand. The production backlog for utility-scale gas turbines has pushed back equipment delivery dates, further straining the supply-demand balance.\nIn contrast, Europe\u2019s gas prices remain depressed, with TFF natural gas futures falling close to an 18-month low at $30.870/MW, with warmer weather expected to lower heating demand. European natural gas inventories have been declining as the continent moves through the shoulder season into prolonged net withdrawals."

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) declined 2.6% to $59.18, while Brent (BZ=F) slid 2.5% to $63.26, extending a three-day selloff triggered by mounting oversupply fears. Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a 4.4 million-barrel rise in U.S. commercial crude inventories last week \u2014 the third consecutive build \u2014 signaling that U.S. refineries are processing less crude into gasoline and distillates as domestic consumption slows. Analysts expect the EIA report to confirm additional stock accumulation, reinforcing the view that demand cannot absorb current output levels.\nChina\u2019s Stockpiling Strategy Masks Weak Refinery Demand\nChina\u2019s crude imports continue to outpace refinery throughput, adding a hidden layer of supply pressure to the global market. Customs figures show imports exceeding refinery runs by 690,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October, the seventh straight monthly surplus. Since March, China has accumulated nearly 900,000 bpd in strategic and commercial reserves, using price weakness in the $63\u2013$65 Brent range to build long-term buffers rather than ramp up production. The strategy temporarily absorbs excess oil from the market but exposes a deeper issue \u2014 real consumption in China remains stagnant, with refiners opting to store crude instead of converting it into fuels.\nOPEC+ Output Growth And Non-OPEC Expansion Flood Markets\nSupply growth from both OPEC+ and non-OPEC producers continues to overwhelm consumption. The Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI) reported global oil demand rising 1.4 million bpd month-on-month, yet exports climbed even faster \u2014 up 1.3 million bpd from August.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s exports hit a seven-month high, and new production gains from the U.S., Brazil, Guyana, and Canada have added over 1.2 million bpd of incremental supply since the spring.\nCrude inventories in JODI\u2019s reporting countries increased 6.4 million barrels in September, while refined product inventories jumped 23 million barrels. This synchronized rise across regions highlights the difficulty of balancing the market, even as OPEC+ members insist that supply discipline will return in 2026.\nU.S. Push For Ukraine Peace Threatens To Release Russian Crude\nReports that the United States is pushing for a peace framework to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine triggered concerns that sanctioned Russian oil could re-enter global supply chains. Sources indicate Washington has drafted a proposal requiring Kyiv to accept limited territorial concessions in exchange for a ceasefire.\nTraders estimate 600,000\u2013800,000 bpd of Russian crude currently stranded in shadow fleets or floating storage could hit markets if sanctions ease. TP ICAP\u2019s Scott Shelton warned that such a scenario could push prices into the low $50s, while Rystad Energy\u2019s Janiv Shah noted that a reduced geopolitical premium would leave investors refocused on weak fundamentals.\nGoldman Sachs Forecasts $53 WTI And $56 Brent By 2026\nGoldman Sachs projects a 2 million bpd surplus by 2026 as deferred projects in Brazil, Guyana, and the U.S. come online, coinciding with OPEC+ unwinding more of its output cuts. The bank\u2019s outlook places WTI at $53 and Brent at $56, citing declining demand elasticity and structural oversupply.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) warns the imbalance could widen if demand in China and Europe underperforms expectations.

The chances of a rate cut fell from around 42% to 33%, revealed the FedWatch Tool.\nAcross the Atlantic, the Eurozone Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) dipped from 2.2% to 2.1% in September, close to the European Central Bank (ECB) 2% inflation target.

The pair briefly hit 1.1540, marking a new two-week low, as the U.S. Dollar (USD) regained strength ahead of the FOMC minutes and Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP). Market sentiment remains defensive, with traders positioning cautiously around upcoming macro catalysts. The current price action shows narrowing intraday ranges but persistent bearish bias, supported by fundamental divergence between the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank (ECB).\nFed Rate Expectations Shift, Reinforcing Dollar Recovery\nThe CME FedWatch Tool now reflects only a 49% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December, sharply down from 67% last week, as traders reassess the Fed\u2019s willingness to ease. This repricing has lifted the Dollar Index (DXY) close to 100.00, limiting EUR/USD rebounds. The latest U.S. Initial Jobless Claims rose to 232,000, and Continuing Claims climbed to 1.957 million, while ADP employment data showed private job losses averaging 2,500 per week. Despite softer jobs data, short-term flows remain dollar-positive due to pre-FOMC hedging.\nFed Officials Signal Uncertainty While Labor Market Normalizes\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin noted that labor conditions are improving, with \u201cbetter worker availability\u201d and declining wage pressure, though he warned inflation remains inconsistent with the 2% target. These comments reflect a divided committee ahead of Wednesday\u2019s minutes. Any hawkish tone could accelerate EUR/USD\u2019s slide below 1.1550, while dovish language might trigger a short-covering rebound toward 1.1620\u20131.1650.\nEurozone Economic Momentum Weakens As ECB Holds Policy Steady\nOn the European side, the macro picture continues to deteriorate. Eurozone Q3 GDP stagnated at 0.1%, and Germany\u2019s manufacturing PMI slipped to 44.8, reinforcing concerns over industrial contraction. Inflation remains contained near 2.2%, reducing urgency for further hikes. The ECB deposit rate stands at 4.00%, and futures imply a 40% chance of a cut by Q1 2026. Diverging policy trajectories between the Fed and ECB have widened yield spreads, making it harder for the euro to sustain rallies above 1.1600.\nTechnical Structure Confirms Persistent Bearish Momentum\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains trapped below its 20-day EMA and descending trendline from late September. The RSI reads 46, showing mild bearish momentum without exhaustion, while MACD stays negative. The pair trades within the 1.1550\u20131.1570 demand zone \u2014 a level that has repeatedly attracted dip-buyers \u2014 but momentum remains weak. A clean break below 1.1550 would expose 1.1500, while resistance levels sit at 1.1610 and 1.1650. The four-hour chart confirms a pattern of lower highs and heavier selling wicks, reinforcing downside bias until a decisive close above 1.1610.\nUS Data Strengthens USD As Euro Fails To Capitalize On Soft Yields\nRecent U.S. data has added weight to the dollar\u2019s rebound. The Empire State Manufacturing Index surged to 18.7 in November \u2014 its strongest reading in a year \u2014 while construction spending grew 0.2% in August. These figures countered expectations of a slowdown, reducing bets on imminent easing. Meanwhile, Nordea Bank projects EUR/USD to rise toward 1.24 by end-2026, assuming a U.S. policy pivot next year. However, that scenario depends on a eurozone rebound not yet visible in current data.\nEurozone Consumption And Industry Continue To Struggle\nThe Eurostat report on retail sales showed a 0.3% monthly decline, while German factory orders fell 0.8%, underscoring fragile domestic demand.

                "body": "US Dollar into NFP: DXY Surges into 100, EUR/USD Pushes Towards 1.1500\nThe US Dollar pullback found support at a big spot last Thursday and Friday, at the Fibonacci level of 98.98. And so far this week, bulls have been pushing with another breakout this morning to re-test the major resistance zone running from 100-100.22. Tomorrow\u2019s NFP report will likely have sway on the matter, but there\u2019s also the counter-part component to consider, as EUR/USD is fast approaching another re-test of the vaulted psychological level at 1.1500.\nThe winds of change are afoot across macro markets: Equities are pulling back and crypto continues to show light symptoms of \u2018melt down.\u2019 Even gold hasn\u2019t been able to hold a bid for long, and as I shared in yesterday\u2019s webinar, the fact that these hot markets have all been showing signs of pullback around the same time seems to suggest that we\u2019re seeing more of a squaring up type of theme as we finally get some US government data following the prolonged shutdown.\nWe\u2019ll find out more tomorrow as we get the NFP report and while the data is old and rather stale, it\u2019ll still be important and we\u2019re seeing \u2018why\u2019 as markets coil ahead of that release.\nIn the US Dollar, and this is again a topic I encountered in yesterday\u2019s webinar, there\u2019s likely a few different forces at work. An obvious one is the scaling back of expectations for a December rate cut, and that syncs well given that both stocks topped and the US Dollar started to see the rally heat up around the last FOMC meeting on October 29th.\nBut \u2013 markets are still fully expecting another 75 bps of cuts by the end of next year and that\u2019s something that can change quickly as Fed-speak of late has sounded a bit more cautious. This is something that could certainly compel another shot of USD-strength and, potentially, a breakout from the key resistance zone that\u2019s held bulls at bay for almost four full months now.\nThat zone even has some relation to last year, when 100.22 set the low when the Fed cut rates in September of 2024. That support stalled the move, with sellers unable to stretch down to 100 and that then led into a massive bullish reversal in Q4 trade. That setup showed a short-term falling wedge, very similar to the longer-term formation that\u2019s built over the past six months in DXY.\nUS Dollar Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD Following a Similar Pattern\nThe current low in the US Dollar was set on September 17th, the day that the Fed started cutting rates this year. Interestingly, this echoes what happened last year, albeit with some different formatting. The USD sold off into the Fed\u2019s first cut in September, with DXY setting a low at that announcement. And then as we traded into Q4, even with a Federal Reserve still cutting rates, the US Dollar rallied in a very big way.\nNotably, Jerome Powell called this year\u2019s September move a \u2018risk management rate cut.\u2019 That triggered a series of higher-highs and higher-lows, with another fresh high printing after the Fed\u2019s next rate cut on October 29th. That rally eventually ran to the top of the 100-100.22 resistance zone, at which price began to relax.\nLast week was mostly pullback \u2013 all the way until 98.98 came into the picture, and that set the low for two days before bulls can get back in the driver\u2019s seat.\nBut, from that deduction we can draw a relationship, where a \u2018less dovish\u2019 Fed has helped to bring USD-strength, and while the recent rally from 98.98 goes along with odds for a December cut whittling down to a coin flip, there\u2019s still wide expectation for more rate cuts next year.\nIn yesterday\u2019s webinar, it was right around 75% for another 75 bps in cuts in 2026. As of right now that probability is 74.2% for another 75 bps in cuts next year.\nThis can be catalyst for USD-strength, although there\u2019s another component I\u2019ll speak of in the next section, and this puts a lot emphasis on upcoming data out of the United States as any narrowing of rate cut expectati"

                "body": "GBP/USD, DAX Forecast: Two trades to watch\nGBP/USD falls after UK CPI cools for the first time in 5 months\nGBP/USD is falling after UK inflation data supported the case for the Bank of England to cut interest rates again in December.\nUK CPI was 3.6% in October, down from 3.8% in September, and in line with forecasts. Service sector inflation, which is watched closely by the central bank, was cooler than expected at 4.5% down from 4.7% and below expectations of 4.6%.\nThe data points to price pressures in the UK cooling and being on a sustained downward path. This supports the case for a 25 basis point rate reduction next month, and the market is also pricing in a slightly faster pace of cuts in 2026.\nThere is, of course, a level of caution ahead of Reeves' budget next week. However, the chancellor said she'll take targeted action to further bring down inflation and the cost of living.\nMeanwhile, the US dollar is rising versus its major peers amid a risk-off mood in the equities market ahead of Nvidia's earnings later today and ahead of the FOMC minutes.\nThe Fed cut rates by 25 basis points at the September meeting, but Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell adopted a more cautious tone in the press conference following it.\nRecent Fed speakers have also sounded hawkish, prompting the market to rein in December rate-cut expectations to 46%, down from 67% last week.\nA cautious tone to the minutes could lift the USD. Any disappointment in Nvidia's earnings could also boost safe-haven flows into the USD.\nGBP/USD forecast \u2013 technical forecast\nGBP/USD has trended lower from the 1.3725 September high, trading below its descending trendline, falling to a low of 1.3010. The slight recovery from this low ran into resistance at the 20 SMA and has eased lower.\nSellers will look to test support around 1.31, last week\u2019s low, and the April 3 high. Below here, 1.30 comes into focus. Should sellers take out this support, it opens the door to a deeper selloff towards 1.27.\nAny attempt at a recovery would first need to rise above the 1.32 resistance and the 20 SMA to expose the 200 SMA at 1.33. A rise above 1.3350 puts the pair on a more stable footing.\nDAX steadies at a 5-month low ahead of Nvidia earnings\nThe DAX is showing signs of steadying after falling to a 5-month low, although the mood remains cautious ahead of Nvidia\u2019s earnings after the close today.\nGlobal stocks have sold off this week amid souring risk appetite. Worries of stretched tech valuations, particularly towards AI-related firms, combined with fading hopes of a December rate cut, have hit stocks hard.\nNvidia earnings are the litmus test for the AI trade, which has helped power stocks across the year. Any disappointment from Nvidia could spark a fresh leg lower for stocks, particularly AI and tech.\nOn the data front, Eurozone CPI was confirmed at 2.1% year on year in October, in line with the preliminary reading. Inflation is in line with the ECB\u2019s target level, supporting the view that the central bank could be done with its rate-cutting cycle.\nTomorrow also sees the release of the September non-farm payroll, which could impact market sentiment. Expectations are for 75k jobs to be added. Weak data could support Fed rate cut expectations.\nDAX forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nThe DAX failed at resistance 24,400 and rebounded lower, breaking below the rising trendline and the 200 SMA, dropping to support just above the 23,050 level, the June low. This level is holding for now, but if sellers break it down, that could spark a deeper selloff towards 22,000, the mid-February low.\nBuyers may be encouraged by the hammer candlestick that could be appearing today. Any recovery needs to rise above 23,300-23,400 resistance, the September low and the 200 SMA. A rise above the rising trendline at 23,700 puts the DAX on a firmer footing and brings 24,000 back into play.\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

Markets might turn cautious later in the day ahead of the release of the delayed US September Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report.\nThe UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation fell to 3.6% YoY in October from 3.8% in September, the National Statistics showed on Wednesday. This figure came in line with the market consensus. The inflation data cemented expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) could cut interest rates in December, which could undermine the Cable in the near term. The upcoming government budget on November 26 is also expected to influence the BoE's next move.\nThe attention will shift to the US labor market data, which is due later on Thursday. The data release was delayed by a 43-day government shutdown that ended last week. The shutdown has complicated the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) assessment of the labor market.\nEconomists expect the report to show that the US added about 50,000 new jobs in September. The Average Hourly Earnings is projected to increase by 0.3% MoM in September, while the Unemployment Rate is estimated to stay at 4.3%. If the report shows a weaker-than-expected outcome, this could drag the USD lower and create a tailwind for the major pair.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released its minutes from the October meeting on Wednesday, indicating \"strongly differing views\" about the appropriate policy decision for the December meeting. The majority of officials supported further rate cuts in general, many participants indicated it might be appropriate to keep interest rates steady for the remainder of the year.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicat"

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Slides to 1.3120 as UK Inflation Drops and BoE Rate Cut Bets Hit 85%\nGBP/USD weakens for a fourth session as CPI falls to 3.6%, core inflation cools to 3.4%, and traders brace for the November 26 Autumn Budget | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Faces Heavy Pressure As Inflation Cools And Fiscal Risks Mount\nGBP/USD remains under aggressive selling pressure, trading around 1.3120, its lowest in a week, after a combination of softer UK inflation data, rising U.S. yields, and mounting domestic fiscal concerns. The pound has now fallen for four consecutive sessions, retreating from 1.3190 highs earlier this month as traders reposition for a December Bank of England (BoE) rate cut.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that headline CPI slowed to 3.6% year-over-year in October, down from 3.8% in September. Core CPI fell to 3.4%, its weakest reading since March 2023, and services inflation eased to 4.5% from 4.7%. These data confirm that inflation is cooling faster than expected, giving the BoE room to ease monetary policy for the first time since March 2020.\nMoney markets now price an 85% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the BoE\u2019s December meeting. This shift has pushed gilt yields lower and flattened the yield curve. The 2-year gilt yield dropped to 4.11%, down nearly 20 basis points in a week, reflecting growing confidence that policy tightening is over.\nUK Fiscal Uncertainty Deepens As Autumn Budget Looms\nThe upcoming Autumn Budget on November 26 is fueling renewed pressure on the pound as concerns rise over fiscal credibility. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces a widening funding gap estimated near \u00a330 billion, largely due to slower growth and weaker tax receipts. Reports suggest the government may abandon planned income tax hikes, raising fears of deeper deficits.\nBond traders have already started demanding a higher risk premium for holding UK debt. The 10-year gilt yield rose back toward 4.30% earlier in the week before easing on CPI data, and credit default swaps on UK sovereign debt ticked up to 21 basis points, their highest since February.\nInvestors remain unconvinced the government can maintain fiscal discipline while balancing political commitments to healthcare and infrastructure spending. This uncertainty, paired with the BoE\u2019s dovish shift, has turned sterling into one of the weakest G10 currencies this month.\nU.S. Dollar Strength Caps Any Recovery In GBP/USD\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) climbed back to 105.7, driven by hawkish Federal Reserve commentary and declining odds of near-term rate cuts. The CME FedWatch Tool now assigns just a 49% probability of a December cut, down from 67% a week earlier. Fed officials including Thomas Barkin and John Williams reiterated that inflation remains \u201coff track\u201d from the 2% target.\nInitial jobless claims rose slightly to 232,000, while the ADP report showed modest job gains, suggesting continued labor-market resilience. Traders are awaiting the Fed minutes and Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data on Thursday, with expectations centered around 50,000 new jobs.\nA stronger labor print could push U.S. Treasury yields even higher, reinforcing dollar strength and deepening pressure on GBP/USD, which has already declined 0.6% this week.\nTechnical Breakdown Shows 1.3070 As Key Support Zone\nTechnically, GBP/USD remains in a confirmed downtrend. The pair has broken below its short-term trendline support and now trades near 1.3120, testing the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level, a key pivot area. Momentum indicators confirm bearish bias \u2014 the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 46, showing weak recovery potential, and the pair remains below all major moving averages.\nIf sellers extend control and GBP/USD breaks below 1.3100, the next targets lie at 1.3084 and 1.3048, followed by the early-November cycle low of 1.3010.\nUpside attempts remain capped near 1.3173 (20-day SMA) and 1.3200 (psychological barrier). A clean move above 1.3200 would require a dovish "

Nvidia\u2019s earnings are viewed as a key barometer of the AI boom.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent expects President Donald Trump to announce his pick for the next Fed chair before Christmas. The five finalists are: Kevin Hassett (Director of the National Economic Council), Kevin Warsh (former Fed Governor), Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, and Rick Reider (fixed-income chief at BlackRock). All five have argued for looser policy settings.\nWhen asked about his choice for the next Fed chair, President Donald Trump said \u201cWe may go the standard way. It's nice to, every once in a while, go politically correct\u2026\u201d The comments skews odds in favor of Waller and Bowman as recent Fed chairs (Jay Powell, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke) were elevated from within the Board of Governors. Alan Greenspan and Paul Volker came from outside.\nThe latest US TIC data indicates continued strong foreign private sector demand for US long-term securities, notably equities. Net foreign purchases of long-term US securities increased by US$208.5bn in September vs. $181.2bn in August driven by near record high net buying of US stocks by private foreign investors.\nOn a 12-month cumulative basis, foreign investors trimmed their holdings of long-term US securities to $1511bn from a record high of $1549bn in August. We expect foreign appetite for US long-term securities (treasury bonds & notes, corporate bonds, equities, gov\u2019t agency bonds) to dwindle over time. The Trump administration\u2019s effort to narrow the US trade deficit means fewer dollars will flow overseas, reducing the need for those funds to be recycled back into US securities. That is a structural drag on USD.\nThe US August trade balance (1:30pm London, 8:30am New York) and the minutes of the FOMC October 28-29 meeting (7:00pm London, 2:00pm New York) are due today. The minutes should offer more details about the \u201cgrowing chorus\u201d of Fed officials supporting skipping a cut. Regardless, we are sticking to our view that the Fed will deliver a follow-up 25bps cut to 3.50%-3.75% in December (46% priced-in) because restrictive Fed policy can worsen the fragile employment backdrop.\nUS labor demand remains weak. The ADP weekly employment preliminary estimate showed private employers shed an average of -2,500 jobs a week for the four weeks ending November 1 vs. -14,250 for the four weeks through Oct 25 (revised down from an initial print of -11,250). Bottom line: we favor fading the latest USD bounce.\nUK\nGBP/USD is drifting lower. UK October CPI leaves room for the Bank of England (BOE) to resume easing at its next December 18 meeting. Headline CPI printed at 3.6% y/y vs. 3.8% in September (consensus: 3.5%, BOE forecast: 3.6%), core CPI inflation eased in line with consensus to 3.4% y/y vs. 3.5% in August, and the policy-relevant services CPI inflation cooled more than expected to a ten-month low at 4.5% y/y (consensus: 4.6%) vs. 4.7% in September.\nThe swaps market raised odds of a December rate cut to 88% from 80% yesterday. Over the next 12 months, the swaps curve implies 60bps of easing and the policy rate to bottom between 3.25%-3.50%. The expected fiscal drag from the UK budget (scheduled for November 26) opens the door for looser BOE policy settings. As such, we expect GBP to keep underperforming on the crosses.\nJAPAN\nUSD/JPY is making fresh multi-month highs, underpinned in part by the sell-off in JGBs. Long-term JGBs yields are breaking higher on concerns over fiscal profligacy and worsening Japan-China diplomatic spat. Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Takaichi is planning a fresh package of economic measures that is likely to exceed last year's \u00a513.9 trillion (2.2% of GDP) supplementary budget.\nIn parallel, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning warned that China will take \u201cserious countermeasures\u201d if Tokyo refuses to retract Takaichi's remarks on T"

                "body": "AUD/USD drops as risk sentiment weakens, Fed rate cut hopes fade\n- The Australian Dollar declines as falling equity markets weigh on risk appetite.\n- Australia\u2019s steady wage growth supports a cautious stance from the central bank.\n- The US Dollar remains supported by fading expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nAUD/USD trades lower around 0.6480 on Wednesday, down 0.40% at the time of writing. The Australian Dollar (AUD) is losing ground against the US Dollar (USD), pressured by a sharp deterioration in global risk sentiment. The drop in Equity markets, driven by concerns over overstretched valuations in the artificial intelligence sector, is prompting investors to adopt a more cautious stance and is weighing particularly on cyclical currencies such as the AUD. Australia\u2019s heavy reliance on commodity exports amplifies these pressures during periods of risk aversion.\nOn the domestic front, Australia\u2019s Wage Price Index rose 0.8% QoQ in the third quarter, in line with expectations, while annual wage growth remained stable at 3.4%. These figures confirm steady wage dynamics, consistent with inflation that remains elevated but contained, reinforcing the case for a gradual approach to monetary policy from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The RBA Minutes published on Tuesday highlighted a more balanced policy stance, suggesting that the Cash Rate could remain unchanged for longer if incoming data stay firm.\nRecent labour market data support this cautious approach as the Australian Unemployment Rate fell to 4.3% in October from 4.5% previously, while Employment Change surged to 42.2K, well above expectations. According to ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures, the chance of an RBA rate cut in December remains low, around 8%, indicating limited expectations for near-term easing.\nIn the United States (US), the US Dollar remains firm. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is holding near elevated levels, supported by increasingly tempered expectations of Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. Market participants now await the labour market data, with September Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) due Thursday, to gain fresh insight into the policy outlook. The CME FedWatch tool indicates a 49% chance of a 25 basis-point rate cut in December, down from 67% a week earlier.\nRecent comments from Fed officials underscore this caution. Thomas Barkin, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, noted that while the labour market appears more balanced, uncertainty persists over whether inflation can sustainably return to the 2% target. Philip Jefferson, Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, warned that risks to employment now outweigh upward risks to inflation, arguing for a \u201cslow\u201d approach to any further policy adjustments.\nData from the Department of Labor shows Initial Jobless Claims rising slightly to 232,000, while the ADP report indicates moderate job losses in recent weeks. Political uncertainty also lingers after US President Donald Trump stated that he would \u201clove\u201d to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell immediately, introducing an additional layer of institutional volatility.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today. Australian Dollar was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

Concerns about Japan's ailing fiscal position on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's new economic stimulus package continue to weigh on the JPY. Furthermore, data released earlier this week showed that Japan's economy contracted in Q3 for the first time in six quarters, which could put additional pressure on the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to delay raising interest rates and contribute to the JPY's underperformance.\nApart from this, the prevalent risk-on mood is seen as another factor undermining the JPY's safe-haven status. The USD, on the other hand, climbs to its highest level since late May and remains well supported by reduced bets for another interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in December, which, in turn, lends additional support to the USD/JPY pair. Meanwhile, some verbal intervention from Japanese authorities fails to provide any respite to the JPY. This backs the case for a further JPY slide as traders look to the delayed US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for a fresh impetus.\nJapanese Yen bears retain control amid Takaichi's expansionary fiscal policies and preference for lower interest rates\n- Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said in a statement this Thursday that the recent FX moves are sharp, one-sided and that he is watching FX market move with a high sense of urgency. FX market needs to move stably reflecting fundamentals, Kihara added further.\n- This comes after Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama issued a fresh warning on Wednesday and said that the government was closely monitoring markets with a high sense of urgency. This fuels intervention fears, though it does little to ease the Japanese Yen selling bias.\n- Japan's yield curve has steepened sharply as investors priced in a bigger-than-anticipated spending package from the new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Goushi Kataoka \u2013 member of a key government panel \u2013 said earlier this week that Japan must compile a stimulus of around \u00a523 trillion.\n- Kataoka added on Wednesday that the Bank of Japan is unlikely to raise interest rates before March, arguing policymakers must first confirm that a major fiscal package is lifting domestic demand. This signals the Takaichi administration's preference for interest rates to stay low.\n- Government data released on Monday showed that Japan's economy contracted for the first time in six quarters during the July-September period. This further tempers expectations that the BoJ will hike rates soon and backs the case for a further depreciating move for the JPY.\n- A Reuters poll shows a narrow majority of economists expect the BoJ to raise rates to 0.75% in December, with all forecasters seeing at least that level by end-Q1. JPY weakness and imported inflation risks are reinforcing the case as wage growth is expected to remain high.\n- The US Dollar moves back closer to its highest level since May, touched earlier this month amid less dovish Federal Reserve expectations. In fact, chances of another rate cut in December fell after the October FOMC meeting minutes showed that members were divided about how to proceed.\n- Traders now look forward to the delayed release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. This, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the USD and providing some impetus to the USD/JPY pair later during the North American session.\nUSD/JPY bulls now ready to give up as fresh breakout through the 15"

                "body": "USD/JPY Update: Yen Plunges After Federal Reserve Minutes Release\nDuring today\u2019s trading session, the USD/JPY recorded a gain of more than 1.00%, exceeding the average of the past five trading days. This reflects continued weakness in the Japanese yen and persistent strength in the U.S. dollar in the short term. The buying pressure, which had already been consolidating in recent sessions, intensified after the release of the Federal Reserve minutes, which suggest a possible neutral stance on interest rates for December. This shift has made the yen less attractive compared to the dollar and could sustain dominant buying pressure on USD/JPY in the coming sessions.\nFederal Reserve Minutes Released\nThe minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy meeting revealed broad internal divisions among committee members regarding the timing of potential future rate cuts. The document highlighted that inflation near 3% has once again become a significant concern, supporting the idea of keeping interest rates unchanged for the remainder of the year. Although several members favor eventual rate cuts, others believe it is too soon to adopt such a stance in the December meeting, as inflation remains too high to relax monetary policy in the short term.\nWhile the September employment data has yet to be released, the minutes have significantly shifted market expectations for the Fed\u2019s upcoming December 10 meeting. According to CME Group, the probability that the benchmark rate will remain at 4.00% has increased to 66.54%, while the likelihood of a rate cut to 3.75% has dropped to 33.46%, the lowest in a month. This marks a notable change in sentiment compared to market expectations from previous weeks.\nSource: CMEGroup\nCurrently, a wide interest rate differential persists between the United States and Japan, with the Federal Reserve maintaining its rate at 4.00% and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) holding an ultra-loose policy with a 0.5% rate. If the Fed continues its high-rate policy, dollar-denominated assets will remain more attractive than those in yen, driving steady demand for the U.S. dollar and limiting the yen\u2019s recovery. This context could sustain strong buying pressure on USD/JPY in the coming weeks.\nThe U.S. Dollar Begins to React\nThe strengthening of USD/JPY is not solely due to yen weakness but also to growing confidence in the U.S. dollar, following recent statements and the Fed minutes. The DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against a basket of global currencies, has maintained a steady bullish bias, trading above the 100-point level, a key reference zone. Throughout the day, the DXY has shown consistent growth, reflecting renewed investor confidence in the U.S. dollar, supported by expectations of sustained high interest rates, which could maintain stable demand for the currency in the medium term.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nThis strengthening of the dollar suggests that a less favored currency in the current environment, such as the yen, could continue to lose ground against the U.S. dollar. As long as the DXY index remains above 100, the dollar\u2019s dominance will likely limit the yen\u2019s recovery, maintaining strong buying pressure on USD/JPY in the coming sessions.\nUSD/JPY Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Aggressive Uptrend Emerging: Since April, the USD/JPY has maintained a steady upward trend, but since early October, the trendline has become steeper, forming an aggressive short-term uptrend. This movement confirms the dominant bullish bias in the technical outlook. So far, no significant bearish signals have emerged to threaten this structure, leaving the uptrend as the key technical formation to monitor. If buying pressure continues, the pair could retest the yearly highs, last seen in January.\n- RSI: The RSI indicator continues to show a bullish bias, with readings above the 50 level, confirming that buying momentum remains dominant. However, the indicator has started approaching the 70 level, signaling "

Washington is using the greenback as a weapon in sanctions and tariffs. The White House is exerting pressure on the Fed to cut rates, while the US national debt continues to rise. Unsurprisingly, investors have stopped using the US dollar as a safe-haven asset, and its share in gold and foreign exchange reserves has fallen from 70% at the beginning of the 21st century to less than 60%.\nForty-five per cent of investors surveyed by Bank of America believe the US dollar is overvalued. This is less than the 50% recorded in October. 48% predict that the EUR/USD will continue to trade in the 1.10\u20131.20 range in 2026. 30% expect the main currency pair to move into the 1.20\u20131.30 range.\nDespite the bleak long-term outlook, the greenback is showing its teeth here and now. The markets clearly overestimated the scale of monetary expansion and were punished for it. A month ago, derivatives indicated a probability of more than 90% for a federal funds rate cut in December. Currently, it is less than 50%. Investors believe that the lack of data will force the Fed to pause rate cuts, which plays into the hands of the dollar.\nTraders fear that the minutes of the October FOMC meeting will reveal a victory for the hawks. The chances of continuing the cycle of monetary expansion at the end of 2025 will fall even further. Nevertheless, the decline in EUR/USD ahead of the publication of an important document indicates that the US dollar is being bought on rumours. Will this be followed by selling on facts?\nAnother puzzle is the yen. The rapid rally of USD/JPY against the backdrop of a cautious central bank and expectations of large-scale fiscal stimulus from Sanae Takaichi indicates its weakness. However, 30% of investors surveyed by Bank of America name the Japanese currency as their top favourite for 2026. It is followed by gold, which is preferred by 26%. The pound sterling is chosen by only 3%.\nThe fate of USD/JPY will depend on divergence in monetary policy.

The pair may further appreciate as the US Dollar (USD) gains ground amid diminishing expectations for another Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in December following the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meeting Minutes. Traders await the release of the US September Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) later on Thursday to gain fresh impetus on Fed policy outlook.\nFOMC Minutes for the October 28-29 meeting indicated that Fed officials are divided and cautious about the path forward for interest rates. Most participants indicated further rate cuts would likely be appropriate over time, but several indicated they did not necessarily view a reduction in December as appropriate.\nThe CME FedWatch Tool suggests that financial markets are now pricing in a 33% chance that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, down from 63% probability that markets priced a week ago.\nThe USD/CAD pair could gain ground as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) may struggle on subdued Oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) holds ground near $59.40 per barrel at the time of writing, following a 2.31% loss in the previous session. It is worth noting that Canada is the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nOil prices could further fall as easing geopolitical risks reduce expectations of supply disruptions from Russia-related sanctions. Reports that Washington is urging Ukrainian President Zelenskiy to consider a US-crafted peace plan have raised hopes for renewed diplomacy, which could lead to increased Russian Oil shipments and add to oversupply concerns.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead c"

Rosenberg Research points out that both deep-rooted issues, like expanding budget deficits, and shorter-term pressures, especially weak commodity prices, are keeping the currency under strain. The Bank of Canada is already on hold with rate hikes, but softer inflation and a wider output gap could even nudge the central bank toward cuts sooner than markets expect. Canada\u2019s newest federal budget is heavy on supply-side reforms and long-term investment aims, but the benefits will take time and depend on strong business\u2013government teamwork. For now, with little direct stimulus, sagging oil prices, and worsening trade terms, the loonie could keep sliding \u2013 Rosenberg sees a potential drop toward C$1.45 per US dollar before a real turnaround emerges.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: The loonie stays on the defensive.\nInvestors have fewer reasons to favor Canadian assets right now. With commodity prices dropping and budget deficits widening, the loonie is already hovering near multi-year lows \u2013 and sentiment could worsen if growth remains sluggish. Equity and bond markets in Canada could see more turbulence as global investors react to these headwinds and recalibrate expectations for the currency.\nThe bigger picture: Canada\u2019s policy pivot needs patience.\nCanada\u2019s new supply-side budget reforms may lay the groundwork for stronger long-term growth, but it could be years before those results show up. Until then, factors like declining exports and rising government borrowing costs could keep growth slow and the loonie under pressure, putting policymakers under the microscope to deliver quicker solutions.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

The currency cross gains ground as the Japanese Yen (JPY) declines on the potential for Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to unveil a stimulus package exceeding JPY 20 trillion.\nMembers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) also proposed a supplementary budget exceeding JPY 25 trillion to support the plan, well above last year\u2019s JPY 13.9 trillion extra budget. The massive spending plan raised market caution amid concerns about Japan\u2019s fiscal health.\nHowever, the upside of the GBP/JPY cross could be restrained as the JPY may receive support on the Reuters poll, indicating the Bank of Japan (BoJ) appears poised to raise interest rates to 0.75% from 0.50% at its December 18\u201319 meeting. Forecasts remain closely balanced, 53% of respondents anticipate a December hike, and all economists who offered a longer-term view expect rates to reach at least 0.75% by the end of Q1 2026.\nBoJ board member Junko Koeda said in a speech Thursday that supply\u2013demand indicators show the output gap near 0% and that labour markets remain tight amid a growing labour shortage. Koeda stated that \u201cin this situation, I believe the bank must continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation in accordance with improvement in economic activity and prices.\u201d She emphasized that ongoing economic and price trends warrant further policy adjustment.\nAdditionally, the GBP/JPY cross may edge lower as the Pound Sterling (GBP) could face challenges amid signs of cooling price pressures, which have strengthened expectations for a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut in December. After the UK CPI release, traders raised the probability of a December BoE cut to 85% from 80% before the data.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuth"

The pair\u2019s printed successive higher highs and higher lows, indicating that momentum favors buyers.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now down 4% year-to-date, just six weeks after hitting a record high above $126,000.\nIn a Myriad prediction market, users forecast just a 28% chance that Bitcoin will hit $115,000 in its next move, rather than falling to $85,000\u2013a sharp reversal of trendlines from just a week ago that reflects investors' sour mood. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of Decrypt.)\nIBIT shares were recently off 3.6% on Wednesday and have tumbled more than 16% over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance.\nThe ETF set its previous record of $463 million in outflows last Friday. It had previously only shed more than $400 million in assets on two other days, rare missteps for the dramatically successful fund. In June, IBIT reached $70 billion in inflows faster than any ETF in the industry's 32-year history.\nIBIT now manages more than $73 billion in assets, more than three times the AUM of its closest rival, with the gains coming as institutional interest in Bitcoin has risen. Harvard University recently upped its position in IBIT to 6.8 million shares worth about $442 million, from a previous holding of 1.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing.\nOther Bitcoin ETFs have also been hard-hit, with the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shedding more than $266 million and $146 million in investments over the past five trading days, respectively, although none on Tuesday. The 11 spot Bitcoin funds collectively control more than $130 billion in assets.\nThe Bitcoin funds declines have come even as fledgling Solana funds have added investments, particularly the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which has posted net inflows on every day of its less than three-week history and now oversees $611 million in AUM. On Wednesday, 21Shares Solana ETF (TSOL) became the fifth Solana-tracking fund to list on a U.S. exchange."

                "body": "The cryptocurrency market has come a long way since 2008, when bitcoin (BTC) became the first decentralized digital currency. Its scarcity, decentralization, and early-mover advantage made it the foundation of the digital asset space. Then came Ethereum (ETH) in 2015, a network designed not just for transactions but for programmable money.\nTen years later, the competition between bitcoin and ethereum continues to shape the entire crypto landscape. Ethereum\u2019s flexibility, smart contracts, and scalable architecture have transformed it from an alternative to bitcoin into a catalyst for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and beyond.\nHistorically, ethereum has proved to be a viable digital asset. Less expensive than bitcoin, the cryptocurrency is fueled by a smart-contract-based ecosystem, which contributes to its heightened flexibility compared to bitcoin. This flexibility allows developers to build other projects on its network, which explains the emergence of millions of different crypto tokens on the Ethereum network long after ETH was launched.\nThe first token launched on the Ethereum network was the ERC-20 fungible token, a type of standard that allows developers to create, issue, and manage cryptocurrencies supported by ETH. Remember the 2017-2018 ICO bonanza? Since then, the ERC token standard has expanded, adding the ERC-721 (non-fungible token standard) and ERC-1155 (semi-fungible token standard).\nSmart contract compatibility enables the Ethereum network to support a wide range of different tokens. This gives developers immense flexibility, allowing them to create and launch their own digital asset without launching a whole blockchain network.\nBesides flexibility and smart contracts, ETH brought enhanced transparency to the crypto space. Unlike its predecessor, whose creation was attributed to a mysterious developer or group of developers known as \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d, ETH is the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and other prominent co-founders.\nIts launch was accompanied by a white paper that clearly outlined its concept and purpose: a scalable, open-source network for decentralized applications (DApps) and seamless peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.\nEthereum laid the groundwork for a new era of digital assets. Its straightforward foundational vision to decentralize online transactions, eliminating the middlemen (i.e., banks, credit card companies, and payment processing platforms), paved the way for future network developments.\nThe period between 2017 and 2020 saw the launch of multiple Ethereum network upgrades, including the Beacon Chain, which facilitated the shift from the proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof of stake (PoS) in 2022. This shift fuelled ethereum\u2019s rapid scale.\nMany applications have been built on the Ethereum blockchain over the past decade, from DeFi applications to NFT marketplaces, and beyond. Institutional investors became increasingly interested in what ethereum had to offer. To such an extent that in 2024, the cryptocurrency received massive institutional backing with the launch of eight spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This marked a turning point for ETH, demonstrating its viability as a must-have digital asset\u2014a perception that still prevails.\n2025 saw bitcoin\u2019s market cap skyrocket to 1.34 trillion USD, almost doubling from last year\u2019s low. During Q1 of 2025, ethereum\u2019s daily transaction volume totaled more than 17.2 billion USD, outperforming bitcoin for the fourth consecutive quarter. As the year progressed, ETH, the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization, gained even more traction.\nIn August 2025, ETH surpassed the psychological 4,000 USD mark for the first time, as global markets had already priced in a Federal Reserve interest rate cut announced by Fed Chair Powell. Cheered by crypto bulls, this watershed moment for ETH was not surprising for institutional figures like Ryan Sean Adams, co-founder of Bankless, w"

On November 17 and 18, 2025,\nblockchain data indicated\n, the company deposited 4,880 BTC and 54,730 ETH\u2014valued at around $642 million\u2014into Coinbase\u2019s institutional platform. This came after a previous $198 million transfer of ETH,\nprompting speculation\nthat these actions may represent a calculated reduction in holdings.\nThe transfers took place as both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced notable price drops, with Bitcoin\nfalling below $100,000\nand Ethereum approaching support near $2,900. Market analysts have viewed these moves as a negative indicator, pointing out that\nBlackRock\n, previously known for aggressively acquiring crypto, has not made significant purchases lately. \u201cGiven the timing\u2014during a broader market slump\u2014this appears to be more than just routine ETF adjustments,\u201d one observer commented,\nsuggesting that the firm\u2019s actions could heighten concerns among retail investors\n.\nRecent regulatory changes have added to market uncertainty. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has recently\nauthorized banks to hold Ethereum\nfor gas fees, requiring that these transactions be managed through separate accounts. While this regulatory update could help normalize institutional crypto custody, it has also sparked debate about how banks will handle large-scale digital asset transfers.\nAttention on BlackRock\u2019s crypto moves comes as alternative crypto ETFs are gaining momentum, potentially drawing investment away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. VanEck\u2019s\nSolana\nETF (VSOL), which launched in November 2025, and\nCanary Capital\u2019s XRP ETF (XRPC)\n\u2014which recorded $58 million in trading volume on its first day\u2014reflect growing interest in smaller-cap digital assets. At the same time, 21shares and Bitwise have rolled out Solana-based products,\nattracting $46 million in inflows\nwithin just one week.\nThe XRP ETF\u2019s launch was especially significant, as it became the first spot fund for the asset listed in the U.S. Despite a price drop to $2.27 after its debut,\nXRPC saw net inflows of $245 million\n, largely fueled by institutional investors. This strong demand stands in contrast to the continued outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, highlighting a shift in investor focus toward emerging blockchain networks.\nThis strong demand stands in contrast to the continued outflows\nfrom Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, highlighting a shift in investor focus toward emerging blockchain networks.\nThe reasoning behind BlackRock\u2019s recent crypto transactions remains unclear, as the company has not offered any public explanation for these large-scale transfers. However, given BlackRock\u2019s reputation as a market trendsetter, its actions are being closely monitored. \u201cShould BlackRock be scaling back its crypto positions, it could add further downward pressure on prices,\u201d one analyst remarked.\nThe company\u2019s upcoming decisions are expected to play a key role in determining\nwhether the current downturn in the crypto market will worsen or begin to stabilize."

                "body": "How XRP Tundra Outpaces Bitcoin and Ethereum in Offering Real DeFi Yield Opportunities\nInterest in dependable, revenue-backed yield has risen as users acknowledge that most major blockchains still struggle to provide sustainable on-chain returns. Bitcoin has no native yield mechanism, and Ethereum\u2019s staking payouts fluctuate according to validator issuance and network-wide inflation.\nThese limitations have intensified discussion around ecosystems designed around real protocol revenue. XRP Tundra fits directly into that shift, presenting a staking architecture built on measurable economic activity across its DeFi products rather than inflation-driven token minting. As a result, its yield structure diverges sharply from what Bitcoin and Ethereum can offer today.\nStructural Limitations in Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s Yield Frameworks\nBitcoin remains a non-yielding asset at the protocol level. Any returns must come through centralized lenders, custodial platforms or leveraged derivatives \u2014 all dependent on counterparty solvency and market cycles. When liquidity contracts, yields evaporate, revealing how fragile external dependency can be.\nEthereum provides on-chain staking, yet its reward system is inseparable from inflation and validator issuance. As more ETH is staked, rewards compress. The protocol does not generate revenue for stakers; instead, it redistributes inflationary issuance and priority fees. This creates a model where returns rise and fall with staking saturation rather than with genuine economic output.\nCommentary from channels such as Crypto Goat has highlighted that the industry is steadily moving toward revenue-share models similar to traditional finance, where returns come from activity, not issuance. That trend shapes the context in which XRP Tundra has attracted attention.\nXRP Tundra\u2019s Revenue-Backed Model Establishes a Different Yield Standard\nXRP Tundra was built to deliver the type of yield framework Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot. Its architecture splits execution and governance into two tokens: TUNDRA-S on Solana, which drives high-speed DeFi activity, and TUNDRA-X on the XRP Ledger, which anchors governance, reserves and future GlacierChain L2 functionality.\nWhat sets the project apart is the source of its returns. All Cryo Vault rewards are funded from real protocol revenue. Every swap, borrow, lend, bridge or derivatives transaction on TUNDRA-S generates fees that go directly into the staking vault. Frost Key NFT mints add another continuous revenue stream, and a percentage of fees is used to market-buy and permanently lock TUNDRA-X, creating increasing scarcity without inflating supply.\nBoth tokens are hard-capped, with no mint functions and no inflation. APYs rise when revenue increases and adjust downward when activity slows. This mirrors the proven models used by GMX and Gains Network \u2014 systems praised for transparency and sustainability.\nVerification is a core part of the project\u2019s positioning. Independent audits from Cyberscope, Solidproof and FreshCoins, plus full team KYC through Vital Block, reinforce the project\u2019s credibility.\nFor those researching whether XRP Tundra is legit, they can check the following article.\nStaking Tier Comparison: How Tundra Provides Flexibility Bitcoin and Ethereum Lack\nThe structure of XRP Tundra\u2019s staking system is another key point of contrast. Instead of a single yield mechanism, the platform offers multiple tiers with predictable, revenue-backed returns. The following comparison table outlines the differences in a newsroom format:\nThis tiered model allows users to choose between flexibility and higher rewards, with each tier funded by protocol fees rather than token inflation. Bitcoin cannot offer such a system at the protocol level, and Ethereum\u2019s saturated validator landscape cannot provide comparable non-inflationary returns.\nAlongside staking, XRP Tundra\u2019s Arctic Spinner introduces instant bonuses based on purchase size \u2014 a feature absent from Bitcoin and Ethereum ec"

Reliability issues and governance risks still require careful consideration.\nSolana is currently trading around 143.12 USD and is still one of the best cryptos to buy.\nIts fast, low-cost infrastructure appeals to DeFi, NFTs, and payments, making it a long-term bet for most investors. As of September 2025, its Total Value Locked (TVL) hit a record $12.1 billion, showing strong demand in its ecosystem.\nThat said, Solana is not without risks. The network has had network outages before, and it faces questions about validator centralization and inflation.\nSo, is it too late to buy Solana? Let\u2019s find out.\nRECOMMENDED: 5 Reasons Solana (SOL) Could Explode in 2025\nWhy Is Solana Still A Good Buy\nSolana continues to attract attention because real usage on the network keeps growing. Its rising TVL shows that more builders, users, and capital are choosing Solana for DeFi, trading, and on-chain activity.\nThis level of organic growth is often a stronger signal than price alone, and it suggests that developers see long-term potential in the ecosystem.\nStaking also remains a major draw. More than 60% of all SOL is staked, and rewards usually fall between 4% and 6%, giving long-term holders a steady yield while contributing to network security.\nSolana\u2019s inflation design also makes it a good buy. The current inflation rate sits around 4.7% and is programmed to decrease over time, which can help stabilize supply as the network matures.\nHalf of all base transaction fees are permanently removed from circulation, meaning heavy network activity naturally slows net inflation. During busy periods, this can meaningfully offset new supply coming into the market.\nRECOMMENDED: Is Solana a Good Investment? 7 Factors Every Investor Should Know\nKey Risks to Consider Before Buying Solana\nSolana isn\u2019t without risks. A major debate around inflation \u2013 including a proposal to cut it from roughly 4.5% to under 1% \u2013 failed to win enough validator support. That leaves some investors unsure about the long-term supply path.\nNetwork reliability is another concern. Past outages showed that even high-speed blockchains can face technical issues, and mission-critical applications need consistent uptime.\nValidator centralization also remains a pressure point. With a large share of stake concentrated among a relatively small group of operators, governance and security risks become more pronounced.\nALSO READ: Is It Worth Buying Solana In 2025?\nSo, Is It Too Late to Buy Solana?\nIf you\u2019re looking at Solana as a long-term play, it\u2019s not too late.

                "body": "Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) is pulling corporate treasury interest. A 60-year-old design firm, Forward Industries, raised $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoin commitments to build what it calls the largest Solana treasury.\nThis strategic fund aims to fuel development, attract talent, and build real-world utility on the network. But is this massive treasury enough to secure Solana\u2019s long-term edge, or will it fall short? Here\u2019s the impact.\nA Record Raise and the Players Behind It\nSeveral key players drove Solana\u2019s record-breaking raise. Here\u2019s who contributed and how they\u2019re shaping the largest Solana treasury:\nThe People Behind the $1.65 Billion Raise\nForward Industries\u2019 financing mix of cash and stablecoins will fund an active treasury that participates in staking, lending, and trading on the Solana network. The plan is to operate as a publicly traded institutional player in Solana\u2019s DeFi markets, using its size to pursue sophisticated strategies.\nGalaxy and Jump will provide infrastructure and advisory services, while Multicoin co-founder Kyle Samani will chair the board. Other board observers include Galaxy Digital president Chris Ferraro and Jump Crypto CIO Saurabh Sharma, reflecting a tight connection to institutional trading desks. The firm plans to deploy funds across multiple Solana protocols rather than simply holding SOL.\nThe Shift From Design to DeFi\nForward Industries\u2019 shift is notable because the firm spent decades designing cases for medical and technology products. Its market cap was about $44.6 million before the announcement, and its stock jumped about 73% after the news.\nKyle Samani will leverage his early investment experience with Solana to source deals, and Jump will contribute engineering talent through the Firedancer validator client, which is designed to boost Solana\u2019s throughput and resilience.\nForward\u2019s management says it aims to generate \u201cdifferentiated on-chain returns\u201d via staking, lending, and trading rather than passive token holding. This strategy mirrors Michael Saylor\u2019s Bitcoin-focused treasury model but targets SOL\u2019s higher on-chain yields.\nWhat Are the Potential Impacts and Opportunities\nAn institutional treasury of this size can affect Solana in several ways. First, it boosts demand for SOL, supporting price and market depth. When 20.9 million SOL held by treasuries represents over 3% of supply and most of it\u2019s staked, the float available for retail trading shrinks, potentially reducing volatility.\nSecond, active deployment of the treasury into staking, lending, and trading can channel capital into Solana\u2019s DeFi protocols, increasing liquidity and attracting users. Forward\u2019s partners plan to leverage their networks to strike deals with major Solana protocols to improve liquidity and earn yield. Such partnerships could accelerate adoption of decentralized exchanges, lending markets, and derivatives on Solana.\nThird, the treasury\u2019s presence may encourage other corporates to explore Solana for tokenized assets and payments. Visa, PayPal, and BlackRock have already integrated Solana for stablecoin settlement, highlighting growing institutional demand. A multi-billion-dollar treasury provides further validation and may spur traditional firms to follow, particularly if regulatory clarity improves.\nFinally, the treasury strategy can serve as a public benchmark. Investors will watch Forward\u2019s quarterly filings to assess transparency, risk management, and performance. Success could legitimize digital asset treasuries more broadly.\nWhat Are the Risks and Unresolved Questions\nDigital asset treasuries have faced criticism. Tom Lee of BitMine warned in October that the \u201cbubble has burst\u201d for treasury companies, noting that many now trade below the value of their crypto holdings. He cited widespread discounts to net asset value as evidence that the speculative frenzy collapsed.\nLee\u2019s comments highlight a key risk. If the price of SOL drops or if corporate treasuries trade at discounts, shareholders could suffer"

                "body": "Major stock indexes closed higher Wednesday ahead of AI darling Nvidia's highly anticipated quarterly results after the bell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 snapping four-session losing streaks.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up a respective 0.6%, 0.4%, and 0.1%. Yesterday, the S&P 500 and Dow both fell for a fourth straight session and the Nasdaq ended lower for a second consecutive day, as worries about AI-tied valuations continued.\nMarkets didn't move much following the 2 p.m. ET release of the minutes from last month's Federal Reserve meeting, with \"many\" officials saying no more interest rate cuts are needed this year.\nMarket participants also are awaiting tomorrow's September jobs report, which was delayed because of the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. The report was originally scheduled for release on Oct. 3, two days after the shutdown began. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also announced Wednesday that full October jobs data will not be released.\nToday, investors were focused on Nvidia (NVDA), the world's most valuable company, whose quarterly earnings report after the bell was expected to have wide-reaching implications for the AI trade and the broader stock market. Nvidia shares gained nearly 3% during Wednesday's session to pace Dow advancers, and the stock rallied further in extended trading after the chipmaker's results handily topped analysts' expectations. (Read our Nvidia earnings live blog here.)\nMicrosoft (MSFT), whose shares fell 2.7% yesterday after announcing strategic partnerships with Nvidia and Claude AI developer Anthropic, and also were pressured by a ratings cut by Rothschild, ended down more than 1%. Amazon (AMZN) stock finished little changed after dropping 4.4% Tuesday on its own rating cut by Rothschild.\nShares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) jumped 3% to a fresh all-time intraday high a day after it announced its latest AI model, Gemini 3.\nLowe's (LOW) shares popped 4% after reporting a third-quarter profit beat and raising its full-year sales projection, a day after rival Home Depot (HD)'s stock sank 6% as the home-improvement retailer reported disappointing profit and cut its full-year outlook.\nTarget (TGT) stock declined 2.7% after its total sales and comparable store sales came up short of analysts' estimates, and it lowered its full-year profit estimate. TJX (TJX) shares edged 0.2% higher after the T.J. Maxx parent reported better-than-expected results and increased its fiscal 2026 guidance. Shares of Walmart (WMT) were down nearly 1% a day before the world's largest retailer reports its results.\nBitcoin was trading around $89,400 at 4 p.m. ET, its lowest level since late April and down from the day's high of about $93,400.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.13% from Tuesday's close at around 4.11%. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, was up 0.7% at 100.19.\nWTI crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, fell more than 2% to $59.50 per barrel. Gold futures advanced 0.2% to $4,075 per ounce.\nWhat to Expect from Walmart Earnings Thursday\nWalmart's going through plenty these days\u2014but so are its customers. Both topics are likely to take center stage when the retail giant reports its third-quarter results on Thursday.\nThe update comes during a time of transition for both the company and the economy. Walmart's (WMT) long-time CEO Doug McMillon will step down at the end of January and advise his replacement: John Furner, who has been with the company for some 45 years.\nThe company is switching CEOs during one of its most successful periods. Shares of Walmart hit an all-time high last month\u2014though they've since fallen some 8%\u2014after it said itwas working with OpenAI on reaching those shopping through ChatGPT. Walmart's e-commerce and delivery business has been booming, drawing in customers with larger incomes. The company has also gained "

This represents a 77.5% premium to the tech stock's Tuesday close \u2013 and the announcement sent Semrush shares 74% higher on Wednesday.\n\"Brand visibility is being reshaped by generative AI, and brands that don't embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,\" said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe's Digital Experience Business, in the press release. \"With Semrush, we're unlocking GEO [generative engine optimization] for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.\"\nWilliam Blair analyst Jake Roberge reiterated his Outperform (Buy) rating on Adobe stock earlier this week.\n\"While recent competitive noise and seat growth questions in the creative ecosystem have added a layer of complexity to the story, we believe Adobe can durably grow earnings at a low- to mid-teens pace over the next two to three years,\" Roberge wrote in a note to clients. \"Therefore, we believe the stock is compelling for long-term shareholders.\"\nThe September jobs report will finally be released\nIn economic news, Wall Street will be tuned into tomorrow morning's release of the September jobs report, which was delayed from its initial October 3 release date due to the record-long government shutdown.\nData released over the summer showed a concerning slowdown in the labor market, which prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rate"

The trend carried across the continent, with EU inflation at 2.5% and the UK dropping to 3.6%. But those broad numbers mask stark differences between countries, with Cyprus seeing just 0.2% inflation and Romania seeing 8.4%. Meanwhile, a handful of corporate shakeups made waves: Nokia\u2019s business overhaul sent its shares tumbling 7%, while Lloyds\u2019 move deeper into digital banking by buying Curve saw its stock dip 1.6%. Deutsche Bank jumped 1.3% on buzz around financing for Oyo Hotels\u2019 IPO ambitions, and GSK edged down 0.6% after acquiring a new US drug.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Steady rates but cautious rally.\nEuropean stock indexes mostly ticked up, with the Stoxx Europe and DAX in positive territory, though the FTSE 100 and CAC 40 lost a step. Investors are finding comfort in cooling prices but remain wary of the ripple effects from ongoing corporate shakeups and those stubborn regional divides. With inflation approaching target, the European Central Bank is expected to keep policy steady for now, offering markets a moment of stability \u2013 though not necessarily time to celebrate.\nThe bigger picture: Transformation in a fragmented landscape.\nEurope\u2019s inflation data paints an optimistic picture at a glance, but look closer and you\u2019ll see uneven progress and lingering cost-of-living strains across the region. Corporate shakeups \u2013 from Nokia\u2019s strategic rewiring to the Lloyds-Curve and Deutsche Bank-Oyo deals \u2013 highlight an economy undergoing major transformation, reshaping everything from jobs to investment and setting the direction for Europe\u2019s recovery ahead.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "The UK stock market was trying to find its footing on Wednesday 19 November 2025, as investors weighed cooler inflation data, a weaker pound and a flurry of corporate news led by WH Smith\u2019s shock chief executive exit.\nBy late morning, the FTSE 100 had recovered early losses to trade modestly higher, up about 0.1% at 9,565.99 as of 10:35 GMT, after falling 1.3% in Tuesday\u2019s global sell-off. [1] The mid\u2011cap FTSE 250, which had also been hit hard the previous session, was only fractionally higher, reflecting lingering caution after a volatile few days. [2]\nKey points at a glance\n- FTSE 100: Down around 0.2% shortly after the open, then edging into positive territory by late morning near 9,566. [3]\n- UK inflation: CPI fell to 3.6% in October (from 3.8%), the first drop in five months and broadly in line with forecasts, boosting hopes of a Bank of England rate cut in December. [4]\n- Currency & bonds: The pound slipped to around $1.31 and gilt yields eased as traders priced in a slightly faster pace of future rate cuts. [5]\n- Corporate movers:\n- WH Smith sinks after its CEO resigns over accounting failures in North America. [6]\n- Smiths Group launches a \u00a31bn share buyback alongside Q1 growth. [7]\n- Jet2 reports another set of record interim results. [8]\n- Severn Trent posts a sharp profit jump but announces CEO Liv Garfield will step down. [9]\n- Workspace and British Land results keep UK commercial property in focus. [10]\n- Regulation: The FCA confirms a UK equity \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d should go live by 2027, aiming to improve transparency in stock trading. [11]\nMarket snapshot: FTSE 100 claws back from Tuesday\u2019s rout\nWednesday\u2019s session opened on a cautious note. At 08:54 GMT the FTSE 100 was down about 0.2%, extending Tuesday\u2019s slump that had knocked the index 1.3% lower and dragged the FTSE 250 down 1.2%. [12]\nHowever, as traders digested the latest inflation figures and reassessed the odds of a December rate cut, buyers slowly returned. By 10:35 GMT, the FTSE 100 had nudged into the green, up 0.14% at 9,565.99, leaving it still well below last week\u2019s record intraday high near 9,930 but comfortably above April\u2019s lows. [13]\nThe move followed a bruising global sell\u2011off on Tuesday, when concerns over stretched AI-related valuations, fading expectations of a near\u2011term US Federal Reserve cut and nerves ahead of Nvidia\u2019s earnings hit risk appetite worldwide. [14] European indices remained subdued on Wednesday, with the pan\u2011European STOXX 600 hovering near a one\u2011month low and tech stocks under pressure. [15]\nMid\u2011caps were steadier. Early commentary suggested the FTSE 250 was up only about 10 points, a near\u2011flat move that underlined how fragile sentiment remains after several days of declines. [16]\nInflation dips to 3.6% \u2013 and markets lean toward a December BoE cut\nThe main macro catalyst for UK markets on 19 November was the Office for National Statistics\u2019 October inflation release.\nHeadline CPI slowed to 3.6% year\u2011on\u2011year, down from 3.8% in September \u2013 the first decline since May and very close to economist expectations. [17]\nKey details from the data:\n- Core inflation (excluding food and energy) eased from 3.5% to 3.4%. [18]\n- Services inflation, closely watched by the Bank of England, fell more than expected to 4.5%, its lowest level since December 2024. [19]\n- The biggest downward pressure came from energy and housing\u2011related costs, as gas and electricity bills rose more slowly following changes to Ofgem\u2019s price cap. [20]\n- Food and drink inflation moved the other way, rising to 4.9%, with staples such as bread, cereals and meat still exerting pressure on household budgets. [21]\nMarkets quickly translated the release into interest\u2011rate bets:\n- The pound slipped around 0.2% to $1.31, while two\u2011year gilt yields moved lower as traders priced in a slightly more aggressive path of future rate cuts. [22]\n- Futures markets now see a high probability that the BoE cuts Bank Rate from 4% to about 3.75% at its December meeting, with additional e"

Services kept fueling most of the inflation, with food and non-energy goods lagging. Despite those softer numbers, Oxford Economics expects the headline rate to dip below 2% soon and stay low into next year, helped by cheaper energy and friendlier year-over-year comparisons. Still, analysts doubt the ECB will rush to lower rates. Meanwhile, almost 37% of German firms said their order books were thin last month, highlighting ongoing demand woes. On the corporate side, SAP nudged shares upward by teaming up with tech leaders to boost Europe\u2019s sovereign AI ambitions, while Ottobock soared after Deutsche Bank\u2019s bullish outlook.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Inflation cools but optimism simmers.\nWith eurozone inflation nearing target, investors are keeping a close eye on how the ECB will tread as price pressures ease. The DAX\u2019s muted move signals lingering uncertainty, even as SAP\u2019s AI push and Ottobock\u2019s strong growth forecast spark selective excitement. Ottobock\u2019s nearly 6% surge \u2013 backed by Deutsche Bank\u2019s upbeat price target and expectations of solid double-digit growth \u2013 shows the market\u2019s hunger for reliable growth stories amid a cautious backdrop.\nThe bigger picture: Germany\u2019s economic engine is in tune but not at full throttle.\nGerman exporters are still struggling with weak demand \u2013 nearly 37% saw underwhelming order books last month \u2013 despite the relief from softer inflation. High costs and tepid pipelines are weighing on wider business optimism. Yet, companies like SAP and Ottobock are betting on innovation in digital and health tech to help claw back a competitive edge. With ECB policy likely staying steady, Germany\u2019s economic rebound may hinge on these kinds of forward-looking investments through 2025 and beyond.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "EU inflation slows, bolstering ECB stance to hold rates\nHeadline consumer-price inflation in the European Union eased to 2.1 per cent year-on-year from 2.2 per cent, while core inflation remained unchanged at 2.4 per cent. The softer price impulse has reinforced the European Central Bank\u2019s inclination to keep policy on hold at current settings, even as the euro comes under pressure relative to the US dollar amid a comparatively hawkish Federal Reserve.\nEU headline inflation decelerated to 2.1% (YoY) in October; core inflation held at 2.4%, consistent with a benign near-term price backdrop.\nThe ECB appears comfortable maintaining a neutral policy stance, leaving the main refinancing rate at c. 2.15% while monitoring demand dynamics.\nGrowth remains fragile in parts of the bloc: Eurozone Q3 GDP rose modestly to 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, while Germany\u2019s Q3 print was flat (0.0%).\nEUR/USD faces short-term consolidation and downward pressure as markets price a greater policy divergence between the ECB and a hawkish Fed.\nEuropean Union\u2019s economy: current context\nEurostat\u2019s October release showed a small deceleration in headline inflation to 2.1 per cent year-on-year, matching market expectations, with core inflation unchanged at 2.4 per cent. Those readings support the European Central Bank\u2019s current approach: the institution has signalled a preference for a neutral policy stance that aims to keep inflation under control while remaining attentive to growth prospects.\nMacro momentum across the bloc remains uneven. Eurozone GDP expanded by 0.2 per cent in Q3 (quarter-on-quarter), a marginal improvement from 0.1 per cent in Q2, yet underlying activity is fragile in key economies. Germany \u2014 the bloc\u2019s largest economy \u2014 recorded stagnation in Q3 (0.0 per cent), reflecting ongoing headwinds in manufacturing and domestic demand. The combination of subdued growth and moderating inflation leaves the ECB room to hold rates at c. 2.15 per cent for an extended period, although weaker inflation could also reflect weak aggregate demand rather than a sustained disinflationary trend.\nAgainst this backdrop, the euro has weakened versus the US dollar. Markets are pricing a degree of policy divergence: the Federal Reserve\u2019s forward guidance remains relatively hawkish, while the ECB appears likely to maintain a steady policy path unless incoming data materially change the inflation or growth outlook.\nTechnical analysis on EUR/USD parity\nFrom a technical perspective, the EUR/USD pair displays a medium-term bullish bias that has recently shown signs of weakening, and price action has entered a consolidation range in the short term.\n- Trend context. Over the medium term EUR/USD retains an upward bias, but the structure of higher highs and higher lows has become less clear. Short-term price action is largely range bound between approximately 1.1500 and 1.1900, reflecting investor caution amid mixed macro signals.\n- Resistance levels. On the upside, relevant technical resistances are: 1.1638 (short term resistance and near the 50- and 100-day moving averages) and 1.1873 (structural resistance). A decisive break above these levels would imply possible higher zones.\n- Support levels. On the downside, important technical supports are: 1.1486 (immediate short-term support), 1.1416 (200-days moving average), and 1.1222 (structural support). Loss of the 1.1222 zone would increase the probability of a deeper correction.\n- Momentum indicators. The MACD currently shows a bearish divergence relative to prior price highs, implying a loss of upward momentum. The RSI is near neutral but has trended slightly lower, consistent with the recent consolidation.\nFigure 1. EUR/USD parity (2024-2025).

                "body": "FRANKFURT \u2013 Germany\u2019s stock market tried to catch its breath on Wednesday, 19 November 2025, as the DAX hovered around the 23,200 mark, only fractionally above yesterday\u2019s close and still parked near five\u2011month lows. [1]\nA tentative rebound in heavyweight names like Daimler Truck, Siemens Energy and Qiagen helped offset ongoing weakness in chemicals, autos and some big financials, but sentiment remained fragile as investors fixated on tonight\u2019s blockbuster Nvidia earnings and a string of U.S. data that could reshape the global rate\u2011cut story. [2]\nDAX today: tiny bounce after a bruising Tuesday\nAfter a heavy sell\u2011off on Tuesday, when the DAX dropped about 1.7% to roughly 23,180 points, its weakest level in several months, Frankfurt opened Wednesday on the back foot. [3]\nEarly in the European session, Germany\u2019s benchmark index slipped around 0.2% to 23,136.63, mirroring a cautious tone across global markets. [4] As the morning wore on, dip\u2011buyers nudged the market slightly higher:\n- Around mid\u2011morning, the DAX was up about 0.1% at 23,195.60, according to intraday data. [5]\n- Composite quotes for Germany\u2019s main stock market index (DE40) later showed it around 23,188 points, only about 0.03% above Tuesday\u2019s close \u2013 effectively flat on the day. [6]\n- Real\u2011time component data put the DAX at roughly 23,205 points, a gain of around 0.14% in early afternoon trading. [7]\nIn other words: Germany\u2019s stock market today is stabilising, not rallying. The index has still lost more than 5% over the past week and remains near five\u2011month lows after breaking below its 200\u2011day moving average. [8]\nAcross the continent, the mood is similar. The pan\u2011European STOXX 600 was down about 0.2%, holding close to a more\u2011than\u2011one\u2011month low after Tuesday\u2019s 1.7% slide, as investors question whether the AI\u2011driven tech rally has morphed into a bubble. [9]\nNvidia earnings and AI valuation jitters dominate sentiment\nThe single biggest story hanging over German and European equities today is Nvidia.\nGlobal markets have spent days unwinding AI\u2011linked trades, with tech\u2011heavy indices in the U.S. and Asia falling as investors reassess sky\u2011high valuations. Reuters notes that global stocks are on their fifth straight day of losses, while Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 is down about 4% from record highs set less than a week ago. [10]\nAn AFP/BSS wrap of Tuesday\u2019s action summed it up bluntly: tech\u2011focused selling on Wall Street helped trigger \u201cglobal contagion\u201d, sending Frankfurt\u2019s DAX down about 1.7% and dragging London and Paris more than 1% lower as well. [11]\nToday, markets are essentially in \u201cshow me\u201d mode:\n- Nvidia\u2019s earnings, due after the U.S. close, are seen as a make\u2011or\u2011break moment for the AI trade that helped push global stocks to all\u2011time highs this year. [12]\n- Analysts warn that Nvidia\u2019s share price is \u201cpriced for perfection\u201d; any disappointment on AI chip demand could deepen the correction in tech and spill over into broader indices like the DAX. [13]\n- Futures data and trading in Nvidia\u2019s Frankfurt\u2011listed shares suggest investors are braced for a highly volatile reaction. [14]\nFor German stocks, which now include several AI\u2011 and chip\u2011sensitive names (Infineon, SAP, Siemens Energy, and industrials exposed to automation), the earnings print could set the tone for the rest of the week.\nTop movers on the DAX: trucks, utilities and telecoms try to lead a rebound\nDespite the cautious headline index move, there was real stock\u2011picking activity under the surface of the Germany stock market today.\nBiggest winners\nIntraday data and market commentary highlight a cluster of cyclical and growth names that outperformed:\n- Daimler Truck Holding jumped roughly 3\u20133.5%, topping the DAX after recent weakness and as investors rotated back into selected industrials. [15]\n- Siemens Energy climbed about 2.4\u20132.7%, extending Tuesday\u2019s strong performance and benefiting from relief that regulatory and balance\u2011sheet risks remain manageable. [16]\n- Qiagen gained close to 2%, while Zalando added aroun"

Futures tied to the S&P 500 (ES=F) were up 1.3%. Those tied to Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.6%.\n(YM=F)\nNvidia surged more than 5% in after-hours trading after the chipmaker delivered an earnings beat and issued a stronger-than-expected revenue outlook for the fourth quarter. CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the company\u2019s Blackwell processors is \"off the charts,\" easing concern that the recent cooldown in AI-linked stocks signaled a longer-term slowdown.\nThe upbeat after-hours reaction followed a modest rebound during Wednesday\u2019s regular session, which saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow (^DJI) break a four-day losing streak. Despite the bounce, major indexes remain in negative territory for the week amid a broader pullback in growth stocks.\n(NVDA)\nMeanwhile, minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s October meeting showed policymakers with \"strongly differing views\" over whether cooling labor conditions or stubborn inflation pose the greater risk to the economy. The divide fed uncertainty over the central bank\u2019s December decision, with a number of officials signaling no additional rate cuts this year.\nInvestors will turn next to Thursday morning\u2019s delayed September nonfarm payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which was pushed back due to the federal government shutdown. Walmart (WMT) is also due to report before the market opens Thursday in the latest health check for big-box retailers ahead of the holiday season.\nLIVE 2 updates"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 47 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 46,138.77.\nAlphabet was among the winners of the day, rising about 3% and hitting a new all-time high. Shares were rallying around optimism about its new generation of AI, Gemini 3, which it rolled out Tuesday.\nFellow \"Magnificent Seven\" member Nvidia saw a boost of roughly 3% ahead of its third-quarter results scheduled for after the bell. Analysts largely expect that the company \u2014 the largest in the broad-market index \u2014 will meaningfully beat Wall Street's expectations and forecast strong sales growth driven by demand for its AI chips and other infrastructure.\n\"It's more challenging for a stock to outperform on the day of its earnings, when the stock has run up into earnings, so it's actually probably a healthy thing that Nvidia has pulled back a bit over the past several days, and that's, to some degree, maybe reset expectations, or it's actually brought in a little bit of doubt,\" said Michael Sheldon, senior portfolio manager at Washington Trust Wealth Management.\n\"It is probably a healthier environment for the stock to report their earnings today and increases the odds that a positive report will be greeted with a positive market reaction,\" he added.\nThe AI chip darling has a high bar to beat. Investors have taken profits from their tech holdings in recent days, reflecting heightened concerns that the AI boom has run up the valuations of Nvidia and other hyperscalers at an unsustainable pace.\n\"People are just starting to ask the question, as they should, 'You guys are committing to spending trillions of dollars into your data centers and your AI capabilities and everything else, when are we going to see the results of that?'\" Scott Welch, chief investment officer at Certuity, told CNBC. \"It's not a question that they're doubting them. It's just that it's a question of timing.\"\n\"There's nothing wrong with the AI trade, but it may not go to the moon tomorrow,\" Welch continued. \"There's never, ever in history been an experience where markets have gotten this elevated and not corrected.\"\nTuesday's session saw the Dow and S&P 500 notch their fourth consecutive losing days, with the S&P 500 logging its longest slide since August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq recorded its fifth negative day in six sessions. Bitcoin briefly dropped below $90,000 on Tuesday before recovering, while gold prices rose from a one-week low."

Kennedy Jr.\u2019s argument that a healthy immune system can keep even pandemic germs at bay.\nListen to more stories on the Noa app.\nLast week, the two top officials at the National Institutes of Health\u2014the world\u2019s largest public funder of biomedical research\u2014debuted a new plan to help Americans weather the next pandemic: getting everyone to eat better and exercise.\nThe standard pandemic-preparedness playbook \u201chas failed catastrophically,\u201d NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya and NIH Principal Deputy Director Matthew J. Memoli wrote in City Journal, a magazine and website published by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think tank. The pair argue that finding and studying pathogens that could cause outbreaks, then stockpiling vaccines against them, is a waste of money. Instead, they say, the United States should encourage people to improve their baseline health\u2014\u201cwhether simply by stopping smoking, controlling hypertension or diabetes, or getting up and walking more.\u201d\nOn its own, Bhattacharya and Memoli\u2019s apparently serious suggestion that just being in better shape will carry the U.S. through an infectious crisis is reckless, experts told me\u2014especially if it\u2019s executed at the expense of other public-health responses. In an email, Andrew Nixon, the director of communications at the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014which oversees the NIH\u2014wrote that the agency \u201csupports a comprehensive approach to pandemic preparedness that recognizes the importance of both biomedical tools and the factors individuals can control.\u201d But more broadly, Bhattacharya and Memoli\u2019s proposal reflects the spread of a dangerous philosophy that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of HHS, has been pushing for years: a dismissal of germ theory, or the notion that infectious microbes are responsible for many of the diseases that plague humankind.\nIn his 2021 book, The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health, Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, argues that modern scientists have blamed too much of infectious disease on pathogens, which he suggests are rarely problematic, unless the immune system has been compromised by poor nutrition, toxins, and other environmental stressors. He credits sanitation and nutrition for driving declines in infectious-disease deaths during the 20th century; vaccination, he has baselessly claimed, was largely ineffective and unnecessary. In his view, germs don\u2019t pose a substantial threat to people who have done the work of \u201cfortifying the immune system\u201d\u2014essentially, those who have taken their health into their own hands.\nIn terms of general health, most Americans would benefit from improvements in diet and exercise. A strong emphasis on both has been core to the Make America Healthy Again movement, and in one important aspect, Kennedy and his allies are correct: The immune system, like other bodily systems, is sensitive to nutritional status, and when people are dealing with chronic health issues, they often fare less well against infectious threats, Melinda Beck, a nutrition and infectious-disease researcher who recently retired from the University of North Carolina, told me. Conditions such as obesity and diabetes, for instance, raise the risk of severe COVID and flu; malnutrition exacerbates the course of diseases such as tuberculosis and measles.\nBut applied to widespread infectious outbreaks, the MAHA prescription is still deeply flawed. Being generally healthy doesn\u2019t guarantee survival, or even better outcomes against infectious diseases\u2014especially when an entire population encounters a pathogen against which it has no immunity. Although some evidence suggests that the 1918 flu pandemic strongly affected certain groups of people who were less healthy at baseline\u2014including undernourished World War I soldiers\u2014\u201crelatively healthy people, as far as we could understand, were"
