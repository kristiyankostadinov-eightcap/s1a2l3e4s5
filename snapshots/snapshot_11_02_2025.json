                "body": "Gold Volatility in Iran: Fed Policy Casts a Long Shadow Over Local Markets\nWANA (Nov 01) \u2013 As the global gold market enters a short-term correction phase following record-breaking highs, prices of the precious metal in Iran continue to show notable volatility. Analysts say the trend in Iran\u2019s gold market is now more closely tied than ever to U.S. monetary policy decisions and domestic currency fluctuations.\nIn recent weeks, the price of 18-carat gold in Tehran has oscillated between 10 and 11 million tomans (about 100$) per gram, reflecting simultaneous instability in the foreign exchange market and persistent inflation expectations. Economists note that gold\u2019s trajectory in Iran is no longer dictated solely by the local dollar rate, but by an interconnected web of factors stretching from Washington to Tehran.\nA Temporary Global Correction Before the Next Upswing\nAfter rallying to a historic peak near $4,400 per ounce earlier this year, global gold prices have stabilized around the $4,000 mark. International analysts interpret this pullback as a natural correction following months of sharp gains.\nThe recent surge was driven largely by a weakening U.S. dollar and expectations of lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve. However, when Fed policymakers signaled delays in potential rate cuts, investors began locking in profits, prompting a short-term retreat.\nDespite this pause, major investment banks remain bullish. Institutions such as Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan project that gold could surpass $4,500 per ounce by the end of 2025.\nGold and Copper: Strategic Pillars of Iran\u2019s Post-Oil Economy\nWANA (Jun 10) \u2013 As Iran seeks to reduce its reliance on oil revenues and bolster its productive sectors, gold and copper are emerging as two key strategic resources poised to play a pivotal role in driving sustainable economic growth, boosting foreign currency reserves, and supporting industrial infrastructure. Rising Strategic Importance Amid Global Volatility [\u2026]\nDomestic Dynamics: The Amplifying Role of Exchange Rates\nIn Iran, the price of gold remains highly sensitive to movements in the local exchange rate. During periods when the rial strengthens due to market intervention or political calm, even a global rise in gold often has limited domestic impact. Conversely, any wave of inflation or currency depreciation typically accelerates gold\u2019s climb\u2014sometimes outpacing global trends.\nAt present, with the dollar trading steadily between 106,000 and 108,000 tomans, Iran\u2019s gold market appears to be in a holding pattern. Market participants warn, however, that any renewed upward momentum in the dollar could trigger a sharper and faster reaction in gold prices.\nGeopolitics and Central Bank Purchases Add Fuel to the Fire\nBeyond U.S. interest rates, geopolitical tensions and central bank behavior are also shaping the outlook for gold. According to the World Gold Council, central banks added more than 400 tons to their reserves in the first half of 2025\u2014an indication of waning confidence in the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency.\nAt the same time, ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and rising tensions in East Asia have boosted safe-haven demand. Within Iran, rapid liquidity growth and persistent inflationary pressures continue to drive domestic investment toward gold as a hedge against uncertainty.\nAnalysts broadly agree that the current phase represents a pause rather than the end of gold\u2019s broader uptrend. Should the Federal Reserve begin lowering rates in the second half of 2025, a weaker dollar and renewed global demand could once again lift gold prices\u2014both internationally and across Iran\u2019s tightly linked domestic market."

                "body": "EAGLE, IDAHO / ACCESS Newswire / October 29, 2025 / Money Metals announced an expanded selection of fractional gold coins, rounds, bars, and other items designed to make gold ownership accessible at almost any budget.\nThe lineup includes 1/2 ounce, 1/4 ounce, and 1/10 ounce pieces, along with gram-denominated bars and divisible products.\nMany people, especially those at a popular big-box wholesale retailer, still believe they must buy gold in one-ounce increments.\nIf that were true, starting a position would be out of reach for many households because gold is now over $4,000 per ounce.\nFractional gold changes that by letting customers begin with smaller, affordable pieces and build over time.\n\u201cToo many people still believe they have to buy gold a full ounce at a time,\u201d said Stefan Gleason, CEO of Money Metals. \u201cThat myth keeps new investors on the sidelines. Our fractional gold lineup lets customers start with as little as a gram or a tenth of an ounce-without compromising on quality, brand recognition, or resale flexibility.\u201d\nWHY FRACTIONAL GOLD NOW\nThe U.S. dollar, or Federal Reserve Note, has lost the vast majority of its purchasing power over the last century. The Federal Reserve\u2019s stated inflation target means dollars are intended to lose buying power every year, even in normal times.\nWhen inflation is 2 percent, the dollar\u2019s buying power falls by roughly 2 percent over that year. In hotter periods, such as the past 6 years, the loss is even greater.\nGold has historically tended to preserve purchasing power over long spans, which is why many savers use it as a hedge against ongoing currency debasement.\nFractional pieces make this strategy practical. Buyers can add to their holdings on a schedule, average through volatility, and stay engaged during fast price moves without waiting to afford a full ounce.\nWHAT MONEY METALS IS OFFERING\nThe catalog features fractional sovereign coins such as American Gold Eagles, Canadian Maple Leafs, British Britannias, Austrian Philharmonics, Australian Kangaroos, South African Krugerrands, and Chinese Pandas. Historic world issues, including British Sovereigns and classic European and Latin denominations, are available when in stock.\nPrivate-mint rounds provide recognizable bullion in popular fractional sizes (e.g., 1/200, 1/100, 1/10, \u00bc, \u00bd ounce). Many privately minted gold rounds resemble famous coins but lack a legal tender face value and typically have a lower markup.\nAssay-sealed bars from established refiners, including Valcambi, PAMP, Geiger, Argor-Heraeus, Perth, Holy Land Mint, and Money Metals\u2019 own brand, cover 1/2 gram through 20 grams and select fractional ounce formats.\nGold notes, like those by Goldback and Aurum, add a portable and divisible option, including state-inspired series and convenient bundles.\n\u201cWhether you prefer the broad recognizability of sovereign coins, the value and protective packaging of assay-sealed bars, or the flexibility of fractional rounds, Money Metals\u2019 vast product options offer the right option for your goals,\u201d said Stefan Gleason.\n\u201cBecause we actively sell and buy back these items every day, customers benefit from competitive pricing, liquidity, and tight spreads across the board.\u201d\nBENEFITS FOR NEW AND SEASONED BUYERS\nSmaller denominations lower the cash outlay required to get started and help buyers maintain discipline during market swings. They also improve flexibility at sale time because investors can liquidate precisely the amount they need rather than part with a whole ounce.\nIn historical cases, fractional gold served as a means of barter with less gold, which allowed for bartering elsewhere with the remaining holdings.\nFor cost-conscious buyers, 1/4 ounce coins often balance premium and flexibility. Those building gradually frequently choose 1/10 ounce coins or 1/2 to 5-gram bars.\nAssay-sealed bars and random-year or \u201cbrand our choice\u201d options can further reduce the per-ounce cost while maintaining recognized purity and packaging.\nHOW TO "

                "body": "148%+ gains in the bag: A new list of AI-picked stocks for November is NOW LIVE\nGold, silver, and mining stocks are not doing much, but at the same time, today\u2019s session is very meaningful.\nThis is the case because of how the precious metals sector is moving lower today, because of what the USD Index is doing, and given how it all fits gold\u2019s big picture. In short, my gold price forecast for November 2025 remains up-to-date.\nGold, silver, and miners moved lower today, and miners are leading the way. Taking a closer look at the most recent upswing reveals that miners were the first to move higher, and silver caught up. This is typical for movement in the precious metals sector, and since silver has already caught up, it seems that the declines can now continue.\nUSD Index Rises as Sentiment Turns\nThe USD Index is moving higher slowly but surely. It started to move higher after the Fed cut rates \u2013 just like it did in September. Back then, it rallied for a few weeks, so it looks like this short-term upswing has only begun.\nBut\u2026 That\u2019s not even the point. The point is that the USD Index declined severely since April while it should have moved higher given the tariff announcements and then their implementation. Instead, the sentiment kept worsening until it moved to the extreme. Remember my Peak Chaos theory? That the markets already discounted the max amount of chaos and that now they are going to reverse? I wrote about that too early with regard to the precious metals market, but it worked like a charm for the USD Index.\nAnyway, just like I wrote yesterday \u2013 when the rally in the USD Index finally becomes obvious to everyone, the PMs can truly slide. And given that we\u2019re about to see a clear monthly gain in the USD Index.\nFrom the long-term point of view, it means that the tiny breakdown below the rising red support line was invalidated and that the move below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement based on the 2008 \u2013 2022 rally was also invalidated.\nIn other words, the USD\u2019s short-term rally is most likely just a small beginning of a huge upswing.\nIt seems that taking profits from the long-term investments and from half of the insurance capital (in gold and silver) when gold was at about $4,150 and silver was above $50 was a great idea.\nWhen the USD Index finally confirms its breakout above 100, things will get really interesting, and many USD bears will be extremely surprised by the outcome.\nHistory May Repeat 2011\nSpeaking of monthly performance, we\u2019re only several hours before the end of the month and we can see that in all likelihood we\u2019re going to see a powerful monthly (!) reversal in gold in the target area that I had featured on Oct. 16.\nQuoting my Oct. 16 Gold Trading Alert:\nOn the above chart, we see that gold moved to \u2013 and even a bit above \u2013 its 1.382 Fibonacci extension based on the 1999 \u2013 2011 bull market.\nIt\u2019s also at \u2013 actually a bit above \u2013 the upper border of its very long-term, rising trend channel. All this while being extremely overbought. And while the USD Index is just waiting to soar.\nAll this creates a situation in which all those recent big gains can be reversed shortly and followed by even bigger and more volatile declines.\nRemember \u2013 we saw something similar in 2011 and back then silver erased two months of gains in one week.\nGold is now \u201cjust\u201d $200 lower than it was when I had written the above and given the monthly reversal that is about to form, the really big declines are just ahead. This would perfectly fit the scenario in which the USD Index rallies profoundly.\nSumming up, gold had a magnificent run-up and so did silver, however, it seems that this rally is over. Fortunately, this creates unique opportunities.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

Furthermore, the United States may not take any action against purchases by China, the main importer of Russian oil, with which it has just signed an agreement to reduce trade tensions. \u2014 AFP\nYou May Also Like"

US President Donald Trump denied an attack was imminent, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the reports were fake.\nEarlier in the day, crude prices were trading lower on a weaker dollar and before an Opec+ meeting in which the production alliance is expected to increase output again.\nBrent, the benchmark for two thirds of the world's oil, added 0.62 per cent to settle at $64.77 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the gauge that tracks US crude, slipped 0.68 per cent to close at $60.98 a barrel.\nOn a weekly basis, Brent and WTI retreated nearly 1 per cent, after posting their biggest weekly gain since June last Friday.\nFrom the end of September, they slipped 2 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively. Year-to-date, Brent has retreated more than 13 per cent, while WTI has slid about 15 per cent.\nOpec+, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, this month agreed to another output increase for November as the supergroup of oil producers continued to unwind production cuts put in place two years ago.\nThe group \u2013 which also includes the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Iraq, Algeria and Oman \u2013 would be boosting production for the ninth month in a row as it focuses on regaining market share and supporting the growth of its economies.\nThe market is also keeping tabs on the effects of the latest western sanctions on Russia\u2019s two largest oil companies over the Ukraine war, which have raised supply concerns.\nAnalysts, however, have previously told The National that the oil glut is \u201cexaggerated\u201d and demand continues to remain strong.\nRBC Capital Markets expects Opec+ to opt for another modest 137,000 barrel-a-day increase for December despite the sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\u201cWhile we think that the sanctions on the two Russian oil exporters will prove material if enforced, we do not think Saudi Arabia and its Opec partners would look to surge output before seeing clear evidence of supply disruption,\u201d said Helima Croft of RBC.\n\u201cWhile the White House might like Saudi Arabia to accelerate the return of supply to the market, any move to do so would leave very thin spare capacity buffers to offset any additional outages.\u201d\nHowever, the new sanctions are unlikely to create a major supply shock as Russia is expected to continue to sell oil in global markets.\nBetween 500,000 to 600,000 bpd of Russian oil production is at risk of being curtailed following the US move, Rystad Energy estimates.\n\u201cIf the Opec+ producers do indeed opt for another 137,000-bpd increase, the actual addition will be much smaller than the headline figure, as most of the producers are nearly maxed and Saudi Arabia is the only country with substantial spare capacity,\u201d Ms Croft of RBC said.\nOil prices were also affected by the stronger dollar, boosted by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that another interest rate cut was guaranteed in December, after the US central bank slashed rates again this week.\nCrude prices were also hit by economic data from China, which indicated factory activity in the world's second-biggest economy had declined for a seventh consecutive month in October.

This marked the second quarter in a row of contraction. The US oil rig count fell to its lowest point in nearly four years in August, according to data from Baker Hughes.\nThe CEO of Diamondback Energy (FANG), an oil and gas producer based in Midland, Texas, laid out a downtrodden outlook for America's oil industry in a letter to shareholders in August.\n\"We continue to believe that, at current oil prices, US shale oil production has likely peaked and activity levels in the Lower 48 will remain depressed,\" CEO Kaes Van't Hof wrote.\n\"The US shale business is broken,\" one respondent to the third quarter Dallas Fed survey, who works in exploration and production, said. \"What was once the world's most dynamic energy engine has been gutted by political hostility and economic ignorance.\"\nBut now, new economy deals are giving an industry in decline a lifeline.\nTexas, long the booming center of US energy production, generates more power annually than any other state in the country, and its demand is only climbing.\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the grid operator that manages about 90% of the state's load, predicted in late 2024 that the power demand load in Texas would climb to 148 gigawatts by 2030. Five months later, in April, the operator updated that estimate to 208 gigawatts.\nThe vast majority of that new demand, nearly 50 gigawatts worth, is expected to come from data centers set to power the AI revolution.\nAll of these data centers are going to need power, and the Permian Basin oil and gas exploration companies' mass of preexisting energy assets \u2014 especially natural gas turbines \u2014 are well-positioned for a transition to new-economy applications, analysts told Yahoo Finance.\nMarkus Mowatt-Larssen, an energy transition analyst at Welligence, noted that West Texas has an abundance of open land suitable for building both data centers and new power generation assets. Developers can also collocate new data centers at the site of existing upstream assets and \"take advantage of stranded natural gas resources for which there is currently not sufficient infrastructure to handle,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\nProduced water \u2014 the water byproduct that comes up from a well along with the extracted hydrocarbons generated by oil and gas assets \u2014 can be used for the immense cooling demands of a data center. Gas that might have been \"flared,\" or burned off, illuminating the night sky throughout the basin, can be redirected to new customers who need power.\n\"In a world where speed matters, the ability to rapidly build gas pipelines, power plants, wind and solar farms with batteries, and local transmission lines within the Permian gives the Basin a distinct advantage for AI developers that need to expand computing power as rapidly as possible,\" said Gabriel Collins, a fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.\nDiamondback, bearish on the US oil outlook, has itself now begun looking toward the boom in data center power demand as a new means of generating revenue. The company announced on its fourth quarter earnings call in February that it is seeking partners for a joint-venture project focused on building a large \"behind the meter\" natural gas plant.\nThe plant would offload some of its gas to Diamondback to power its own operations while pumping out the lion's share to data center clients seeking cheap land and abundant electricity generation. Van Hof't signaled to investors and analysts that the oil and gas company has interest from some of the biggest names in the tech industry.\n\"We're still confidentially discussing it with the hyperscalers, giving feedback,\" van Hof't said on the earnings call, citing \"how muc"

                "body": "Oil prices rebounded on Friday but posted a third monthly decline in a row, capping a volatile trading session set off by reports that the US was ready to attack Venezuela.\nMedia reports claimed that Washington was prepared for an air strike against Opec's ninth-biggest producer, after the Pentagon said it had sent warships to the Caribbean and F-35 stealth warplanes to Puerto Rico, in addition to an aircraft carrier strike group en route to the Caribbean.\nHowever, the Pentagon said the fleet was there to cut drug trafficking. US President Donald Trump denied an attack was imminent, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the reports were fake.\nEarlier in the day, crude prices were trading lower on a weaker dollar and before an Opec+ meeting in which the production alliance is expected to increase output again.\nBrent, the benchmark for two thirds of the world's oil, added 0.62 per cent to settle at $64.77 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the gauge that tracks US crude, slipped 0.68 per cent to close at $60.98 a barrel.\nOn a weekly basis, Brent and WTI retreated nearly 1 per cent, after posting their biggest weekly gain since June last Friday.\nFrom the end of September, they slipped 2 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively. Year-to-date, Brent has retreated more than 13 per cent, while WTI has slid about 15 per cent.\nOpec+, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, this month agreed to another output increase for November as the supergroup of oil producers continued to unwind production cuts put in place two years ago.\nThe group \u2013 which also includes the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Iraq, Algeria and Oman \u2013 would be boosting production for the ninth month in a row as it focuses on regaining market share and supporting the growth of its economies.\nThe market is also keeping tabs on the effects of the latest western sanctions on Russia\u2019s two largest oil companies over the Ukraine war, which have raised supply concerns.\nAnalysts, however, have previously told The National that the oil glut is \u201cexaggerated\u201d and demand continues to remain strong.\nRBC Capital Markets expects Opec+ to opt for another modest 137,000 barrel-a-day increase for December despite the sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\u201cWhile we think that the sanctions on the two Russian oil exporters will prove material if enforced, we do not think Saudi Arabia and its Opec partners would look to surge output before seeing clear evidence of supply disruption,\u201d said Helima Croft of RBC.\n\u201cWhile the White House might like Saudi Arabia to accelerate the return of supply to the market, any move to do so would leave very thin spare capacity buffers to offset any additional outages.\u201d\nHowever, the new sanctions are unlikely to create a major supply shock as Russia is expected to continue to sell oil in global markets.\nBetween 500,000 to 600,000 bpd of Russian oil production is at risk of being curtailed following the US move, Rystad Energy estimates.\n\u201cIf the Opec+ producers do indeed opt for another 137,000-bpd increase, the actual addition will be much smaller than the headline figure, as most of the producers are nearly maxed and Saudi Arabia is the only country with substantial spare capacity,\u201d Ms Croft of RBC said.\nOil prices were also affected by the stronger dollar, boosted by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that another interest rate cut was guaranteed in December, after the US central bank slashed rates again this week.\nCrude prices were also hit by economic data from China, which indicated factory activity in the world's second-biggest economy had declined for a seventh consecutive month in October.

                "body": "Understanding India's Strategic Energy Transformation\nThe global energy landscape underwent a fundamental shift as Indian refiners pivot away from Russian oil in response to evolving sanctions frameworks and geopolitical pressures. This transformation represents far more than a simple supplier substitution\u2014it signals India's strategic response to complex compliance requirements that have reshaped international oil procurement patterns, with significant oil price movements affecting global markets.\nRecent data indicates that India's Russian crude imports reached peak levels of 1.75 million barrels per day, representing 36% of total crude imports during the 2022-2024 period. This substantial dependency positioned Russia as India's largest single-country supplier since mid-2022, fundamentally altering traditional energy trade relationships.\nThe current market dynamics reveal a measurable decline in Russian crude's market share, dropping from 36% to 34% year-over-year. While this shift appears modest in percentage terms, it represents approximately 320,000 barrels per day in absolute volume\u2014a significant reallocation in global oil flows.\nSanctions Framework Creates Unprecedented Compliance Challenges\nThe Trump administration's November 1, 2025 announcement of comprehensive sanctions targeting Rosneft and Lukoil marked a decisive escalation in Western policy toward Russian energy exports. These measures, coordinated with similar UK sanctions, created multi-layered compliance challenges extending beyond traditional trade restrictions, contributing to broader tariff-driven market impact across energy sectors.\nCritical Compliance Barriers Include:\n\u2022 Banking institutions exercising extreme caution in transaction processing\n\u2022 Insurance networks facing heightened regulatory scrutiny\n\u2022 Shipping channels subject to sanctions enforcement\n\u2022 Legal liability concerns for companies maintaining Russian energy relationships\n\u2022 Secondary sanctions risks affecting broader commercial operations\nThe sanctions framework operates through interconnected mechanisms that significantly increase transaction complexity. Previously attractive Russian crude discounts of $8-12 per barrel below Middle Eastern benchmarks have become substantially less appealing as compliance costs and operational risks escalate.\nAccording to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments, crude oil price surges following sanctions implementation have sparked tightening supply concerns and renewed inflation pressures. This development could negatively impact India's fiscal position as elevated crude prices may widen the deficit and strain import expenditures.\nAlternative Supply Sources Reshape Import Strategies\nU.S. crude imports into India surged to 575,000 barrels per day in October 2025, representing the highest level in three years and demonstrating a deliberate strategic pivot toward Western Hemisphere suppliers. This dramatic increase signals Indian refiners' commitment to diversifying away from Russian dependency, particularly as US oil production decline factors influence global supply dynamics.\nPrimary Alternative Supply Sources:\n\u2022 United States: Light sweet crude varieties with different processing requirements\n\u2022 Middle East: Traditional Gulf state suppliers offering established logistics networks\n\u2022 Brazil: Heavy crude suitable for existing Indian refinery configurations\n\u2022 West Africa: Medium-grade crude options providing supply diversity\n\u2022 Canada: Oil sands products accessible through international markets\nThis supply chain restructuring necessitates significant operational adjustments across India's refining sector. Furthermore, Indian refineries must navigate longer shipping routes, different crude quality specifications, and more complex logistics networks while maintaining competitive processing margins.\nThe transition presents technical challenges as Russian Urals crude possesses distinct viscosity and sulfur content characteristics compared to alternative sourc"

The metal\u2019s correction, which began after October 20, intensified as the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish stance, a stronger U.S. dollar, and ETF outflows weighed heavily on sentiment. Despite gold\u2019s 50% gain year-to-date, traders are reassessing near-term prospects as yields rise and the U.S.\u2013China trade d\u00e9tente fails to spark renewed safe-haven demand.\nFed\u2019s Hawkish Tone Fuels Dollar Strength\nThe turning point for gold came following Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s warning that a December rate cut was \u201cnot a done deal.\u201d The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, setting the new range at 3.75%\u20134.00%, but Powell\u2019s tone was far from dovish. He highlighted that inflation progress remains \u201cincomplete,\u201d which triggered a surge in Treasury yields and boosted the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) above 100.20, its highest level since late September.\nThis renewed dollar strength dampened demand for non-yielding assets like gold, reinforcing the inverse relationship that has persisted throughout 2025. COMEX December gold futures dropped 5.7%, the steepest one-day decline in 12 years, while gold ETFs saw their largest outflows since March. Institutional investors, anticipating tighter financial conditions, pulled capital from precious metals into short-term Treasuries yielding above 4.5%, intensifying selling pressure.\nU.S.\u2013China Trade Truce Offers Limited Relief\nMarkets had initially expected a U.S.\u2013China summit in Busan to support gold, but optimism quickly faded. Although the two countries announced a 10% reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and a postponement of China\u2019s rare earth export restrictions, geopolitical tension persisted. Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s remarks at the subsequent APEC summit, emphasizing \u201cmultilateral trade systems,\u201d were interpreted as a veiled response to U.S. policy, underscoring lingering discord.\nThe trade agreement temporarily steadied gold near $4,010, but failed to trigger sustained inflows as investors adopted a wait-and-see stance. Analysts warned that while the truce may prevent escalation, it does little to stimulate safe-haven flows since both economies are pursuing domestic rebalancing rather than true cooperation. The uncertainty\u2014though supportive in principle\u2014was overshadowed by the stronger dollar and rising U.S. yields.\nTechnical Pullback Mirrors 2011 Reversal Pattern\nFrom a technical perspective, gold\u2019s recent decline mirrors patterns seen during its 2011 post-rally reversal. After touching an all-time high near $4,380 earlier in October, prices slipped nearly 8%, forming a monthly reversal candle that often precedes extended corrections. The metal remains above its 100-day moving average at $3,940, but a breach below this level could expose the $3,750 support zone cited by Westpac Bank\u2019s Robert Rennie.\nMomentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have eased from overbought territory (above 70) to near 49, signaling a neutral but weakening bias. Short-term traders now eye $4,150 as immediate resistance and $3,750 as key support. Should the dollar continue strengthening, gold\u2019s medium-term bias could turn negative, potentially driving prices closer to $3,700\u2013$3,720 before stabilizing.\nETF Outflows Reinforce Adjustment Phase\nThe most notable structural shift in gold\u2019s momentum is the sharp outflow from gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

                "body": "FX Daily: Dollar squeezing every bit of Powell\u2019s hawkishness\nThe dollar enjoyed a second round of support yesterday as Powell's relatively hawkish press conference continued to resonate with data-starved markets. But the conditions for another big leg higher in USD aren't there, in our view. Meanwhile, Japan has intervened verbally to curb JPY volatility, and GBP is looking closely at Reeves' political position\nUSD: Further gains harder to justify\nThe dollar found more support yesterday on the tail effect of Fed Chair Powell\u2019s hawkish press conference and, more marginally, the US-China trade deal (on the latter, we recommend our commodities team\u2019s rare earths note). Throughout September and October, we have discussed how short-dollar trades clearly hit a roadblock and needed to be fuelled by more compelling negative USD news. The government shutdown has prevented jobs data from offering that catalyst, and Powell\u2019s caution on a December cut has to be taken more at face value now.\nBut our short-term call on the dollar remains more one of \u2018lack of direction\u2019 rather than the initiation of a more sustainable rebound. And the reason is precisely the lack of data releases, which incidentally prevents markets from making any conviction call on slower Fed easing. In our view, DXY lacks the thrust to break above 100.0. Today, the PCE report should be delayed.\nIn Japan, USD/JPY is now obviously causing concerns for authorities. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said overnight that the yen\u2019s \u201cvery one-sided and rapid currency\u201d moves are being watched with a \u201chigh sense of urgency\u201d. This confirms it\u2019s officially the rate of change rather than the level that matters, although previous instances of BoJ FX intervention tell us that psychological levels play a role too. This time, there is a larger question mark on whether the US will condone FX intervention.\nMarkets may be willing to test whether 155.0 is a line in the sand \u2013 inaction around that level could prompt more speculative long USD/JPY bets. However, hot Tokyo CPI and industrial production overnight raise the chance of a December hike, which is our base case, but only 45% priced in by markets.\nFrancesco Pesole\nEUR: Bar for more ECB easing is high\nIt\u2019s abundantly clear that the ECB wants to keep things boring at this stage. Here are our ECB watcher Carsten Brzeski\u2019s takes on yesterday\u2019s statement and press conference. The only real highlight was the shift from a \u2018balance of risk\u2019 wording to a broader set of upside and downside risks to growth. Lagarde acknowledged some downside risks had eased, but didn\u2019t give much weight to the shift in wording. Admittedly, eurozone growth was better than expected in 3Q (0.2% QoQ), largely due to surprisingly strong French numbers (0.5% QoQ).\nThe coming weeks will see Governing Council members offering their nuances to the policy-inflation-growth assessments. But don\u2019t expect much. The ECB is clearly in a \u2018good place\u2019 at 2% and the bar for more easing remains high.\nAnyway, EUR/USD remains entirely a function of dollar moves, and post-FOMC price action is leading to speculation of a potential break below 1.150. We don\u2019t see the conditions for another big leg lower in the pair, though. Jobs data need to confirm Powell\u2019s more cautious stance, and we doubt the bar is much higher for a Fed dovish repricing should US jobs deterioration continue. The contribution of the euro is small, but a slight improvement in the growth story and a firm ECB cannot harm. Our call remains bullish on EUR/USD into year-end.\nFrancesco Pesole\nGBP: A surprise Reeves resignation would be bad for markets\nWe published a market guide to the UK Autumn Budget yesterday, looking at four different scenarios and their impact on gilts and the pound. In our baseline scenario, Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivers a combination of tax hikes whilst avoiding the more inflationary measures. That has gradually been priced in by markets via some dovish BoE repricing, lower gilt yields and a weaker "

The decline capped a third consecutive weekly loss as investors favored the Greenback amid hawkish Federal Reserve remarks and deepening concerns over the United Kingdom\u2019s fiscal outlook. The pair traded within a 1.3090\u20131.3240 range, failing to hold above the 1.3200 handle as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) hovered near 99.80, its highest in three months. The backdrop reflected an uneasy combination of strong U.S. monetary policy, fragile UK fiscal positioning, and mounting skepticism ahead of the country\u2019s November budget.\nFed\u2019s Hawkish Stance Strengthens the Dollar and Caps Sterling Recovery\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting reignited dollar strength after Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that further rate cuts are \u201cnot guaranteed,\u201d despite the October reduction to the 3.75\u20134.00% range. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a December rate cut dropped to 63%, down from over 90% just a week earlier.\nSeveral Fed officials supported this restrictive tone. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack stated she would not have supported the October cut, insisting that \u201cmonetary conditions must remain tight to ensure inflation\u2019s return to target.\u201d Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed\u2019s Raphael Bostic acknowledged tension between price stability and employment but emphasized that \u201cpolicy cannot ease prematurely.\u201d\nThese statements lifted U.S. yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield holding above 4.42%, and drove the DXY toward the key 100.00 resistance. The strong dollar has now gained 2.1% month-to-date, marking its best performance since July. For GBP/USD, this created sustained downside pressure, as investors rotated into safer assets and shorted currencies exposed to fiscal and political risk.\nUK Fiscal Constraints and Political Pressure Weigh on Sterling\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) painted a grim outlook for Britain\u2019s finances ahead of the November budget. Productivity is expected to decline by 0.3%, while the budget deficit could widen by \u00a321 billion by 2030 if current spending trends persist. The IFS added that the government already faces a \u00a322 billion shortfall, leaving Chancellor Rachel Reeves minimal room for maneuver without breaking election pledges.\nMarket sentiment soured as fiscal tightening appeared unavoidable. Traders now expect either tax hikes or increased borrowing, both of which risk slowing growth further. Consumer confidence fell sharply, with GfK\u2019s October reading dropping to its weakest since December 2022, reinforcing fears of soft domestic demand. The UK GDP growth rate, last reported at 0.2% for Q3, shows little sign of acceleration, making it difficult for the Bank of England (BoE) to maintain parity with the Fed\u2019s restrictive stance.\nMarket Reaction: Sterling Breaks Key Support and Eyes 1.2950 Zone\nThe pound\u2019s failure to hold 1.3200 triggered algorithmic selling and a cascade of stops around 1.3145\u20131.3160, a level previously defended for two weeks.

The trimmed mean CPI for Q3 rose to 1.0% QoQ and 3.0% YoY. While the monthly CPI increased to 3.5% YoY, it limited hopes for another rate cut by the RBA in the near term.

                "body": "Australian Dollar Outlook: RBA, US ISM and ADP In Focus\nThe Australian dollar outperformed its peers last week after strong inflation data dashed hopes of an RBA rate cut this year. With the central bank vindicated in its cautious stance, attention now shifts to upcoming employment figures and US data releases \u2014 including the ISM and ADP reports \u2014 for clues on the next move in AUD/USD.\nView related analysis:\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Eyes Volatility Ahead of Fed, AU CPI\n- ASX 200 Morning Market Outlook: Sectors Highlight Structural Weakness\n- Gold Shows Tentative Signs Of Stability, Options Hint At Mild Recovery\n- US Dollar Eyes Breakout as EUR/USD, GBP/USD Probe Support, USD/JPY Rallies\n- The Nasdaq-to-Bitcoin Correlation Is Alive and Well (During Risk-Off)\nRBA Vindicated as Hot Inflation Data Halts Rate-Cut Hopes\nAustralian Dollar Performance\n- The Australian dollar was the strongest FX major last week, gaining the most traction against the British pound, Swiss franc, and euro.\n- Strong inflation figures have killed all hopes of an RBA cut this week \u2014 and likely this year.\n- AUD/JPY rose 3.1% in October, marking its most bullish month in 18.\n- GBP/AUD formed a shooting star month, fell 1.7% last week, and briefly probed 2.0 on the combination of hot Australian CPI and increased odds of Bank of England (BoE) cuts.\n- EUR/AUD formed a bearish outside month, fell for a second week, and bears are now eyeing a break of its October low.\n- A bullish pinbar month formed on AUD/CHF after a false break of 0.5164, and it rose for a second consecutive week.\n- AUD/NZD climbed for a fifth month, though it formed an inverted hammer below the 2022 high \u2014 hinting at potential weakness within its bullish trend.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nRBA Vindicated as Hot Inflation Data Halts Rate-Cut Hopes\nThe RBA have taken plenty of stick from pundits for not cutting rates sooner, with each policy statement accompanied by lingering concerns over inflation. Well, they likely feel vindicated following the release of the Q3 figures \u2014 even if it puts them in a tricky position. Trimmed mean CPI rose 1% q/q, above Governor Bullock\u2019s own 0.9% threshold to justify holding rates at this week\u2019s meeting. The trimmed mean also climbed to 3% y/y, the top of the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target band, while the weighted mean rose to an uncomfortable 3.2%.\nNot only is an RBA rate cut this week dead and buried, but the latest data also casts doubt on whether the Bank will cut at all this year \u2014 and raises the question of whether we\u2019ve already seen the terminal rate at 3.6%. Unless unemployment spikes and employment begins to roll over, it\u2019s hard to see the RBA cutting again before the next quarterly CPI figures drop on 28 January.\nRBA cash rate futures imply just a 7% chance of a cut this week, down from 81% just two weeks ago.\nFocus Shifts to Labour Data After Hot Inflation Report\nWhile Governor Bullock made it clear she was more concerned about inflation than rising unemployment ahead of the hot inflation report, that doesn\u2019t make employment data insignificant. Traders can use smaller employment-related releases to gauge whether the labour market is starting to weaken. ANZ\u2019s job advertisements data, released on Monday at 11:30, showed a -3.5% decline in September \u2014 the fastest contraction since December 2023. If this trend continues, it could build expectations for a softer jobs report and a higher unemployment rate. It\u2019s also worth noting that ANZ announced 3,500 job cuts over the next year back in September \u2014 and banks tend to follow one another with such moves.\nEmployment and inflation trends can also be tracked through the Judo Bank PMIs and AIG construction and manufacturing reports. While these releases rarely generate significant reactions in AUD/USD, they can collectively help shape RBA policy expectations at the margin.\nAustralia This Week: Economic Data and Events for AUD/USD Traders\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson: Source \u2013 Investing.com\nPowel"

                "body": "The Fed and the Bank of Japan diverged from policy expectations, sending USD/JPY up 0.74% to close the week at 154.004, its highest weekly close since January 27, 2025.\nFed Chair Powell downplayed the chances of a December interest rate cut on Wednesday, October 29, lifting demand for the US dollar. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan kept interest rates at 0.5% and dampened expectations for a December rate hike, weighing on the Japanese yen.\nThe USD/JPY pair advanced despite Tokyo inflation heating up in October, which would typically support a more hawkish BoJ rate path. Concerns about tariffs affecting the broader Japanese economy overshadowed the inflation data.\nIt could be a pivotal week ahead for the USD/JPY pair. Traders should closely monitor developments on Capitol Hill. Government agencies could begin releasing delayed US economic reports, potentially shifting the Fed\u2019s policy stance.\nJapanese economic data, BoJ rhetoric, Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s policy goals, and intervention threats will also influence price trends.\nOn Tuesday, November 4, the finalized S&P Global Manufacturing PMI will draw interest. According to the preliminary survey, the PMI slipped from 48.5 in September to 48.3 in October.\nA sharper drop could reflect the effects of US tariffs on demand and price margins, supporting a more dovish BoJ rate path. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled further delays to rate hikes earlier this week, stating:\n\u201cWe would like to spend a bit more time scrutinizing wages and price moves. We will have more data on how companies, hit by 15% tariffs, would respond and set wages, including for next year.\u201d\nWith the BoJ focused on tariffs and wages, Japan\u2019s wage growth figures will face scrutiny on Thursday, November 6. Economists forecast average cash earnings to rise 1.6% year-on-year in September, up from 1.5% in August.\nRising wages could boost household spending and fuel demand-driven inflation, supporting a December rate hike. However, wages would need to increase sharply to pressure the BoJ into a policy adjustment. Average cash earnings have tumbled since July\u2019s 3.4% year-on-year increase.\nFirms have cut prices for goods bound for the US, forcing producers to slow wage hikes to limit the impact on their bottom lines. Crucially, slowing wages could be a precursor to job cuts if tariffs continue to squeeze margins, underscoring the need for the BoJ to remain vigilant.\nAdditional data releases on Thursday, November 6, include finalized S&P Services PMI and Reuters Tankan Index numbers.\nThe Services PMI is also likely to influence the BoJ\u2019s policy stance, given that the sector accounts for roughly 70% of Japan\u2019s GDP. According to the preliminary survey, the S&P Global Services PMI fell from 53.3 to 52.4. A downward revision, combined with falling input and output prices, would support delaying rate hikes until 2026, weighing on the yen.\nOn the other hand, a higher reading could ease concerns about the economic outlook, potentially raising bets on a December rate hike.\nOn Friday, November 7, household spending will require consideration. Economists forecast household spending to rise 2.5% year-on-year in September, up from 2.3% in August.\nA higher reading could signal a pickup in inflationary pressures, increasing bets on a December BoJ rate hike. On the other hand, a lower print may reinforce BoJ Governor Ueda\u2019s calls to spend more time assessing incoming data.\nNotably, the weaker Japanese yen could push import prices higher, potentially weakening household spending. Import price trends are a key focus for the Japanese government. Rising costs may raise speculation about an intervention, which could send USD/JPY sharply lower.\nFollow our real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nCrucially, a rise toward 155 could raise expectations of the Ministry of Finance warning of an intervention, mirroring events in 2024. The potential for intervention will likely be the key downside risk for USD/JPY in the near-term, g"

                "body": "USD/JPY Surges Toward 154.00 as Powell\u2019s Hawkish Tone Reignites Dollar Strength and Japan Faces Intervention Pressure\nThe USD/JPY pair extended its aggressive climb into November\u2019s first session, closing Friday near 154.00, its highest level since March, as U.S. yields surged following Jerome Powell\u2019s reaffirmation that rate cuts remain \u201cfar from guaranteed.\u201d The dollar\u2019s rally was intensified by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which delayed crucial labor market data, forcing traders to rely on private indicators such as ADP employment and ISM services PMI. These events have tightened volatility, pushing the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield back toward 4.75%, while the 2-year yield steadied near 4.98%, sustaining dollar momentum against the yen.\nU.S. Yield Rebound Anchors USD/JPY Bullish Trajectory\nCorrelation between USD/JPY and U.S. bond yields has strengthened sharply, with a rolling five-day coefficient peaking at 0.93\u2014one of the highest readings of the year\u2014demonstrating how the pair\u2019s movement has decoupled from equity risk sentiment and now mirrors Treasury performance almost tick-for-tick. The Nasdaq futures and VIX correlation have weakened, indicating that risk appetite is no longer driving yen weakness; instead, the yield advantage is dominating.\nFollowing Powell\u2019s FOMC remarks, traders reduced the odds of a December rate cut to below 25%, compared to nearly 60% two weeks prior. The Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative tightening is expected to slow by early December, when maturities from the Fed\u2019s holdings will be reinvested into short-term Treasuries, further anchoring front-end yields and sustaining pressure on the yen.\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s latest quarterly refunding projection, estimating $590 billion in Q4 borrowing, compounded concerns over debt supply, reinforcing yield elevation. With U.S. debt issuance focused on short-term maturities, yield spreads between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries narrowed to -24 basis points, further strengthening dollar appeal.\nJapan\u2019s Officials Step Up Verbal Defense as Yen Nears Intervention Zone\nAs USD/JPY trades above the 152.00 psychological threshold that triggered intervention in 2022, Tokyo\u2019s financial authorities are visibly uneasy. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama issued a warning that the yen\u2019s \u201cvery one-sided and rapid moves\u201d are being monitored with \u201ca high sense of urgency.\u201d This explicit language mirrors the rhetoric used just before Japan\u2019s prior intervention when the pair was near 151.95, suggesting that policymakers are now on alert.\nStill, Japan\u2019s 10-year JGB yield, capped by the Bank of Japan\u2019s 1.0% upper limit, leaves the central bank with little flexibility to counteract U.S. rate differentials. The widening yield gap\u2014now exceeding 380 basis points between U.S. 10-year Treasuries and Japanese JGBs\u2014continues to suppress yen demand.\nThe Tokyo CPI print for October, rising 2.9% year-over-year, adds pressure on the BOJ to consider policy normalization by December. Market consensus is shifting toward a potential rate hike or YCC adjustment, particularly if upcoming wage data (due November 7) confirms robust growth.\nTechnical Analysis: Bullish Momentum Faces RSI Divergence\nTechnically, USD/JPY remains in a well-defined uptrend, holding firmly above both its 200-day moving average (148.60) and 50-day average (150.40). The breakout above 153.28 last week established a new structural base, now acting as key support. Resistance sits at 154.45, 154.80, 156.50, and 158.88, marking potential upside checkpoints should the pair sustain momentum.\nHowever, the RSI (14) shows mild bearish divergence\u2014prices are making new highs, while momentum is flattening around 68. This suggests potential exhaustion near the 154.00\u2013154.80 range. The MACD, nonetheless, maintains a bullish crossover signal, confirming sustained buying bias. A short-term retracement toward 153.00\u2013153.20 cannot be ruled out, where the uptrend line from October 2 provides a secondary accumulation zone for dip buye"

                "body": "USD/JPY Surges Toward 154.00 as Powell\u2019s Hawkish Tone Reignites Dollar Strength and Japan Faces Intervention Pressure\nThe USD/JPY pair extended its aggressive climb into November\u2019s first session, closing Friday near 154.00, its highest level since March, as U.S. yields surged following Jerome Powell\u2019s reaffirmation that rate cuts remain \u201cfar from guaranteed.\u201d The dollar\u2019s rally was intensified by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which delayed crucial labor market data, forcing traders to rely on private indicators such as ADP employment and ISM services PMI. These events have tightened volatility, pushing the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield back toward 4.75%, while the 2-year yield steadied near 4.98%, sustaining dollar momentum against the yen.\nU.S. Yield Rebound Anchors USD/JPY Bullish Trajectory\nCorrelation between USD/JPY and U.S. bond yields has strengthened sharply, with a rolling five-day coefficient peaking at 0.93\u2014one of the highest readings of the year\u2014demonstrating how the pair\u2019s movement has decoupled from equity risk sentiment and now mirrors Treasury performance almost tick-for-tick. The Nasdaq futures and VIX correlation have weakened, indicating that risk appetite is no longer driving yen weakness; instead, the yield advantage is dominating.\nFollowing Powell\u2019s FOMC remarks, traders reduced the odds of a December rate cut to below 25%, compared to nearly 60% two weeks prior. The Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative tightening is expected to slow by early December, when maturities from the Fed\u2019s holdings will be reinvested into short-term Treasuries, further anchoring front-end yields and sustaining pressure on the yen.\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s latest quarterly refunding projection, estimating $590 billion in Q4 borrowing, compounded concerns over debt supply, reinforcing yield elevation. With U.S. debt issuance focused on short-term maturities, yield spreads between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries narrowed to -24 basis points, further strengthening dollar appeal.\nJapan\u2019s Officials Step Up Verbal Defense as Yen Nears Intervention Zone\nAs USD/JPY trades above the 152.00 psychological threshold that triggered intervention in 2022, Tokyo\u2019s financial authorities are visibly uneasy. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama issued a warning that the yen\u2019s \u201cvery one-sided and rapid moves\u201d are being monitored with \u201ca high sense of urgency.\u201d This explicit language mirrors the rhetoric used just before Japan\u2019s prior intervention when the pair was near 151.95, suggesting that policymakers are now on alert.\nStill, Japan\u2019s 10-year JGB yield, capped by the Bank of Japan\u2019s 1.0% upper limit, leaves the central bank with little flexibility to counteract U.S. rate differentials. The widening yield gap\u2014now exceeding 380 basis points between U.S. 10-year Treasuries and Japanese JGBs\u2014continues to suppress yen demand.\nThe Tokyo CPI print for October, rising 2.9% year-over-year, adds pressure on the BOJ to consider policy normalization by December. Market consensus is shifting toward a potential rate hike or YCC adjustment, particularly if upcoming wage data (due November 7) confirms robust growth.\nTechnical Analysis: Bullish Momentum Faces RSI Divergence\nTechnically, USD/JPY remains in a well-defined uptrend, holding firmly above both its 200-day moving average (148.60) and 50-day average (150.40). The breakout above 153.28 last week established a new structural base, now acting as key support. Resistance sits at 154.45, 154.80, 156.50, and 158.88, marking potential upside checkpoints should the pair sustain momentum.\nHowever, the RSI (14) shows mild bearish divergence\u2014prices are making new highs, while momentum is flattening around 68. This suggests potential exhaustion near the 154.00\u2013154.80 range. The MACD, nonetheless, maintains a bullish crossover signal, confirming sustained buying bias. A short-term retracement toward 153.00\u2013153.20 cannot be ruled out, where the uptrend line from October 2 provides a secondary accumulation zone for dip buye"

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Sinks to 1.3097, UK Fiscal Gaps Hit Sterling After Market Close\nAfter Friday\u2019s close, GBP/USD extended its slide to a seven-month low, pressured by the Fed\u2019s tough stance on inflation, soaring U.S. yields | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Weekly Analysis: Pound Hits 1.3097 as Fiscal Strain and Fed Hawkishness Trigger Seven-Month Low\nThe British Pound ended Friday, November 1, sharply lower against the U.S. Dollar, closing near 1.3097, its weakest level since April. The decline capped a third consecutive weekly loss as investors favored the Greenback amid hawkish Federal Reserve remarks and deepening concerns over the United Kingdom\u2019s fiscal outlook. The pair traded within a 1.3090\u20131.3240 range, failing to hold above the 1.3200 handle as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) hovered near 99.80, its highest in three months. The backdrop reflected an uneasy combination of strong U.S. monetary policy, fragile UK fiscal positioning, and mounting skepticism ahead of the country\u2019s November budget.\nFed\u2019s Hawkish Stance Strengthens the Dollar and Caps Sterling Recovery\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting reignited dollar strength after Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that further rate cuts are \u201cnot guaranteed,\u201d despite the October reduction to the 3.75\u20134.00% range. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a December rate cut dropped to 63%, down from over 90% just a week earlier.\nSeveral Fed officials supported this restrictive tone. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack stated she would not have supported the October cut, insisting that \u201cmonetary conditions must remain tight to ensure inflation\u2019s return to target.\u201d Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed\u2019s Raphael Bostic acknowledged tension between price stability and employment but emphasized that \u201cpolicy cannot ease prematurely.\u201d\nThese statements lifted U.S. yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield holding above 4.42%, and drove the DXY toward the key 100.00 resistance. The strong dollar has now gained 2.1% month-to-date, marking its best performance since July. For GBP/USD, this created sustained downside pressure, as investors rotated into safer assets and shorted currencies exposed to fiscal and political risk.\nUK Fiscal Constraints and Political Pressure Weigh on Sterling\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) painted a grim outlook for Britain\u2019s finances ahead of the November budget. Productivity is expected to decline by 0.3%, while the budget deficit could widen by \u00a321 billion by 2030 if current spending trends persist. The IFS added that the government already faces a \u00a322 billion shortfall, leaving Chancellor Rachel Reeves minimal room for maneuver without breaking election pledges.\nMarket sentiment soured as fiscal tightening appeared unavoidable. Traders now expect either tax hikes or increased borrowing, both of which risk slowing growth further. Consumer confidence fell sharply, with GfK\u2019s October reading dropping to its weakest since December 2022, reinforcing fears of soft domestic demand. The UK GDP growth rate, last reported at 0.2% for Q3, shows little sign of acceleration, making it difficult for the Bank of England (BoE) to maintain parity with the Fed\u2019s restrictive stance.\nMarket Reaction: Sterling Breaks Key Support and Eyes 1.2950 Zone\nThe pound\u2019s failure to hold 1.3200 triggered algorithmic selling and a cascade of stops around 1.3145\u20131.3160, a level previously defended for two weeks. The sharp move lower to 1.3097 confirms a decisive breakdown, opening the path toward the 1.2950\u20131.2980 support area, a zone not tested since March.\nTechnical indicators remain bearish. The RSI (14) sits at 37, reflecting persistent downward momentum, while the MACD continues to widen below its signal line. The 50-day EMA, currently at 1.3270, has crossed below the 200-day EMA, signaling a bearish continuation pattern known as a death cross. If sustained, the next target aligns with 1.2880, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of "

The market capitalization stands at $2.18 trillion as the 24-hour trading volume has shrunk by 3.79% at $66.34 billion.\nHYPL stands at $43.11, with a day's decrease of 3.11%.

                "body": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Rebounds to $110,400 as BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF Anchors Market Stability\nBitcoin closed the week near $110,400, regaining footing after three consecutive sessions of heavy ETF outflows. The stabilization was largely attributed to BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which absorbed renewed inflows late Friday, helping offset broader selling pressure seen earlier in the week. According to institutional flow trackers, Bitcoin ETFs lost $191.6 million on Friday, following $488 million Thursday and $470 million Wednesday, totaling $1.15 billion in redemptions over three sessions \u2014 the steepest outflow streak since April.\nDespite these exits, IBIT\u2019s market share rose to 41% of total Bitcoin ETF assets as long-term investors treated the dip as an entry point. Analysts pointed to IBIT\u2019s consistent bid support as the key stabilizing force preventing BTC from breaching the $108,000 support zone.\nSolana ETFs Absorb Capital as Rotation Away from Bitcoin and Ethereum Accelerates\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs experienced redemptions, capital swiftly rotated into Solana-linked products. Data from SoSoValue confirmed $44.48 million in daily inflows into Solana ETFs on Friday, marking a fourth consecutive day of inflows and pushing total inflows to $199.2 million, with combined AUM surpassing $502 million.\nThe Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) led this surge, adding nearly $223 million in assets since launch and posting a 4.99% daily gain. Offering an estimated 7% staking yield, BSOL has quickly become the centerpiece of the current institutional rotation cycle. Grayscale\u2019s GSOL and Canary\u2019s Hedera (HBAR) and Litecoin (LTC) ETFs are also gaining traction, though their growth remains secondary to Bitwise\u2019s early dominance.\nIBIT\u2019s Role in Market Rebalancing and Institutional Confidence\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF, which has drawn over $28 billion in inflows since its January debut, remains the benchmark for institutional sentiment toward Bitcoin. Despite recent outflows, IBIT continues to record the lowest tracking error and strongest liquidity ratio among all crypto ETFs, reinforcing its credibility as Bitcoin\u2019s institutional gateway.\nThe temporary rotation into Solana does not signify a withdrawal from Bitcoin but rather a portfolio diversification move by major funds. With the Fed signaling slower tightening and liquidity injections exceeding $1.5 trillion globally, institutions are tactically allocating toward high-yield altcoin ETFs like BSOL while maintaining core exposure in IBIT.\nBitcoin Technicals: 200-Day EMA Cross Hints at $145,000 Target\nBitcoin\u2019s technical setup remains bullish. After climbing 12% from its October low of $98,200, BTC is now holding above the 200-day EMA, historically a key inflection level for multi-month rallies. The RSI sits at 63, showing moderate momentum, while on-chain accumulation by short-term holders signals renewed confidence.\nAnalysts project a potential move toward $130,000\u2013$145,000 by mid-2026, with support zones at $108,000 and $106,500. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF remains pivotal; if IBIT\u2019s inflows accelerate next week, Bitcoin could re-test $115,000 resistance before breaking higher.\nSolana Builds ETF Momentum, Eyes $300\u2013$500 Range\nAt $186.90, Solana (SOL-USD) continues to consolidate after an 18% weekly decline, but analysts view the correction as a healthy retracement following outsized inflows. CryptoPulse identified a bullish accumulation zone near $170, with potential breakout targets at $300\u2013$500, while DonaldsTrades forecasts a $600 target by 2026 contingent on ETF strength and market-wide liquidity recovery.\nThe debut of Bitwise\u2019s BSOL ETF and Hong Kong\u2019s first Solana ETF approval has broadened Solana\u2019s institutional reach, creating a secondary capital pipeline beyond U.S. markets. As Bitcoin stabilizes, yield-seeking funds are likely to maintain dual exposure \u2014 IBIT for stability, BSOL for yield growth.\nMarket Rotation Highlights a Structural Shift in Crypto Capital Flows\nThe simultaneous activit"

                "title": "Best Crypto Now for Long Term? Will MoonBull ($MOBU) Be the Breakout Star as XLM and WLFI Push Into DeFi - Digital Journal",
                "source": "Digital Journal",
                "url": "https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/news/indnewswire/best-crypto-long-term-will-1651916496.html",
                "body": "The hunt for the best crypto to buy for long term is on, and it's no longer just about market giants. Investors are now chasing tokens that blend staying power with smart mechanics and early-stage potential. Every bull cycle crowns a new leader, and this time, MoonBull looks ready to take the throne.\nWhile XLM (Stellar) continues building bridges for global payments and World Liberty Financial ($WLFI) pushes decentralized finance into traditional markets, MoonBull is turning conviction into community growth. Its presale isn't just raising funds; it's creating believers. By combining meme energy, Ethereum-grade security, and DeFi precision, MoonBull positions itself as the long-term play for investors who think beyond short-term flips.\nMoonBull's staking engine stands as a defining feature in its ecosystem and a core reason it's being hailed as the best crypto to buy for long term. At Stage 10, holders can access staking, earning daily rewards on their holdings while maintaining flexibility. Rewards remain locked for 2 months, allowing the ecosystem to maintain stability and reduce selling pressure. A 14.6 billion $MOBU allocation backs this pool, ensuring consistent payouts for dedicated participants. It's designed to turn time into yield, rewarding those who believe in the journey, not just the destination.\nEqually important is MoonBull's foundation: Ethereum. Deploying $MOBU on Ethereum grants instant access to DeFi protocols, wallets, and decentralized exchanges without bridges or external integrations. Ethereum's validator network, smart contract reliability, and liquidity infrastructure make it a secure and scalable home for MoonBull. This combination of security and accessibility strengthens its case as the best crypto to buy for long term investors seeking both growth and dependability.\nMoonBull's presale has reached Stage 5, priced at $0.00006584, with $500K+ raised and 1,700+ holders already on board. With a listing price set at $0.00616, Stage 5 investors stand to capture ROI. Those who entered during Stage 1 already enjoy returns, while the next stage brings an automatic 27.4% price increase.\nA $15,000 entry at current prices secures approximately 228 million $MOBU tokens, potentially worth around $1.4 million at listing. Each presale stage reduces available supply, tightening scarcity while fueling growth. Momentum here isn't hype, it's coded logic. Missing Stage 5 feels a lot like skipping Ethereum at $10. Once this presale cycle ends, early believers could be the ones setting the tone for 2025's biggest moves.\nStellar (XLM) continues to lead in financial interoperability. Its network powers near-instant, low-cost cross-border transactions while connecting traditional banks and fintechs to blockchain rails. The Stellar Development Foundation's mission remains clear, simplify global payments and increase access to underserved economies.\nIts recent introduction of Soroban smart contracts expanded Stellar's potential beyond simple transactions, opening the door for DeFi applications and cross-chain compatibility. XLM's stability makes it a solid hold for long-term investors, but MoonBull offers what Stellar can't, early-stage, high-reward scalability for those seeking compounding participation rather than corporate integration.\nWorld Liberty Financial (WLFI) is redefining decentralized wealth management. Its vision centers on tokenizing traditional financial products and making them accessible on-chain. By bridging retail and institutional finance, WLFI seeks to democratize asset ownership while providing secure, yield-bearing opportunities.\nRecent developments show WLFI collaborating with major financial firms to test decentralized credit and tokenized lending systems. These integrations highlight its long-term potential in reshaping how capital flows globally. While WLFI's ambitions target institutions, MoonBull focuses on empowering the retail crowd, giving every holder a direct stake in growth through reflections"

                "source": "CryptoSlate",

                "body": "How the Ethereum vs Solana war ended quietly not with a bang but a whimper\nBattle lines redrawn with Ethereum as a modular settlement layer and Solana as a unified execution layer.\nThe debate pitting Ethereum versus Solana as rival L1s misses how radically their architectures diverged in 2025. Ethereum evolved into a settlement layer for modular rollups, while Solana doubled down on monolithic throughput.\nEthereum abandoned the monolithic-chain race years ago, as its roadmap treats the base layer as settlement infrastructure. At the same time, execution occurs on layer-2 (L2) rollups that post state roots back to the mainnet.\nSolana made the opposite bet, with one unified ledger, sub-second slot times, and a proof-of-history pipeline that sequences transactions in a single global ledger.\nBoth paths deliver transactions that feel instant to users clicking \u201csend,\u201d but the security models diverge sharply once you ask what happens in the seconds, minutes, or days after that click.\nThe question builders face in 2026 isn\u2019t which chain runs faster in a vacuum; it\u2019s which one is more efficient in a practical application. It\u2019s about which model delivers lower friction for the application they want to build, and how much they\u2019re willing to pay, in terms of latency, complexity, or exit time, for the assurances each system provides.\nMonolithic speed versus modular finality\nSolana\u2019s architecture collapses inclusion, confirmation, and economic finality into a single 400-millisecond slot when the network runs smoothly.\nValidators vote on blocks using a proof-of-history clock that timestamps transactions before consensus, allowing the network to pipeline throughput without waiting for traditional BFT round-trips.\nUsers see confirmation streams after two-thirds of stake votes on the block, typically within half a second, and complete finality arrives around 12 seconds later.\nJakob Pov\u0161i\u010d, co-founder of Temporal, described the user-facing result in a note:\n\u201cFor most end users, a transaction is considered \u2018confirmed\u2019 once two-thirds of the network have voted on its block, which takes less than half a second.\u201d\nEthereum\u2019s modular design separates those steps. Rollups sequence transactions off-chain: Arbitrum produces blocks every 250 milliseconds, while Optimism produces blocks every two seconds. As a result, users see \u201csoft\u201d finality the moment the sequencer accepts the transaction.\nBut economic finality only arrives when the rollup posts its state root to L1 and the dispute or validity window closes.\nOptimistic rollups impose seven-day challenge periods before users can withdraw to mainnet, while ZK rollups compress that to 15 minutes or a few hours by submitting validity proofs.\nWill Papper, co-founder of Syndicate, argued the delay matters less than it appears. In a note, he added:\n\u201cMany instant bridges feel comfortable operating on non-finalized rollup states anyway. L2s deliver sub-second inclusion for apps that rarely bridge to L1, but applications requiring frequent mainnet settlement pay a time cost Solana avoids.\u201d\nWhat users actually feel\nThe architecture difference reshapes how each system handles congestion, fees, and failure. On Solana, the base fee remains fixed at 5,000 lamports per signature, roughly $0.0001, while priority fees allow users to bid for inclusion during traffic spikes.\nStake-weighted quality-of-service routes high-priority transactions from known validators faster, and local fee markets prevent single hot accounts from clogging the scheduler.\nMost retail transactions land under one cent. When the system fails, it fails globally: the Feb. 6, 2024, Solana halt lasted four hours and 46 minutes after a legacy loader bug forced validators to restart the cluster.\nL2 fees fluctuate with Ethereum\u2019s blob market. Still, the introduction of Dencun\u2019s blob in March 2024 and Pectra\u2019s capacity increases in May 2025 drove typical \u201csend\u201d transactions to single-digit cents on major rollups.\nThe failure modes differ: an L2 sequencer go"

                "body": "Solana Foundation manager Vibhu has stirred debate in the crypto industry by challenging Ripple executives to a live, data-based discussion on XRP\u2019s blockchain performance. His post on X invited XRP community members to join a \u201cfacts-only\u201d debate, urging participants to rely on verifiable on-chain metrics rather than speculation. The move reflects growing tension between advocates of Solana\u2019s expanding ecosystem and Ripple\u2019s supporters, who often emphasize long-term institutional growth.\nVibhu Questions XRP\u2019s Network Activity\nVibhu argued that many XRP supporters avoid discussing measurable on-chain trends. He said he respects Ripple\u2019s innovation but believes its community should face data showing minimal progress. According to metrics he cited, XRP Ledger\u2019s daily active accounts have hovered near 25,000 for about three years. \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t lie,\u201d Vibhu said, noting that XRP\u2019s network has not kept pace with market developments.\nHe contrasted this stagnation with Solana\u2019s rapid growth, reporting more than 2.5 million active accounts daily. Consequently, he pointed out that Solana\u2019s network processes far more real activity than XRP, highlighting a significant gap between both ecosystems. Vibhu stressed that low fees exist on both blockchains, so the disparity reflects user demand, not cost advantages.\nComparing Volumes and Ecosystem Growth\nBesides user counts, Vibhu compared transactional and payment data to demonstrate Solana\u2019s growing dominance. XRP Ledger reportedly handles 1 million to 1.5 million daily transactions, while Solana records roughly 100 million. Moreover, he noted that Solana\u2019s stablecoin transfer volume hit nearly $2 trillion in October, while XRP\u2019s monthly transfers remain between $50 billion and $60 billion.\nHowever, Ripple continues to expand its ecosystem through acquisitions and new initiatives. Its purchase of GTreasury and launch of Evernorth on Nasdaq show a push toward broader enterprise adoption. Additionally, Ripple\u2019s upcoming DeFi roadmap aims to increase tokenization and stablecoin activity on the XRP Ledger, signaling potential recovery in future usage metrics.\nLive Debate to Settle the Data Dispute\nVibhu invited Ripple executives to join a public debate where both sides present verifiable data. \u201cI\u2019ll bring facts,\u201d he said, emphasizing that the event should remain factual and transparent. Former Ripple Director of Developer Relations Matt Hamilton accepted the challenge, while community figure King Solomon offered to host the debate.\nThe upcoming discussion could reveal contrasting views on blockchain growth and user engagement, shaping how investors perceive Solana\u2019s and XRP\u2019s network strength in the evolving crypto landscape."

As participants eye critical technical levels, Solana\u2019s mix of strong fundamentals and key price defenses sets the stage for a potentially pivotal move ahead.\nSolana On-Chain Metrics Hit Record Highs\nSolana\u2019s latest data showcases exceptional growth on the fundamentals front. According to Messari and DeFiLlama, Solana\u2019s perpetual DEX volume surged 93% quarter-over-quarter to $1.6 billion, setting a new all-time high. Platforms like Jupiter ($726M), Drift ($466M), and Pacifica ($404M) dominated ativity, underlining how decentralized derivatives trading is thriving on Solana.\nSolana\u2019s on-chain activity reaches new records as perpetual DEX volumes surge 93% QoQ, signaling expanding DeFi dominance. Source: Solana via X\nSuch expansion reflects sustained network demand and liquidity depth. This consistent increase in usage and fee generation demonstrates that Solana\u2019s ecosystem continues to evolve beyond speculative cycles, laying the groundwork for more stable price appreciation as network participation scales further.\nTechnical Outlook: 200-Day SMA Holds as Critical Support\nAli Martinez highlights Solana\u2019s strong defense near the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a historically significant level for major trend shifts. Price action continues to respect this dynamic support, situated around $185 to $190, which has repeatedly acted as the pivot for prior rebounds.\nSolana maintains its bullish structure as price action defends the 200-day SMA near $185\u2013$190, a level often marking major trend reversals. Source: Ali Martinez via X\nStructurally, Solana price remains within an ascending parallel channel, with the next resistance levels near $240 and $300. A clean bounce from the current range could trigger another impulsive leg upward, reinforcing the broader bullish trend. Conversely, losing this 200D SMA would weaken mid-term momentum, making this a make-or-break level for Solana\u2019s trajectory.\nSolana Support Must Hold to Avoid Deeper Correction\nChart analysis shared by Crypto Million cautions that the market remains vulnerable if the $185 floor gives way. Solana price shows a series of lower highs and narrowing price action, indicating exhaustion in short-term momentum. If this zone fails to attract sufficient bids, the price could slide towards the $170 area, aligning with a 0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone and prior liquidity sweep regions.\nSolana trades within a crucial $185\u2013$170 support corridor, where a breakdown could confirm deeper correction or trigger a swift reversal. Source: Crypto Million via X\nThis SOL structure resembles a potential liquidity grab setup, either a short-term sweep before reversal or a breakdown confirming further weakness. Hence, $185 to $170 forms a critical technical corridor where market participants will decide the next dominant trend.\nSolana\u2019s Key Reversal Zone at $170\nSolana\u2019s $170 support area remains the key reversal zone to monitor. Price has repeatedly reacted strongly around this level, forming a well-defined accumulation zone. A revisit here could generate a classic double-bottom structure if buyers defend aggressively.\nSolana\u2019s $170 zone stands out as a key reversal area, where repeated rebounds hint at strong accumulation and potential double-bottom formation. Source: PikaCrypto via X\nThe overhead resistance remains between $210 to $220, where multiple rejections have occurred. For bullish continuation, the price must reclaim that resistance with strong volume confirmation. Until then, Solana\u2019s short-term bias remains neutral, but the $170 level serves as the most technically significant demand zone for traders anticipating a rebound.\nFinal Th"

As investors seek tangible value, Solana, a heavyweight in the realm of layer-1 blockchains, finds itself contending with increasing competition from practical tokens like Remittix. With the market pulsating with speculation, this article reveals the current intricacies impacting crypto investments, highlighting how Solana is weathering turbulent conditions while promising alternatives like Remittix (RTX) may change the investment landscape.\nThe ETF Dilemma for Solana\nSolana's price movements are intertwined with the uncertain fate of its much-anticipated exchange-traded fund (ETF). Currently, Solana is trading at $185.07, enjoying a 4.72% boost as excitement returns to the market. Yet, a cautious tone pervades the trading floor, as analysts stress the pivotal role of the SEC's regulatory timeline in guiding Solana's future. If the ETF ambitions stall or go unfulfilled, the threat of a dip towards the essential $150 support level looms large\u2014a healthy retreat that could, paradoxically, set the stage for future upticks.\nConsequences of ETF Uncertainties\nThe conversation surrounding Solana's ETF ambitions paints a vivid picture of potential institutional engagement, offering a more accessible route for funds that shy away from the complexities of direct crypto custody. On the flip side, any delays or refusals could force traders to revise their strategies. Thus, grasping the SEC's forthcoming decisions and their ripple effects on the broader crypto market is essential for anticipating possible paths forward.\nEnter Remittix: A Challenger with Purpose\nAs Solana grapples with ETF-related uncertainties, Remittix (RTX) shines as a formidable contender for the long-haul investor. Trading at $0.1166, Remittix specializes in facilitating seamless cross-border crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries, addressing a gap often overlooked in the crypto sector. With $27.7 million garnered from private fundraising and strong backing from institutional investors, faith in its breakthrough payment model is evidently on the rise.\nWhat Makes Remittix Shine\nWhat sets Remittix apart from the crowded crypto arena is its unwavering commitment to operational compliance and transparency. Verifiable by CertiK, this project has cemented its reputation as a standout in the realm of security-conscious crypto ventures. In an environment where DeFi demands practicality, investors are increasingly drawn to initiatives like Remittix that emphasize real-world utility and unwavering integrity.\nGauging Market Sentiment for Solana and Remittix\nDespite the overarching uncertainties linked to ETF approvals, Solana's trading volume reflects a robust market presence, boasting a market cap that exceeds $102 billion. This indicates a sustained interest in decentralized applications. In contrast, Remittix capitalizes on community engagement, inviting users to participate in wallet beta testing, which cultivates collaboration and bolsters investor confidence.\nCultivating Community with Remittix\nInvestors should pay close attention to community involvement as a crucial factor in their decision-making processes. Remittix\u2019s enticing referral program\u2014offering 15% rewards in USDT\u2014enhances its appeal to those hunting for promising low-cap crypto opportunities. This approach not only motivates user participation but integrates their feedback into the company\u2019s journey of growth.\nThe Shift in Crypto Payment Architecture\nBoth Solana and Remittix signify a pivotal transition within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, underscoring the rising demand for effective payment systems that harmoniously blend traditional finance with digital currency innovation. The future of PayFi hinges on developments that integrate fiat with cryptocurrency solutions, skillfully responding to user needs in a rapidly evolving fiscal atmosphere.\nThe Imperative of Regulatory Adherence\nAs Web3 initiatives and crypto enterprises navigate "

All three major U.S. indexes\u2014the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2014closed higher, reflecting a market atmosphere where hope and prudence intersected. This momentum, rooted in strong corporate earnings and a growing expectation of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, set the tone for what many believe could be a pivotal period for investors (CNN, STL.News).\nDespite persistent geopolitical tensions and mixed signals from economic data, investors appeared to focus on the positives. The S&P 500 climbed about 1.4% for the week, closing near record highs. The Nasdaq Composite, propelled by the technology sector, rose roughly 1.9%, while the Dow Jones advanced about 1.1%. Notably, the Russell 2000 index\u2014tracking small-cap stocks\u2014jumped 2.1%, hinting at a broadening of market participation beyond the dominant mega-cap names.\nRate Cut Anticipation Fuels Market Sentiment\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy has been a persistent undercurrent in market discussions. This week, the narrative shifted toward a probable rate cut, with futures markets nearly unanimous in predicting a quarter-point reduction at the Fed\u2019s next meeting. Bond yields reflected this shift: the 10-year Treasury yield settled near 4.2%, down from recent highs, and the spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries narrowed to around 20 basis points.\nSuch developments eased fears of a deep recession while suggesting a more supportive environment for equities. Inflation readings dipped below 3% on an annualized basis, giving policymakers greater flexibility and sparking a rotation into interest-sensitive sectors like real estate investment trusts (REITs) and utilities. Investors, keen to anticipate the Fed\u2019s next move, drove these sectors higher on the back of lower yield expectations.\nTechnology Sector Leads Earnings Season\nEarnings reports dominated headlines, with the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d technology firms\u2014Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla\u2014delivering results that surpassed analyst expectations. Apple, in particular, stood out. After reporting a blockbuster Q4, Apple\u2019s stock closed at $270.37, trading near the top of its 52-week range and above its 200-day moving average. Despite a minor dip of $1.03 (down 0.38%) at the close and a further $0.37 slide in after-hours trading, analysts remain bullish, with several major institutions raising price targets on the stock to as high as $325 (CNN).\nApple\u2019s quarterly revenue held steady at $94.04 billion, while net income came in at $23.43 billion, representing a slight decrease from previous quarters. The company\u2019s market capitalization soared above $4 trillion, reinforcing its status as a mega-cap powerhouse. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, and Argus have all reiterated their confidence in Apple\u2019s long-term prospects, citing innovative product launches and resilient global demand.\nElsewhere in tech, semiconductor firms and cloud computing giants posted robust earnings. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gained about 3%, underpinned by strong demand for AI chips and data center investments. This performance helped lift the Nasdaq and underscored the sector\u2019s central role in the ongoing market rally.\nSector Rotation and Broader Market Participation\nWhile technology continued to dominate, the week\u2019s gains were not limited to Silicon Valley.

                "body": "Stable inflation gives chancellor space to break doom loop\nIt might be the peak, or perhaps the mini-summit for the current bump in inflation.\nEconomists across the city suggest its downhill from here, after the inflation rate for September remained static at 3.8%, failing to breach the expected 4% mark.\nIn absolute terms inflation remains too high, higher than other similar countries, and too visible in the everyday items seen in the shops. Just under double the official target of 2% set for the Bank of England.\nBut the direction of travel matters significantly.\nEven if it should stay around this level for the rest of the year, some significant falls are on the way in the spring, as various regulated price rises last year drop out of the calculation.\nIt would be a much happier place if it were 2.5% in April.\nHowever, it is worth remembering that even as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pointed to the highest inflation in the G7 this year and next, it also said inflation would fall back to the 2% target by the end of next year.\nCrucially retail industry experts now assert food price inflation has also peaked, though prices remain at painful levels for many.\nThis lowers - though does not eliminate - the chances of self-fulfilling expectations of inflation in the way wages and prices are set. This is the critical factor for the setting of interest rates.\nMy immediate thought was the \"Santa\" rate cut from Andrew Bailey may be back on the table for December. But then I looked again at the information underlying some of last week's numbers from the IMF.\nBuried in the forecast is the suggestion of four rate cuts over the next year to take interest rates down to 3%. The only reason a cut is not expected next month, according to the IMF, is because it is too close to the Budget.\nAdvertisement\nA more benign inflation outlook suddenly makes that look less fanciful. The US Federal Reserve rate cuts are also in the background.\nThe markets seem to be reassessing their view here and around the world.\nThe effective interest rates on UK government debt fell sharply, regardless of whether those loans were for two or for 30 years. Ten-year rates fell to the lowest level this year, while two-year rates dropped to the lowest since last August.\nThis could save a few billion from the gap in the Budget calculations, at just the right time for the chancellor.\nEven more important, it shows the UK is not being treated as an outlier by the markets.\nThe chancellor went to some effort in her off-the-cuff UK sales pitch to worldwide investors in the US last week.\nBritain was, she said, the best place to invest and trade globally, that she was going to sort out Brexit-related economic problems and the UK had the fastest declining deficit in the G20.\nThe Budget is going to be a challenge, but catastrophic suggestions about British bankruptcy and bailouts seem quite spectacularly off the mark, assuming that is, that the government does have nearly 400 MPs for its agenda.\nNo one wants to be caught on the wrong side of the very real chance of a tech market crash, or unpredictable spike in the US-China trade war, or perhaps any unexpected innovations in the appointment of the new chair of the Federal Reserve in the US.\nThe inflation number and gilt rate falls offer the chance of some respite, for a break in the circle of doom.\nThe question is whether the tax measures Reeves needs to close even a smaller Budget gap, risk bringing it back through another door."

                "body": "EV prices edge up as demand increases\nThis month\u2019s data from The Independent EV Price Index has shown that median prices have increased as demand for electric cars picks up.\nSeptember was the biggest-ever month for EV registrations, with 72,779 new battery electric vehicles hitting the road, up 29.1 per cent on September 2024. Over the same period the EV Price Index shows that EVs have become far more affordable, with median prices down \u00a33,759 in September 2025 versus September 2024 \u2013 a drop of 7.7 per cent.\nOver the past year, a host of more affordable EVs have gone on sale, with choice increasing by 35 per cent when individual model derivatives are analysed.\nThe Independent EV Price Index analyses transaction prices of new electric cars, with manufacturer incentives and the government\u2019s new electric car grant taken into account. The index reflects real-world prices paid by consumers rather than just list prices.\nHowever, month-on-month data reveals that EV transaction prices have actually risen by 0.5 per cent or \u00a3207 from August to September as the new 75 registration plate brought buyers into showrooms.\nAdvertisement\nThe increase in transaction prices in September were led by the most popular segments: medium SUVs with transaction prices up \u00a31,426 month-on-month or 3.3 per cent, and small SUVs that rose \u00a3140 or 0.4 per cent.\nOther categories of electric cars all saw a further drop in transaction prices in September following drops in August. These ranged from family cars at \u00a3245 less (or one per cent) to prestige cars down \u00a3712 (or 1.1 per cent).\nAnalysing the EV Price Index data, The Independent\u2019s electric vehicles editor Steve Fowler said, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing organic demand for electric cars increasing, which means retailers aren\u2019t working quite as hard to seal the deal across the most popular segments.\n\u201cHowever, a median year-on-year price drop of \u00a33,759 shows just how much more affordable electric cars are becoming, and that\u2019s before you take into account running cost savings, especially if the owner is able to plug in at home and benefit from a low-rate energy tariff.\u201d\nThe Independent EV Price Index also highlights the car makers offering the biggest deals, with GWM offering incentives totalling 22.9 per cent, Cupra at 19.9 per cent and Vauxhall at 19.6 per cent. The standout deal of the month uncovered by the EV Price Index research was for Vauxhall Corsa 100kW Ultimate 50kWh, with savings of 36.1 per cent (\u00a311,570). That cuts the price to just \u00a321,480, or \u00a3261 a month on PCP.\n\u201cThe dynamics of supply and demand have a huge effect on the deals we\u2019re seeing via the EV Price Index,\u201d said Steve Fowler. \u201cAlthough there were more customers in retailers in September, there is still plenty of EV stock around in some sectors of the market and strong pressure from car makers to hit government targets for the sale of EVs, which means incentives are likely to remain high for the rest of the year.\u201d"

The ECB\u2019s decision to pause rate hikes reassured some investors, but most sectors struggled: the Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.4%, led by bigger drops in tech and oil and gas stocks (both down 0.9%), as well as notable losses in retail, banks, and food companies. Insurer Scor SE lost over 7% despite posting profits, as analysts flagged risks if disaster claims rise. Meanwhile, eurozone inflation edged down to 2.1% for October, and German 10-year yields approached 2.65%, fueled by changing interest rate expectations. Brent crude eased 0.5% to $64.08 per barrel, adding pressure to energy shares. Still, Europe\u2019s volatility index dipped 1.3%, suggesting investors expect calmer days ahead, at least for now.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Sector headwinds keep investors cautious.\nWith losses spread across oil, tech, and banking stocks, European markets are reflecting widespread investor caution about the region\u2019s economic outlook and where interest rates might go next. While softer inflation buys the ECB some breathing room, uncertainty across sectors keeps confidence in check. Meanwhile, rising US futures show that investors may be feeling more optimistic elsewhere \u2013 underscoring a growing divide between Europe and Wall Street\u2019s outlooks.\nThe bigger picture: European resilience faces a test.\nThe ECB\u2019s decision to hold rates and cooling inflation should, in theory, support growth, but broad declines in key sectors are casting a shadow over the continent\u2019s economic rebound. Climbing bond yields and sliding stocks highlight the need for policy makers and investors to adjust to a slower-growth environment. Europe\u2019s response now could ripple through global markets and influence how investors allocate capital in the months ahead.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

Meanwhile, Treasury yields painted a mixed picture: the 10-year yield held steady around 4.1%, but the 2-year dipped to 3.6%. The Fed\u2019s latest signals make a December rate cut look unlikely unless inflation makes a convincing move lower, keeping markets in a holding pattern while officials weigh the data with extra caution.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Tech holds steady while caution lingers.\nAmazon\u2019s results gave tech stocks a boost, showing how the sector can power ahead even with so much uncertainty. Still, the broader market\u2019s sideways action signals investors aren\u2019t feeling fully confident, watching mixed earnings and the Fed\u2019s wavering outlook closely. Investors are growing choosier, favoring companies and sectors that can weather shifting economic winds as the central bank keeps rate policy up in the air.\nThe bigger picture: Uncertain policy shapes global strategy.\nWith Fed officials holding off on clear signals, inflation nowhere near target, and only murky clues from economic data, everyone from business leaders to global investors is recalculating. The timeline for interest rate changes is far from clear, which could sway economic decisions well into next year.

                "body": "Amarin Corporation plc (NASDAQ:AMRN) Released Earnings Last Week And Analysts Lifted Their Price Target To US$11.33\nAmarin Corporation plc (NASDAQ:AMRN) investors will be delighted, with the company turning in some strong numbers with its latest results. Revenues were better than expected, with US$50m in revenue some 15% ahead of forecasts. The company still lost US$0.40 per share, although the losses were marginally smaller than the analysts expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\nTaking into account the latest results, the three analysts covering Amarin provided consensus estimates of US$182.8m revenue in 2026, which would reflect a considerable 19% decline over the past 12 months. Losses are predicted to fall substantially, shrinking 96% to US$0.18. Before this earnings announcement, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$174.4m and losses of US$0.16 per share in 2026. So it's pretty clear the analysts have mixed opinions on Amarin even after this update; although they upped their revenue numbers, it came at the cost of a considerable increase in per-share losses.\nSee our latest analysis for Amarin\nThe average price target rose 6.2% to US$11.33, even thoughthe analysts have been updating their forecasts to show higher revenues and higher forecast losses. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Amarin at US$12.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$10.00. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We would also point out that the forecast 16% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2026 is better than the historical trend, which saw revenues shrink 24% annually over the past five years By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 22% per year. So while a broad number of companies are forecast to grow, unfortunately Amarin is expected to see its revenue affected worse than other companies in the industry."

                "body": "L.A.\u2019s best sushi restaurant relocates with a star bartender and a new menu format\n- Share via\nThe Elysian is a mod apartment building originally designed in the 1960s by architect William Pereira. The original LACMA campus also numbered among Pereira\u2019s projects, as did my favorite skyscraper on the planet, the TransAmerica Building in San Francisco. This one sits on a hill, overlooking Sunset Boulevard, in Victor Heights, the small neighborhood abutting Elysian Park and bordering Echo Park and Chinatown.\nI timed my drive to a lull in traffic after the start of a Dodgers game this week to visit the Elysian\u2019s new ground-floor tenant, Morihiro, and a couple major shifts the relocation brings: a walk-in cocktail bar and an a la carte component to the menu.\nA new era for L.A.\u2019s best sushi restaurant\nTo sushi wonks, Morihiro \u201cMori\u201d Onodera needs no introduction. He arrived in Los Angeles 40 years ago this year, after training in sushi bars for a couple of years in Tokyo. Working at seminal L.A. sushi ground-breakers like Matsuhisa and Katsu, and running Mori Sushi in West Los Angeles for 11 years beginning in 2000, he\u2019s been a guiding hand in defining how Angelenos perceive and enjoy omakase.\nAfter a break from restaurant ownership, he returned with tiny Morihiro in Atwater Village in November 2020. Columnist Jenn Harris and I ranked it No. 6 on the current edition of the 101 Best Restaurants in Los Angeles guide.\nOnodera has never been afraid of change. Which may be why neither Harris nor I were overly surprised at first when we heard the news sitting together at Onodera\u2019s Atwater omakase counter at the end of August (yes, researching our next edition of the 101 guide, arriving in early December). His hands forming nigiri in a finger ballet, he slipped into casual conversation that he was moving the restaurant. Our eyebrows shot up. Then he smiled mysteriously.\n\u201cWe will have a bar,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bringing on Han Suk Cho.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, you stole Han from Kato?!\u201d I shouted reflexively. His staff burst out laughing.\nMorihiro\u2019s star bartender\nOf course, Onodera didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d Cho. But it hit me as a shake-up. I\u2019ve written about how Cho and Kato\u2019s bar director Austin Hennelly are the city\u2019s most dynamic cocktail duo. Their spirit-forward versions of a Bee\u2019s Knees or milk punch flowed into the Taiwanese flavors of Jon Yao\u2019s cuisine, and the textures and sharpness of the non-alcoholic drinks they fine-tuned are, it isn\u2019t hyperbole to say, some of the world\u2019s most cutting-edge examples of the genre.\nThe Elysian era settles Morihiro into a sleek room with neutral-colored walls, spare decor and an outdoor space with a lovely stone garden that\u2019s still a work in progress. Cho is the first person I see, standing at the near end of a long curving black bar. Onodera stands farther down, in the room\u2019s center, forming nigiri for three people dining omakase.\n\u201cI worked at Kato for 3 \u00bd years, a long time in one restaurant,\u201d Cho says to me later in a phone interview. \u201cI learned so much about the craft there, and Austin has been a very good shield for me. I could always bounce ideas off of him. But I had to go to really see how much I\u2019ve grown.\u201d\nBefore Kato, Cho focused on NA beverage pairing programs at top-tier restaurants. Last decade she worked briefly at Providence, and then at SingleThread in Sonoma, the luxury restaurant-inn-farm run by chef Kyle Connaughton and farmer Katina Connaughton that merges culinary notions of Japan and California, and then back down the coast at Dave Beran\u2019s now-closed Dialogue in Santa Monica.\nIn her position as bar director at Morihiro, she\u2019s starting out by concentrating on simplicity \u2014 less on distilling the season\u2019s jeweled fruits into complex liquid equations and more on figuring out the exact right mixture of three or four elements, in the best proportions, for a distinctive drink.\n\u201cMori\u2019s Martini,\u201d for instance, combines a California-Japanese mashup of St. George Botanivore, gin made in the Bay Area, with Bermutto"

If he can't go, the team's primary backup nickel has been veteran Cam Lewis.\nThe Bills are already down multiple defensive players for Sunday's big matchup (4:25 p.m. ET, CBS) as they try to slow down Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, including both starting defensive tackles. Ed Oliver (left biceps) is out indefinitely, while DaQuan Jones (left calf) has been ruled out of what will be his third straight game missed.\nBuffalo will also be without linebacker Shaq Thompson (hamstring), who has played an important role this season. Coach Sean McDermott said that Thompson's injury was lingering and resurfaced at practice. On the offensive side, wide receiver Joshua Palmer (knee/ankle) has also been ruled out.\nThe good news for the linebacker room is that starters Terrel Bernard (ankle) and Matt Milano (pectoral) were both full participants at practice all week and have no injury designation for the game. Kicker Matt Prater (right calf) also doesn't carry an injury designation and is set to play after being limited in practice all week.\nThe other injury update for Buffalo on Friday is that starting safety Taylor Rapp is likely out for the rest of the season after he was placed on injured reserve last week with a knee injury that stemmed from training camp. McDermott didn't want to say definitively that he's done for the year, but that it is likely headed that way.\n\"[Rapp] just had the surgery. He had surgery two days ago or a day ago,\" McDermott said. \"So, at this point it's probably, I'm not a doctor, but from what I'm hearing it's probably not until next year at this point.\"\nVeteran Jordan Poyer primarily took starting snaps in Rapp's place last week with rookie Jordan Hancock coming in on some third downs."
