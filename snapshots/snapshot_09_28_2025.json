                "body": "Key Facts\n- Gold at Record Highs: Gold prices surged to an all-time high of around $3,790 per ounce during the week, settling near $3,778 by Friday. December gold futures closed above $3,800 [1] [2]. The yellow metal gained roughly 2.5% on the week, driven by safe-haven demand and expectations of further U.S. interest rate cuts [3] [4].\n- Silver Outperforms: Silver spiked to about $46.41/oz \u2013 its highest in over 14 years (since 2011) \u2013 after a 2.6% jump on Friday [5]. The metal is up ~55% year-to-date, outpacing gold\u2019s gains [6]. Investors are flocking to silver as a more affordable alternative amid gold\u2019s high price [7], and analysts see potential for new highs as industrial demand (e.g. solar energy) stays strong.\n- Platinum & Palladium Climb: Platinum rallied to $1,568/oz, a 12-year high [8], on growing supply deficits and safe-haven interest. It has leapt ~50% in just a few months, breaking out of a long stagnation. Palladium also rose ~3% this week to about $1,285/oz [9], buoyed by worries over Russian supply and mine disruptions. Both platinum and palladium are benefitting from supply tightness \u2013 the Platinum Institute projects an 850,000 oz platinum deficit in 2025 [10] \u2013 and investor rotation into these undervalued precious metals.\n- Fed Easing & Inflation Data: The U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s dovish tilt is a key catalyst. A quarter-point rate cut in mid-September, followed by inflation data (PCE +2.7% YoY in August) in line with expectations, reinforced bets on more easing [11]. Traders now predict an ~88% chance of another Fed rate cut in October [12]. Lower rates and a weaker dollar typically boost precious metals, which have \u201csafe-haven appeal in a low interest-rate environment\u201d [13].\n- Geopolitical Boost: Ongoing global uncertainties are lifting safe-haven demand. Geopolitical tensions \u2013 from NATO warning Russia over airspace incursions [14] to Middle East conflicts \u2013 have investors seeking refuge in gold. Additionally, trade conflicts persist: U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on imported drugs, trucks, and furniture (effective Oct. 1) [15], underscoring economic uncertainty. These factors are driving risk-averse inflows into precious metals.\n- Analyst & Industry Insight: Market strategists say gold\u2019s meteoric rise is underpinned by risk aversion and currency doubts. \u201cPeople want an alternative to fiat money\u2026 particularly the dollar,\u201d notes GraniteShares\u2019 Will Rhind, adding that gold\u2019s appeal as an uncorrelated asset \u201cgrows by the month\u201d [16]. Meanwhile, ETF inflows and hedge fund buying are robust \u2013 Commerzbank reports strong demand from gold ETFs amid rate-cut expectations and political concerns [17]. Central banks continue to be major gold buyers as well, diversifying reserves away from the U.S. dollar [18] [19].\n- Mining & Corporate Moves: The rally is lifting mining stocks and prompting industry shifts. China\u2019s Zijin Mining saw its market value top $100 billion during the run-up [20] and is proceeding with a major Hong Kong IPO for its international gold unit [21]. Major producers are capitalizing on high prices to streamline portfolios \u2013 e.g. Newmont sold off a non-core Canadian project to focus on top-tier mines [22] \u2013 and record profits are bolstering balance sheets. In supply news, Freeport-McMoRan\u2019s Grasberg mine in Indonesia halted operations after a September mudflow accident; a force majeure has curbed one of the world\u2019s largest gold and copper sources [23], adding to supply concerns.\n- Bullish Outlook (with Caution): Many experts believe the precious metals upswing isn\u2019t over. Some forecasts see gold reaching $4,000/oz by year-end if current trends persist [24], and silver potentially challenging its 2011 record near $50. Citigroup strategists note this bull market could even broaden to other metals like copper as easy money and debt worries persist [25]. However, rapid gains have stretched the market \u2013 a healthy pullback is possible. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty shocked if we got up to $4,000 and did"

Despite Russia, the world\u2019s second-largest oil producer, joining OPEC+, the group still falls short by more than 500,000 barrels per day. The so-called oil glut has not materialized, with prices remaining below $70 a barrel, despite OPEC+\u2019s inability to increase output.\nAmong OPEC members, only Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi have the capacity to boost production, but no additional barrels have been added. This raises concerns about keeping the oil market tight. If these two countries have spare capacity, why aren\u2019t they producing more? Could this be an attempt to keep oil prices firm in the hope of further price increases per barrel? Has the world reached its limit on oil production? If so, why are oil prices still under $70 in international markets? Since April 2023, following an agreement to cut output and support prices, OPEC+ has gradually increased production. There still appears to be around 3.5 million barrels per day of spare capacity, mainly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. However, this idle capacity remains unused, likely to maintain price stability and prevent further declines. However, when will OPEC+ ask its members, mainly Iraq and Kazakhstan, to increase oil supply to the market, or will they wait for a stronger, more sustained rise in oil prices? Another consideration is whether the organization will wait for clearer signs of a tightening oil market before agreeing to push more volumes into the market, aiming to avoid further price weakness.\nOPEC+ seeks to maintain order in the oil markets under its umbrella, ideally with full participation and commitment from all members in line with its agreements and responsibilities to the international oil market. OPEC+ plans to increase production starting next month, October, by adding an additional 137,000 barrels per day. However, oil analysts doubt that the full volume will reach the market, estimating the actual increase closer to 80,000 barrels per day, as the group is likely to fall short of the agreed target of 137,000 barrels.\nThe main concern is whether OPEC+ will have spare oil capacity exceeding 2.5 million barrels per day by next year. The question is whether oil producers will choose to increase production in search of more oil or hold back to keep the market uncertain and firm up prices. The American experience is notable, as the U.S. has quietly ramped up crude oil production to nearly 13.6 million barrels per day, making it the world\u2019s top producer. This aggressive output aims to protect their oil market, maintain energy independence, and reduce imports. However, this goal remains unmet, as U.S. crude oil demand exceeds 20 million barrels per day, while production is around 13.5 million barrels per day. This leaves a gap of about 6 to 7 million barrels per day that must be imported from various parts of the world. Although the U.S. market is not the most lucrative for producers, it offers some of the lowest prices compared to global markets. As the largest consumer, the U.S. still represents an important outlet for oil sales, especially when other markets may be limited. The question is whether OPEC can add more crude oil to the market. Perhaps it can and will. The main issue is whether the netback, or the selling price, is attractive enough to sell to the U.S., or if the U.S. market is used as a last-resort outlet, accepting lower income but still generating some cash in the absence of more rewarding markets. The U.S. oil market is massive, and it is worth being a player in such a large outlet, if only for the record, despite prices being $4\u2013$5 per barrel lower than other crude benchmarks.

In previous studies, most research has been conducted using standard small size (\u03c625 \u00d7 50 mm) shale cores, which are dense and oil-poor, differing from real reservoir conditions. In order to deeply investigate the CO2 HnP characteristics, a series of large-diameter core (\u03c6100 \u00d7 200 mm) experiments were conducted with recombined live oil under simulated reservoir conditions (69 \u00b0C, 19 MPa), and the CO2 HnP performance was analyzed under various parameters. Meanwhile, gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) was used to analyze the characteristics of oil and gas production and the short-term CO2 sequestration potential was also assessed. The results showed that increasing injection pressure from 17 to 24 MPa enhanced oil recovery from 2.81% to 5.72%, with diminishing returns. The gas/oil ratio (GOR) remained relatively stable, while the oil recovery efficiency peaked and then declined with higher CO2 injection volumes. The produced oil tended to become lighter. Lower production pressures and longer soaking times improved recovery and CO2 storage efficiency but gains diminished over time. After six cycles, total recovery reached 25.40%, but per-cycle recovery decreased, GOR and gas production increased, and the CO2 injection volume rose, reducing the overall efficiency. Under the experimental conditions, the optimal CO2 HnP and short-term CO2 storage efficiency were achieved with an injection pressure of 22 MPa, a production pressure of 12 MPa, a soaking time of 16 h, and 3 cycles of HnP. This study provides further support for developing accurate and efficient shale oil development strategies for the target reservoir.\nCited By\nThis article has not yet been cited by other publications.\nArticle Views\nAltmetric\nCitations\nArticle Views are the COUNTER-compliant sum of full text article downloads since November 2008 (both PDF and HTML) across all institutions and individuals.

Iraq's oil ministry announced the resumption, which began at 6 a.m. local time, signaling a breakthrough in a long-standing deadlock.\nThe agreement, involving Iraq's federal and Kurdish regional governments along with foreign oil producers, enables a daily flow of up to 190,000 barrels to Turkey's Ceyhan port. This move comes amid U.S. pressure for the restart, aiming to contribute to the global oil market as OPEC+ increases output.\nIraq's exports are set to rise, staying within OPEC quotas, amid efforts to settle outstanding debts with oil companies operating in Kurdistan. The Kurdish region's commitment to deliver a significant daily crude quota underscores an attempt to stabilize and boost Iraq's oil production and exports.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\n{{#Source}}{{Source}}{{/Source}}{{#IsBlog}}\n{{Disclaimer}}\n{{/Disclaimer}}"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - EURO to Dollar Struggles at 1.1700 as U.S. Growth Tops 3.8% and Fed Cut Bets Dominate\nThe pair bounced from 1.1650 but remains capped by dollar strength, with support at 1.1600 and resistance at 1.1750. Markets price 88% odds of an October Fed cut, while Eurozone PMI stagnates at 51.2, underscoring diverging growth paths | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Consolidates at 1.1700 as Dollar Strength Reasserts\nThe EUR/USD pair closed the week near 1.1700, rebounding after dipping toward 1.1650 earlier in the session. The euro regained some ground following U.S. inflation data that matched expectations, with Core PCE rising 0.2% month-over-month and 2.9% year-over-year in August. Headline PCE came in at 2.7% annually, reinforcing market conviction that the Federal Reserve will proceed with rate cuts into year-end. Futures markets now price an 88% probability of an October cut and 65% odds of another in December, providing short-term support for the shared currency. However, the rebound is capped by the dollar\u2019s resilience, driven by stronger U.S. growth metrics, including revised Q2 GDP at 3.8% and durable goods orders rising 2.9% in August, alongside jobless claims falling to 218,000.\nDivergence Between U.S. and Eurozone Data Shapes Momentum\nThe macroeconomic backdrop continues to favor the U.S. dollar, with the eurozone showing weaker relative performance. Eurozone PMI data revealed contraction in manufacturing, offset only slightly by expansion in services, leaving the composite PMI at 51.2. Meanwhile, German retail sales and unemployment figures due next week will be critical for direction, especially as inflation risks remain sticky. ECB surveys show households expect 2.8% inflation in one year and 2.2% over five years, reflecting lingering uncertainty that could restrain euro upside. Political and trade frictions, including ongoing tariff announcements by Washington, further cloud sentiment, particularly as U.S. fiscal policy remains stimulative through higher government spending and tax cuts.\nMarket Sentiment Split as Inflation Expectations Diverge\nThe University of Michigan sentiment index dropped to 55.1 in September from 58.2 in August, a steep fall from last year\u2019s 70.3. The breakdown shows wealthier households with significant equity exposure reporting optimism, while lower-income consumers turned increasingly negative under the weight of tariffs and price stickiness. Short-term inflation expectations eased marginally to 4.7% from 4.8%, while long-term expectations ticked higher to 3.7% from 3.5%. This divergence keeps the Fed cautious, balancing the need to ease against the risk of reigniting inflation. For the EUR/USD, this means that while rate cut bets buoy demand for euros in the short term, structural dollar strength anchored in higher growth and fiscal spending continues to limit upside.\nRead More\n-\nTLT ETF Price Analysis: NYSEARCA:TLT Struggles at $88.90 as Yields Stay Elevated\n27.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Drive BTC-USD Price Above $109K as Fidelity Dumps $300M and Vanguard Signals Crypto Pivot\n27.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Futures Price (NG=F) Hover at $3.20 as AECO Prices Crash Below Zero and Storage Swells Toward 3.8 Tcf\n27.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar-Yen Tests 150.00 as Payrolls and Fed Bets Drive Momentum\n27.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Landscape Points to Critical Levels in EUR/USD\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains pinned near the 1.1700 threshold, a pivotal zone that has repeatedly capped rallies. A sustained close above 1.1750 could open the path toward 1.1800 and eventually 1.1920, the September peak. On the downside, immediate support rests at 1.1650, followed by 1.1600 and the 100-day SMA near 1.1588. A breakdown below 1.1588 would expose the pair to deeper losses toward 1.1400 and even the 200-day SMA near 1.1150. Momentum indicators remain mixed: RSI signals bearish bia"

Check our detailed guide-\nThe Fed Chair Powell emphasized the need for a balanced approach to rate cuts, warning against the risks of reigniting inflation. While the comments didn\u2019t trigger an immediate reaction, the dollar found strength during midweek as markets reassessed the Fed\u2019s easing pace. The move was further reinforced by the better-than-expected US GDP for Q2, revised higher to 3.8% year-over-year. Durable goods orders surged to 2.9% in August, while jobless claims fell 14k, all underscoring the US economic resilience. Friday\u2019s Core PCE inflation met the forecast at 2.9% y/y, providing no surprise to the markets but keeping intact the Fed\u2019s cautious rhetoric.\nFrom the Eurozone, the PMI figures revealed a mixed scenario, as the manufacturing sector contracted in September, slightly offset by growth in the services sector, leaving the composite PMI at 51.2. A modest expansion could do little to lift the euro, especially in the backdrop of a stronger dollar.\nEUR/USD Key Events Next Week\nLooking ahead, the focus remains on the data with the following major events:\n- Germany Retail Sales (Tuesday)\n- HICP Inflation y/y (Tuesday)\n- Germany Unemployment\n- Chicago PMI (Tuesday)\n- JOLTs Job Opening (Tuesday)\n- US ADP Employment Change (Wednesday)\n- US Jobless Claims (Thursday)\n- US NFP (Friday)\nThe primary focus will remain on the US labor market, as the Fed remains concerned about safeguarding it from further softening. Meanwhile, German data is also key to watch as the Eurozone\u2019s growth concerns are mounting. Moreover, central bank speeches may further provide impetus to the market.\nWith the dollar in firm control and data risks skewed toward US outperformance, EUR/USD may struggle to regain momentum in the near term. The euro\u2019s fate this week will hinge on whether inflation and employment data on both sides of the Atlantic can shift the policy narrative.\nEUR/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Lacking Direction at 1.1700\nThe EUR/USD daily chart shows a broken rising channel, with price moving below the 20-day MA. Although a mild recovery was seen from multi-week lows by the 50-day MA, the euro is still not out of the woods. The next significant support emerges at a swing low and 100-day MA near 1.1575.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about ECN brokers?

On the other hand, the price could rise above 1.1700, reaching 1.1800 and potentially surpassing yearly highs of 1.1920, with an ultimate target of 1.2000.\nLooking to trade forex now?

Payrolls on Friday will be the key event, with any clean signal on jobs growth and unemployment likely to dictate the next move in the pair.\nFed rate cut pricing driving the bus\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY remains heavily dictated by expectations for Federal Reserve policy, with rate cut pricing continuing to dominate as the key driver. The correlation between the pair and the shape of Fed funds futures out to September 2026 sits at an extraordinary -0.94, underscoring how tightly the yen is tracking the ebb and flow of U.S. policy expectations. While short-dated U.S. Treasury yields also retain a powerful influence, other traditional drivers such as yield differentials, risk appetite and U.S. equity market volatility have been far less significant. For now, the focus remains squarely on what could shift the outlook for U.S. rates.\nPayrolls tops event risk\nSource: LSEG (U.S. ET shown)\nIn the week ahead, the September nonfarm payrolls report on Friday looms as the single most important release. While the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday is arguably a better gauge given it avoids the heavy downward revisions that frequently plague the official data, it is payrolls that carry the greater weight for the Fed. The central bank\u2019s unusual emphasis on headline jobs growth over the unemployment rate means Friday\u2019s figures will likely be decisive for USD/JPY price action. The most influential outcome would be if both the payrolls and unemployment rate send the same signal. A soft print would likely fuel expectations for deeper cuts, weighing on USD/JPY, while a strong showing could see cut pricing pared back and the pair push higher.\nRecent surprises in U.S. economic data have generally tilted to the upside, including income and spending figures released last Friday, so a weak payrolls number would cut against the prevailing trend. Still, traders will be alert to the possibility of a downside miss given recent trends. Ahead of the main event, Tuesday\u2019s JOLTs survey, Wednesday\u2019s ISM manufacturing and ADP reports, Thursday\u2019s jobless claims and Friday\u2019s ISM services print all have potential to stir volatility, though their impact is expected to be secondary to the payrolls report.\nSource: LSEG (U.S. ET shown)\nFor Japan, domestic factors remain very much in the background. Comments from BOJ officials may influence if they diverge from the prevailing message that gradual rate hikes will proceed if the bank\u2019s forecasts prove accurate, but otherwise the yen is likely to take its cues from the U.S. side. Friday\u2019s Tokyo CPI undershot suggests upside inflation risks may be easing, allowing policymakers scope to observe incoming data before tightening again. Even so, with two board members dissenting in favour of a hike at the September meeting, the release of the summary of opinions could still generate market interest.\nUltimately, the path of least resistance for USD/JPY will be determined by the U.S. labour market. Until the September payrolls report lands, traders may be cautious to chase the pair aggressively in either direction. Any strong Fed commentary following Friday\u2019s release could be the final word on where USD/JPY heads next.\nUSD/JPY technical analysis\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY has finally broken out of the sideways range it had been stuck in since the July payrolls report, surging above the 200DMA on Wednesday before pushing through resistance at 149.00 on Thursday. That former barrier may now switch to support, offering a potential base for longs targeting a retest of resistance at 151.00 or even 152.40. The pair held the break on Friday but was unable "

Hence, in case of deeper decline, strong support should emerge above 0.5506 to contain downside to bring reversal.

Investors are keeping a close eye on a double bottom formation forming and, if accurate, could send a stampede to $0.42 in the near term, with some projecting a run to the $0.60\u2013$0.70 range in mid-to-late 2025.\nMarket sentiment is also becoming increasingly positive, reflected by a Greed reading of 72 and greater whale accumulation at the $0.22\u2013$0.24 levels, setting a price floor. Despite institutional profit-taking danger, sustained closes above pivotal levels of resistance can potentially have DOGE approaching $0.50\u2013$0.60, with the current trading at around $0.24 being a 10.42% day gain. Meanwhile, interest in MUTM continues to rise.\nMutuum Finance presale has reached a new level with more than 16,600 investors and more than $16.4 million to date.

As a token of time, the project has included an early bird $100,000 giveaway, with 10 rewards of $10,000 MUTM.\nMutuum Finance, in keeping with its promise of privacy, will launch a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Differing from depegging algorithmic stablecoins that will lose their peg in a bear market, the stablecoin will be non-algorithmic and overcollateralized with the hope of being stable even in bad times.\nMutuum Finance intends to extend the frontiers of decentralized finance.

Other defensive features in the form of fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are also offered by the platform to offer good, accurate pricing data in an extremely volatile market.\nThe strategy taps into underutilized collateral reserves to offer secured and safe long-term value, rendering the stablecoin a sanctuary of security and sound store of value. This renders Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the safest and most revolutionary projects in the present DeFi ecosystem.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining strong momentum while Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to hold the $0.23 support line. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035 and are over 50% sold out, with the following stage being priced at $0.04. Mutuum Finance has raised $16.4 million from 16,600+ investors, which shows high demand.

                "body": "USD/JPY soared to an eight-week high as expectations of a Bank of Japan rate hike faded alongside reduced bets on multiple Fed rate cuts. Shifting monetary policy outlooks widened the US-Japan interest rate differential, lifting the US dollar.\nUSD/JPY rallied 1.07% to close at 149.472 in the week ending September 26. A mixed start to the week saw the pair drop to a low of 147.461 before surging to a high of 149.957.\nStronger-than-expected US GDP and labor market data and easing Tokyo inflation extended the pair\u2019s winning streak to five weeks.\nThis week, Japan\u2019s retail sales, Tankan surveys, consumer confidence, and labor market data could drive yen trends. However, the Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions and Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s speech could be pivotal after last week\u2019s inflation data.\nOn Tuesday, September 30, Japanese retail sales could fuel speculation about an October BoJ rate hike. Economists forecast retail sales to rise 1% month-on-month in August after sliding 1.6% in July.\nA sharper increase could support demand-driven inflation and a more hawkish BoJ policy stance, lifting demand for the yen. However, an unexpected fall in retail sales may signal cooling inflation, weakening the case for a rate hike.\nThe BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions, also due on Tuesday, will draw scrutiny after two board members dissented from keeping rates at 0.5% in September.\nEvidence of broader support for tightening could boost bets on an October move, while a consensus to delay would weigh.\nOn Wednesday, October 1, the BoJ\u2019s Tankan Surveys for the third quarter will take center stage. Economists forecast the Tankan Large Manufacturers Index to increase from 13 in Q2 to 15 in Q3.\nA higher reading could ease concerns about US tariffs impacting demand, supporting a more hawkish BoJ policy stance. On the other hand, a lower print may temper rate hike expectations.\nThe BoJ has discussed the need to assess the effect of US tariffs on the Japanese economy before considering a monetary policy adjustment.\nOn Thursday, October 2, economists expect Japan\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index to rise to 35.2 in September, up from 34.9 in August. Improved sentiment could signal stronger spending and inflationary pressures. Conversely, a lower print may curb spending, supporting a less hawkish BoJ rate path.\nOn Friday, October 3, unemployment data may also influence the BoJ\u2019s policy stance and demand for the yen. Economists forecast unemployment to rise from 2.3% in July to 2.4% in August. Rising unemployment would indicate weaker wages, potentially cooling consumer spending and demand-driven inflation. On the other hand, steady unemployment may support a rate hike later in the month.\nBeyond the data, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda will wrap up a busy week. Forward guidance on the timing of an interest rate hike could be pivotal for the yen.\nBookmark our real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY volatility.\nThe US economic calendar is equally heavy, with consumer confidence, labor market data, and the ISM Services PMI in focus.\nKey releases include:\nStronger-than-expected US labor market data could dampen Fed rate-cut expectations, boosting the dollar and USD/JPY. Softer readings would cement bets on an October Fed rate cut, weighing on the US dollar.\nBeyond the data, Fed speeches will require consideration as the October interest rate decision looms. Multiple FOMC members are on the calendar to speak. Reaction to last week\u2019s inflation data and this week\u2019s labor market indicators could fuel USD/JPY volatility.\nOn the daily chart, the USD/JPY trades above the 50-day and the 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), signaling bullish momentum.\nA breakout above the September 26 high of 149.957 could bring the August high of 150.917 into sight. A sustained move through 150.917 may enable the bulls to target the March high of 151.301.\nOn the downside, a drop below the 149.358 support level may pave the way toward the 200-day EMA. If breached, the pair could test the 5"

If buyers fail to sustain momentum, pullbacks could target 148.00 or deeper retracements toward 145.50, the September low.\nBig Picture: USD/JPY Holds Medium-Term Uptrend Above 139.00\nFrom a structural perspective, USD/JPY\u2019s multi-year trend from the 2021 low at 102.58 remains intact. The correction from last year\u2019s 161.94 high may have already bottomed at 139.87, with the breakout through 149.12 reinforcing that interpretation. As long as 139.00\u2013139.20 holds, the bullish bias for a retest of 161.94 is preserved. A failure back below 139.00 would suggest the corrective wave is not yet complete, but that scenario looks less likely given current U.S. economic resilience."

Payrolls on Friday will be the key event, with any clean signal on jobs growth and unemployment likely to dictate the next move in the pair.\nFed rate cut pricing driving the bus\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY remains heavily dictated by expectations for Federal Reserve policy, with rate cut pricing continuing to dominate as the key driver. The correlation between the pair and the shape of Fed funds futures out to September 2026 sits at an extraordinary -0.94, underscoring how tightly the yen is tracking the ebb and flow of U.S. policy expectations. While short-dated U.S. Treasury yields also retain a powerful influence, other traditional drivers such as yield differentials, risk appetite and U.S. equity market volatility have been far less significant. For now, the focus remains squarely on what could shift the outlook for U.S. rates.\nPayrolls tops event risk\nSource: LSEG (U.S. ET shown)\nIn the week ahead, the September nonfarm payrolls report on Friday looms as the single most important release. While the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday is arguably a better gauge given it avoids the heavy downward revisions that frequently plague the official data, it is payrolls that carry the greater weight for the Fed. The central bank\u2019s unusual emphasis on headline jobs growth over the unemployment rate means Friday\u2019s figures will likely be decisive for USD/JPY price action. The most influential outcome would be if both the payrolls and unemployment rate send the same signal. A soft print would likely fuel expectations for deeper cuts, weighing on USD/JPY, while a strong showing could see cut pricing pared back and the pair push higher.\nRecent surprises in U.S. economic data have generally tilted to the upside, including income and spending figures released last Friday, so a weak payrolls number would cut against the prevailing trend. Still, traders will be alert to the possibility of a downside miss given recent trends. Ahead of the main event, Tuesday\u2019s JOLTs survey, Wednesday\u2019s ISM manufacturing and ADP reports, Thursday\u2019s jobless claims and Friday\u2019s ISM services print all have potential to stir volatility, though their impact is expected to be secondary to the payrolls report.\nSource: LSEG (U.S. ET shown)\nFor Japan, domestic factors remain very much in the background. Comments from BOJ officials may influence if they diverge from the prevailing message that gradual rate hikes will proceed if the bank\u2019s forecasts prove accurate, but otherwise the yen is likely to take its cues from the U.S. side. Friday\u2019s Tokyo CPI undershot suggests upside inflation risks may be easing, allowing policymakers scope to observe incoming data before tightening again. Even so, with two board members dissenting in favour of a hike at the September meeting, the release of the summary of opinions could still generate market interest.\nUltimately, the path of least resistance for USD/JPY will be determined by the U.S. labour market. Until the September payrolls report lands, traders may be cautious to chase the pair aggressively in either direction. Any strong Fed commentary following Friday\u2019s release could be the final word on where USD/JPY heads next.\nUSD/JPY technical analysis\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY has finally broken out of the sideways range it had been stuck in since the July payrolls report, surging above the 200DMA on Wednesday before pushing through resistance at 149.00 on Thursday. That former barrier may now switch to support, offering a potential base for longs targeting a retest of resistance at 151.00 or even 152.40. The pair held the break on Friday but was unable "

Check our detailed guide-\nThe Fed Chair Powell emphasized the need for a balanced approach to rate cuts, warning against the risks of reigniting inflation. While the comments didn\u2019t trigger an immediate reaction, the dollar found strength during midweek as markets reassessed the Fed\u2019s easing pace. The move was further reinforced by the better-than-expected US GDP for Q2, revised higher to 3.8% year-over-year. Durable goods orders surged to 2.9% in August, while jobless claims fell 14k, all underscoring the US economic resilience. Friday\u2019s Core PCE inflation met the forecast at 2.9% y/y, providing no surprise to the markets but keeping intact the Fed\u2019s cautious rhetoric.\nFrom the Eurozone, the PMI figures revealed a mixed scenario, as the manufacturing sector contracted in September, slightly offset by growth in the services sector, leaving the composite PMI at 51.2. A modest expansion could do little to lift the euro, especially in the backdrop of a stronger dollar.\nEUR/USD Key Events Next Week\nLooking ahead, the focus remains on the data with the following major events:\n- Germany Retail Sales (Tuesday)\n- HICP Inflation y/y (Tuesday)\n- Germany Unemployment\n- Chicago PMI (Tuesday)\n- JOLTs Job Opening (Tuesday)\n- US ADP Employment Change (Wednesday)\n- US Jobless Claims (Thursday)\n- US NFP (Friday)\nThe primary focus will remain on the US labor market, as the Fed remains concerned about safeguarding it from further softening. Meanwhile, German data is also key to watch as the Eurozone\u2019s growth concerns are mounting. Moreover, central bank speeches may further provide impetus to the market.\nWith the dollar in firm control and data risks skewed toward US outperformance, EUR/USD may struggle to regain momentum in the near term. The euro\u2019s fate this week will hinge on whether inflation and employment data on both sides of the Atlantic can shift the policy narrative.\nEUR/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Lacking Direction at 1.1700\nThe EUR/USD daily chart shows a broken rising channel, with price moving below the 20-day MA. Although a mild recovery was seen from multi-week lows by the 50-day MA, the euro is still not out of the woods. The next significant support emerges at a swing low and 100-day MA near 1.1575.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about ECN brokers?

On the other hand, the price could rise above 1.1700, reaching 1.1800 and potentially surpassing yearly highs of 1.1920, with an ultimate target of 1.2000.\nLooking to trade forex now?

This reversal from years of refusal comes at a time when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) trades at $109,443, with ETF markets shaping capital flows on Wall Street. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has already amassed over $80 billion AUM since its January 2024 launch, with Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust drawing billions more. Vanguard\u2019s entry would not involve launching its own product, but instead listing ETFs from rivals like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale \u2014 a move that could redirect institutional capital significantly.\nInstitutional Rotation and Fidelity\u2019s $300M Bitcoin Sale\nAt the same time, large-scale whale moves are reshaping ETF flows. On-chain data confirms Fidelity sold $300.4 million in BTC, distributing sales through multiple tranches such as 1,018 BTC ($115.7M) and 449.6 BTC ($51.04M) to limit slippage. The transactions coincided with Bitcoin struggling at the $60,000\u2013$61,000 resistance zone, where institutional profit-taking tends to occur. Despite the liquidation, Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin ETF still absorbed inflows including 305 BTC ($34.65M) and 250 BTC ($28.39M), showing that demand from family offices and retail investors continues to counter institutional selling pressure.\nETF Flows Redraw Market Balance for BTC-USD\nThe push-pull dynamic of ETF inflows and outflows highlights the maturity of Bitcoin\u2019s ETF market. While institutions like Fidelity rebalance, retail and wealth managers continue adding exposure. Net inflows into BlackRock\u2019s IBIT stand above $60 billion, and combined Bitcoin ETF inflows since 2024 have crossed $100 billion. Vanguard\u2019s U-turn could add tens of billions more, effectively normalizing Bitcoin alongside equities and bonds in diversified portfolios. Analysts argue this inflow cycle has underpinned Bitcoin\u2019s ability to hold above $100,000 even after heavy institutional sales.\nRegulatory Shifts Fuel Broader Crypto ETF Pipeline\nBeyond Bitcoin, the SEC\u2019s new generic listing framework has shortened ETF approvals from 270 days to just 75 days, accelerating filings for Solana (SOL-USD), XRP (XRP-USD), and Cardano (ADA-USD). Multiple amended S-1s for Solana staking ETFs are pending, with analysts predicting approval by mid-October. If confirmed, institutional flows could rotate into altcoins, further supporting BTC-USD\u2019s role as the reserve layer of crypto ETF adoption. Early U.S. Solana ETF launches already recorded $33M in volume and $12M in inflows on day one, proving appetite for regulated alternatives.\nRead More\n-\nTLT ETF Price Analysis: NYSEARCA:TLT Struggles at $88.90 as Yields Stay Elevated\n27.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nSolana Price Forecast: SOL-USD Battles $200 Support as ETF Filings and Whale Transfers Shape Next Move\n27.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Futures Price (NG=F) Hover at $3.20 as AECO Prices Crash Below Zero and Storage Swells Toward 3.8 Tcf\n27.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar-Yen Tests 150.00 as Payrolls and Fed Bets Drive Momentum\n27.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nPrice Impact and Technical Outlook for Bitcoin\nDespite Fidelity\u2019s $300M sell, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has held firm above $109,000, showing deeper liquidity compared to earlier cycles.

                "url": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-cifr/cipher-mining/news/is-cipher-minings-skyrocketing-2025-returns-justified-after/amp",
                "body": "Thinking about buying, selling, or holding Cipher Mining stock? You are definitely not alone. The buzz around this name has been hard to miss, especially with its wild ride over the past year. Those returns have been nothing short of eye-catching. While the shares stumbled a bit in the last week and dipped 6.6%, zoom out and the story looks very different: up over 64% in the last month, 137.5% year-to-date, and an incredible 179.1% in the past 12 months. If you stretch even further back, Cipher Mining has clocked an astonishing 810.3% return over three years. Most investors would agree that is not your average performance, and these numbers have plenty of people debating whether the company\u2019s recent surge is just the start, or if it is masking some new risks.\nSo what is been driving all this? For companies like Cipher Mining, catalysts often include broad crypto market moves and regulatory news that shake up the entire industry\u2019s outlook. The appetite for crypto-related stocks has shifted dramatically this year, with investors responding enthusiastically to price action in Bitcoin and growing institutional interest in the blockchain space. Of course, the question on most investors\u2019 minds remains the same: is Cipher Mining actually undervalued, or is recent optimism leading to a frothy price?\nThat is where the valuation score comes in. Cipher Mining currently scores a 2 out of 6 on standard undervaluation checks. That means it is undervalued in two of the six methods analysts typically use. Not bad, but certainly not a slam dunk. Let\u2019s break down these valuation approaches and see where Cipher Mining stacks up, plus why some investors might still be missing the real picture on its value.\nCipher Mining scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.\nThe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model aims to estimate a company's intrinsic value by forecasting its future cash flows and then discounting those projections back to today's dollars. This approach gives investors a sense of what a business is truly worth, based on its ability to generate actual cash over time.\nFor Cipher Mining, the model uses the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity method. The company's last twelve months of Free Cash Flow sits at a negative $409.3 million. Analysts forecast that Cipher Mining's cash flow will improve rapidly. By 2029, projected Free Cash Flow reaches $1 billion, with stock performance expected to benefit from a turnaround from losses into robust cash generation. While analyst estimates cover the next five years, cash flow projections beyond 2029 are based on trend extrapolation.\nBased on these projections, Cipher Mining\u2019s estimated intrinsic share value is $30.96. According to the model, this is a 63.0% discount versus the current market price. Put simply, the stock appears substantially undervalued from a DCF perspective, assuming these aggressive cash flow improvements are realized.\nThe Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is a go-to valuation metric for growth companies that may not yet be profitable but are rapidly expanding revenue. It allows investors to gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of sales, which is especially useful for companies like Cipher Mining that are investing heavily for future growth and not yet generating consistent earnings.\nGrowth potential and risk profile can have a big impact on what is considered a \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d P/S ratio. Higher-growth companies typically command higher multiples, reflecting the market\u2019s optimism, while riskier or slower-growing firms might trade at lower ratios to account for uncertainty.\nCurrently, Cipher Mining trades at a P/S ratio of 28.4x. That is significantly higher than the software industry average of 5.3x and above its peer group\u2019s average of 23.3x. While a comparison to industry or peer averages is helpful for context, it does not fully capture Cipher Mining\u2019s specific growth outlook, risk level, or business model.\nThis is wh"

                "body": "Ready or not, the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is gearing up for a revolution, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s imminent upgrades. One that has captured the spotlight is the much-anticipated Fusaka update, which promises to dramatically alter the facets of speed and liquidity within cryptocurrency markets. This isn't just a technical shift; it's a transformative leap towards regulatory alignment that could strengthen Ethereum's leadership in the DeFi arena. With a Layer 2 (L2) solution called Base, spearheaded by Coinbase, aiming to achieve a remarkable Total Value Locked (TVL) of $20 billion by 2026, the entire crypto environment stands to benefit from this evolution. Institutional investors are taking notice, boosting market confidence in ways we haven\u2019t seen before.\nBase L2: A Catalyst for Change\nBase is pushing the boundaries of what Ethereum can achieve. By implementing a modular sequencer architecture, Base enhances transaction throughput without compromising on essential security features, preserving users' control over their assets. This is particularly vital as more institutional players step into the crypto arena. With its TVL currently at an impressive $15 billion, Base reflects broader market trends and solidifies its position as a pioneer of DeFi advancements. Such innovative approaches not only respond to regulatory standards but also provide users with secure transactions, creating an environment ripe for investment.\nInstitutional Investors Take the Leap\nAs regulatory frameworks become clearer, institutional interest in decentralized systems grows exponentially. Base\u2019s ambitious initiative to onboard up to 25,000 developers by year-end showcases its scalability and potential for expansive functionality. With investment heavyweights like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton making moves into tokenized funds within the DeFi landscape, the anticipated influx of liquidity will turbocharge transaction volumes. Such developments validate Ethereum's reputation, reaffirming its growing significance in the global financial system.\nFostering Innovation Through Interoperability\nThe real triumph of L2 networks like Base hinges on their capacity to enable seamless cross-chain activities. By prioritizing interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem, Base addresses pressing challenges that have historically impeded DeFi protocols. The resulting improvements in liquidity and integration capabilities enable rapid scalability, while also supercharging developer engagement and innovation. This commitment to interoperability ensures that DeFi remains not just functional, but truly accessible for everyone involved.\nThe Road Ahead for Cryptocurrency\nAs we peer into the future, it\u2019s clear that Ethereum\u2019s innovative trajectory will shape the landscape of the cryptocurrency market. The forthcoming Fusaka upgrade, slated for November 2025, promises to introduce features that will not only enhance security but also label Ethereum as a formidable force in the financial technology sector. Analysts predict that Ethereum's price could skyrocket to between $18,000 and $20,000 by 2026, fueled by rising institutional enthusiasm and vigorous enhancements in DeFi infrastructure. We may be on the brink of a revolutionary financial epoch.\nConclusion\nThe intersection of Ethereum\u2019s aggressive upgrades and Base\u2019s ambitious L2 initiatives marks a pivotal juncture for decentralized finance and institutional cryptocurrency engagement. As these frameworks strive not only to refine transaction efficiency but also to ensure regulatory compliance, their ramifications for Web3 startups and financial applications are boundless. The cryptocurrency landscape finds itself on the verge of an extraordinary evolution, with Ethereum poised to champion a future defined by innovation and regulated integrity. It's a moment ripe with potential for unprecedented growth, as the rewriting of the financial narrative unfolds before us."

                "body": "September 27, 2025 \u2013 The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape is abuzz with speculation surrounding a new class of advanced tokens, exemplified by the hypothetical NexusChain ($NEX). Analysts are predicting that a project embodying NexusChain's innovative features could replicate, or even surpass, the explosive growth seen by Ethereum (ETH) in 2021. This new wave of DeFi innovation integrates cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI), robust security protocols, seamless cross-chain interoperability, and institutional-grade compliance, promising to address the most persistent challenges hindering DeFi's mainstream adoption.\nThe potential emergence of a token like NexusChain signals a pivotal moment for the financial markets, offering a glimpse into a future where decentralized finance is not only more efficient and secure but also readily accessible to institutional capital. Its arrival could trigger a significant re-evaluation of existing blockchain technologies and investment strategies, as the market looks for the next generation of infrastructure capable of supporting a truly global, compliant, and interconnected financial ecosystem.\nNexusChain ($NEX): A Deep Dive into its Disruptive Features\nNexusChain ($NEX) represents a conceptual leap in blockchain technology, synthesizing features that are currently being developed across various projects, yet rarely unified in a single, cohesive platform. Should such a project materialize, its core tenets would redefine performance, security, and accessibility in DeFi.\nAt its heart lies an AI-optimized consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) or older Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems, NexusChain's consensus would leverage AI algorithms to dynamically adjust network parameters, optimize transaction routing, and predict load, ensuring unparalleled scalability and efficiency. This could translate to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second (TPS) with near-zero transaction costs, far surpassing the capabilities of many existing Layer-1 blockchains. For instance, projects like Nexchain AI are already exploring hybrid consensus models combining PoS with AI to enhance performance and flexibility.\nComplementing its efficiency is proactive AI security. DeFi has been plagued by billions lost to smart contract exploits, flash loan attacks, and sophisticated cyber threats. NexusChain would integrate a proprietary \"Sentinel AI\" module that continuously audits smart contract code, monitors the network for anomalous transaction patterns, and can even temporarily pause suspicious activity. This proactive, machine learning-driven approach moves beyond reactive audits, aiming to prevent attacks before they cause harm, a feature emphasized by projects like Nexchain AI, which touts a completely AI-powered architecture for enhanced security.\nAnother critical innovation is native cross-chain liquidity. The current DeFi landscape is fragmented, with liquidity trapped across disparate blockchains, often relying on vulnerable bridges. NexusChain would introduce a \"Universal Asset Layer\" that employs cryptographic proofs and decentralized light clients for truly atomic swaps and seamless asset transfers across major Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks. This eliminates the need for wrapped assets and centralized custodians, unlocking vast amounts of liquidity and fostering a unified DeFi ecosystem. Various \"Nexus Chain\" projects and the NexulonAI ecosystem are actively working on cross-chain interoperability solutions, aiming to break down these barriers.\nFinally, and perhaps most crucially for institutional adoption, is an institutional-grade compliance engine. This configurable \"Reg-Bridge\" engine would allow protocols built on NexusChain to integrate verifiable Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) attestations using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy, permissioned lending pools, and robust tokenization standards for real-world assets (RWAs).

                "body": "In a dramatic turn of events within the cryptocurrency landscape, Ruvi AI (RUVI) has emerged as a formidable new contender, rapidly capturing investor attention and, in some instances, diverting capital from established giants like Solana (SOL). The project's presale success, characterized by lightning-fast token sales and aggressive bonus structures, has ignited a fervent Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) among retail and institutional investors alike, positioning RUVI as a potential \"100x gem\" in the upcoming bull run. This shift highlights a growing appetite for utility-backed AI projects offering high-growth potential, even as more mature assets like Solana navigate a period of market correction.\nAs of late September 2025, while Solana (SOL) (SOL) continues to be a significant layer-1 blockchain with robust institutional interest, its recent price dip and market volatility have created an opening for ambitious newcomers. Ruvi AI's strategic presale, promising guaranteed price increases and substantial early-investor bonuses, has effectively leveraged this environment, creating a narrative of rapid wealth generation that is proving irresistible to many. The immediate implication is a noticeable reallocation of \"smart money\" towards early-stage ventures, signaling a dynamic evolution in investor sentiment within the ever-shifting crypto market.\nThe Genesis of a New Crypto Sensation: Ruvi AI's Presale Phenomenon\nThe meteoric rise of Ruvi AI's presale has been nothing short of astonishing, quickly becoming one of the most talked-about events in the altcoin space. Reports indicate that the project has swiftly sold out multiple phases of its presale, with a staggering 20% of its Phase 3 supply claimed in a matter of days. To date, Ruvi AI has reportedly raised over $4 million, selling more than 285 million tokens at a velocity that has \"stunned market observers.\" Some analysts are even drawing comparisons to the early demand seen for Ripple (XRP) (XRP), underscoring the magnitude of its initial traction. The project's community of holders has rapidly expanded, now exceeding 3,900 participants, a testament to its broad appeal.\nThe timeline of events leading to this moment reveals a meticulously planned strategy designed to maximize investor urgency and FOMO. Ruvi AI's presale is currently in Phase 3, with tokens priced at $0.020. A cornerstone of its tokenomics is the guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 upon the commencement of Phase 4, a clear incentive for immediate investment. Beyond this, the project has implemented a multi-tiered VIP bonus structure, rewarding early and significant investments. For instance, a $10,000 investment in VIP 5 can unlock an additional 100% bonus, potentially yielding a projected 9,900% Return on Investment (ROI) if the token reaches $1. Lower tiers offer 40% to 60% bonuses for investments of $1,000 and $2,000, respectively, further sweetening the deal for early adopters.\nKey players in this unfolding narrative include the Ruvi AI development team, whose vision for an AI-powered super app targeting the $104 billion creator economy provides a compelling utility proposition. This focus on a tangible use case, rather than pure speculation, has lent credibility to the project. Furthermore, a successful smart contract audit by CyberScope and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap have significantly bolstered Ruvi AI's legitimacy and visibility within the broader crypto market, accelerating its presale velocity. Initial market reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, with analysts swiftly positioning RUVI as a \"top pick\" and a potential \"100x gem\" for the upcoming bull cycle, drawing parallels to the early successes of projects like Avalanche (AVAX) (AVAX).\nThe immediate impact has been a noticeable shift in retail investor sentiment, moving away from purely speculative meme coins towards utility-backed AI projects that promise a \"safer\" and \"faster path\" to significant returns.

                "body": "The air crackles with expectation as the possibility of Solana ETFs receiving U.S. approval approaches. This moment could very well catapult Solana from the fringes to the forefront of cryptocurrency investing. As the dialogue heats up, insights from industry visionaries signal that a monumental wave of institutional capital could dramatically shift the dynamics of both Solana and the broader crypto ecosystem. So, what are the catalysts fueling this burgeoning interest, and how can investors navigate this evolving landscape?\nThe Rising Tide of Solana ETFs\nThis burgeoning enthusiasm for Solana ETFs isn't merely a fleeting fancy; it heralds a seismic shift in the cryptocurrency domain. Heavyweights like Bitwise, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton are positioning themselves for a potential affirmation\u2014the kind that could hit as soon as mid-October. Nate Geraci of NovaDius Wealth Management anticipates that the long-awaited regulatory approval for Solana staking ETFs could set off a torrent of institutional demand, with initial inflows speculated to soar to a staggering $1 trillion.\nThis spike in interest is underscored by the remarkable $60 million that Bitwise\u2019s Solana staking ETP raked in within a single week. Bitwise's CEO, Hunter Horsley, captures the moment succinctly: \u201cSolana is on people\u2019s minds.\u201d This shift signifies not just a newfound interest but a rethinking of how institutional players engage with the Solana ecosystem.\nUnpacking Investor Confidence in Solana\nThe road to this heightened institutional confidence is paved with several key factors. Solana's remarkably fast transaction speeds and minimal fees set it apart from heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum, rendering it a tantalizing investment. With institutional ownership of SOL hovering below 1% of the total supply, the opportunity for significant asset allocation growth invites potential for substantial returns.\nThe recent regulatory changes in the U.S. further sweeten the pot, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment class. With the SEC's approval of the Hyperliquid ETF being a pivotal moment, there's a palpable sense that if Solana ETFs gain traction, groundbreaking investment vehicles will soon follow\u2014paving the path for institutional players to step in with confidence.\nCaution in the Wake of Potential Volatility\nAmid the excitement surrounding Solana ETF approvals, it's essential to take a tempered approach to the crypto market. Recent data shows a broader sell-off, with Solana's price experiencing a decline of 2.81% in the last day and plummeting by 19% in the past week. These fluctuations remind investors that the crypto terrain remains rife with unpredictability, underscoring the necessity for prudence.\nFor those exploring investment in Solana, a vigilant eye is paramount. Investors must be prepared for potential price shifts influenced by broader economic conditions and regulatory changes. A solid grasp of Solana\u2019s intrinsic value and its burgeoning ecosystem can provide a buffer against market volatility, enhancing the stability of investment prospects.\nEvolving Strategies for Web3 Startups\nThe anticipated influx of institutional capital stemming from Solana ETF approvals could dramatically reshape Web3 startup operations. As investment entities realign to integrate robust crypto-to-fiat systems, this influx may overshadow the critical need for startups to establish compliant operational strategies vital for navigating an ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\nExperts caution that excess dependence on ETF inflows could cause startups to overlook developing core payment integrations. An overemphasis on immediate financial rewards might stifle the sustainable growth essential for longevity in this fluctuating market.\nCharting the Course for Solana and Institutional Investers\nAs the month progresses, all eyes remain fixed on Solana's ability to leverage an unprecedented environment ripe for institutional engagement.

Solana, often hailed as an \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d has captured the attention of investors and developers alike with its high-speed transactions and low costs. As we look ahead, a crucial question emerges: what does the Solana price prediction look like for the coming years? Will SOL reach the ambitious SOL price target of $500, or even surpass it, by 2030? Let\u2019s dive deep into the factors shaping Solana\u2019s journey and unlock its potential.\nUnderstanding Solana\u2019s Foundation: What Makes SOL Unique and Powerful?\nBefore we project into the future, it\u2019s essential to grasp what Solana brings to the table. Launched in 2020, Solana quickly distinguished itself with a unique blend of innovative technologies designed for scalability. Its core innovation, Proof of History (PoH), combined with a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, allows for unparalleled transaction speeds \u2013 potentially tens of thousands per second \u2013 at significantly lower fees compared to many competitors. This technological edge has fostered a rapidly growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\nThe architecture of Solana is built for speed and efficiency. Unlike many other blockchains that process transactions sequentially, Solana utilizes parallel processing, enabling it to handle a massive volume of transactions simultaneously. This design choice is fundamental to its high throughput and low latency, making it ideal for applications requiring rapid finality, such as high-frequency trading, real-time gaming, and instant payment systems. The consistent development and refinement of this architecture are key drivers behind any optimistic Solana price prediction.\n- Speed and Throughput: Solana boasts impressive transaction throughput, crucial for mass adoption and enterprise-level applications. It can process thousands of transactions per second, far exceeding many legacy blockchains.\n- Cost-Effectiveness: Transaction fees are remarkably low, often fractions of a cent, making it accessible for everyday use and microtransactions without burdening users.\n- Scalability Solutions: Designed to handle enterprise-level demands without compromising decentralization, Solana\u2019s sharding solutions and validator improvements continue to enhance its capacity.\n- Developer Ecosystem: A vibrant and growing developer community is building innovative solutions across various sectors, from gaming to DeFi, leveraging Solana\u2019s robust infrastructure.\nThe Current Landscape: Where Does Solana Stand Today in the Crypto Sphere?\nSolana\u2019s journey has been marked by both meteoric rises and challenging corrections. After an astonishing bull run that saw its value soar, it faced significant headwinds, including network outages and broader market downturns during the crypto winter. However, the resilience of its community and ongoing development efforts have kept it firmly in the top ranks of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its current price reflects a complex interplay of market sentiment, technological developments, and macroeconomic forces. Understanding these dynamics is key to formulating a reliable Solana price prediction and assessing its potential for future growth.\nRecent performance indicates a strong recovery and renewed interest, driven by factors such as the success of new dApps, increasing institutional interest, and the general positive sentiment returning to the crypto markets. Despite past challenges, Solana has demonstrated a remarkable ability to bounce back, reinforcing investor confidence in its long-term viability.\nWhat Drives Solana\u2019s Price Evolution?

The S&P 500 fell 0.5% Thursday for its third straight drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.5%. All three indexes are still near their records set at the start of the week. Stocks felt pressure from reports showing the U.S. economy may be stronger than economists thought. That could make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut interest rates several times in the coming months.\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street stumbled to a third straight loss on Thursday as U.S. stocks gave back more of their big gains for the year so far.\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.5% and marked its longest losing streak in more than a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 173 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.5%. All three indexes are still near their records set at the start of the week, though.\nStocks felt pressure from reports showing the U.S. economy may be stronger than economists thought. While that\u2019s encouraging news for workers and for people looking for jobs, it could make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut interest rates several times in the coming months.\nThe Fed just delivered its first cut of the year last week, and officials had penciled in more through the end of next year. That was critical for Wall Street after U.S. stocks shot to records since April in large part because of expectations for rate cuts. Easier rates can boost the economy and make investors more willing to pay high prices for stocks and other investments.\nBut a stronger-than-expected economy could remove some of the Fed\u2019s urgency, particularly because cuts to rates carry the risk of worsening inflation that\u2019s already stubbornly high. If the Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates as often as investors expect, it would empower criticism that the U.S. stock market is too expensive after rising so much, so quickly.\n\u201cBuckle up,\u201d warned Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at financial services firm BTIG.\nStocks look to be in their most vulnerable position since their April lows given how much complacency has built up and how the rubber band has recently been \u201cas stretched as it gets in some parts of the market,\u201d Krinsky wrote in a research report.\nWall Street\u2019s ultimate hope is that the U.S. economy stays in a delicate balance where it\u2019s slow enough to convince the Fed to cut rates but doesn't become so weak that it leads to a recession.\nTreasury yields ticked higher in the bond market as traders pared bets for the number of upcoming cuts to rates by the Fed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.17% from 4.16% late Wednesday.\nOne of Thursday\u2019s stronger-than-expected economic reports said that fewer U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week. That could be a signal that the pace of layoffs is slowing.\nAnother report said the U.S. economy grew at a faster pace during the spring than earlier thought, while a third said orders blew past economists\u2019 expectations last month for U.S. manufactured goods with a relatively long life span.\nOn Wall Street, CarMax tumbled 20.1% after the seller of used autos reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It sold fewer vehicles during the quarter than it had a year earlier. It also was hurt because it increased its expectations for losses from loans made in earlier years.\nJabil fell 6.7% even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, thanks in part to demand coming because of artificial intelligence. It also gave forecasts for upcoming revenue and profit that topped analysts\u2019 expectations.\nSuch moves typically send a stock\u2019s price higher, but Jabil came into the day with an already huge gain of 56.6% for the year so far.

The company plans to put the proceeds toward reducing its existing commercial paper, retiring some long-term debt, and shoring up general corporate needs. Moves like this are rarely minor. Such a large capital raise, structured as junior subordinated notes, can reshape the company's balance sheet and influence its future financial moves.\nThe announcement comes as Alliant Energy\u2019s stock has delivered a 13% return year-to-date and is up 12% over the past year, outperforming many utility peers while still trailing the broader Dow Jones benchmark. After mixed second-quarter earnings, with earnings per share doubling year over year and revenue growing but coming in slightly below expectations, momentum seems to be picking up. Investors have pushed the stock just above key moving averages, suggesting that sentiment is warming alongside the financial maneuver.\nGiven the recent uptick in share price and ongoing capital investments, is Alliant Energy undervalued at today\u2019s levels or is the market simply pricing in its potential for future growth?\nMost Popular Narrative: 3.5% Undervalued\nThe most widely followed narrative suggests that Alliant Energy is undervalued by just over 3%, pointing to a price target slightly higher than current prices based on future earnings and revenue growth forecasts.\nThe company's proactive alignment with customer demand, decarbonization, and infrastructure modernization trends positions it to benefit from both rising ESG capital inflows and increasing electricity volumes tied to electrification of industry and digital infrastructure. This is seen as positively impacting its long-term revenue and earnings trajectory.\nCurious what\u2019s fueling this potential undervaluation? The narrative hints at a bold financial roadmap featuring robust annual growth, higher profit margins, and ambitious return assumptions. Want a closer look at the aggressive projections and the market-moving forces behind this call? The details will surprise you.\nResult: Fair Value of $68.50 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.However, delays in major data center projects or unfavorable regulatory shifts could quickly challenge these growth assumptions and put pressure on Alliant Energy\u2019s future earnings path.\nFind out about the key risks to this Alliant Energy narrative.Another View: SWS DCF Model Sees Things Differently\nWhile the analyst consensus suggests Alliant Energy is undervalued, our SWS DCF model tells a different story.

Inflation is still higher than in March 2022, and tightening monetary policy is causing structural issues, especially with inflated real estate alongside equity prices in certain sectors.\nFormer Bank of England Governor Mervyn King still believes that rate rises will tip the UK into a recession, a view shared by Legal & General chief investment officer Sonja Laud.\nAnd in terms of fiscal policy, the tax burden is now at its highest level since World War II. Corporation tax has risen for larger companies from 19% to 25% and the popular super-deduction benefit has ceased, causing AstraZeneca\u2019s to build its new state-of-the-art factory in Ireland.\nLarger companies including CRH, Flutter, ARM, Shell, Ferguson, and BHP have either left London already or are considering it \u2014 with Legal & General CEO Nigel Wilson recently referring to the UK as a 'low growth, low productivity, low wage economy.'\nThis all makes selecting the best UK shares to buy in August somewhat of a challenge \u2014 but where there\u2019s doubt, there\u2019s often opportunity.\nBest UK shares to watch\n1. Begbies Traynor (LON: BEG)\nIn the background of the UK economy, a small business collapse may be brewing. Begbies Traynor Executive Chairman Ric Traynor considers that the country\u2019s \u2018zombie\u2019 companies, which have thus far survived through the aberration of low interest rates, will \u2018over the next 18 months...we\u2019ll see virtually all of them finally come to an end.\u2019\nNot good news for SME operators, but bankruptcies are already close to their Global Financial Crisis peak. And what is bad news for some businesses is good news for Begbies Traynor \u2014 in recent full-year results, it saw another \u2018successful year of continued growth with results ahead of original market expectations.\u2019\nRevenue grew by 11% year-over-year, free cash flow hit \u00a314.1 million, the dividend increased by 9% to 3.8p for the year, the sixth year of increases in a row, and it noted confidence of \u2018a further year of growth in line with market expectations...strong order book of insolvency revenue (up 19% in the year), driven by continued increase in insolvency market volumes.\u2019\nTraynor enthused that \u2018we have a proven growth strategy which, over the five year period between 2019 and 2023, has doubled revenue and tripled adjusted profit before tax, from a combination of organic growth and acquisitions.\u2019\nBegbies Traynor shares have fallen by 10.3% year-to-date to 130p, though the FTSE 250 company has risen by 85.7% over the past five years. August could be a buying opportunity.\n2. Card Factory (LON: CARD)\nWhile the headlines may be bad news for the UK high street, it remains the case that capable operators are still doing well, regardless of their target market on the value scale.\nGreggs, JD Wetherspoon, Next, and Marks & Spencer are all enjoying a superlative 2023 \u2014 and Card Factory has been another solid riser. Perhaps there\u2019s a lesson for the CEOs continually blaming market conditions for poor performance.\nOn 7 August, the company issued a trading update concerning the first half to 31 July \u2014 announcing that \u2018the positive start to the financial period, highlighted at the preliminary results, has continued. Trading in the first six months was materially ahead of the Board's expectations.\u2019\nWhile it acknowledged that the macro backdrop remains uncertain, Card Factory now \u2018"

Europe\u2019s insurance index soared ~+2.1%, snapping a 3-day losing streak [3]. Banking shares also climbed broadly (Milan\u2019s FTSE MIB +0.96% amid bank gains) [4], aided by deal speculation in Italy.\n- Steel & Oil Stocks Jump: Industrial and commodity firms rallied on policy news. Steelmakers leapt 2\u20135% after reports the EU will impose 25\u201350% tariffs on Chinese steel imports [5]. Brent crude spiked ~2% toward $70 as Russia curbed fuel exports [6], lifting oil & gas shares.\n- Tariff Threats Fizzle: Trump\u2019s surprise 100% tariff on foreign-made drugs barely hit European pharma \u2013 AstraZeneca +0.4% and GSK +1.1% as EU imports are exempt [7]. A proposed 25% U.S. duty on heavy trucks hurt some automakers (Daimler Truck \u20132%, Traton \u20132% [8]), but markets largely shrugged off trade fears.\n- Stocks on the Move:InterContinental Hotels Group jumped +4% after a double-upgrade from JPMorgan [9]. Lufthansa rose +1.6% on plans for thousands of job cuts to trim costs [10]. EssilorLuxottica climbed +2.3% after U.S. approval of its new myopia lenses [11].

Core PCE inflation came in at +2.9% \u2013 exactly forecast [14] \u2013 easing fears of a Fed pivot. \u201cIt was already priced in,\u201d one portfolio manager said of tariff risks [15]. Traders still overwhelmingly expect Fed rate cuts by year-end [16], and the ECB held rates at 2% this month with the eurozone economy in a \u201cgood place\u201d [17] [18].\n- Cautious Optimism Ahead: Despite Friday\u2019s bounce, European stocks were flat on the week [19], reflecting lingering growth and geopolitical worries. High valuations may cap upside, but Goldman Sachs still sees ~5% gains for European equities in the next year amid improving fundamentals [20]. All eyes turn to upcoming data (Eurozone inflation, U.S. jobs) for clues if this rally can sustain into Q4.\nMarket Recap: Relief Rally Ends a Volatile Week\nGerman DAX stock index graph displayed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. European markets rebounded off three-week lows heading into the weekend (Sept. 24, 2025) [21] [22]\nEuropean stocks staged a broad relief rally at week\u2019s end, erasing earlier losses from a volatile week. On Friday, September 26, the STOXX Europe 600 index climbed +0.8%, clawing its way back from three-week lows hit mid-week [23]. This late surge left the STOXX 600 essentially where it began the week \u2013 up a marginal +0.07% over the five sessions [24]. Major national indexes were all in positive territory Friday. Germany\u2019s DAX 40 and France\u2019s CAC 40 each rose around +0.8\u20130.9%, and London\u2019s FTSE 100 gained +0.8% [25]. Spain\u2019s IBEX 35 was the standout, jumping +1.3% to its highest level in over a week [26]. Even Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB in Milan notched a solid +0.96% gain, aided by its heavy weighting in bank and insurance stocks [27]. Investors appeared to breathe a collective sigh of relief heading into the weekend, as European equities rebounded from their lowest levels in nearly a month. The strong Friday finish helped offset earlier selling pressure and underscored the market\u2019s resilience in the face of recent headwinds.\nSector & Stock Highlights: Financials and Steelmakers Rally as Pharma Shrugs Off Tariffs\nFinancial stocks led the market comeback.

                "body": "Positive earnings growth hasn't been enough to get Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) shareholders a favorable return over the last five years\nWe think intelligent long term investing is the way to go. But no-one is immune from buying too high. To wit, the Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) share price managed to fall 56% over five long years. That's not a lot of fun for true believers. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 32% in the last three months.\nWhile the last five years has been tough for Charter Communications shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns.\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Charter Communications actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 29% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.\nBecause of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.\nIn contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 3.2% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for Charter Communications in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.\nA Different Perspective\nInvestors in Charter Communications had a tough year, with a total loss of 16%, against a market gain of about 18%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Charter Communications , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."

                "source": "FinancialContent",
                "url": "https://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/article/marketminute-2025-9-27-incannex-healthcare-nasdaq-ixhl-braces-for-volatility-as-q4-earnings-loom-options-traders-eye-strategic-plays",
                "body": "Melbourne, Australia \u2013 September 27, 2025 \u2013 Incannex Healthcare Limited (NASDAQ: IXHL) is on the cusp of a pivotal week, with its Q4 2025 earnings report scheduled for release on Monday, September 29, 2025, before market open. This highly anticipated announcement is expected to inject significant volatility into the stock, with analysts predicting a possible price swing of +/- 63.21% on the first trading day. For investors and options traders, the coming days represent a critical juncture, demanding careful consideration of both potential directional movements and volatility-driven strategies.\nThe biotech firm, known for its cannabinoid and psychedelic medicine research, has a history of dramatic price movements tied to clinical trial progress. The upcoming earnings call, slated for Friday, October 3, 2025, will offer further insights into the company's financial health and pipeline advancements, setting the stage for what could be a defining period for IXHL and its stakeholders.\nIncannex Poised for Post-Earnings Jolt Amidst Broader Biotech Shifts\nThe immediate catalyst for Incannex Healthcare Limited (NASDAQ: IXHL) is undoubtedly its Q4 2025 earnings report. The sheer magnitude of the projected price swing underscores the market's anticipation and the potential for substantial gains or losses. This event follows a remarkable 876% surge in IXHL's stock price on May 14, 2025, a direct result of successfully completing patient dosing in the Phase 2 segment of its Phase 2/3 trial for IHL-42X, a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. This historical precedent highlights the stock's sensitivity to clinical milestones and its capacity for explosive movements, making the upcoming earnings a high-stakes affair.\nBeyond Incannex's specific developments, the broader biotech landscape has seen several shifts that could indirectly influence investor sentiment. In the past week, the FDA issued new draft guidance aimed at accelerating cell and gene therapy development for small patient populations, a move generally seen as beneficial for the innovative biotech sector. Concurrently, concerns within the biopharma industry regarding a proposed H-1B visa crackdown, potentially hindering access to global talent, have emerged. Deal structures in biopharma are also evolving, with a decline in average potential earnouts but a steady increase in upfront payments since 2017. Furthermore, the UK's launch of a \u00a350 million R&D investment fund for life sciences could attract major research projects, improving the global life sciences environment and potentially benefiting companies like IXHL in the long run.\nAnalyst coverage for IXHL remains somewhat limited, with one brokerage firm issuing a \"Hold-equivalent\" recommendation, resulting in an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 3.00. Traditional analysts have not set specific price targets. However, AI-driven forecasts offer a mixed bag of short-term outlooks, ranging from a modest rise to a significant bullish target, and even a highly bearish prediction. This disparity underscores the uncertainty surrounding IXHL's immediate future. Technically, IXHL\u2019s stock price, hovering around $0.5949 as of September 26-27, 2025, presents a contradictory picture. While the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is above the 60-day SMA, typically a bullish signal, the price is below its 50-day and 200-day MAs, indicating a neutral to bearish overall moving average trend. Momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are neutral, but the stock's high daily volatility (averaging 13.31% last week) is a consistent feature.\nNavigating the Post-Earnings Landscape: Winners and Losers\nThe outcome of Incannex Healthcare Limited's (NASDAQ: IXHL) Q4 2025 earnings report will directly impact the company and its investors, creating clear winners and losers. A strong earnings beat, coupled with positive updates on its clinical pipeline \u2013 particularly IHL-42X or other promising candidates \u2013 could ignite another rally,"

                "body": "Unfortunately for some shareholders, the Limbach Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LMB) share price has dived 26% in the last thirty days, prolonging recent pain. Looking back over the past twelve months the stock has been a solid performer regardless, with a gain of 24%.\nIn spite of the heavy fall in price, Limbach Holdings may still be sending very bearish signals at the moment with a price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 30.6x, since almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 19x and even P/E's lower than 11x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.\nWith earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Limbach Holdings has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Limbach Holdings will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?\nLimbach Holdings' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 32%. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 313% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 20% each year during the coming three years according to the four analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% per year growth forecast for the broader market.\nWith this information, we can see why Limbach Holdings is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\nThe Bottom Line On Limbach Holdings' P/E\nEven after such a strong price drop, Limbach Holdings' P/E still exceeds the rest of the market significantly. While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.\nWe've established that Limbach Holdings maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Limbach Holdings might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

Sign up for it here.\nThe ascent of MAHA\u2014the Trump administration\u2019s movement to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d\u2014is part of a broader health revolution in the United States, one that venerates the past in order to carve out a purportedly healthier future. It has had mixed results; some MAHA tenets have little basis in medical literature (researchers pushed back on the White House\u2019s announcement this week that Tylenol use during pregnancy could be linked to autism). In today\u2019s Daily, my colleague Elizabeth Bruenig joins me for a conversation about her new article, \u201cWhen Child Death Was Everywhere,\u201d and the philosophy of the man behind the movement, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nWill Gottsegen: How does the ideology of conservatism explain what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is trying to do with health policy?\nElizabeth Bruenig: When you think of conservatism, you\u2019re thinking basically of someone who wants to conserve. William F. Buckley Jr. said the conservative disposition \u201cstands athwart history, yelling Stop.\u201d I think that helps explain why RFK Jr., who was a lifelong liberal, wound up on the conservative side of things. He, like a lot of conservatives, feels that the answer to human health and happiness lies somewhere in the past. It\u2019s a kind of nostalgia that drives what he\u2019s doing.\nWill: Wasn\u2019t that nostalgia for a supposedly healthier time once the province of the left?\nLiz: Vaccine skepticism was for a long time associated with the left, because it was associated with people who were skeptical of Western medicine or had a kind of \u201cback to the earth\u201d belief system that advocated holistic treatments and rejected modern pharmacology. Over time, anti-vax sentiment became more bipartisan, and then, after COVID, it just exploded on the right without exploding on the left.\nWill: Americans\u2019 trust in institutions such as HHS and the CDC declined majorly after COVID, on the right and the left. Is that how you wind up with someone as skeptical of the medical establishment as RFK Jr.?\nLiz: I think it\u2019s how you wind up with so many people who are interested in RFK Jr.\u2019s message. RFK Jr. was already anti-vax by the time the pandemic came around, but what COVID changed is it created so many people who had serious doubts about our institutions. And I think that explains why you have so many people at this point who are willing to listen to an anti-vax message.\nWill: You describe a lot of what RFK Jr. is doing as an unwinding of old policies, or a vision of return to an earlier era. What are the wrongs he\u2019s looking to right? And is there a way in which he\u2019s reacting to specific policies?\nLiz: RFK Jr., if you look at his career, is someone who has focused on the purity of nature: protecting the purity of natural resources, clean water, protecting pristine natural sites from industrial pollution. So I think his view on vaccines and processed foods is all of a piece with everything else he\u2019s done to try to keep things pure and natural. I do think that he is responding to the CDC\u2019s actions during COVID. A lot of people wound up very disillusioned with the lockdowns, with the mask mandates, and so on. And RFK Jr. is very much capitalizing on that mistrust people developed of the CDC.\nWill: To what extent is this broad skepticism now self-sustaining? Will we even need RFK Jr. to keep the wheels turning?\nLiz: I\u2019m afraid that we won\u2019t. At this point, it\u2019s become part of the belief system of the right, especially the MAGA right\u2014just like how post\u2013Donald Trump, we\u2019ll still be dealing in some sense with the MAGA movement, because it\u2019s changed how conservatives think about politics.
