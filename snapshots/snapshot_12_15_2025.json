                "body": "Gold\u2019s late-year rally has accelerated in December 2025, with spot prices holding firmly above the $4,200\u2013$4,300 zone as traders recalibrate expectations for US interest rates, the dollar, and global risk. In the space of a few sessions, the market has digested a Federal Reserve rate cut, a fresh warning from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) about \u201cexplosive\u201d price behavior in both US equities and gold, and a surge in silver that many analysts say is pulling precious metals higher as a complex. [1]\nSo what\u2019s the most realistic gold price forecast for the rest of December 2025\u2014and what would it take for XAU/USD to break to new highs or slip into a sharper pullback before year-end?\nWhere gold stands in mid-December 2025\nGold has spent the second week of December grinding higher and testing levels last seen in late October. On Friday, December 12, spot gold rose to about $4,293 per ounce after touching a seven-week high earlier in the session, while US gold futures settled around $4,328. [2]\nThat move followed a strong post-Fed reaction earlier in the week. On Thursday, December 11, Reuters reported spot gold up about 1.2% near $4,280, its highest level since October 21, with the US dollar sliding to an eight-week low\u2014conditions that typically support dollar-priced commodities like gold. [3]\nFrom a weekly-technical perspective, FXStreet\u2019s weekly note said gold added roughly 3% over the week, briefly flirting with the $4,350 area before settling around $4,330. [4]\nThe biggest December driver: the Fed cut rates\u2014by 25 bps, but with a split vote\nThe macro catalyst that mattered most for gold this month was the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy decision.\nOn December 10, the Fed cut the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50%\u20133.75%, while noting inflation \u201cremains somewhat elevated\u201d and emphasizing it would assess incoming data and risks when considering further moves. [5]\nImportantly for market psychology, the decision wasn\u2019t unanimous. The Fed statement shows three dissenters: one favored a larger 50 bps cut, while two preferred no change. That kind of split can increase uncertainty\u2014and uncertainty often helps keep safe-haven bids alive in gold. [6]\nFXStreet\u2019s coverage echoed the same core takeaway: the Fed delivered the widely expected 25 bps cut to 3.50%\u20133.75%, but the voting split and forward-looking uncertainty kept traders focused on what happens next rather than treating the move as \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d [7]\nWhy rate cuts matter for gold (and why this cut didn\u2019t end the debate)\nGold doesn\u2019t pay interest. That\u2019s why it often benefits when interest rates (and especially real yields) are falling, because the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of holding bullion declines.\nReuters\u2019 December 12 market wrap captured the current narrative: the Fed delivered its third quarter-point cut of the year, but signaled caution on further easing until more data arrives\u2014leaving traders to keep repricing the path of policy rather than locking in a single scenario. [8]\nThe result is a market that can still move sharply on each major data print\u2014because the direction of yields and the dollar can shift quickly if traders believe the Fed is done cutting, or conversely, if they see a faster easing cycle ahead.\nThe new complicating factor: BIS warns of \u201cexplosive\u201d behavior in gold and US equities\nIn the last few days, the most talked-about \u201crisk\u201d headline for gold hasn\u2019t been geopolitical\u2014it\u2019s been valuation and positioning.\nOn December 8, BIS published analysis noting that a statistical test frequently used to detect \u201cexplosive\u201d price behavior suggests both the S&P 500 and gold have entered \u201cexplosive territory\u201d in recent months\u2014something the BIS says has happened simultaneously only once in at least the last 50 years. [9]\nThe BIS also stresses a key nuance that matters for anyone using the \u201cbubble\u201d word too casually: even if a test detects bubble-like dynamics, it doesn\u2019t tell you when a correction might happen.

                "body": "Latin America is expected to be a leading source of global oil supply growth in 2025 and 2026, with new production from Brazil and Guyana significantly expanding global output, according to forecasts from Oxford Economics.\nThe advisory firm projects that global oil production will reach about 106 million barrels per day in 2026, supported by a 1.6 million-barrel-per-day supply increase. Brazil and Guyana together are expected to contribute roughly 1.6 million barrels per day across 2025\u201326, making the region one of the strongest contributors outside the United States and the Middle East.\nThis expansion positions Latin America as one of the few regions delivering reliable medium-term supply growth, as Bloomberg explains. Oxford Economics notes that Brazil's offshore projects and Guyana's rapid development of the Stabroek block are reshaping the global production map, helping to generate a surplus that could keep prices in the high-$50 range next year.\nThe firm expects Brent crude to end 2026 near $58 per barrel.\nWhile U.S. shale remains an important factor in balancing the market, its growth is expected to moderate. The firm forecasts U.S. output to rise by about 400,000 barrels per day in 2026, far less than the combined contribution from Brazil and Guyana. The relative outperformance underscores Latin America's emerging role in supplying new barrels as other producers face declines or plateauing capacity.\nOPEC's planned easing of production cuts in the second half of 2026 could add additional barrels, but analysts say the bloc's contribution will not diminish the importance of Latin America's output trajectory. For global buyers, especially in Asia, the region is becoming an increasingly central source of medium-sour and light-sweet crude.\nLonger-term outlooks point to structural challenges that could elevate the region's importance even further. In a sprawling report by UAE's Khaleej Times framed around the Oxford Economics forecast, Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said that despite near-term abundance, the industry faces \"a deeper structural tension\" due to declining mature fields and insufficient investment.\nHansen warned that current price levels may not support the large upstream commitments needed globally, creating potential supply risks later in the decade. He also added that regions with ongoing development momentum \u2014 including Brazil and Guyana \u2014 may play a stabilizing role if other producers struggle to maintain output.\n\u00a9 2025 Latin Times.

                "body": "Oil prices are limping into the final weeks of 2025 with Brent crude hovering just above $60 a barrel and traders fixated on one word: oversupply. As of Friday, December 12, Brent settled at about $61.12 per barrel and WTI at $57.44, both benchmarks down more than 4% for the week and sitting near their lowest levels in several years. [1]\nAt the same time, big agencies and Wall Street banks are rolling out fresh forecasts that increasingly point to sub\u2011$60 oil in 2026, even as OPEC insists the market will be roughly balanced next year. [2]\nThis article pulls together the latest December 2025 data, forecasts and analysis to sketch out a near\u2011term oil price forecast for December 2025, and what it might mean for 2026.\nWhere oil prices stand in mid\u2011December 2025\n- Spot prices:\n- Year\u2011to\u2011date performance:\nBrent has fallen roughly 18% in 2025 so far, while WTI is down close to 20%, as the market has steadily priced out the war\u2011driven risk premium of the early 2020s and refocused on swelling supply. [5] - Price levels vs recent history:\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that North Sea Dated crude (a physical benchmark related to Brent) averaged about $63.63 per barrel in November, its fifth monthly decline in a row and the longest losing streak in over a decade \u2014 effectively putting prices near four\u2011year lows. [6]\nIn short, December 2025 oil prices are weak, but not collapsing: Brent is holding around the low $60s, yet sentiment is sharply bearish because of what\u2019s happening in supply, demand and inventories.\nWhy the market has turned bearish going into December\n1. A supply surge colliding with only modest demand growth\nThe IEA\u2019s December 2025 Oil Market Report paints a clear picture:\n- Global oil demand is expected to rise by about 830,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and 860,000 bpd in 2026. [7]\n- But global oil supply is set to grow much faster \u2013 roughly 3 million bpd in 2025 and another 2.4 million bpd in 2026, driven heavily by non\u2011OPEC+ producers like the U.S., Brazil and Guyana. [8]\nThat imbalance is now showing up in stockpiles:\n- Observed global oil inventories hit around 8.03 billion barrels in October, the highest in four years, with stock builds averaging 1.2 million bpd in the first ten months of 2025. [9]\n- The IEA estimates the implied surplus at nearly 3.7 million bpd on average from Q4 2025 through 2026 \u2013 an unusually large overhang for this stage of the cycle. [10]\nThat\u2019s why recent IEA forecasts of a glut have become one of the main downward forces on prices this month.\n2. \u201cOil on water\u201d and the emerging \u201csuper glut\u201d narrative\nA big part of the story is where the barrels are sitting. The IEA highlights a surge in oil on water \u2014 crude in transit or temporarily floating \u2014 as sanctioned barrels struggle to find buyers and long\u2011haul shipments from the Americas to Asia jump. [11]\nPrivate\u2011sector and media analysis has picked this up and sharpened it:\n- A widely discussed Financial Times piece cites Trafigura\u2019s chief economist warning of a coming \u201csuper glut\u201d in 2026 as new supply projects ramp up while demand growth softens. He points to new output from Brazil and Guyana, cooling Chinese demand (partly due to EV adoption), and resilient U.S. supply. [12]\n- A detailed WRAL/FinancialContent analysis similarly describes a \u201csuper glut\u201d in crude, with non\u2011OPEC+ supply from the U.S., Brazil, Canada and Guyana consistently outpacing demand, while EV adoption and industrial slowdowns cap consumption. [13]\nTaken together, the narrative going into December is clear: there is simply too much oil around, and it\u2019s increasingly visible in both inventories and shipping data.\n3. Agencies now see lower average prices ahead\nThe latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Short\u2011Term Energy Outlook, released on December 9, 2025, explicitly bakes falling prices into its forecast: [14]\n- The EIA expects global oil inventories to keep rising through 2026, putting continuing downward pressure on prices.\n- It projects Brent cru"

Negotiations are set to continue on Monday.\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said \"a lot of progress was made,\" though additional details were not divulged.\nUkraine's military said on Friday that it attacked a major Russian oil refinery in Yaroslavl, northeast of Moscow; industry sources said the facility had suspended output.\nRussian state oil and gas revenue in December is likely to fall by nearly half from a year earlier to 410 billion roubles ($5.12B) due to lower crude prices and a stronger rouble, Reuters calculations showed on Friday.\nA possible peace deal could eventually increase Russian oil supply, which is currently sanctioned by Western countries.\nOn the supply side, U.S. energy firms last week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating for a second time in three weeks, energy services firm Baker said on Friday.\n(Reuters)\nOnly the headline is edited by Shafaq News."

                "body": "Latin America is expected to be a leading source of global oil supply growth in 2025 and 2026, with new production from Brazil and Guyana significantly expanding global output, according to forecasts from Oxford Economics.\nThe advisory firm projects that global oil production will reach about 106 million barrels per day in 2026, supported by a 1.6 million-barrel-per-day supply increase. Brazil and Guyana together are expected to contribute roughly 1.6 million barrels per day across 2025\u201326, making the region one of the strongest contributors outside the United States and the Middle East.\nThis expansion positions Latin America as one of the few regions delivering reliable medium-term supply growth, as Bloomberg explains. Oxford Economics notes that Brazil's offshore projects and Guyana's rapid development of the Stabroek block are reshaping the global production map, helping to generate a surplus that could keep prices in the high-$50 range next year.\nThe firm expects Brent crude to end 2026 near $58 per barrel.\nWhile U.S. shale remains an important factor in balancing the market, its growth is expected to moderate. The firm forecasts U.S. output to rise by about 400,000 barrels per day in 2026, far less than the combined contribution from Brazil and Guyana. The relative outperformance underscores Latin America's emerging role in supplying new barrels as other producers face declines or plateauing capacity.\nOPEC's planned easing of production cuts in the second half of 2026 could add additional barrels, but analysts say the bloc's contribution will not diminish the importance of Latin America's output trajectory. For global buyers, especially in Asia, the region is becoming an increasingly central source of medium-sour and light-sweet crude.\nLonger-term outlooks point to structural challenges that could elevate the region's importance even further. In a sprawling report by UAE's Khaleej Times framed around the Oxford Economics forecast, Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said that despite near-term abundance, the industry faces \"a deeper structural tension\" due to declining mature fields and insufficient investment.\nHansen warned that current price levels may not support the large upstream commitments needed globally, creating potential supply risks later in the decade. He also added that regions with ongoing development momentum \u2014 including Brazil and Guyana \u2014 may play a stabilizing role if other producers struggle to maintain output.\n\u00a9 2025 Latin Times.

This referred to market strategies and asset allocation shifts that gained traction immediately following Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the November 2024 United States (US) presidential election, carrying into early 2025 as his second term began.\nInvestor expectations centred on protectionism, fiscal expansion, deregulation and pro-business reforms \u2013 amplified by campaign promises for bold action in a Republican-controlled Congress. This created a bullish tilt toward assets perceived to benefit from higher growth and inflation, while pressuring those vulnerable to trade disruptions.\nBy March, this approach had begun to unravel as haphazard and overly aggressive tariff policies sparked recession and trade war fears. In addition, concerns grew over diminished central bank independence as Federal Reserve (Fed) faced political pressure to cut interest rates despite persistent inflation.\nAs economic growth and inflation moderated and the labour market cooled, Fed reduced rates three times by 25 basis points (bp) in September, October and December, bringing Fed funds rate to 3.50% - 3.75%. These cuts followed 100 bp of easing in 2024, materially reducing the US dollar's (USD) yield advantage.\nThe USD\u2019s performance in 2025 has been characterised by substantial volatility. The DXY trended lower through the year, down 9.1% year to date (YTD), though occasional safe-haven demand provided support during market uncertainty.\n2026 outlook\nThe DXY is expected to face considerable headwinds in 2026 as central bank policy divergence intensifies. We believe the DXY has potential to move towards the mid-90s range by the end of 2026, dependent on the following factors:\n- Fed and central banks\nThe Fed is anticipated to implement one to two rate cuts toward a neutral stance around 3.00% \u2013 3.25%, while other central banks pursue different trajectories. The Bank of Japan's (BoJ) gradual normalisation narrows the yield differential that has long supported USD strength against the Japanese yen. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank's (ECB) extended pause at 2.00% creates favourable conditions for modest euro appreciation as the Fed eases.\nUncertainty surrounding changes in Fed leadership adds another layer of negative sentiment toward the dollar as Jerome Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May.\n- Inflation\nHowever, dollar weakness remains contingent on inflation subsiding sufficiently to allow the anticipated easing. Should price pressures prove persistent, compelling the Fed to maintain restrictive policy longer than expected, DXY could find support near current levels.\nAUD/USD\n2025 performance overview\nAs we approach the end of 2025, AUD/USD is trading at 0.6640 \u2013 a 7.31% increase calendar year-to-date (CYTD) \u2013 and is set to break a four-year losing streak. Its impressive performance comes as USD, as measured by DXY, declined by 9.06% during the same timeframe.\nThe Australian dollar's (AUD) ascent and the greenback\u2019s decline can be attributed to several key factors. Firm commodity prices have played a role, notably the strong performance of iron ore, copper and gold, which has supported the commodity-dependent currency and Australian economy.\nMore importantly, however, Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) 75 bp of rate cuts from a peak of 4.35% to 3.60% this year was shallower than market anticipated. This was primarily due to rising inflation, resilient economic growth, employment and spending data.\nFinally, the dramatic improvement in risk sentiment that followed Liberation Day tariff lows in early April allowed AUD/USD, which is an integral part of the risk complex, to make a V-shaped recovery from "

Spot prices currently trade around the 1.1730 region, down less than 0.10% for the day.\nThe US Dollar (USD) edges higher during the Asian session on Monday and looks to build on last week's modest bounce from an over two-month low, which, in turn, is seen acting as a headwind for the EUR/USD pair. The USD uptick, however, lacks any obvious fundamental catalyst and is more likely to remain capped in the wake of dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations.\nThe US central bank last week signaled caution about further cuts after lowering borrowing costs for the third time this year. Traders, however, are still pricing in a greater possibility of two more rate cuts next year as signs of a weakening labor market are becoming increasingly evident. The prospect of a Trump-aligned Fed chair might keep a lid on the attempted USD recovery.\nUS President Donald Trump said that he had narrowed the list of contenders to replace Jerome Powell as the next Fed chair and expects his nominee to deliver interest-rate cuts. Trump's chief economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, is seen as the likely choice to succeed the current Fed chief. This might hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and support the EUR/USD pair.\nThe shared currency, on the other hand, continues to draw support from the growing acceptance that the European Central Bank (ECB) is done cutting interest rates. Traders, however, seem reluctant and opt to wait for the crucial ECB meeting on Thursday. Moreover, the delayed US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Tuesday should provide a fresh impetus to the EUR/USD pair.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Updated: December 14, 2025\nGBP/USD and EUR/USD rose last week as the dollar softened after a Fed rate cut. Here\u2019s what moved the pound, euro and USD \u2014 and what could drive prices in the week ahead.\nSterling and the euro ended the week firmer against the US dollar, extending a December upswing as markets digested the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest quarter-point rate cut and a run of weaker US data. But while GBP/USD advanced modestly, the pound lost ground against the euro, reflecting a softer UK growth picture and a market that is increasingly confident the Bank of England will cut rates at its next meeting.\nWith the ECB and the BoE both due on Thursday, December 18, and shutdown-delayed US jobs, retail sales and CPI data set to land, the week ahead is shaping up as one of the most consequential for GBP, EUR and USD pricinginto year-end. [1]\nLast week\u2019s prices in focus: GBP/USD, EUR/USD and GBP/EUR (week of Dec 8\u201314, 2025)\nBecause FX trading is thin over weekends, \u201clast week\u201d in market terms largely refers to Monday, Dec 8 through Friday, Dec 12 (with limited movement recorded on Dec 13\u201314).\nWhere the majors traded\n- GBP/USD (Pound to Dollar):\nOpened the week around 1.3325 and closed Friday near 1.3373, after trading roughly 1.3288\u20131.3434 during the week\u2019s sessions. [2]\nWeekly change (approx.): +0.36%. - EUR/USD (Euro to Dollar):\nOpened near 1.1640 and ended Friday around 1.1743. [3]\nFXStreet noted EUR/USD reached about 1.1762 during the week, finishing only a handful of pips below that level. [4]\nWeekly change (approx., using closes): +0.88%. - GBP/EUR (Pound to Euro):\nThe pound started near 1.1448 and ended Friday around 1.1388, implying euro strength versus sterling through the week. [5]\nWeekly change (approx.): -0.52%.\nWhat that means in plain terms: the US dollar weakened broadly, lifting both GBP/USD and EUR/USD, but the euro outperformed sterling on the week.\nWhat moved USD last week: Fed cut + \u201clate\u201d US data + fragile confidence in the dollar\nThe clearest driver of last week\u2019s FX move was the Federal Reserve\u2019s quarter-point cut, delivered midweek, which pushed the dollar lower as traders weighed how much additional easing may still be ahead. [6]\nAt the same time, markets were working through a messy US macro backdrop. Reuters flagged that the dollar slide was reinforced by weaker US figures (including jobless claims) and shifting expectations around the Fed\u2019s path, while also noting Fed liquidity operations that added to the broader \u201cdollar down\u201d narrative. [7]\nING\u2019s strategy team summed up the bigger picture: the DXY dollar index is ending the year down roughly 9%, with investors surprised by the resilience of US trading partners and fading US \u201cexceptionalism,\u201d and with seasonal forces potentially keeping the dollar soft into year-end. [8]\nWhy it matters for GBP/USD and EUR/USD:\nWhen markets price a lower US rate outlook, the dollar typically loses some of its yield advantage \u2014 and the currencies most sensitive to global rate spreads (like EUR and GBP) often benefit.\nWhat moved GBP last week: UK growth disappointment and rising confidence in a BoE cut\nSterling began the week cautiously as traders braced for \u201can action-packed week\u201d that included the Fed decision and UK data, with Reuters noting the pound had recently climbed to multi-week highs helped by improving sentiment after the UK budget and by expectations for a softer dollar. [9]\nBut by the end of the week, the UK macro picture looked shakier.\nReuters reported the UK economy contracted 0.1% month-on-month in October, and that output fell 0.1% across August\u2013October, a backdrop that left the pound softer against the euro even as it held up against the dollar. [10]\nMeanwhile, the rate story has become increasingly one-sided:\n- A Reuters poll found all economists surveyed expected the BoE to cut by 25 bps to 3.75% on December 18, with many anticipating additional cuts into early 2026. [11]\n- Reuters also reported that money markets were already heavily leaning toward a D"

The currency pair like the EUR/USD had been showing signs of incremental gains the past few weeks and was forecast to struggle after the Federal Reserve\u2019s FOMC Statement this past week. But something curious happened, instead of seeing selling build after the anticipated interest rate cut from the U.S central bank, the GBP/USD solidified upwards.\nWhat some viewed as an opportunity to sell the results already traded previously into the GBP/USD based on the anticipated interest rate cut that did in fact take place, because there was an expectation the Fed would sound cautious during the FOMC Statement \u2013 which in fact happened too \u2013 something odd was seen.\nFinancial institutions didn\u2019t act on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s rhetoric. Instead financial institutions seemed to acknowledge in mass that they understand a potentially more dovish Fed may be seen in a handful of months. Because Jerome Powell will not be in charge of the Federal Reserve after May of 2026.\nTop Forex Brokers\nChanges to Come and Changes to Outlook\nNo, the GBP/USD has not climbed back to its higher water marks seen in August, September and October of this year, but the currency pair has shown an ability to sustain the gains it has made since late November. The GBP/USD was near 1.30250 on the 21st of November. The upwards movement which occurred this past Wednesday did see buying produce highs around 1.34225 on Thursday which sold off, but again the momentum higher after the Fed\u2019s FOMC rhetoric did surprise many traders which caused some speculators to express dismay.\nWhile the Fed said they would be cautious this past week, there are folks who believe that new Fed leadership in late spring and early summer of 2026 may produce a different interest rate philosophy. The Bank of England will conduct its own interest rate decision on the 18th, this coming Thursday, and is expected to reduce cut 25 basis points. Intriguingly, inflation in the U.K does remain a concern and CPI results will be published the day before on Wednesday of this coming week, a result of 3.50% is anticipated per the year on year number.\n1.34000 as a Target Too High\nTraders need to remember the Christmas holiday is quickly approaching. This will be the last full week of trading before the holiday season starts.\n- The central bank decisions from the BoE, the ECB and BoJ this week will affect Forex, but the Fed has spoken already and this may make what the Bank of England does and the others less meaningful.\n- Day traders saw the 1.34000 level hit on Thursday, but they should be rather cautious in the coming days about recapturing the loss territory.\n- Nervous results have been a dominant feature in the broad markets the past few weeks.\n- While the GBP/USD has incrementally climbed, outlook may start to look fuzzy as the holidays approach and sentiment is put to the test.\nGBP/USD Weekly Outlook:\nSpeculative price range for GBP/USD is 1.33085 to 1.34590\nThe movement lower on Friday in the GBP/USD suggested that some financial houses may believe the gains made on Wednesday and Thursday were a bit too strong. Perhaps the GBP/USD will see choppy results these first couple of days that is conservative, based on the knowledge the Bank of England is about to step up to the limelight on Thursday.\nHowever, as the holidays approach this will also add to a layer of caution. Yet, because of lower volumes which develop during the Christmas and New Year holidays technical surprises frequently are exhibited which show velocity. So once again, maybe the upside movement of Wednesday and Thursday of last week was a bit of a signal that some financial institutions believe a higher GBP/USD could develop. Day traders should be conservative and be willing to cash out profitable moves before reversals via intraday results cause wasted opportunities early this week.\nReady to trade our weekly forecast?

                "body": "Australian Dollar Outlook: Momentum Fades as US Data Takes Centre Stage\nAustralian Dollar Outlook: AUD Momentum, Seasonality and Key Market Drivers\nAustralian Dollar Performance\nA closer look at the Australian dollar\u2019s performance against its FX peers suggests the post-RBA hawkish enthusiasm may be stalling. While a fresh catalyst may be needed to extend gains, December seasonality could still provide a modest tailwind into year-end.\n- AUD/USD rose for a third consecutive week on diverging RBA\u2013Fed policy expectations, though bullish momentum is starting to fade\n- AUD/JPY reached a 3.5-year high but remains hesitant above the 104 level\n- AUD/NZD continues to consolidate below 1.15 following a sharp multi-week advance\n- AUD/CHF snapped a three-week winning streak\n- The Australian dollar also weakened against the euro and British pound\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nAustralia This Week: Economic Data and Events for AUD/USD Traders\nFed Cut Leaves USD Direction Data-Dependent\nThe Fed delivered a 25bp cut as expected, though divisions within the committee over future easing are evident. Three FOMC members dissented: one favoured a larger cut, while two preferred no cut at all. Incoming data will therefore play a key role in shaping near-term expectations for further cuts in H1, with direct implications for the US dollar \u2014 and by extension the Australian dollar.\nUS data continues to be backfilled, with this week\u2019s calendar split into two clear clusters. NFP, retail sales and flash PMIs are released on Wednesday, followed by two key inflation reports \u2014 CPI and PCE \u2014 late on Friday.\n- S&P Global PMIs remain elevated, signalling solid economic growth, although the pace of expansion slowed in November\n- Services inflation cooled at its fastest pace in 21 months, according to the latest ISM report\n- Doves will be watching whether NFP mirrors the recent softness seen in ADP payrolls\nRBA Speech Unlikely to Shift Policy Focus From Data\nWhile RBA Assistant Governor Kent speaks on Tuesday, the address is unlikely to include any commentary on monetary policy. That said, further guidance may not be necessary. The RBA has made it clear that incoming data between now and February \u2014 particularly the quarterly CPI release in late January \u2014 will be critical. With February flagged as a potentially live meeting, AUD/USD traders should pay close attention to this week\u2019s flash PMI reports for early signals on inflation, growth and employment.\nAUD/USD December Seasonality: Average Returns and Win Rates\nOver the past 20 years, AUD/USD has posted an average December return of 0.79%, although the median return is close to flat at 0.08%. The 56% win rate gives bulls only a modest statistical edge overall.\nA closer look at average daily returns within December shows the bullish bias tends to emerge from around 20 December onwards. From that point, most sessions deliver positive average returns, with win rates consistently above 50%. Both returns and win rates typically strengthen further from Christmas Eve through to New Year\u2019s Eve, aligning with well-known year-end seasonality patterns.\nBy contrast, the current week has historically produced negative average returns, even though the win rate during this period remains mixed rather than decisively bearish.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: ABS, LSEG\nAUD/USD Correlations\n- The 20-day inverse correlation between the Australian dollar and the US dollar (DXY) remains strong at -0.86, although it has weakened over the near term, with the 10-day correlation easing to -0.53. This suggests the USD relationship is becoming less reliable for short-term signals.\n- A similar pattern is evident with risk assets \u2014 using the S&P 500 as a proxy \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, the Chinese yuan, where correlations have moderated at shorter lookbacks.\n- By contrast, the historical link with copper has broken down, with the 10-day correlation slipping to -0.20, indicating little to no relationship in the near ter"

                "body": "- The AUD/USD forecast appears neutral after the dismal Chinese data.\n- Australian employment data revealing weakness puts RBA in doubts about keeping tighter monetary policy.\n- The markets await US NFP data due on Tuesday for further impetus.\nThe AUD/USD price opened the week slightly lower, trading near mid-0.6600 in Asian hours on Monday as weak Chinese economic data dampened sentiment. The move followed a disappointing set of November releases from China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, reinforcing concerns about fragile demand conditions.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about copy trading platforms? Check our detailed guide-\nChina\u2019s retail sales rose just 1.3% YoY, well below expectations for a near-3% increase, while industrial production slowed to 4.8% from October\u2019s 4.9%. Fixed asset investment also missed forecasts, pointing to ongoing hesitation among consumers and businesses despite repeated policy support measures. Aussie came under mild pressure, as a reaction to dismal Chinese growth data.\nDomestic factors have also weighed on the currency. The Australian dollar has eased over the past two sessions after labor market data showed a sharp deterioration in November. Employment fell by 21.3k jobs, compared to expected solid gains, raising questions about whether earlier economic resilience is starting to fade.\nAlthough the Reserve Bank of Australia has recently warned that inflation risks remain elevated, the weak jobs report has reduced confidence in the near-term tighter policy.\nEven so, AUD/USD losses remain contained by a broadly softer US dollar. The greenback continues to struggle as investors position for a more accommodative Fed path than policymakers currently signal. Although the Fed\u2019s latest projections point to just one rate cut next year, market pricing suggests extended easing further into 2026, especially if labor market conditions continue to cool. That expectation has kept US yields under pressure and limited the dollar\u2019s ability to rebound.\nThe next key test for the pair will come from US labor data, with the delayed Nonfarm Payrolls report due on Tuesday. Forecasts center on a modest rise in employment. Any downside surprise would reinforce expectations for further Fed easing, adding pressure on the dollar. In that scenario, AUD/USD could stabilize despite weak domestic fundamentals. On the other hand, a stronger-than-expected jobs report would give the dollar a lift and could drag the pair back toward recent lows.\nBeyond the US data, traders will continue to watch developments in China after authorities signaled plans to issue ultra-long-term bonds in 2026 to support growth initiatives. This offers some longer-term reassurance, but markets remain focused on near-term activity data, where momentum is still lacking.\nFor now, AUD/USD sits at the intersection of soft China-linked fundamentals and a hesitant US dollar, leaving the pair sensitive to incoming data short-term swings rather than a clear trend.\nAUD/USD Technical Forecast: Caught Between 20 and 50 MAs\nThe 4-hour chart shows the price trapped between the 20-period and 50-period MAs near the 0.6650 area. Meanwhile, the RSI stays around the 50.0 level, revealing no clear bias. Though the pair remains supported by 50-period MA and order block zone, the upside trend lacks momentum below 0.6700.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about scalping forex brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nThe immediate support for the pair lies at 0.6630 minor demand area ahead of December swing lows near 0.6610 and then 100-period MA around 0.6570.

                "body": "Japanese Yen builds on intraday gains amid hawkish BoJ expectations and softer risk tone\n- The Japanese Yen kicks off the new week on a positive note amid rising BoJ rate hike bets.\n- A softer risk tone further benefits the safe-haven JPY, while a dovish Fed weighs on the USD.\n- Traders keenly await this week\u2019s important US macro releases and the BoJ policy meeting.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) attracts fresh buyers at the start of a new week as an improvement in business confidence backs the case for further policy tightening by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). This comes on top of a shift in rhetoric from BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and reaffirms bets for an imminent rate hike later this week. Apart from this, a slight deterioration in the global risk sentiment turns out to be another factor underpinning the JPY's safe-haven status.\nHowever, worries about Japan's deteriorating fiscal condition, amid Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's massive spending plan, might hold back the JPY bulls from placing fresh bets. The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, languishes near a two-month low, touched last Thursday, in the wake of rising bets for two more rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). This marks a significant divergence compared to hawkish BoJ expectations, which drags the USD/JPY pair to the 155.25 area during the Asian session and backs the case for a further near-term depreciating move.\nJapanese Yen continues to be underpinned by hawkish BoJ expectations\n- According to the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey released earlier this Monday, the business confidence index at large manufacturers in Japan rose to 15 in the fourth quarter of 2025 from 14.0 in the previous quarter. Further details revealed that the large Manufacturing Outlook arrived at 15.0 vs 12.0 prior.\n- Commenting on the Tankan survey, a senior BoJ official said that Japanese firms cited easing uncertainty around US trade policy and resilient demand in high-tech sectors as key factors supporting business sentiment. Firms cited pass-through of costs and robust demand as factors brightening the business outlook.\n- Moreover, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda recently said that the central bank is getting closer to attaining its inflation target. This reaffirms market bets for an imminent BoJ interest rate hike at the end of the December 18-19 policy meeting and backs the case for further policy tightening going into 2026.\n- Moreover, reports suggest that top officials in Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s cabinet are unlikely to oppose a BoJ rate hike. Traders, however, seem reluctant to place bullish bets around the Japanese Yen and opt to wait for more cues about the BoJ's future policy path before positioning for further gains.\n- Hence, the focus will remain glued to Ueda\u2019s post-meeting press conference on Friday. In the meantime, Takaichi's massive spending plan has exacerbated concerns about Japan's public finances amid sluggish economic growth, which, in turn, is seen as another factor acting as a headwind for the JPY.\n- The US Dollar, on the other hand, struggles to attract any meaningful buyers and languishes near a two-month low touched last Thursday amid dovish Federal Reserve expectations. The Fed signaled caution about further rate cuts, though traders are pricing in two more interest rate cuts next year.\n- Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said that he had narrowed the list of contenders to replace Jerome Powell as the next Fed chair and expects his nominee to deliver interest-rate cuts. The prospect of a Trump-aligned Fed chair keeps the USD bulls on the defensive and caps the USD/JPY pair.\n- Traders also seem reluctant ahead of this week's important US macro releases \u2013 including the delayed Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for October on Tuesday and the latest inflation figures on Thursday. In the meantime, the divergent BoJ-Fed outlooks might continue to support the lower-yielding JPY.\nUSD/JPY bears might await break below 155.00 before placing fresh bets\nFrom a technical pe"

The US dollar weakened against the Japanese yen as the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next year, with further speeches anticipated from Fed officials.\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates in December, which was in line with expectations, but the tone from Chair Jerome Powell was interpreted less decisively than anticipated, leading to some pressure on the US dollar against the yen. Economic projections suggested only one more rate reduction by 2026, affecting the market dynamics.\nPotential Fed Chair Candidates\nIn the US, President Trump mentioned Kevin Warsh as a lead candidate for the Fed Chair position, with others still in contention. Meanwhile, the market is adjusting to the potential for the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to increase interest rates on Friday, which might support the yen.\nJapan\u2019s economy faces challenges, particularly concerning public finances due to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s spending plan, which could impact the yen\u2019s strength. Factors driving the yen include BoJ policies, US-Japanese bond yield differentials, and its status as a safe-haven currency during market stress.\nThe US dollar is weakening against the Japanese yen as we head into the second half of December 2025. Last week\u2019s Federal Reserve interest rate cut has set a dovish tone for the dollar. This trend is amplified by strong expectations that the Bank of Japan will finally deliver an interest rate hike this Friday.\nWe\u2019ve seen the US 10-year Treasury yield fall towards 3.60% following the Fed\u2019s decision, narrowing its gap with the Japanese 10-year government bond yield, which has risen to near 0.95%. This shrinking yield differential makes holding dollars less attractive compared to the yen. Recent data showed US Core PCE, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, cooled to 2.8% in November, reinforcing the case for the Fed\u2019s easier policy stance.\nDetermining BoJ\u2019s Impact\nIn contrast, Japan\u2019s economy is showing signs that support a tighter monetary policy. Data from November showed Tokyo Core CPI holding firm at 2.5%, remaining above the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target for well over a year. This sustained inflation provides the BoJ with the justification it needs to move away from the ultra-loose policies that have defined its strategy for much of the last decade.\nGiven the high anticipation surrounding Friday\u2019s BoJ meeting, implied volatility on USD/JPY options has increased significantly. Buying puts to bet on a further fall in the currency pair is now expensive. Traders could instead look at selling out-of-the-money call options or implementing bear call spreads to benefit from a declining or range-bound price while collecting premium.\nHowever, we must be cautious about a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact\u201d reaction to the BoJ\u2019s decision. If the central bank delivers a smaller-than-expected hike or signals a very slow pace for future increases, the yen could quickly give back its recent gains. Concerns over Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s massive spending plans could also make the BoJ hesitant to tighten policy too aggressively.\nLooking at the latest Commitment of Traders report, we\u2019ve seen large speculators reduce their net short positions on the yen for the third consecutive week. This signals that the market is already shifting its positioning in anticipation of a stronger yen. The main risk now is whether the BoJ\u2019s actions on Friday will match these heightened market expectations."

                "body": "The Japanese yen has begun to recover from initial post-data weakness following the release of the Bank of Japan\u2019s December Tankan survey and subsequent comments from a BOJ official, as markets increasingly lean toward the possibility of a policy rate hike later this week.\nThe Tankan survey showed corporate sentiment holding up better than expected, with large manufacturers\u2019 confidence steady at +15 and smaller firms outperforming forecasts. Capital expenditure plans remained firm, inflation expectations stayed anchored at 2.4% across one-, three- and five-year horizons, and labour shortages persisted, all elements consistent with the BOJ\u2019s narrative that underlying price pressures remain intact.\nFollow-up comments from a BOJ official added further colour. Firms cited easing uncertainty around U.S. trade policy, a smaller-than-feared impact from U.S. tariffs, improved cost pass-through and robust demand linked to artificial intelligence and semiconductor investment as factors supporting business conditions. While companies also flagged rising labour costs, worker shortages and weaker consumption due to higher prices, the balance of commentary suggested resilience rather than deterioration in corporate fundamentals.\nTaken together, the data and responses appear to strengthen the case for another step toward policy normalisation at the BOJ\u2019s December 18/19 meeting. The combination of stable sentiment, firm capex intentions and anchored inflation expectations supports the view that Japan\u2019s economy can absorb modestly tighter policy, even as profit growth moderates.\nIn currency markets, the initial reaction was counterintuitive. The yen weakened following the Tankan release, with USD/JPY briefly climbing above 155.95. However, as markets digested the details and the BOJ commentary, the yen began to strengthen, with USD/JPY pulling back below 155.60.\nThe price action suggests a market still cautious but increasingly sensitive to any signal that the BOJ may move sooner rather than later. With positioning heavily skewed toward yen weakness, even incremental confirmation of a December hike risks triggering further short-covering.\nThe evolving BoJ rate hike narrative, reinforced by Tankan data and corporate feedback, is shifting expectations. If the BOJ does move this week, it would mark another meaningful step away from ultra-loose policy and could provide further support for the yen, particularly if accompanied by guidance that policy normalisation will continue gradually into 2026."

The key catalyst was a subdued US dollar amid softening labor market indicators, including jobless claims and weaker private hiring, combined with improved risk sentiment.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about copy trading platforms? Check our detailed guide-\nThe markets responded to the Fed\u2019s 25-basis-point easing, followed by dovish signals, reiterating the cooling labor market. Market participants now anticipate two more cuts by mid-year, which will weigh on US yields and drag the dollar lower across the board.\nFrom Canada, the momentum is not booming, though; it continues to highlight relative stability. Recent data reveal steady employment and wage growth, encouraging the Bank of Canada to pause the easing. The BoC in the last meeting showed a data-dependent approach, revealing less urgency to signal aggressive easing. This contrasts with the Fed\u2019s more accommodative stance, which widens the policy divergence and favors the CAD over the USD.\nMeanwhile, oil prices, being a key driver of CAD, remain steady under the $60.0 mark, providing a tangible floor for the Canadian dollar. However, concerns about oversupply keep oil gains limited, with a risk of falling below the $50.0 mark in 2026. This could restrict the USD/CAD downside, pushing the pair into a consolidation phase.\nMoving forward to the next week, the USD/CAD could see huge volatility as Canada\u2019s CPI data is due. A strong inflation reading would reduce the odds of front-loaded BoC cuts, lending CAD a fresh boost. On the other hand, the US CPI remains a focal point for traders. A downside surprise could cement the case for the Fed\u2019s earlier cuts into 2026. However, reflation could unwind some dovish bets, temporarily lifting the USD/CAD. Meanwhile, the US NFP data is also crucial to monitor, as the Fed has expressed concerns about the persistently deteriorating labor market conditions.\nUSD/CAD Key Releases Next Week:\n- US NFP\n- US CPI\n- US Retail Sales\n- US Jobless Claims\n- Fed speeches\n- Canada CPI\nOverall, next week\u2019s narrative hinges on whether incoming US data confirms a cooling economy. If so, USD/CAD could extend lower, but oil volatility and CPI prints remain the wildcards.\nUSD/CAD Weekly Technical Forecast: Bearish Crossovers and Oversold RSI\nThe USD/CAD is gradually heading towards a key support level at 1.3720, as the 100- and 200-day MAs, along with the 20- and 50-day MAs, have formed a bearish crossover. However, the RSI has reached the oversold zone, which could initiate the consolidation phase before any directional move.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about scalping forex brokers?

This way, borrowing costs were brought to their lowest level since 2022.\nBut, the vote was divided, as three FOMC members continued to vote against the rate reduction.\nStephen Miran voted in favor of a larger 50 bps cut, while Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid voted for keeping interest rates on hold.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said at the press conference that the central bank\u2019s rate policy was well positioned to respond to whatever lies ahead for the economy. However, Powell did not offer any guidance on the timing of the next rate cut.\nFOMC policy makers signaled just one 25 bps rate cut for next year, or the same projection as in September.\nHowever, new signs of US labor market softness only added to investor expectations of two Fed interest rate cuts next year. US initial jobless claims rose by 44,000 to 236,000 during the week ending December 6th, exceeding market expectations. It has been the sharpest weekly rise since March 2020.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Canada kept its benchmark interest rate intact at 2.25% at its December 10th policy meeting, in line with market consensus.\nGDP growth surprised to the upside, with economy expanding 2.6% in the third quarter, and the labor market improved, with the unemployment rate slipping to 6.5% in November.\nConsumer inflation eased to 2.2% in October and policy makers judged measures of core inflation were still within the 2.5% to 3% range.\nThe BoC Governing Council said it viewed the current policy rate about right to keep inflation near 2%, while supporting the economy through this period of structural adjustment.\nThe major Forex pair lost 0.30% for the week."

                "body": "Updated: Dec. 14, 2025\nCanada\u2019s stock market heads into the new week with the S&P/TSX Composite still near record territory\u2014but with an important reality check right around the corner: inflation data.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange benchmark finished Friday at 31,527.39, down 0.4% on the day as technology stocks slid, yet still up 0.7% for the week\u2014a resilient showing after a series of record closes earlier in the week. [1]\nNow the focus shifts to Canada\u2019s November CPI, due Monday, and what it may signal for the Bank of Canada\u2019s next move (and for rate-sensitive TSX sectors like financials, real estate, and consumer names). [2]\nWhere the TSX stands heading into the week\nThe TSX has had a standout 2025. Earlier in the week, Reuters noted the index was up more than 25% for the year, positioning it for its best year since 2009. [3]\nWhat\u2019s important for the week ahead is that the market\u2019s leadership has broadened beyond a single theme. In fact, the TSX\u2019s four biggest groups\u2014financials, energy, technology, and materials\u2014collectively represent about 77% of the index\u2019s market capitalization, and all have posted gains since the start of 2025. [4]\nThat diversification has helped stabilize Canada\u2019s benchmark through rotations that have been more disruptive elsewhere\u2014especially when global investors start questioning whether tech valuations are running too hot.\nLast week\u2019s story (Dec. 8\u201312): records, rotation, and a tech shakeout\nMonday: profit-taking ahead of central bank decisions\nThe TSX began the week lower as investors booked gains and waited for major rate decisions. The index closed down 0.45% at 31,169.97, pressured by metal and mining shares. [5]\nA notable corporate highlight: Transcontinental surged after agreeing to sell its packaging unit to ProAmpac in a deal valued at C$2.22 billion including debt, underscoring that deal-making remains active even late in the year. [6]\nTuesday: materials lift, silver hits a record, and Teck\u2019s mega-merger advances\nThe TSX edged up 0.2% to 31,244.37, supported by mining shares as silver jumped to a record. [7]\nThe session also carried major deal news: shareholders approved the previously announced merger between Anglo American and Teck Resources, leaving regulatory approvals as the key remaining hurdle. [8]\nOn the growth theme, Reuters also flagged a $20 billion AI infrastructure joint venture involving Brookfield and Qatar-owned AI company Qai, a reminder that global AI capital spending continues to ripple into TSX-linked infrastructure and alternative asset platforms. [9]\nWednesday: central banks deliver\u2014TSX breaks to a fresh record close\nThe week\u2019s major macro event landed Wednesday. The TSX jumped 0.8% to a record close of 31,490.85 after both the Bank of Canada held and the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter point and signaled a likely pause in further reductions. [10]\nFinancials rose (including a strong move in Toronto-Dominion Bank), while Shopify helped drive technology higher on the day. [11]\nThursday: metals power another record; \u201cAI bubble\u201d worries re-emerge\nThe TSX notched yet another record close, finishing up 0.5% at 31,660.73, as rising metal prices pushed materials higher. [12]\nBut even in a record-setting session, the tape showed tension: technology declined as Oracle\u2019s results revived broader concerns about an AI-driven valuation bubble. [13]\nFriday: tech slides, cannabis surges, and CPI becomes the next catalyst\nFriday\u2019s pullback had a clear driver: tech weakness. The technology sector fell 3.4%, with Celestica down 12.9%. [14]\nAt the same time, healthcare became the standout, surging 8.9%, as Curaleaf jumped 37.8% after a Washington Post report suggested U.S. President Donald Trump was expected to push for dramatically looser federal restrictions on marijuana. [15]\nThat kind of cross-sector divergence is exactly what makes the upcoming week pivotal: investors are still willing to rotate risk\u2014but macro data will determine which rotations stick.\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s mes"

While a fresh catalyst may be needed to extend gains, December seasonality could still provide a modest tailwind into year-end.\n- AUD/USD rose for a third consecutive week on diverging RBA\u2013Fed policy expectations, though bullish momentum is starting to fade\n- AUD/JPY reached a 3.5-year high but remains hesitant above the 104 level\n- AUD/NZD continues to consolidate below 1.15 following a sharp multi-week advance\n- AUD/CHF snapped a three-week winning streak\n- The Australian dollar also weakened against the euro and British pound\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nAustralia This Week: Economic Data and Events for AUD/USD Traders\nFed Cut Leaves USD Direction Data-Dependent\nThe Fed delivered a 25bp cut as expected, though divisions within the committee over future easing are evident. Three FOMC members dissented: one favoured a larger cut, while two preferred no cut at all. Incoming data will therefore play a key role in shaping near-term expectations for further cuts in H1, with direct implications for the US dollar \u2014 and by extension the Australian dollar.\nUS data continues to be backfilled, with this week\u2019s calendar split into two clear clusters. NFP, retail sales and flash PMIs are released on Wednesday, followed by two key inflation reports \u2014 CPI and PCE \u2014 late on Friday.\n- S&P Global PMIs remain elevated, signalling solid economic growth, although the pace of expansion slowed in November\n- Services inflation cooled at its fastest pace in 21 months, according to the latest ISM report\n- Doves will be watching whether NFP mirrors the recent softness seen in ADP payrolls\nRBA Speech Unlikely to Shift Policy Focus From Data\nWhile RBA Assistant Governor Kent speaks on Tuesday, the address is unlikely to include any commentary on monetary policy. That said, further guidance may not be necessary. The RBA has made it clear that incoming data between now and February \u2014 particularly the quarterly CPI release in late January \u2014 will be critical. With February flagged as a potentially live meeting, AUD/USD traders should pay close attention to this week\u2019s flash PMI reports for early signals on inflation, growth and employment.\nAUD/USD December Seasonality: Average Returns and Win Rates\nOver the past 20 years, AUD/USD has posted an average December return of 0.79%, although the median return is close to flat at 0.08%. The 56% win rate gives bulls only a modest statistical edge overall.\nA closer look at average daily returns within December shows the bullish bias tends to emerge from around 20 December onwards. From that point, most sessions deliver positive average returns, with win rates consistently above 50%. Both returns and win rates typically strengthen further from Christmas Eve through to New Year\u2019s Eve, aligning with well-known year-end seasonality patterns.\nBy contrast, the current week has historically produced negative average returns, even though the win rate during this period remains mixed rather than decisively bearish.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: ABS, LSEG\nAUD/USD Correlations\n- The 20-day inverse correlation between the Australian dollar and the US dollar (DXY) remains strong at -0.86, although it has weakened over the near term, with the 10-day correlation easing to -0.53. This suggests the USD relationship is becoming less reliable for short-term signals.\n- A similar pattern is evident with risk assets \u2014 using the S&P 500 as a proxy \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, the Chinese yuan, where correlations have moderated at shorter lookbacks.\n- By contrast, the historical link with copper has broken down, with the 10-day correlation slipping to -0.20, indicating little to no relationship in the near term.\n- The standout remains NZD/USD, which continues to show a strong posi"

These zones coincide with a rising trend line that has been providing dynamic support throughout the uptrend, creating a confluence of technical support that could prove attractive to buyers.\nA larger correction could still reach the 61.8% Fib at 202.87, which aligns closely with the 200 SMA (red line) dynamic support. This level might be the line in the sand for a bullish pullback scenario.\nIf any of the Fibonacci levels hold as a floor, GBPJPY could resume the rally to retest the swing high near 208.95 or push even higher toward establishing fresh peaks.\nThe 100 SMA (blue line) is above the 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the upside or that the climb is more likely to gain traction than to reverse. The gap between the indicators remains wide, reflecting sustained bullish momentum despite the recent pullback. Price is also moving above both moving averages, so these could hold as dynamic support on further dips.\nStochastic has reached the oversold region and appears to be forming a base, indicating exhaustion among sellers. A turn higher from these levels would show a return in bullish pressure and could coincide with a bounce off the Fibonacci support zone.\nRSI is also approaching oversold territory, suggesting that bears may be running out of steam. The oscillator has room to climb before reaching the midpoint, so a reversal from current levels could fuel sustained buying momentum."

                "body": "USD/JPY\nThe US dollar has been grinding back and forth against the Japanese yen for the better part of the month, and this past week was no different. At this point, it looks like we are trying to sort out where to go next. The \u00a5155 level looks to be important, right along with the \u00a5158 level. We have been in a significant uptrend, but if we can break above the 150 a.m. level, then it opens up the US dollar to much higher pricing. On the other hand, if we drop below the \u00a5155 level, we could see the market test the \u00a5153 level, an area that is significant support.\nUSD/ZAR\nThe US dollar tried to rally during the course of the trading week, breaking back above the 17 ZAR level, but then turned around to show signs of negativity. At this point, it looks as if the US dollar is trying to break down against the South African Rand, which makes a certain amount of sense considering that commodities are starting to per copy even further. South Africa is a major exporter of gold and other precious metals, as well as hard commodities, and therefore, marrying that with a higher interest rate coming out of South Africa suggests that we could continue to drop.\nEUR/USD\nThe euro has rallied quite nicely against the US dollar during the trading week as the markets are trying to determine whether or not the Federal Reserve is actually going to start loosening monetary policy, or if it was a \u201chawkish cut.\u201d This causes chaos, and quite frankly, I think this is a pair that probably remains somewhat range-bound between now and the end of the year, but if we were to break above the 1.1850 level, then one would have to assume that the euro is going to continue to strengthen, and by extension, the US dollar probably shrinks against most other currencies.\nTop Forex Brokers\nAUD/USD\nThe Australian dollar has been all over the place against the US dollar, but it looks as if the 0.67 level is going to continue to be significant resistance. For me, this is one of the easier trades to take next week, because, quite frankly, if you short this pair and are wrong, then it\u2019s an obvious and major bullish move. With that being the case, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility, but if we were to break above the 0.87 level, then it\u2019s possible that we will go much higher. At this point, I think you have a situation where the market could drop to 0.6550, possibly even down to the 0.65 level.\nGBP/USD\nThe British pound rallied initially against the US dollar, but quite frankly, as we close out the week, it seems to have shown a little bit of hesitation. Because of this, it looks like the 1.34 level will continue to be important resistance, and until we can clear that on at least a daily close, if not a weekly candlestick, I\u2019m not convinced that the British pound is going to go much higher. In fact, it is starting to set up as a potential sell signal at the moment. The 1.32 level underneath should be support, but if that gives way to selling pressure, we will probably drop toward the 1.30 level again. Keep in mind that the Bank of England is expected to start selling, so it\u2019ll be interesting to read the statement and press conference results.\nUSD/CHF\nAt the end of the week, we have seen a little bit of US dollar stability against the Swiss franc, and I think this makes a certain amount of signs of strength and stability, if not a massive hard floor. This makes a certain amount of sense as the Swiss National Bank is likely to intervene if the Swiss franc strengthens too rapidly. In fact, they have already threatened to do so, and I think the 0.79 level continues to be the floor at the moment. In other words, a bounce in this pair would make a certain amount of sense, especially when you look at the hesitation of the euro and the British pound to strengthen against the US dollar on Friday.\nBitcoin\nBitcoin continues to look as if it is going to grind sideways, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see whether or not that continues.

IBIT reached that mark \u201c5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days,\u201d Balchunas wrote on X, referring to asset manager State Street\u2019s famous gold ETF.\nWhile other asset managers like Fidelity and VanEck also offer Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock\u2019s version is the largest by far. After IBIT\u2019s $70 billion in total assets, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC comes in second with $20 billion and Grayscale\u2019s GBTC comes in third with just under $20 billion.\nETFs are a type of investment vehicle, traded on the stock market, that track the price of one or more underlying assets. The fees ETF issuers charge are usually less than mutual funds and offer a simple way to diversify an investment portfolio. Before the introduction of crypto ETFs last year, Invesco\u2019s QQQ trust ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq, and Vanguard\u2019s VOO ETF, which tracks the S&P 500, were among the most popular.\nIBIT and 10 other Bitcoin ETFs from various companies launched at the beginning of last year after gaining long-awaited regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The debut of the first Bitcoin ETFs showcased strong investor demand for access to the cryptocurrency\u2019s price movements, with IBIT accumulating over $1 billion in assets under management within its first four days on the market.\nAdvertisement\nBy November, BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF had surpassed its gold fund in total assets, becoming the largest of the 1,400 funds the asset manager offers globally.\nBut the record-breaking did not slow down after that. In December, IBIT became the fastest ETF to hit $50 billion in assets under management, five times quicker than BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF which took nearly four years and invests in companies outside of the U.S. and Canada, according to Balchunas.\n\u201cIBIT\u2019s growth is unprecedented,\u201d Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart told the outlet at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class.\u201d\nSince their launch last January, increased flows into Bitcoin ETFs have coincided with increases in the currency\u2019s price. For example, as Bitcoin hit an all-time of $111,900 in late May, the total net assets across all 12 Bitcoin ETFs reached an all-time high of over $134 billion.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

                "body": "Will the Bitcoin Cycle Survive American Monetary Policy?\nSince its beginnings, bitcoin followed an almost perfect mechanism. Every four years, the halving came to restart the engine, like a metronome. But times change. In 2025, mathematical gravity is no longer enough. The cycles are distorted, slowed down, sometimes reversed. The price of BTC no longer reacts only to halving or narratives. It is sucked into another dimension: that of interest rates, the Fed, and global monetary policy. Bitcoin has grown, and now it lives in the same world as other risky assets.\nIn Brief\n- The bitcoin cycle seems more influenced by American elections than by the halving.\n- Inflows are slowing on ETFs, weakening the current crypto market momentum.\n- The Fed\u2019s unpredictable decisions complicate macro readings for crypto investors.\n- Altcoin volume is under pressure despite growing interest in crypto products on the stock market.\nHalving or Elections: Who Really Holds the Bitcoin Wheel?\nFor a long time, the crypto industry loved the idea of a \u201c4-year cycle\u201c. Simple, reassuring. But Markus Thielen (10X Research) throws a stone in the pond:\nIt\u2019s not the halving that dictates the pace, but rather the midterm elections. They generally coincide with a consolidation period for stock markets. When looking at Bitcoin peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021, they all fall in the fourth quarter. That fits much better than halving dates, which themselves move.\nHe notes that peaks have always occurred at year-end: December 2013, December 2017, November 2021. And today?\nWith a confused Fed, unclear economic policy, and internal divisions, the machine is stuck. Jerome Powell may multiply speeches, but markets hear nothing clear. Result: Bitcoin has exited its bullish channel started in 2023. Investors no longer know which saint to pray to.\nAnd this uncertainty spares no other cryptos. In a market dominated by macro uncertainty, altcoins suffer even more. Ethereum stalls, others fade away. Thielen warns that without a resurgence of inflows, the crypto market will not rebound.\nBitcoin, Rates, and Confusion: The Market Seeks a Conductor\nThe first market move after a Fed announcement is always the wrong one, some traders believe. On the day of the last Fed decision, Bitcoin jumped to 94,000 dollars\u2026 before falling back to 89,000.\nThe cause? A Jerome Powell press conference judged ambiguous: he starts neutral, ends dovish, but the official message remains hawkish. In short, nothing decisive. Thielen\u2019s analysis is ruthless:\nPowell started with a balanced view. But over the course of the press conference, he became increasingly dovish, which confused the markets. He constantly changes his tone.\nMeanwhile, flows into Bitcoin ETFs are slowing. In December 2023, 34 billion dollars rushed into crypto products. In 2025, it\u2019s barely 22 billion. Worse: on-chain flows are now negative. Institutions keep their distance. And CEXs like Coinbase or Binance see their activity drop due to lack of volume.\nIn this context, crypto cycles can no longer be read as before. Even supporters of the supercycle, like Tom Lee, struggle to convince. He argues that a recovery in the ISM (manufacturing activity index) could restart Bitcoin. But Thielen is skeptical: the economy is no longer industrial. The ISM no longer reflects anything.\nCEX, IPO, and Altcoins: Towards Another Crypto Cycle?\nWhile the Bitcoin cycle stalls, another engine emerges: the stock markets. Crypto IPOs, from Circle to Robinhood, grab attention. Even Korean investors, long fond of altcoins, turn to American crypto stocks. Thielen cites a revealing figure: at one point, crypto volume in Korea exceeded that of all local stocks combined by 50%.\nBut this shift is logical. Institutional money no longer wants token 733 on CoinMarketCap. It wants regulation, audited balance sheets, liquidity. Result: altcoins outside of Ethereum and BNB are going through a desert crossing. And even so, BNB only manages thanks to its ecosystem, yields, and"

                "body": "A seismic shift has occurred in the realm of US Bitcoin ETFs, with a shocking $78.35 million vanishing as net outflows on December 11, 2025. This exodus, featuring stalwarts like Fidelity, Ark Invest, and VanEck, stirs the pot of speculation and concern about the fluctuating market landscape. As caution grips investors and uncertainty looms large, a deeper examination of these trends is not just relevant\u2014it\u2019s essential.\nDecoding the Recent Bitcoin ETF Exodus\nThe wave of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs offers a candid glimpse into the psyche of investors and the vulnerabilities of the market. Current figures reveal a pronounced exodus, spearheaded by redemptions from Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), Ark Invest's ARKB, and VanEck's HODL. This backdrop casts a long shadow over the modest inflows received by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This dramatic see-saw signals a growing wariness among investors, as institutional investments now feel the same jitters that plagues speculative ventures.\nThe Elephant in the Room: Major Financial Influencers\nThe pullback from industry giants like Fidelity, Ark Invest, and VanEck tells us much about the current landscape. An eye-popping $103 million fled from Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, while Ark Invest and VanEck collectively shed over $35 million. In contrast, the incoming funds to BlackRock\u2019s IBIT suggest a more discerning approach from investors\u2014a tactical move fueled by an urgent desire to safeguard assets during rollercoaster market episodes.\nMarket Adjustments and Basis Trade Dynamics\nRecent dialogues in financial circles sing the praises of basis trade unwinds as pivotal in understanding these shifts. These movements echo wider inefficiencies entrenched in trading positions, reacting to market currents that have little to do with Bitcoin's direct value. Perspectives from seasoned market players such as Arthur Hayes, the former head of BitMEX, paint these ETF withdrawals not as ominous warnings but mechanical adjustments\u2014an essential, albeit concerning, facet of the crypto ecosystem. Investors must learn to parse these signals amidst the noise of the market\u2019s ebbs and flows.\nThe Rise of Investor Caution in Turbulent Waters\nThe recent changes in liquidity within US Bitcoin ETFs suggest a growing tide of investor trepidation. Data from Coinglass showcases an additional $76.27 million that shifted from wallets to exchanges shortly thereafter, augmenting a trend of risk aversion. The overall market narrative appears to point to a collective pause, with cryptocurrency investors adopting a wait-and-see mindset that underscores a palpable need for caution in times of unrest.\nNew Opportunities for Web3 Ventures\nFor Web3 startups and offshore crypto enterprises, the fallout from these Bitcoin ETF outflows signals a shifting frontier ripe for innovation. As traditional ETF entries struggle against the backdrop of amplifying volatility, there\u2019s a clear pathway toward integrating fiat-crypto directly and embracing stablecoin-based treasury solutions. By developing compliant payment frameworks, these companies can not only weather the financial storms but potentially flourish, sidestepping the pitfalls that ETF turbulence creates.\nThe Road Ahead for Bitcoin ETFs\nWith the macroeconomic horizon shifting under the influence of prospective Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate hikes, the outlook for Bitcoin ETFs grows increasingly nebulous. Historical patterns remind us that a single day of outflows seldom marks a permanent trend, yet these movements underscore the urgent need for vigilance as flow patterns morph and the market\u2019s direction shifts. For institutions, maintaining investor trust during such tumultuous times remains a delicate balancing act.\nConclusion\nThe recent $78.35 million outflow from US Bitcoin ETFs isn't merely a statistical aberration; it represents an inflection point in the narrative of cryptocurrency. As key market players recalibrate their strategies and the air thickens with uncertainty, understandi"

                "body": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an Ethereum-based DeFi crypto project, has confirmed that independent security reviews by Halborn Security are ongoing as part of its preparation for the upcoming V1 release. The update comes as the project continues to progress through its development roadmap and presale phases, with the V1 launch planned for Q4 2025.\nProject Overview and Development Direction\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to operate without custodians. The platform is structured to allow users to supply assets, earn interest, and access collateral-backed loans directly through smart contracts.\nThe protocol is built around a dual lending model. One part of the system focuses on pooled lending, where users deposit assets into liquidity pools and receive interest-bearing tokens in return. The second part supports more flexible loan structures, where borrowing conditions are defined by protocol rules rather than intermediaries. This approach is intended to balance predictable returns for suppliers with controlled borrowing options for users seeking liquidity.\nAccording to the team, all core lending logic is being finalized before the protocol moves into public testing. The V1 release is expected to include the Liquidity Pool, interest-bearing receipt tokens, a Debt Token system, and an automated Liquidator Bot. ETH and USDT are planned as the initial supported assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral.\nSecurity Reviews and Audit Process\nSecurity preparation remains a central focus as Mutuum Finance moves closer to its first testnet deployment. The team has confirmed that Halborn Security is reviewing the finalized lending and borrowing smart contracts under a formal analysis process. These reviews are intended to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure that contract logic behaves as expected under a range of scenarios.\nIn addition to the Halborn review, Mutuum Finance has already completed an audit with CertiK, which resulted in a 90/100 Token Scan score. The project also operates a $50K bug bounty program, aimed specifically at discovering code vulnerabilities before the protocol is exposed to wider usage.\nTogether, these measures form a layered security approach. For a lending-focused new crypto project, such preparation is considered important because lending protocols manage user collateral and rely on accurate liquidation logic to remain solvent.\nProtocol Mechanics and mtTokens\nAt the core of the Mutuum Finance design are interest-bearing tokens known as mtTokens. When users supply assets to the protocol, they receive mtTokens that represent their position in the liquidity pool. These tokens increase in redeemable value as borrowers repay interest.\nThe mtToken model allows interest to accrue automatically, without requiring manual claims. This mechanism is designed to keep the protocol accounting simple while aligning returns with actual borrowing activity rather than token emissions.\nBorrowing within the protocol follows defined risk parameters. Loan-to-Value limits vary by asset type, reflecting differences in volatility and liquidity. Lower-volatility assets are assigned higher LTV thresholds, while more volatile assets are capped at lower levels. When a position crosses a liquidation threshold, the Liquidator Bot is designed to initiate a controlled liquidation process to protect the system.\nStablecoin and Layer-2 Plans\nBeyond the initial lending and borrowing features, Mutuum Finance has outlined plans for additional functionality in later roadmap stages. One of these is the development of a protocol-native stablecoin. According to project documentation, the stablecoin is intended to be backed by interest generated within the protocol, rather than by external reserves or inflation mechanisms.\nThe roadmap also includes planned expansion to Layer-2 networks. Layer-2 deployment is expected to reduce "

Bitcoin led with $287M.\nQuick Take\nSummary is AI generated, newsroom reviewed.\nU.S. spot crypto ETFs tracked by the report saw $530 million in combined net inflows between December 8 and 12.\nBitcoin ETFs led the weekly inflows with $287 million, pushing total net assets to a record $118.27 billion.\nEthereum ETFs followed closely with $209 million in net inflows, showing sustained institutional confidence in the asset.\nEthereum ETFs followed closely with $209 million in net inflows, showing sustained institutional confidence in the asset.\nInstitutional demand for crypto stayed strong last week. From December 8 to December 12, spot ETFs tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana pulled in a combined $530 million. The steady inflows came despite choppy prices and cautious market sentiment.\nBitcoin led the pack. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs added $287 million over the five-day period. Ethereum followed closely, with $209 million in net inflows. Solana ETFs added a smaller but still notable $33.6 million. Importantly, none of the seven Solana ETFs recorded net outflows during the week. That detail matters. It suggests investors are still allocating capital across major assets, not just Bitcoin.\nBitcoin ETFs Hold Firm as Assets Near $118B\nBitcoin ETFs continued to attract capital at a measured pace. On December 12 alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $49.16 million in net inflows. Weekly inflows reached $286.6 million, reversing losses from the prior week. Total net assets across U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs now stand at $118.27 billion. That equals roughly 6.6% of Bitcoin\u2019s total market cap. Trading activity also remained active, with $18.8 billion in value traded over the week.\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT once again drove most of the action. The fund added more than $51 million in one day and now holds over $70 billion in net assets. Other issuers stayed mostly flat, signaling consolidation rather than exits. Even as Bitcoin prices softened late in the week, ETF buyers did not pull back. That pattern points to longer term positioning rather than short-term trading.\nEthereum and Solana See Broad-Based Participation\nEthereum ETFs posted $209 million in weekly inflows, showing continued institutional confidence. Although daily flows varied, the overall trend stayed positive. Funds continued to build exposure even as ETH prices moved sideways. Solana\u2019s performance stood out for a different reason. While inflows totaled a modest $33.6 million, not a single Solana ETF recorded a net outflow during the week. That kind of consistency is rare for newer ETF products. The data suggests investors are slowly diversifying beyond BTC and ETH. Solana\u2019s growing ETF stability hints at rising comfort with alternative layer-one exposure. Together, ETH and SOL inflows made up nearly half of total weekly ETF demand.\nWhat the Flow Data Says About Market Structure\nETF flows tell a clear story. Institutions are still buying dips. They are also spreading risk across multiple assets instead of rotating out. Total Bitcoin ETF inflows now sit at $57.9 billion since launch. Ethereum and Solana continue to build their own inflow records, week by week. Meanwhile, volatility in daily flows shows active positioning rather than panic selling. Price action remains uneven. Yet capital keeps entering regulated products. That combination usually signals confidence in the asset class, even if short-term direction stays uncertain. Currently, ETFs remain the cleanest window into institutional crypto demand. The latest numbers show that demand is very much alive.\nFollow us on Google News\nGet the latest crypto insights and updates.\nRelated Posts\nXRP Technical Structure Signals Potential Bullish Expansion Over the Next Six Months\nTriparna Baishnab\nAuthor\nSEC Releases Crypto Wallet Custody Guide as Investor Educati"

This means very soon you\u2019ll be able to open up the Coinbase app and see native Solana assets on Coinbase, maybe even your own,\u201d Allen said.\nAllen\u2019s presentation deck also showed that Coinbase users will be able to trade Solana tokens with a bank card or USDC. Though Coinbase has yet to officially confirm the announcement on its channels, a spokesperson for the firm told The Defiant in comments today that it builds on Coinbase's plans for its DEX integration: \u201cWhen we launched our DEX trading platform earlier this year, we promised that access to Solana would come soon. That time is almost here.\"\nThe spokesperson also added that Coinbase will reveal more details in a livestream event on Dec. 17.\nSolana DEX Volumes Dropping\nThe rollout comes just a month after Coinbase announced its acquisition of Solana-based trading platform Vector to expand its on-chain trading capabilities. As The Defiant reported, the acquisition brings the platform\u2019s team and token-tracking tools into Coinbase\u2019s DEX system, which currently supports the firm's own Ethereum Layer 2, Base, with plans to add more networks after Solana.\nAfter peaking at $313 billion in monthly volumes in January, Solana DEX activity has since dropped, staying mostly above $100 billion per month, according to DefiLlama data. The largest DEX on Solana, HumidiFi, generated over $24.4 billion in volumes over the past 30 days, followed by Raydium and Meteora with $15.2 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively.\nSOL is down over 3.5% in the past 24 hours as the broader crypto markets slump.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

The setting itself drew attention. Judges introduced RippleX as the unit responsible for supporting the XRP Ledger and XRP adoption.\nHe stressed that Ripple did not attend the event to unveil a product launch. Instead, the focus centered on supporting ecosystem builders across chai\nXRP and Wrapped XRP Head to Solana\nJudges confirmed that XRP and wrapped XRP will enter the Solana ecosystem through Hex Trust and LayerZero. This move enables XRP exposure within Solana\u2019s decentralized finance landscape.\nXRP will integrate into decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, yield platforms, and perpetual markets. What changes when XRP enters Solana DeFi? Access expands to tens of millions of Solana wallets, and liquidity no longer remains confined to a single network.\nWhy Solana Fits Ripple\u2019s Strategy\nJudges outlined three drivers behind the choice of Solana: new users, new demand, and market depth. Solana\u2019s large and active wallet base provides immediate reach. Deep liquidity across its DeFi venues supports efficient trading and capital movement.\nJudges compared asset distribution to global currency access, stating that assets fail to scale when access remains limited. The message underscored Ripple\u2019s view that isolation restricts growth.\nVibhu acknowledged a change in outlook during the discussion. He explained that deeper exposure to XRP and its community reshaped his view on bringing the asset into Solana DeFi. He referenced opportunities around XRP-based yield, lending, and broader utility within Solana\u2019s ecosystem.\nThe exchange highlighted how cross-chain collaboration continues to reshape long-held narratives within crypto communities.\nHow wXRP Supports Cross-Chain Use\nWrapped XRP will function as a 1:1 representation of native XRP, with custody and issuance handled by Hex Trust. LayerZero\u2019s infrastructure will support cross-chain movement, allowing wXRP to operate across multiple networks without relying on unregulated bridges. This structure allows institutions and users to maintain exposure to XRP while engaging in on-chain activity beyond the XRP Ledger.\nJudges noted that liquidity fragmentation limits asset efficiency. By embedding XRP across chains, Ripple aims to remove those barriers. The approach aligns with broader efforts to connect XRP with RLUSD and other on-chain assets across supported networks.\nRippleX Head of Engineering J. Ayo Akinyele has described Ripple\u2019s long-term focus on a multichain future. He emphasized that crypto activity naturally spreads across networks rather than concentrating on a single chain.\nIn this framework, the XRP Ledger continues to serve as a stable and predictable base layer. That foundation supports security and trust while enabling activity to extend outward.\nXRP Utility Takes Center Stage\nJudges closed the session with a clear statement: Ripple does not want XRP used only for trading. The company wants XRP used everywhere. The Solana integration represents one step in a broader distribution strategy that includes LayerZero, Wormhole, and Axelar.\nAs XRP\u2019s price remains range-bound, Ripple\u2019s roadmap points toward expanding real-world and on-chain usage across ecosystems."

                "body": "Rotation into Defensive Stocks Bolsters the Dow Near Record Highs\n15.12.2025 - 05:57:02Dow Jones US2605661048\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered close to its all-time peak on Monday, yet a palpable sense of caution hung over the market. As technology shares tumbled, the blue-chip index found support from a significant rotation of capital into defensive sectors. Investors appeared hesitant to make major moves ahead of a crucial batch of economic data scheduled for release on Tuesday.\nRecent trading sessions have highlighted a stark divergence within the U.S. equity landscape. The Dow Jones advanced by 1.1 percent last week, a notable contrast to the Nasdaq Composite's 1.69 percent decline. This shift points to institutional money moving away from richly valued technology stocks and seeking refuge in the more traditional industrial and defensive names that characterize the Dow.\nThis rotation has been accelerated by significant sell-offs in key tech players. Broadcom saw its shares drop between 7 and 11 percent, despite reporting quarterly revenue of $19.1 billion that surpassed expectations. Similarly, Oracle plunged 12.7 percent following its earnings report. The exodus from growth-oriented equities is gathering pace.\nWithin the Dow, primary beneficiaries of this capital shift include:\n* Chevron (CVX): Energy stocks are attracting inflows.\n* JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financials are stabilizing following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.\n* Defensive Consumer Staples: These companies provide ballast against technology-led volatility.\nTechnical Picture: Consolidation at a Critical Juncture\nThe index is trading just below its intraday record high of 48,880 points, hit on Friday. The 48,450-point level now acts as a short-term pivot zone. A decisive break above 48,880 would clear a path toward the 49,000 milestone, though market conviction for such a move is currently lacking.\nShould investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Dow Jones?\nImmediate support rests at the 48,000-point mark, which aligns with the 20-day moving average. A breach of this level could trigger a deeper correction toward 47,500. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated from overbought territory after Friday's weakness, offering a short-term signal of eased selling pressure.\nA complicating factor is the rise in the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 4.18 percent. This increases valuation pressure on equities and dampens overall risk appetite.\nAwaiting Key Economic Catalysts\nMonday's session typified a \"wait-and-see\" approach. The market's focus is firmly on Tuesday's data deluge, which includes the delayed November Non-Farm Payrolls report and retail sales figures. These releases are expected to set the directional tone for trading in the coming weeks.\nAdded to this, the rollover of futures contracts from December to March is contributing to elevated volatility during the early trading hours. Traders anticipate a consolidation phase, with the Dow likely to move within a range of 48,300 to 48,600 points, rather than staging a decisive breakout.\nAd\nDow Jones Stock: Buy or Sell?!

                "body": "London markets reopen on Monday, 15 December 2025 with three forces likely to dominate the early tone: a risk-off aftertaste from Wall Street\u2019s late-week tech-led pullback, accelerating expectations of a Bank of England rate cut later this week, and a data-heavy global calendar that could reshape rate and FX pricing before Christmas.\nBelow is what to watch into the London Stock Exchange open (08:00 GMT), the themes that matter most for the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, and the UK shares likely to be in focus.\nThe early setup for UK shares\nFutures and positioning\n- FTSE 100 futures were last quoted around 9,727 (March contract) ahead of Monday\u2019s session. [1]\nReminder: futures levels can move quickly with Asia trading and Monday pre-open headlines.\nWhere London left off on Friday\n- The FTSE 100 fell 0.6% on Friday, while the FTSE 250 edged up 0.1%, with both indices logging a second consecutive weekly decline. [2]\n- Precious metal miners were a notable swing factor: the FTSE 350 precious metal miners index surged intraday but finished with a smaller gain. [3]\nThe immediate question for Monday is whether the FTSE\u2019s commodity-heavy composition (energy/miners) can stabilise the index if global risk sentiment stays fragile.\nGlobal markets: Wall Street jitters, higher yields, and a stronger dollar undertone\nUS equities ended the week lower\n- On Friday, the Dow fell 0.51%, the S&P 500 fell 1.07%, and the Nasdaq fell 1.69% in a session Reuters characterised as another down day led by tech/AI-related nerves. [4]\n- Reuters also noted US Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield around 4.192%. [5]\nFor UK investors, this matters because higher global yields tend to pressure \u201clong-duration\u201d growth equities and can tighten financial conditions\u2014while also feeding through to sterling and gilt dynamics.\nCommodities: oil weakness versus metals volatility\n- Oil finished the week on the back foot: Brent settled around $61.12 and WTI around $57.44, with Reuters citing supply-glut concerns and broader macro/geopolitical narratives weighing on prices. [6]\n- Copper was volatile, pulling back sharply after touching record territory earlier in the session, another signal of how skittish \u201cgrowth-sensitive\u201d trades have become. [7]\nThis sets up a familiar FTSE 100 tug-of-war:\n- Lower oil can drag heavyweight energy names.\n- Metal price swings can dominate the mining complex (and sentiment more broadly).\nFX: sterling eases on UK growth worries\n- Reuters reported sterling slipped to about $1.3375 after weak UK GDP data. [8]\nA softer pound can be supportive for the internationally exposed FTSE 100 (foreign earnings translation), but if it reflects growth concerns, it can also hit UK domestic cyclicals.\nBank of England week: the cut is the consensus\u2026 but the path matters more\nThe Bank of England is the central macro catalyst for UK assets this week.\nWhere Bank Rate stands right now\n- The Bank of England\u2019s official page lists Current Bank Rate: 4%, with the next decision due 18 December 2025. [9]\nWhat markets and economists expect\n- Reuters reported that all economists polled expected the BoE to cut by 25bp to 3.75% on 18 December. [10]\n- On the market-pricing side, Reuters also highlighted that traders had around a 90% chance of a 25bp cut priced in. [11]\nWhy the BoE matters for the FTSE 100/250\nA rate cut can be interpreted two ways, and Monday\u2019s market tone may hinge on which narrative dominates:\n- \u201cEasing because growth is slowing\u201d\nThat can be a headwind for economically sensitive UK shares (retailers, leisure, some industrials), even as it supports rate-sensitive segments. - \u201cEasing because inflation is cooling\u201d\nThat is typically more constructive for risk appetite and UK domestics\u2014especially if wage and services inflation also look contained.\nUK data calendar: jobs and inflation land before the BoE decision\nUK macro releases this week are not \u201cbackground noise\u201d\u2014they are directly in the BoE\u2019s line of sight.\nTuesday, 16 December (07:00) \u2013 UK labour market\n- The"

[1] Even so, several weekly summaries put the DAX modestly higher on the week (around +0.7%)\u2014a gain built on mid-week central-bank relief that was later tested by a fresh wave of \u201cAI bubble\u201d jitters. [2]\nBelow is what mattered in 8\u201314 December 2025, and what will likely drive Germany\u2019s stock market on 15\u201319 December 2025.\nWhat moved Frankfurt markets this week (8\u201314 December 2025)\n1) Bond yields surged \u2014 and that mattered for rate\u2011sensitive German sectors\nThe story that kept resurfacing across European trading desks was simple: yields up, valuation pressure up.\n- On 8 December, Reuters highlighted that Germany\u2019s 30-year yield rose to around 3.466%, the highest since July 2011, weighing particularly on real estate stocks. [3]\n- By 10 December, Reuters reported Germany\u2019s 10-year Bund yield hitting about 2.87%, a nine\u2011month high, with markets reassessing whether the European Central Bank is truly done. [4]\nWhy it matters for Frankfurt: higher long-end yields can hit the sectors the DAX tends to use as \u201cbond proxies\u201d (real estate, utilities) while supporting banks\u2019 interest-rate narratives\u2014at least until growth concerns dominate.\n2) The Fed delivered a cut \u2014 but the message was not \u201call clear\u201d\nThe global tone setter was the U.S. Federal Reserve decision on 10 December.\n- The Fed set policy to a target range of 3.5%\u20133.75% (effective 11 December). [5]\n- Reuters described a divided decision and emphasized the signal of a likely slower path for additional cuts, with projections pointing to only one cut in 2026 (per Reuters\u2019 reporting on the meeting and outlook). [6]\nFor German equities, the near-term boost from easier U.S. financial conditions competed with two counterweights:\n- a less dovish-than-hoped policy trajectory, and\n- the knock-on impact on EUR/USD and European rate expectations.\nA Reuters global markets wrap also noted the euro strengthened (to a multi\u2011week high) after the Fed decision\u2014an issue for export-heavy indices like the DAX when currency moves accelerate.\n3) AI valuation anxiety returned \u2014 and it spilled into Europe\nJust as markets tried to pivot into a \u201crates down, risk up\u201d narrative, the AI trade delivered another round of volatility.\nReuters reported that renewed concern about an AI-fueled rally\u2014sparked by U.S. corporate news flow\u2014pushed European shares lower on 12 December, with the DAX down on the day as the broader market turned risk-averse. [7]\nThis matters in Frankfurt even though Europe has less mega-cap AI concentration than the U.S.: the DAX still includes globally priced growth names (and suppliers into tech capex cycles) and reacts when global risk premia shift quickly.\n4) German data improved at the margin \u2014 but the \u201cGermany is the drag\u201d narrative didn\u2019t disappear\nGermany delivered a cluster of macro prints that were \u201cless bad,\u201d yet not strong enough to silence structural worries.\n- Industrial production (October 2025): Destatis reported output +1.8% month-on-month, above prior momentum, with industry excluding energy and construction +1.5% m/m. [8]\n- Exports (October 2025): Destatis reported exports +0.1% m/m while imports fell -1.2% m/m (seasonally and calendar adjusted). [9]\nReuters added that the export rise surprised forecasts, while shipments to the U.S. and China fell sharply, underscoring uneven external demand.

                "body": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Seneca Foods (NASDAQ:SENE.A). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\nHow Quickly Is Seneca Foods Increasing Earnings Per Share?\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that Seneca Foods has managed to grow EPS by 20% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for Seneca Foods remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 8.3% to US$1.6b. That's a real positive.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Seneca Foods\nWhile it's always good to see growing profits, you should always remember that a weak balance sheet could come back to bite. So check Seneca Foods' balance sheet strength, before getting too excited.\nAre Seneca Foods Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nIt should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. So it is good to see that Seneca Foods insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$122m. That equates to 16% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Very encouraging."

[2]\nWhat Happened Yesterday: A Pause Near Record Highs\nOn Tuesday, December 9, U.S. stocks closed mixed:\n- Dow Jones: \u22120.38% to 47,560.29\n- S&P 500: \u22120.09% to 6,840.51\n- Nasdaq Composite: +0.13% to 23,576.49 [3]\nThe small\u2011cap Russell 2000 briefly notched an intraday record high before finishing up about 0.2%, reflecting renewed appetite for economically sensitive, domestically focused companies. [4]\nBanks were the weak spot. JPMorgan Chase sank about 4.7%, its worst single\u2011day drop since April, after warning that expenses could rise to roughly $105 billion in 2026, a move that dragged the broader S&P 500 bank index down about 2%. [5]\nTech trading was choppy, with AI heavyweight Nvidia edging lower even as Washington signaled it would allow some high\u2011end AI chips to be shipped to China subject to fees and restrictions. [6]\nThe Fed: A Third Rate Cut, but a Tougher Tone?\nThe clear focal point for Wall Street today is the Federal Reserve. The Fed announces its policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET, followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. [7]\nWhat markets are pricing in\n- The CME FedWatch tool shows markets assigning roughly a 90% probability that the Fed delivers another 25\u2011basis\u2011point cut, taking the federal funds rate to 3.50%\u20133.75%. [8]\n- Futures currently imply only two quarter\u2011point cuts in total through the end of 2026, leaving policy in the 3.00%\u20133.25% region \u2014 less aggressive easing than some traders hoped earlier in the year. [9]\nA Reuters preview notes that policymakers are divided: some worry that cutting too slowly could weaken the labor market, while others fear that cutting too quickly could reignite inflation that\u2019s still running above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. [10]\nComplicating matters, a recent U.S. government shutdown delayed key economic releases. Much of the Fed\u2019s inflation and jobs data is now outdated, with a wave of postponed reports arriving only after today\u2019s meeting \u2014 another reason analysts expect Powell to stress \u201cdata dependence\u201d and avoid strong commitments about 2026. [11]\nWhy many expect a \u2018hawkish cut\u2019\nCommentary from banks and macro analysts converges on one phrase: \u201chawkish cut.\u201d\n- Strategists at TD Securities, cited by Reuters, expect a 25\u2011bp cut paired with tougher guidance, signaling a high bar for further easing unless the labor market deteriorates meaningfully. [12]\n- Research from KBC Bank (via ActionForex) frames it similarly: markets are \u201cpreparing for another hawkish rate cut,\u201d with Fed officials likely to push back against hopes for rapid, ongoing easing. [13]\nIn practical terms, this means the Fed may deliver the cut markets already expect, but use the dot plot and Powell\u2019s press conference to suggest that additional cuts will be slower and more conditional than futures currently imply.\nFutures, Bonds and the Bigger Macro Picture\nBefore the opening bell, Dow and S&P 500 futures were up about 0.1% while Nasdaq futures ticked slightly higher, according to Investopedia\u2019s live coverage. [14]\nAt the same time, bond yields have been grinding higher:\n- The 10\u2011year U.S. Treasury yield is trading near 4.21%, its highest level since early September, up from 4.19% at Tuesday\u2019s close. [15]\nHigher long\u2011term yields make future cash flows less valuable, which tends to wei"

                "body": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s final meeting of 2025 has delivered exactly what Wall Street expected on paper \u2013 a third quarter\u2011point rate cut \u2013 but the message around it is anything but simple. Stocks have pushed toward fresh highs, bond yields are slipping, and index futures are flashing a more cautious tone as investors digest what many are calling a classic \u201chawkish cut.\u201d\nOn Thursday, December 11, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were trading near record levels, even as futures on those same indexes pointed modestly lower earlier in the day and tech stocks lagged. [1]\nAt the center of the move: a divided Fed, delayed economic data after a historic government shutdown, and growing political pressure ahead of a leadership change at the U.S. central bank. [2]\nWhat the Fed Just Did \u2014 And Why It\u2019s Being Called a \u2018Hawkish Cut\u2019\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point, bringing the federal funds target range down to 3.50%\u20133.75%. It was the third rate cut of 2025, aimed at supporting a softening labor market after months of slowing job growth. [3]\nBut the details of the decision made it clear this was no simple pivot back to ultra\u2011easy policy:\n- Split vote: The decision featured rare open disagreement. Two policymakers voted against cutting rates, arguing there was no need to ease now, while another dissented because he wanted a larger, half\u2011point move. [4]\n- A pause signal: New projections show Fed officials see only one additional quarter\u2011point cut in 2026 and one more in 2027, effectively signaling a pause after this move unless the data deteriorate. [5]\n- Inflation still \u2018somewhat elevated\u2019: The Fed\u2019s statement pointedly noted that inflation remains above target, even as the labor market shows downside risks, underscoring the narrow path between fighting price pressures and avoiding unnecessary damage to jobs. [6]\nComplicating the picture: the Fed is flying partially blind. A 43\u2011day U.S. government shutdown delayed key indicators, pushing the November jobs report to December 16 and inflation data to later in the month. [7]\nFed Chair Jerome Powell stressed that another rate hike is \u201cnot the base case,\u201d but he also refused to pre\u2011commit to further cuts, telling markets the path ahead will depend heavily on incoming data once the statistical fog lifts. [8]\nWall Street\u2019s Two\u2011Day Whiplash: Rally First, Then a Softer Open\nWednesday: Relief Rally After the Decision\nOnce the Fed announcement hit and Powell\u2019s press conference began, markets did what they often do when uncertainty clears \u2014 they rallied.\n- The Dow jumped about 1.05%, or nearly 500 points, to roughly 48,058.\n- The S&P 500 gained around 0.67% to just under 6,887.\n- The Nasdaq Composite climbed roughly 0.33%. [9]\nAt the same time, Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar fell, as investors cheered a cut that seemed supportive of growth without hinting at an imminent policy reversal. [10]\nOne portfolio manager described it as \u201cmusic to both the bond market and the stock market\u2019s ears,\u201d reflecting relief that the Fed wasn\u2019t shutting down the prospect of future easing altogether, even while projecting just one cut in 2026. [11]\nThursday Morning: Futures Turn Lower\nBy Thursday morning, however, the sugar high was fading.\nFutures on major U.S. indexes slipped as investors shifted from celebrating \u201ca cut\u201d to parsing the implications of \u201ca hawkish cut\u201d:\n- Dow futures were about 0.1% lower.\n- S&P 500 futures fell roughly 0.5%.\n- Nasdaq 100 futures dropped close to 0.8%. [12]\nThis pullback came after cash indexes had already approached or set record highs, suggesting traders were locking in gains and reassessing the Fed\u2019s relatively stingy 2026 outlook.\nCorporate news added its own twists. A disappointing earnings report from Oracle and concerns about stretched AI valuations dragged the Nasdaq and several big\u2011name tech stocks lower, even as blue\u2011chip Dow components like Visa, Home Depot and UnitedHealth extended their gains.

                "body": "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Melvin Council Jr. hadn't hit much of anything from behind the arc this season for No. 19 Kansas. So NC State was more than willing to let him keep trying Saturday.\nOnly, Council responded with a performance that his Hall of Fame coach could only describe as \"unbelievable.\"\nThe 6-foot-4 senior had career highs of 36 points and nine 3-pointers, and the Jayhawks needed every bit of it to hold off the Wolfpack 77-76 in overtime - particularly with freshman star Darryn Peterson exiting late in regulation with lingering hamstring trouble.\n\"We had one guy that was probably the best performer that I think that I've had on the road in my 23 years at Kansas,\" coach Bill Self said. \"He was unbelievable. Made hard shots. They dared him to shoot, and then when he made a couple, he started looking at a big basket.\n\"I'm happy for our team, but especially happy for him because he put us on his back tonight.\"\nBut beyond the scoring, the stunning part of Saturday's performance was how he did it - by time and time again hitting from 3-point range.\nCouncil had made just 27.3% of his 3-pointers in Division I since leaving the junior-college ranks before the 2023-24 season. That included missing his first 10 3s of the season for Kansas and sitting at 5 of 27 (18.5%) entering Saturday.\nThe Wolfpack knew that, with first-year coach Will Wade and his staff being heavy into analytics and opting to flat-out leave Council largely unguarded on the wings to start this game. And it was nothing new to Council, who said he had even gotten a pep talk from former KU star Mario Chalmers - who hit the unforgettable 3-pointer to force overtime in the Jayhawks' 2008 NCAA championship win against Memphis - in recent weeks.\n\"You know, my scout team will do that to me in practice,\" Council said. \"My guys and coaches are just telling me just to be confident in your shot and just take it. ... (Chalmers) was telling me: 'Be aggressive, shoot the ball.'\"\nHe made his first 3 just 2 1/2 minutes into the game, made another about three minutes later and had four made 3s in the first 15 minutes, matching his career high for any game in the Division I ranks.\nWade said the Wolfpack adjusted their approach to defend him more aggressively. But the damage was done, with Council building confidence on the way to having a game that Wade said would have Council \"telling his grandkids about that one.\"\n\"We adjusted after he hit the third 3, but he was in rhythm and got going,\" Wade said, adding later: \"You look at everything when somebody scores 36 on you.\"\nCouncil scored the last 13 points of regulation for Kansas, including three 3s. That proved vital considering Peterson checked out abruptly with 2:15 left in regulation; the top-flight NBA prospect had recently returned from missing seven straight games due to a hamstring strain and Self said afterward Peterson was dealing with tightness.\nCouncil later exploited a soft switch early in overtime to launch a 3 off the dribble - N.C. State's Tre Holloman had gone under the screen and teammate Darrion Williams tried to recover from near the elbow as Council made the gather - to bury a 3 and push Kansas to a 69-68 lead.\nHe eventually fed big man Flory Bidunga's dunk with 51.9 seconds left in OT to put the Jayhawks ahead for good.\nCouncil made 13 of 27 shots for the game, including 9 of 15 3-pointers, to go with seven rebounds and four assists in 43 minutes. He became only the fourth KU player since 1996-97 with at least 36 points in a road game, the last being Jalen Wilson (38 points) at Kansas State in January 2023. And his nine 3s were second-most in program history, trailing only Terry Brown's 11 - also against N.C. State - in January 1991.\n\"Man, we have a dog right here with us,\" Bidunga said, adding: \"That's a bad man right here, I'm really impressed.\""

                "body": "Tokyo stocks head into Monday\u2019s open (Dec. 15, 2025) with two forces pulling in opposite directions: a soft global tech tone after Wall Street\u2019s Friday slide, and rising domestic conviction that Japan is on the cusp of another Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate hike later this week. [1]\nInvestors will get a major \u201cjust-before-the-bell\u201d catalyst at 8:50 a.m. JST: the BOJ\u2019s quarterly Tankan business sentiment survey\u2014often the single most market-moving Japan data point of the month. [2]\nBelow is what matters most for Nikkei 225 and Topix trading at the open.\nThe fast read: key drivers into the Tokyo open\n- Wall Street risk tone: U.S. tech led a broad pullback Friday, with the S&P 500 down 1.07% and the Nasdaq down 1.69%, as AI-profitability worries resurfaced and yields rose. [3]\n- Japan\u2019s pre-open headline: The BOJ Tankan prints at 8:50 a.m. JST, minutes before the cash market opens, with forecasts pointing to a modest uptick in large-firm sentiment. [4]\n- Rate-hike drumbeat: A Reuters poll shows 90% of economists expect the BOJ to lift rates to 0.75% from 0.50%at the Dec. 18\u201319 meeting; separate Reuters reporting says markets have \u201calmost fully priced in\u201d a hike and the BOJ is likely to reiterate it will keep raising rates, data permitting. [5]\n- Yen + yields: The yen and JGB yields remain central to sector leadership\u2014exporters versus banks and insurers\u2014while BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled the bank could increase bond buying if long-term rates rise too sharply. [6]\n- Energy tailwind (for importers): Oil ended last week lower, with Brent settling near $61/bbl and WTI near $57/bbl amid oversupply concerns, a backdrop that can help airlines, transport and some consumer names while pressuring upstream energy. [7]\n1) Global cue: U.S. tech weakness could spill into Japan\u2019s chip/AI complex\nFriday\u2019s U.S. session was a reminder that the \u201cAI trade\u201d is still a source of volatility. Technology shares were the weakest major S&P sector, and the Nasdaq\u2019s drop was driven in part by renewed scrutiny of how quickly massive AI-related spending can translate into profits\u2014concerns that have been recurring in recent sessions. [8]\nWhy Tokyo traders care: Japan\u2019s index heavyweights include global-facing tech and automation names, and the market has a dense ecosystem of chip equipment, test/measurement, factory automation and materials suppliers that often shadow U.S. semiconductors\u2014especially on Monday opens after a U.S. Friday move.\nAlso worth noting: Friday\u2019s U.S. pullback happened alongside a rebound in Treasury yields, which can tighten financial conditions and amplify equity sensitivity to valuation concerns. [9]\n2) Where futures point: Nikkei futures signal a cautious start\nJapan\u2019s cash market closed Friday with the Nikkei at 50,836.55 and Topix at 3,423.83, according to Reuters market data. [10]\nMeanwhile, Nikkei 225 futures (SGX, March 2026 contract) were recently around 49,995, per Investing.com\u2019s contract page. [11]\nThat level is roughly 1.7% below Friday\u2019s cash close\u2014suggesting the market is at least flirting with a gap-down open if risk sentiment doesn\u2019t stabilize in early Asia trade.\nTwo important caveats for investors:\n- Futures can swing quickly in thin Sunday/Monday liquidity.\n- The Tankan hits just before the open, and a surprise can reshape the opening auction.\n3) The main event before the bell: BOJ Tankan at 8:50 a.m. JST\nThe BOJ releases its quarterly Tankan survey at 8:50 a.m. JST on Monday, Dec. 15 (Sunday evening in the U.S.). [12]\nWhat the market expects (consensus):\n- Large manufacturers sentiment index: 15 (prior 14)\n- Large non-manufacturers sentiment index: 35 (prior 34)\n- Small manufacturers sentiment index: 1 (prior 1)\n- Small non-manufacturers sentiment index: 14 (prior 14) [13]\nThe Tankan also carries closely watched capital spending intentions:\n- Large firms capex plans: 12.1% (prior 12.5%)\n- Small firms capex plans: -0.2% (prior -2.3%) [14]\nWhy it matters for Monday\u2019s open\n- A stronger-than-expected Tankan can fuel \u201cJapan"
