                "body": "The relationship between gold prices and the dollar: Everything to know\nInvestors have long viewed gold as a steady hedge during periods of economic uncertainty, but its role in today's markets is evolving rapidly. Recent shifts in monetary policy, stubborn inflation risks and rising geopolitical tensions have all reshaped how investors think about safety, value and long-term protection, and have pushed traditional market relationships to their limits.\nAgainst that backdrop, gold's recent price behavior has been anything but ordinary. After breaking through key price thresholds in 2024 and 2025 \u2014 first $3,000 per ounce, then $4,000 \u2014 the price of the precious metal has continued climbing in 2026, recently surpassing $4,600 per ounce and setting a string of new all-time highs. What once looked like a cyclical upswing now resembles a sustained re-rating of gold's place in the global financial system.\nA combination of persistent central-bank buying, shifting rate expectations and changing investor attitudes toward risk has helped keep gold's momentum intact. Perhaps most surprising, though, is how the metal has behaved alongside a relatively strong U.S. dollar, challenging long-held assumptions and leaving many investors wondering what comes next. Below, we'll break down what investors should know now.\nWanted to invest in gold now that the price is climbing? Get started here now.\nThe relationship between gold prices and the dollar\nBelow, experts break down why the price of gold keeps climbing and the precious metal's complex relationship with the dollar.\nWhy gold prices have been climbing\n\"Gold can be a valuable asset in a portfolio precisely because it has [a] low correlation with other asset classes,\" emphasizes Ben Nadelstein, head of content at Monetary Metals.\nThis independence from traditional market patterns has caught investors' attention, especially as the economy faces increasing uncertainty. The appeal of gold's unique behavior has helped drive its impressive price climb, but it's not the only factor at work. Industry professionals highlight other forces that have pushed gold prices higher:\nCentral bank buying: Central banks have dramatically increased their gold reserves in recent years and continue to do so.Investor sentiment: More investors are adding gold to diversify their portfolios amid inflationary and financial stability concerns.De-dollarization: The BRICS+ nations are reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar.Market evolution: Gold prices now respond to a broader range of global economic factors.\nHow gold prices typically move with the dollar\nHenry Yoshida, co-founder of Rocket Dollar, highlights that gold prices and the U.S. dollar traditionally move in opposite directions.\nAdvertisement\n\"A stronger U.S. dollar will suppress the price of gold, while a weaker U.S. dollar will likely drive the price of gold higher through increased demand,\" Yoshida says.\nBut Michael Petch, co-founder and president of Argo Digital Gold, points out that this relationship isn't absolute.\n\"[When there's] financial instability, gold and the dollar may [go up as people] seek safe-haven assets,\" Petch says.\nThe complex interplay between gold and the dollar\n\"Large-scale government accumulation has added a demand-side force that can push [gold] prices higher, even in a strong-dollar environment,\" Petch says.\nBeyond this influence, Kevin Bryan, director of customer experience at The Alloy Market, points to several often-overlooked factors that create a more nuanced dynamic:\nSupply limits: Mining strikes and environmental regulations can restrict gold production. As a result, gold prices may go up, even if the dollar is strong.Geopolitical risks: Rising global tensions and trade disputes create uncertainty. Naturally, this drives people to invest in safe-haven assets such as gold.Inflation concerns: Investors may turn to precious metals, including gold and silver, to hedge against inflation, regardless of current dollar strength.Digi"

We view these actions positively. Although silver accounted for only 6% of the company\u2019s revenue, with the metal priced at the mid-USD 20 per ounce level, meaningful price increases would be needed to offset unprecedented inflation, which, against a weaker consumer backdrop, might be difficult to implement.\n- Pandora plans to introduce platinum plating as an alternative to silver, to be gradually rolled out to replace at least 50% of the relevant silver assortment by 2027. We are concerned whether plated jewelry would convey the same perception quality and durability as silver does, and are encouraged that Pandora tests the alloy both in use and with consumers. Early test results seem positive.\n- The company aims to achieve at least 21% operating margin in the long term (mid-20% in our 10-year forecast), helped by product and metal innovation. That said, in 2027, operating margin could decline to 12% (or 14% excluding one-off costs of the metal transition).\nThe bottom line: We reduce our fair value estimate for Pandora to DKK 940 as we incorporate higher near-term pressures from raw material costs and more subdued growth. We view a return to mid-20% operating margin as realistic in the long term, given metals diversification and eventual normalization of silver prices.\nBig picture: We also concede that, as the largest affordable jeweler, Pandora is better positioned than its smaller peers, as raw material cost inflation can be existential, leading to accelerated exits and consolidation.\nEditor's Note: This analysis was originally published as a stock note by Morningstar Equity Research.\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

                "body": "Silver prices influence agriculture mostly in an indirect way \u2013 but that has not stopped farmers from talking about it.\nSilver has been the second-best performing commodity, up 426 percent since 2020. Chat forums like Agriville.com had farmers chatting about its performance on a regular basis, as they believe it serves as a leading indicator. However, the so called \u201csafe havens\u201d -- silver and gold -- fell 19% and 31% in one day (January 30) -- so they can no longer be considered safe havens?\nThe original thread on the chat forum was posted on December 21, 2025, by a nuser named wheatking16. Before even the collapse some Agriville.com users were advising caution, \u201cWith silver I believe it is almost time, as Warren Buffet would say, to be scared as everyone is starting to be greedy,\u201d said AllisWD45.\n\u201cWhen the coffee shop talk is about silver and advice about silver abounds, it may be time to be careful with these investments if we have any.\u201d\nOn January 16, user errolanderson said, \u201cThere is now a huge disconnect between precious metal futures and the miners. Translation: The basis is now exceptionally weak \u2018n wide. Mining shares have not remotely kept pace with the spec-driven futures.\u201d\nMoe Agostino Chief Commodity Strategist with Farms.com Risk Management and the host of the Ag Commodity Corner+ Podcast says \u201cwhen futures have gone parabolic in a very short-term period of timeline in gold and silver, and trading is well above the 200-day moving average or mean, it is time to take your original capital and risk the profits. It never ends well.\u201d\n\u201cIf you bought physical a long-time ago you can continue to play the long game, but if you bought paper late, its over, the bubble has burst!\u201d exclaims Agostino. \u201cThe trade was focused on the wrong bubble, it was not AI, it was in gold and silver and you could include the \u2018digital\u2019 gold, Bitcoin!\u201d\nFarms.com asked Agostino to provide background on silver\u2019s connection to agriculture. He says Bitcoin was the best performing asset/commodity since 2020, up 955%, followed by silver. Even after the recent plunge, with gold up 327% and the S&P 500 gaining 113%. Bitcoin was considered a \u201cdigital\u201d gold but has lost that lustre in the past year falling 50%.\n\u201cThe dollarization and debasement trade since 2016 has led to central banks around the world, led by China and India, to sell the American dollar to trade against U.S./Trump trade policies, replacing the global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar Index, with safe-havens like gold and silver,\u201d explains Agostino.\nThe safe-haven trade had been gathering steam since early 2025 and coincided with the second Trump presidential term. Trade wars, global economic uncertainty, and a general lack of economic direction/stability caused investors to flock to safe-haven assets like precious metals, including gold, silver, copper, and platinum.\nAs noted above, the move to the upside where demand outpaced supply finally came to an end and the bubble burst on January 30. Continues Agostino, \u201cthe unwinding of leveraged positions from institutions had made the drop lower much worse.\u201d\nSilver prices influence agriculture mostly in an indirect way\n\u201cRather than acting as a core input cost for farming, silver tends to serve as a leading indicator of broader commodity inflation,\u201d explains Agostino.\nAlthough silver does play a role in certain advanced agricultural technologies\u2014such as nano fertilizers, seed treatments, and antimicrobial pesticides\u2014the stronger connection between the two sectors emerges when macroeconomic forces like high inflation, a weakening U.S. dollar, or increased demand for safe haven assets push both silver and agricultural commodities (including soybeans) upward at the same time.\nSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are becoming more common in modern farming because they can boost seed germination, enhance photosynthesis, and function as low toxicity pesticides. Rising silver prices can therefore signal higher input costs or inflationary pressure across agr"

                "body": "Silver plummets after Trump taps Kevin Warsh to chair Federal Reserve\nThe price of silver plummeted Friday, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he will nominate economist Kevin Warsh to chair the Federal Reserve.\nSpot silver prices had dropped by more than 37% just before 5 p.m. ET, to around $84.63 a troy ounce. Precious metals trade nearly 24 hours a day.\nFriday\u2019s plunge put an abrupt halt to silver\u2019s red-hot run over the last 12 months. Analysts attributed the drop to investors selling their silver for high returns at what could be the end of its juggernaut.\nBut even accounting for Friday\u2019s losses, silver is still up more than 150% since this time last year.\nSpot gold prices also fell in Friday trading, although not nearly as steeply as silver. The price of gold was down around 11% shortly before 5 p.m. ET, to around $4,864 a troy ounce.\nAdvertisement\nLike silver, gold has made remarkable gains over the past year, as investors flocked to \u201csafe haven\u201d assets like precious metals as a hedge against uncertainty in financial markets and the global economy. After Friday\u2019s hit, gold was still up more than 70% over the past year.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar traded higher Friday, reversing a downward trend that gained steam on Tuesday, when the U.S. currency had its worst day since April 2025.\nThe twin dynamics on Wall Street of investors selling their safe haven metals, while pushing up the dollar, signals an increase in confidence. This is likely due in part to the popular view that Warsh would be an experienced hand at the wheel of the Fed.\nWarsh is also a longtime monetary \u201chawk\u201d who, during his time on the Fed board, generally opposed lowering interest rates as a way to turbo charge economic growth.\nWarsh has pivoted somewhat over the past year, as he carefully positioned himself in Trump\u2019s camp, criticizing the current Fed and sounding open to lowering rates.\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed slightly down Friday, investors weighed other factors, such as Friday\u2019s unexpectedly sharp rise in the Producer Price Index."

The 64-year-old bookseller spent the night sleeping in a nearby restaurant instead, worried that this could be the new normal if the gas that fuels the island runs out.\nRecommended Videos\nAnxieties simmered in Havana on Friday, a day after Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel warned that U.S. efforts to block oil supplies would take a heavy toll on the Caribbean nation and asked Cubans to endure further sacrifices to weather the impending hardship.\nMany Cubans, already reeling from years of deepening economic crisis, were left asking: What more can we sacrifice?\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried,\u201d O\u00f1a said. \u201cBefore, things were always difficult. But there was always one bus. One way to get home. Now, there are none.\u201d\nBy Friday morning, working class residents like O\u00f1a were already seeing an inkling of what the future might hold.\nAlready unreliable public buses stopped running altogether, leaving many stranded for hours. Others were left walking large distances or hitchhiking. Long gas lines and black outs, a constant on the island, have grown even worse as U.S. President Donald Trump presses down on Cuba with an increasingly heavy hand.\nLast week, Trump signed an executive order threatening to impose tariffs on countries providing oil to Cuba, a move that could further cripple an island plagued by a deepening energy crisis.\nOn Friday, the national transportation company also said it was cutting routes in the east of the island while the University of Havana said it would cancel some events and push for more remote learning, citing \u201cenergy deficits.\u201d\nMeanwhile, much of the city of 2 million \u2013 schools, banks, bakeries and shops \u2013 continued to operate as usual, underscoring how normal the crisis has become on the Caribbean island. Taxis, shared electric motorcycles and other transportation organized by some employers were still working in Havana\u2019s capital. However, taxi fares remain far out of reach for the many Cubans living on a state salary of less than $20 a month.\nWhile the U.S. announced $6 million in aid to Cubans Thursday night, severing the island from its primary energy sources has dealt a blow to the nation, especially to civilians who often bear the brunt of the economic crisis.

                "body": "HAVANA \u2013 After a day spent selling books, Solanda O\u00f1a typically boards a bus from a wealthy seaside district in Havana to her home in the city\u2019s working-class center.\nBut on Thursday night, the bus never came. The 64-year-old bookseller spent the night sleeping in a nearby restaurant instead, worried that this could be the new normal if the gas that fuels the island runs out.\nRecommended Videos\nAnxieties simmered in Havana on Friday, a day after Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel warned that U.S. efforts to block oil supplies would take a heavy toll on the Caribbean nation and asked Cubans to endure further sacrifices to weather the impending hardship.\nMany Cubans, already reeling from years of deepening economic crisis, were left asking: What more can we sacrifice?\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried,\u201d O\u00f1a said. \u201cBefore, things were always difficult. But there was always one bus. One way to get home. Now, there are none.\u201d\nBy Friday morning, working class residents like O\u00f1a were already seeing an inkling of what the future might hold.\nAlready unreliable public buses stopped running altogether, leaving many stranded for hours. Others were left walking large distances or hitchhiking. Long gas lines and black outs, a constant on the island, have grown even worse as U.S. President Donald Trump presses down on Cuba with an increasingly heavy hand.\nLast week, Trump signed an executive order threatening to impose tariffs on countries providing oil to Cuba, a move that could further cripple an island plagued by a deepening energy crisis.\nOn Friday, the national transportation company also said it was cutting routes in the east of the island while the University of Havana said it would cancel some events and push for more remote learning, citing \u201cenergy deficits.\u201d\nMeanwhile, much of the city of 2 million \u2013 schools, banks, bakeries and shops \u2013 continued to operate as usual, underscoring how normal the crisis has become on the Caribbean island. Taxis, shared electric motorcycles and other transportation organized by some employers were still working in Havana\u2019s capital. However, taxi fares remain far out of reach for the many Cubans living on a state salary of less than $20 a month.\nWhile the U.S. announced $6 million in aid to Cubans Thursday night, severing the island from its primary energy sources has dealt a blow to the nation, especially to civilians who often bear the brunt of the economic crisis.

                "body": "By Emma Sanchez\nThe world\u2019s largest oilfield-service providers are looking to production increases in the Middle East to help offset a slowdown in US shale.\nThat\u2019s one of the big takeaways from comments this week made by executives at Helmerich & Payne Inc. and Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., who pointed to opportunities in countries such as Saudi Arabia to help drive growth. The comments echoed outlooks from some of the biggest names in the industry, including SLB and Weatherford International Plc, who expect the Middle East to lead a rebound in activity for the end of 2026 through 2027.\nOperators in the US shale patch, once the world\u2019s leader in oil production growth, are now closely watching commodity markets as they hover near the level that makes drilling profitable for producers. If crude prices drop into the low $50-per-barrel range for several months, companies are expected to make more drastic cuts to drilling and fracking in the US.\nGlobal oil prices have steadily declined in the past several months on expectations of a glut. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has fallen more than 10% over the past year, trading around $63 a barrel on Thursday.\nBut some producers in the Middle East can better sustain the lower crude prices, which underscores why the oilfield-services companies are looking there for growth. Projects to frack for natural gas have also emerged in the region, as governments face rising electricity demand, industrial expansion and petrochemical build-outs.\nHere\u2019s a look at recent comments from oilfield-services companies:\nHelmerich & Payne\n- One of the top drilling-rig contractors on the US shale patch, the company said the reactivation of its suspended rigs in Saudi Arabia is underway.\n- On an earnings call Thursday, incoming Chief Executive Officer Trey Adams said the company remains hopeful for further opportunities in the region\nPatterson-UTI Energy\n- The company opened a drill bit manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia that started operations in December, CEO Andy Hendricks said in a call discussing fourth-quarter results Thursday.\nSLB\n- A rebound in oil production driven by OPEC+ policy and gas becoming a priority to meet regional demand will lead to a \u201cfavorable\u201d next few years, SLB CEO Olivier Le Peuch said during an earnings call on Jan. 23.\n- \u201cThe Middle East market will be characterized by rebounds in drilling and workover activity in Saudi Arabia, with rig counts potentially returning to early 2025 levels by the end of 2026, and this has already begun,\u201d Le Peuch said.\nWeatherford\n- Weatherford International, which gets a lot of its business from the Middle East/North Africa region, sees a \u201cstrong opportunity\u201d in Saudi Arabia and momentum in countries including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman, CEO Girish Saligram said during an earnings call Wednesday.\nHalliburton\n- Halliburton Co., the world\u2019s biggest provider of fracking services, took a more cautious view, with the company estimating activity in the region being flat or down slightly in 2026, CEO Jeff Miller said during an earnings call on Jan. 21.\n- \u201cI\u2019m well aware of the activity growth in Saudi Arabia, but taking a bit more conservative view of the timing and pacing of that coming back,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt likely will, but it\u2019s less clear to me how impactful and how early that would be.\u201d\nShare This:"

A risk-on impulse weighed on the Dollar\u2019s safe-haven appeal, while an uneventful ECB monetary policy decision on Thursday, left traders leaning onto market mood. The EUR/USD trades at 1.1817, up 0.34%.\nEuro trims losses near 1.1820 as fading Dollar strength and steady ECB messaging steady the pair\nThe shared currency is poised to end the week with losses, but its seems the EUR/USD is poised to consolidate within the 1.1750-1.1830 area. Economic data in the US revealed that Consumer Sentiment improved in February, yet it failed to boost the US Dollar.\nThursday\u2019s poor jobs data, fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve could cut rates more than twice this year. During Friday's session, money markets priced in 62 basis points of easing, before retreating to 54 bps, according to Prime Market Terminal data.\nMeanwhile, Fed speakers crossed the wires with Raphael Bostic being hawkish, Mary Daly striking a neutral tone, while the Vice Chair Philip Jefferson\u2019s, revealed that a stable labor market reduces inflation risks.\nAcross the pond, the docket was light, yet Industrial Production figures in Germany were worse than expected in December. In the meantime, European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers crossed the wires, but they repeated some of ECB\u2019s President Lagarde\u2019s speech, in which she pointed out that they\u2019re not worried about the volaitity in the EUR/USD, particularly the strength of the Euro. In fact she said that since the summer, the Euro \u201cit has fluctuated within a range\u2026\u201d and that the ECB \u201cconcluded that the impact of the exchange rate appreciation since last year is incorporated in our baseline.\u201d\nNext week, the calendar will be busy in both sides of the Atlantic, dominated by ECB and Fed speeches. However, the main event would be the Nonfarm Payrolls report for January, Retail Sales and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), both in the US.\nDaily market movers: Euro shrugs-off Fed officials comments, rise\n- Atlanta\u2019s Fed Raphael Bostic said that it's important to keep interest rates at a level that restricts economic activity and returns inflation to 2%.\n- San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said policymakers must balance both sides of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate. Meanwhile, the Fed\u2019s Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said that he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the economy, adding that current monetary policy is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to deal with what likely lies ahead.\n- Falling job openings, an increase in layoffs highlighted by the Challenger report, and a surge in Jobless Claims have reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in 2026.\n- At the same time, the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment index for February improved to 57.3 from 56.4, topping forecasts of 55. One-year inflation expectations declined to 3.5% from 4.0%, while the five-year outlook edged up slightly to 3.4% from 3.3%.\n- German industrial production contracted sharply in December, falling 1.9% month-on-month, according to data released by the federal statistics office on Friday. The decline was far steeper than the 0.3% drop anticipated by economists.\nTechnical analysis: EUR/USD to remain range-bound within 1.1750-1.1830\nThe technical picture shows the EUR/USD is neutral to downward biased, after registering successive series of lower highs and lower lows, but steadily. Selling momentum is fading as depicted in the Relative Strength index (RSI).\nFor a bullish continuation, buyers must rec"

There were more people abstaining, so I think really at this point in time that suggests that perhaps there is some confusion at the Bank of England.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nWith that being the case, the 50-day EMA sits just below the 1.35 region, an area that I thought we could possibly drive down to. We have done that; now we have to see whether or not it holds. I think at this point in time the death of the US dollar was premature by a lot of traders in their analysis out there.\nMarket Sentiment and Technical Levels\nI think we are starting to see that play out against certain currencies - not all, but certain ones are starting to struggle a little bit, namely the euro, namely the British pound. I don't necessarily think that the trend is going to change here, but it is possible that traders may look at this as an overbought position.\nNow we may hang around the 1.35 level in order to find some type of directionality. A bounce from here could end up being a nice opportunity to reach towards the 1.3750 level, but we will just have to wait and see.\nIf we break down from here, then the 1.33 level and the 200-day EMA could be the target for short sellers. Friday could be interesting, but we will just have to wait and see. I think the bulls probably need to see stability, not necessarily an impulsive move, just boring trading.\nReady to trade the Forex GBP/USD analysis and predictions?

                "body": "GBP/USD extends its pullback for a second consecutive session on Thursday, retreating further from last week\u2019s peak near 1.3870, the highest level since September 2021. The pair slides toward the 1.3600 area during the early European session, pressured by a firmer US Dollar and growing caution ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) policy announcement.\nThe BoE is widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3.75%, as inflation remains above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. December inflation data showed price pressures proving sticky, limiting the scope for near-term easing. That said, markets continue to price in the possibility of rate cuts in 2026, reflecting increasing evidence of softness in the UK labor market. The unemployment rate has held at a four-year high of 5.1%, employment declined by 43,000 in December, and wage growth has continued to slow. Together, these factors strengthen the argument for a more accommodative stance further down the line.\nAgainst this backdrop, investors will closely scrutinize the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee vote split and Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s press conference. Any signals regarding the balance between inflation risks and labor market weakness could have a meaningful impact on the Pound and shape near-term direction in GBP/USD.\nIn the meantime, Sterling bulls appear reluctant to commit, as the US Dollar continues to recover from a recent four-year low. The Greenback has found support after President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chair, fueling speculation that US monetary policy may prove less dovish than previously expected. Additional support comes from heightened market volatility and hawkish remarks from Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who warned that inflation risks remain tilted to the upside.\nHowever, upside momentum for the US Dollar may be limited. Markets still expect the Federal Reserve to deliver two rate cuts in 2026, a view reinforced by weak US labor data. The latest ADP report showed private-sector job creation slowing sharply to just 22,000 in January, well below expectations. Trump\u2019s comments suggesting confidence that rates will eventually be lowered also cap Dollar gains.\nLooking ahead, traders will monitor US JOLTS Job Openings and Weekly Initial Jobless Claims for fresh direction. With mixed fundamentals on both sides, caution remains warranted before positioning for a sustained breakout.\nTrade Idea:\nSell GBP/USD on rallies toward 1.3720, targeting 1.3500, with a stop above 1.3820, as Dollar strength and BoE uncertainty keep downside risks in play."

After being weighed down by a broad-based sell-off in global equities and risk-sensitive assets, the pair benefits from renewed demand for the Australian Dollar, supported by firmer expectations of monetary tightening in Australia.\nThe Australian Dollar had recently struggled amid heightened risk aversion, triggered by a correction in technology stocks linked to concerns over heavy investment in artificial intelligence. Often seen as a liquid barometer of global risk sentiment, the Australian currency was temporarily sidelined in favor of safe-haven assets.\nSupport returned following comments from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Michele Bullock. She stated that the board had raised the policy rate because the Australian economy is more capacity-constrained than previously assessed, requiring a more restrictive monetary stance. According to Bullock, the central bank must curb demand growth unless supply capacity expands more rapidly. These remarks revived expectations of another rate hike, with markets now assigning a higher chance to additional tightening as early as May.\nRecent Australian macroeconomic data have also provided some support. Australia\u2019s Trade Balance widened to AUD 3.373 billion in December, up from AUD 2.597 billion previously and slightly above market expectations. Exports rose 1.0% MoM, mainly driven by metals and mineral ores, while imports fell 0.8%, reflecting softer domestic demand. Meanwhile, S&P Global PMI surveys show a sharp acceleration in services sector activity, reinforcing the view of a still-resilient economy.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar remains under pressure. The US Dollar Index (DXY) slips 0.28% on Friday and trades around 97.68 at the time of press, after two consecutive days of gains. Recent US labor market data point to a cooling job market, fueling expectations of monetary easing from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Weekly Initial Jobless Claims increased to 231,000, while private job creation measured by the ADP survey came in well below expectations.\nEven as some Fed officials urge caution and stress that inflation has yet to show clear signs of easing, markets continue to price in rate cuts later this year. This backdrop limits the US Dollar\u2019s rebound potential and allows AUD/USD to hold in positive territory, as investors await fresh macroeconomic catalysts, including upcoming US consumer sentiment data.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Yen weakens as financial uncertainty grows ahead of Japan\u2019s Lower House election\nThe Japanese yen is currently navigating conflicting pressures between a government seeking to accelerate economic growth and a central bank attempting to anchor inflationary expectations. Consequently, the Japanese currency is once again approaching the critical \u00a5158 zone.\nThe yen has depreciated amid significant political and financial uncertainty. Investors are closely monitoring the upcoming lower house election this Sunday, where the incumbent government seeks a stronger mandate to pursue its growth-oriented economic agenda.\nFinancial instability is becoming a primary concern; a further sharp depreciation in the yen could trigger significant liquidation in the domestic bond market.\nReflecting this heightened uncertainty, 10-year Japanese Government Bond yields are currently trading around the 2.22% mark\u2014a five-year high.\nThe USD/JPY pair is reclaiming its medium-term bullish trajectory, with price action trending toward historical resistance near the \u00a5159 level.\nJapanese yen ensnared by electoral uncertainty and financial stability concerns\nThe Japanese yen remains under significant pressure ahead of the lower house elections, as concerns mount regarding the financial health of the credit markets in Asia\u2019s second-largest economy. On 8 February, Japan will head to the polls. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is seeking to broaden her legislative support to implement a policy suite focused on aggressive economic growth driven by increased public expenditure. However, market participants remain wary that the proposed fiscal incentives could exacerbate inflationary pressures.\nAs a result, 10-year Japanese Government Bond yields reached 2.22%\u2014their highest level in five years\u2014as investors anticipate a more restrictive (hawkish) stance from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to curb rising prices. Amidst this backdrop, yen holders have engaged in substantial selling. The scale of the yen's depreciation has been so pronounced that rumours of a potential joint intervention by Japanese and US authorities have surfaced. Such a move would aim to defend the \u00a5159 psychological level and prevent a prominent liquidation in the bond markets of both nations.\nDespite a temporary reprieve in selling pressure over the past fortnight, renewed strength in the US dollar has pushed the USD/JPY pair back to the \u00a5157.18 level.\nFigure 1. Japan Government Bonds 10Y Yield (2021-2026). Source: Figure obtained from TradingView.\nTechnical analysis of the USD/JPY pair\nFrom a technical perspective, the USD/JPY pair continues to respect its medium-term bullish momentum. Key observations include:\n- Trend Context: In the long term, the pair remains within a broad consolidation pattern, reflecting deep-seated market indecision. Conversely, the medium-term trend is technically bullish, characterised by a sequence of \"higher highs\" and \"higher lows,\" with prices maintaining a position above the 50, 100, and 200-period Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).\n- Resistance Levels: If short-term resistance at \u00a5159 is breached to the upside, the next significant technical ceiling is the relevant peak of \u00a5161.50. A decisive break above this level would signal a potential extension into higher territory.\n- Support Levels: Should the short-term support at \u00a5152 fail\u2014a critical zone where an ascending trend line, the 200-period SMA, and horizontal support converge\u2014the next structural floor is located at \u00a5147. A breach of the \u00a5147 zone would significantly increase the probability of a deeper market correction.\n- Momentum Indicators: Both the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are currently oscillating within neutral zones. This behaviour underscores the prevailing uncertainty; consequently, the next major directional shift in the USD/JPY pair will likely be dictated by fundamental developments.\nFigure 2.

                "body": "Japanese Yen bulls seem hesitant amid fiscal concerns, ahead of snap election\n- Japanese Yen bears take some profits off the table heading into Japan\u2019s snap election on Sunday.\n- Rising bets for an imminent BoJ rate hike and the risk-off impulse also benefit the safe-haven JPY.\n- The USD pauses the recent recovery from a four-year low and further exerts pressure on USD/JPY.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) struggles to capitalize on its modest intraday strength against a broadly retreating US Dollar (USD) and remains close to a two-week trough, touched the previous day. Investors remain concerned about Japan's financial health on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's expansionary fiscal plans. Moreover, the political uncertainty ahead of the snap election on February 8 is holding back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the JPY.\nMeanwhile, traders remain on high alert amid the possibility of a coordinated Japan-US intervention to stem the JPY's weakness. This, along with a turnaround in the risk sentiment and bets that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will stick to its policy normalization path, assists the JPY to snap a five-day losing streak. The USD, on the other hand, is pressured by bets for more rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed), which weighs on the USD/JPY pair through the early European session.\nJapanese Yen remains on the front foot amid BoJ rate hike bets and risk-off mood\n- Data released earlier this Friday showed that Household Spending in Japan declined 2.6% YoY in December 2025, marking a sharp contraction after a 2.9% rise in the previous month. This suggests that elevated living costs are weighing on consumption, reinforcing the Bank of Japan's resolve to counter inflation and backing the case for an early interest rate hike.\n- In fact, the Summary of Opinions from the BoJ's January meeting, released earlier this week, showed that policymakers debated mounting price pressures from a weak Japanese Yen. Moreover, board members judged that further interest rate increases were appropriate over time. This assists the JPY to gain some positive traction during the Asian session on Friday.\n- Asian stocks extended losses into a second day as a selloff on Wall Street intensified amid a global rout in tech equities, and also benefited the safe-haven JPY. The US Dollar, on the other hand, consolidates its recent gains to a two-week peak and prompts traders to lighten their USD/JPY bullish bets ahead of Japan's snap lower house election on Sunday, February 8.\n- Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) looks set for a big victory. This would give Takaichi a greater grip on Japan's parliament and more headroom to carry out her pro-stimulus macro policies much more forcefully. The market seems worried that expansionary fiscal plans may hurt Japan's already strained public finances quite badly.\n- From the US, the US Department of Labor reported on Thursday that the number of citizens submitting new applications for unemployment insurance rose to 231K for the week ending January 31 from the previous week\u2019s 209K. The reading was also higher than the 212K initial estimates and comes on top of dismal private-sector employment details released Wednesday.\n- Adding to this, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) revealed that the number of job openings on the last business day of December stood at 6.542 million compared to the previous month's downwardly revised print of 6.928 million. This pointed to labor market weakness and strengthened the case for more interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.\n- In fact, traders are currently pricing in the possibility that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs two more times in 2026. This, in turn, keeps a lid on the recent strong US Dollar recovery from a four-year trough and also contributes to the USD/JPY pair's modest pullback from a two-week high, levels above the 157.00 mark, touched on Thursday.\n- Traders now look forward t"

The recovery from just under 152 has already reclaimed roughly 3.5%, putting spot on track for about a 1.5% weekly gain while the Yen posts its second straight week as the weakest major. The immediate band that matters now is 156.50\u2013158.00: the pair is holding above 156.45 intraday lows and trading around 157.00 as markets price in a highly probable landslide win for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party and continued carry demand into the weekend.\nUSD/JPY \u2013 Election arithmetic, fiscal fears and the 240% debt overhang\nPolls point to the LDP securing at least the 233 seats needed for a simple majority in the Lower House, with several surveys flagging the risk of an LDP\u2013Japan Innovation Party (JIP) bloc pushing toward the 310-seat supermajority threshold. A supermajority would let the coalition override Upper House resistance and ram through expansive fiscal packages at a time when Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is already around 240%. That combination \u2013 bigger deficits in a country this indebted \u2013 has been a core driver of Yen weakness since October and explains why USD/JPY ripped from roughly 147.06 in early October to the 159.45 area by mid-January. Even a plain LDP majority, without a formal supermajority, still strengthens Takaichi\u2019s hand enough to keep the market focused on more borrowing, more bond supply and a Bank of Japan forced to tread carefully on tightening. Near term, that political setup is bullish for USD/JPY, because it reinforces the perception that Tokyo will keep leaning on easy money and fiscal stimulus to support growth.\nUSD/JPY \u2013 Household spending slump exposes the BoJ\u2019s dilemma on inflation and the weak Yen\nDecember household spending fell 2.6% year-on-year after a 2.9% rise in November, a swing of more than five percentage points and a clear negative surprise. With private consumption accounting for roughly 55\u201360% of Japan\u2019s GDP, a contraction of that magnitude matters. On the surface it softens the case for an aggressive Bank of Japan, because weaker consumption typically cools demand-driven inflation and raises downside risk for growth. The twist is that part of the spending slump is likely imported from the FX market: a weaker Yen pushes up the cost of energy and food, eroding household purchasing power even if nominal wages are not collapsing. The BoJ has already flagged the need to deal with Yen weakness as a channel for import-driven inflation; that is why talk of \u201crate checks\u201d and intervention re-entered the market when USD/JPY spiked toward the 159 area. The result is an awkward trade-off: allow USD/JPY to stretch higher and you risk further squeezing households; tighten too quickly and you hit a consumer that is already cutting back. For the medium term, that mix still leans toward a BoJ that edges rates higher over 2026 rather than sitting on its hands indefinitely \u2013 a Yen-positive shift once election noise fades.\nUSD/JPY \u2013 Fed path, soft US labour data and why carry is still working for now\nOn the US side, the dollar backdrop is no longer one-way bullish, but the rate gap versus Japan remains wide enough to keep carry trades alive. Jobless claims jumped more than expected in the last week of January and JOLTS job openings dropped to their weakest print in more than five years, while the ADP employment report slowed to about 22K from 41K the prior month. Those numbers pushed markets to increase the probab"

                "body": "The USD/CAD pair edges lower during the early European session on Friday, hovering around the 1.3685 area. The modest pullback reflects a softer US Dollar, pressured by a series of disappointing US economic indicators, while the Canadian Dollar draws support from rising crude oil prices. Later in the day, market participants will turn their attention to the preliminary February reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which could offer fresh insight into US consumer confidence and near-term economic momentum.\nRecent US labor market data have reinforced concerns that economic conditions may be losing steam. Weekly Initial Jobless Claims climbed more than anticipated, pointing to emerging stress in employment conditions. At the same time, US job openings declined unexpectedly in December, falling to their lowest level since 2020, while layoffs increased. Adding to the cautious tone, corporate announcements showed that job cuts in January were the highest since the global financial crisis in 2009. Together, these signals suggest a cooling labor market, which tends to weigh on the US Dollar by strengthening expectations that the Federal Reserve may eventually need to ease policy further.\nOn the Canadian side, the Loonie is finding support from developments in the energy market. Persistent geopolitical tensions and supply-side risks are underpinning crude oil prices, a key driver for the Canadian Dollar. As Canada is one of the world\u2019s largest oil exporters, higher oil prices typically translate into improved trade flows and stronger demand for the CAD, limiting upside potential in USD/CAD.\nThat said, deeper losses in the pair may be capped by shifting expectations around US monetary policy leadership. US President Donald Trump\u2019s recent nomination of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair has prompted markets to reassess the future policy path. Warsh is widely viewed as favoring a more cautious approach to rate cuts and has previously emphasized the importance of reducing the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. These perceptions have helped stabilize the US Dollar, even in the face of weaker macroeconomic data.\nIn the near term, USD/CAD is likely to remain sensitive to incoming US data and oil price movements. While softer US fundamentals and firm energy prices favor the Canadian Dollar, evolving Fed leadership expectations may continue to limit the downside for the pair.\nTrade Idea:\nSell USD/CAD on rallies toward 1.3720\u20131.3750, targeting 1.3600, with a stop above 1.3800, as weak US data and firm oil prices favor the Canadian Dollar."

And if Canada\u2019s cycle stays soft, the loonie could lag other commodity-linked currencies like the australian dollar, reminding investors that resource exporters don\u2019t always move as a pack.\nThe bigger picture: Cheaper money needs open channels.\nRate cuts only stimulate growth if they flow through to credit, construction, and exports. When housing and factories stay muted, it can signal structural frictions or cautious households and businesses \u2013 and that can extend the easing cycle. In that world, weaker demand and a bigger output gap may keep inflation contained, pushing central banks to cut more than investors initially price in.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "USD/CAD holds below 1.3700 amid weak US labor data, higher crude oil prices\n- USD/CAD posts modest losses around 1.3685 in Friday\u2019s early European session.\n- US weekly jobless claims increased more than expected last week; JOLTS job openings plummeted in December.\n- Higher crude oil prices could underpin the commodity-linked Loonie.\nThe USD/CAD pair trades with mild losses near 1.3685 during the early European session on Friday. The US Dollar (USD) softens against the Canadian Dollar (CAD) amid weaker-than-expected US economic data and a rise in crude oil prices. The preliminary reading of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index report for February will be in the spotlight later on Friday.\nData released on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week. Meanwhile, US job openings unexpectedly fell in December to the lowest level since 2020, and layoffs rose. Companies revealed the most job cutbacks in January since the Great Recession in 2009. Signs of weakening in the US labor market could drag the Greenback lower against the CAD.\nMeanwhile, ongoing geopolitical risks could boost crude oil prices and provide some support to the commodity-linked Loonie. It is worth noting that Canada is a major oil-exporting country, and high crude oil prices generally have a positive impact on the CAD.\nHowever, the downside for the pair might be limited amid hawkish shifts in Federal Reserve (Fed) leadership expectations. US President Donald Trump nominated former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as Fed chair last week. Traders anticipate a slower pace of interest rate cuts under his tenure and a focus on shrinking the Fed's balance sheet.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar.

On one side, IBIT sits at the center of listed crypto exposure during a period of intense price pressure and large redemptions, which can give you a real time view of how larger investors are reacting. On the other side, Aladdin's new link to Preqin data relates to how BlackRock serves institutions that are allocating to private markets and looking for more robust tools.\nTogether, they highlight how NYSE:BLK is involved in both newer ETF products tied to digital assets and more established technology for institutional portfolios.

Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on BlackRock.\nWhy BlackRock could be great value\nFor you as an investor, IBIT\u2019s record US$10b trading day during a 13% Bitcoin drop sends a clear signal that institutional money is still active in listed crypto but willing to pull back quickly when volatility spikes. At the same time, Aladdin\u2019s integration of Preqin data into its private-markets system shows BlackRock leaning further into fee-based, tech-driven infrastructure for institutions that want a single place to assess, allocate and monitor both public and private assets.\nHow this fits the BlackRock narrative\nThese moves line up with the longer-term story many investors already watch for BlackRock, where core ETFs like IBIT sit alongside higher-margin private-markets and technology services. The same themes you see in earlier narratives about alternatives growth and Aladdin\u2019s role are echoed here, with the IBIT flows highlighting shorter-term sentiment swings while the Aladdin Preqin tie-up speaks to the slower, systems-focused part of the business that can matter for client stickiness against rivals such as Vanguard and State Street."

According to one observer, the record activity stemmed from a hedge fund blowup, while others disagreed, citing routine market chaos as a catalyst.\nWhat really stood out\nOn Friday, as the ETF tanked 13% to its lowest level since October 2024, options volume exploded to a record 2.33 million contracts, with puts narrowly outpacing calls.\nThe fact that puts saw more volume than calls on Thursday indicates a higher demand for downside protection, a typical occurrence during price sell-offs.\nOptions are derivative contracts that provide built-in insurance against swings in the price of the underlying asset, in this case, IBIT. You pay a small fee (premium) for the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell IBIT at a set price by a deadline or expiry.\nA call option lets you lock in IBIT at a set price today for a small premium. If it rallies above that level later, you buy cheap and sell for profit; if not, you only lose the premium. A put option locks in the sale of IBIT at that price. If it slides below, you sell high and pocket the difference; otherwise, you lose just the premium. Calls offer leveraged upside bets, while puts protect against downside drops.\nAnother standout figure was the record $900 million in premiums paid by IBIT options buyers that day\u2014the highest single-day total ever. To put it in context, that's equivalent to the market cap of several crypto tokens ranking beyond the top 70.\nSpeculative theory: record activity tied to hedge fund blowup\nA post by market analyst Parker, which has gone viral on X, argues that the $900 million premium payments resulted from the blowup of a large hedge fund (one or a few) with nearly 100% of money invested in IBIT. Funds often focus on just one asset, avoiding spreading out risk exposure elsewhere.\nParker's post alleges that this fund initially bought cheap \"out of the money\" call options on IBIT following the October crash, anticipating a quick recovery and bigger rally.\nThese OTM calls are like cheap lottery tickets at levels well above the ongoing price of the underlying asset. If the asset rallies past these levels, these calls make significant money; if it doesn't, buyers of these calls lose the initial premium paid.\nHowever, the fund bought these calls using borrowed money. As IBIT continued to drop, they doubled down on their bet.\nOn Thursday, as IBIT crashed, these calls tanked in value and brokers hit the fund with margin calls demanding cash/collateral. The fund, having bled money elsewhere, was unable to provide the same and ended up dumping large amounts of IBIT shares in the market, resulting in a record $10 billion spot volume.\nThe fund also desperately replaced expiring calls or closed loss-making calls, resulting in a record $900 million in total premium payments. Essentially, Parker associates the record activity with one or a few massive players scrambling, not routine trading.\nShreyas Chari, director of trading and head of derivatives at Monarq Asset Management put it best: \"Systematic selling "

BlackRock is already known for its global ETF and index fund franchise, and IBIT adds a crypto exposure option that trades on traditional market infrastructure.\nAt the same time, JioBlackRock Personalised Investment Advice points to a world where advice, portfolio tools, and execution are increasingly delivered through apps and online platforms. If you follow NYSE:BLK, these moves may be useful context when you think about how large asset managers are positioning themselves around digital assets and technology-driven distribution.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for BlackRock by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on BlackRock.\nHow BlackRock stacks up against its biggest competitors\nIBIT\u2019s record US$10b trading day and the launch of app based advice with JioBlackRock both point in the same direction for BlackRock, which is to sit wherever flows and client engagement are strongest, whether that is a spot Bitcoin ETF or a mobile advisory channel. Alongside these, partnerships such as the multi alternatives separately managed account with Partners Group and technology tie ups like the Preqin integration into Aladdin\u2019s private markets platform show BlackRock trying to connect high demand asset classes like digital assets and private markets with scalable, tech led distribution in a way peers such as Vanguard and State Street are also pursuing.\nHow This Fits Into The BlackRock Narrative\nThese moves line up with the existing narrative that BlackRock is leaning into higher fee alternatives, infrastructure and technology driven services as a complement to its core index and ETF business. IBIT\u2019s large asset base, private markets SMAs spanning private equity, private credit and real assets, and digital advice partnerships in markets such as India are all different expressions of the same theme of using data and platforms to deepen relationships across both institutional and retail clients.\nRisks and Rewards To Keep In Mind\n- IBIT\u2019s position as the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with around US$56b in assets gives BlackRock a visible role in a new fee pool that competitors like Fidelity and VanEck are also targeting.\n- Partnerships such as the multi alternatives SMA with Partners Group and the Preqin data integration into Aladdin and eFront can make it easier for advisors to access private markets at scale, which may support stickier relationships.\n- Higher volumes in IBIT have come during sharp Bitcoin price swings and ETF outflows, which ties part of BlackRock\u2019s franchise to crypto market volatility and changing risk appetite.\n- Expanding in private markets, stablecoins and infrastructure acquisitions introduces execution, regulatory and operational risks, especially as large deals and complex platforms become more important to the business mix.\nWhat To Watch Next\nFrom here, it is worth tracking whether IBIT\u2019s trading activity translates into durable assets under management, how quickly advisors adopt the new multi alternatives SMAs, and whether digital advice partnerships like JioBlackRock gain real traction with end investors. If you want a broader sense of how these pieces fit into the long term story"

DeFi projects, financial platforms that operate without third-party intermediaries, are usually apps built using Ethereum, the blockchain behind the second biggest cryptocurrency, ETH.\nThe project\u2019s lending and borrowing platform World Liberty Markets launched in January 2026, promising to offer users \u201caccess to transparent, high-performance liquidity markets\u201d powered by DeFi yield protocol Dolomite.\nIt's worth noting that while there are plenty of DeFi apps, the space is still a highly experimental part of the crypto industry and has been plagued by hacks and scams.\nThose in the DeFi space typically say they want to streamline a slow and expensive legacy banking system, and World Liberty Financial so far has sold itself as the quintessential DeFi project: A borrowing and lending platform that will \"unlock financial access for all, by replacing the limits of traditional banking with open, on-chain infrastructure, creating a fairer system\u2014where opportunity isn't defined by location, status, or permission.\"\nWhat can you do with World Liberty Financial?\nWhile you can't yet take loans out using the platform, you can buy its native token, WLFI, which has a market cap of $3.05 billion as of February 2026, making it the 34th biggest cryptocurrency in existence, per CoinGecko data. WLFI is available on crypto exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and OKX.\nThe project also has its own stablecoin, USD1, which Decrypt first revealed in October 2024. The stablecoin runs on Ethereum and BNB Chain, Solana, Tron and Plume Network, and is available on American exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken.\nStablecoins are digital tokens pegged to the value of fiat currencies\u2014in USD1\u2019s case, the U.S. dollar. The assets are a key part of the DeFi economy (and the wider crypto economy) because traders use them to swiftly enter and exit digital asset transactions. Instead of using dollars on traditional banking rails, digital tokens accelerate the crypto trading process.\nIn January 2026, World Liberty Financial filed an application with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to form a national trust bank. The proposal would place its USD1 stablecoin under direct federal supervision, rather than the current structure designed for state-licensed entities.\nUnder the proposal, an entity named as World Liberty Trust Company would take over the issuance and redemption of USD1, as well as offering conversion and custody services from fiat and other stablecoins, and reserve management for the assets backing outstanding USD1.\nPresident Trump is listed as \"co-founder emeritus\" on the World Liberty Financial website, meaning he is no longer involved in the project since taking office in January. His close friend and the White House's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is also listed as a \"co-founder emeritus.\"\nStill, the Trump and Witkoff families have likely made a lot of money from the project: Steve Witkoff's son, Zach, is the CEO, and the president's three sons, Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron, are listed as co-founde"

The integration aims to enhance the user experience by allowing wallet users to engage with these two popular crypto ecosystems without needing alternative wallets or wrapped tokens.\nThe launch for Solana is expected in May, marking MetaMask's first foray into supporting a non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain. Full Bitcoin support is anticipated to commence in the third quarter of 2025.\nWith these additions, users will be able to buy, sell, swap, and interact with decentralized applications (DApps) across the entire Solana ecosystem. Existing Solana users will also benefit from MetaMask's security and feature-rich environment.\nIn addition to the new crypto support, MetaMask is planning a significant revamp of its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). One notable feature is the introduction of gas-included swaps, which will allow users to conduct token swaps without needing to hold Ethereum (ETH) for gas fees. This feature is set to roll out in March 2025.\nFurthermore, the wallet will soon enable users to manage multiple wallets through multiple Secret Recovery Phrases (SRPs), with this feature expected to go live next month.\nMetaMask is also introducing a physical card that allows users to make real-world purchases with crypto, utilizing Mastercard's payment network. The virtual version is already available in select regions, and the physical card will launch in April.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).

Benefit from expert knowledge. Sign up now!\nVibe Check: Ethereum is in pure crossroads mode right now. Price action has been swinging with aggressive spikes and nasty shakeouts, while narratives around ETFs, Layer-2 scaling, and upcoming upgrades are heating up. With volatility surging and sentiment flipping between euphoria and panic, ETH is acting like a coiled spring \u2013 but nobody knows if it snaps up or down first.\nWant to see what people are saying? Here are the real opinions:\n- Watch the most hyped Ethereum price prediction videos on YouTube\n- Scroll fresh Ethereum trend posts blowing up on Instagram\n- Binge viral TikToks on high-risk Ethereum trading plays\nThe Narrative: Ethereum is no longer just a speculative altcoin, it is the backbone of an entire on-chain economy \u2013 DeFi, NFTs, gaming, RWAs (real-world assets), and DAOs all orbit around it. But with that dominance comes pressure.\nOn the tech side, Layer-2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync and others are in a full-on scaling war. They are fighting for users, TVL, and narrative dominance \u2013 airdrops, incentives, and yield bribes everywhere. The wild twist? Every time users migrate to these rollups, they are still ultimately paying Ethereum Mainnet for data availability and security. That means Ethereum is quietly becoming more of a settlement layer, less of a day-to-day playground.\nThis has two big implications:\n- Mainnet activity looks quieter on the surface \u2013 fewer small retail transactions, more big whale and institutional-style moves.\n- Revenue composition shifts \u2013 L2s handle the heavy traffic, but they constantly post data back to Ethereum, feeding it fees in the background.\nMeanwhile, macro narratives around ETFs, regulations, and institutional access are turning Ethereum into a serious asset class rather than just a degen toy. Talk across major crypto media has locked in on topics like potential spot ETH ETF flows, whether ETH will be classed as a commodity or security, and how staking yields compare to traditional bond yields. That is real TradFi energy, not just Twitter cope.\nBut there is a dark side. Retail remembers the brutal drawdowns, the gas fee nightmares during NFT mania, and the endless promises of cheaper, faster transactions \"soon.\" A lot of people feel burned. So while institutions are quietly positioning, retail liquidity is still skittish. That mismatch is exactly where huge asymmetric moves are born \u2013 the kind that make some portfolios explode and others get completely rekt.\nLayer-2 Wars: Is Ethereum Losing Users Or Leveling Up?\nLet us zoom into the Layer-2 story, because this is where most of the confusion sits. You are seeing more action and hype on chains like:\n- Arbitrum \u2013 Massive DeFi footprint, high TVL, big whales farming, tons of yield strategies.\n- Optimism \u2013 Betting hard on the Superchain vision, with multiple chains all aligned under one shared stack.\n- Base \u2013 Coinbase-backed, aggressive on onboarding normies, NFT mints, social apps, and consumer crypto.\nOn TikTok and YouTube, creators are constantly shilling new L2 plays, airdrop strategies, and \"next 100x\" tokens. To the average trader, it looks like Ethereum is losing dominance. But under the hood, these L2s are basically turbocharged lanes plugged into the Ethereum highway.\nEvery rollup settles back down to Ethereum. That means:\n- Security anchor: Ethereum validators ultimately secure the system.\n- Data fees: L2 batches get posted to Ethereum, generating Mainnet revenue.\n- Value gravity: High-value assets still prefer Ethereum because of liquidity depth and perceived safety.\nThe big risk? If L2 user experience gets insanely good and gas fees on L2s stay super low, some users will barely touch Mainnet. Ethereum shifts into a more \"invisible\" role. From a narrative perspective, that can scare people who are watching only Mainnet metrics "

Solana treasury firms with negative holdings include Forward Industries (-64%), Solana Company (-65%), DeFi DevCorp (-42%), Sharps Tech (68%), and Upexi (47%).\nAt the time of publication, Solana has dropped more than 3% in the past 24 hours. SOL is currently trading at $83.89, having rebounded from $70 during the day.\nThe drop in Solana\u2019s price mirrors the huge SOL liquidations seen on Friday. On-chain data revealed that more than $300 million in long positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours. The single largest liquidation was approximately $6.69 million.\nThe liquidations explain why SOl holdings held by treasury companies have dropped significantly in the previous few weeks. On-chain data for 19 Solana treasury entities showed the DATs hold around 18.5 million SOL. The firms\u2019 holdings amount to approximately $1.54 billion, a 39.1% drop in the last 30 days.\nForward Industries currently has 6.9 million SOL on its balance sheet, valued at around $580 million, followed by Solana Company with 2.3 million SOL, valued at more than $192 million. DeFi Development Corp holds 2.2 million SOL, worth about $184 million, while Upexi and Sharps Technology hold around 2 million ($169 million) and 1.9 million ($167.6 million), respectively.\nThe total market cap of Forward Industries as of Thursday was $415 million, followed by DeFi Development with $96 million. Solmate Infrastructure had a market cap of $88 million, followed by Solana Company at $82 million. Upexi and Sharps Technology recorded a market cap of $70 million and $38 million, respectively.\nAs of Friday, DeFi Development had the most 24-hour trading volume at more than $10.7 million, followed by Forward Industries with $8.5 million. Upexi recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $5.1 million, while Solmate Infrastructure and Solana Company had $1.5 million and $1.12 million, respectively.\nDespite the drop in SOL treasuries, Kyle Samani, Co-Founder of Multicoin Capital, revealed on Thursday that he would be doubling down on his investment in Forward Industries. The initiative aims to increase his indirect exposure to Solana.\nThe crypto mogul said he was still optimistic about Solana and the broader crypto industry. He plans to boost his exposure to SOL through his personal investments and as Chairman of Forward Industries.\nSamani also revealed that his optimism about crypto stems from his belief that the CLARITY Act will unlock a tidal wave of new entrants into the market. He also believes that the legislation will spur the adoption of digital assets in the future. The crypto investor stepped down from his role at Multicoin, arguing that he needs to explore new areas of technology.\nOn-chain data revealed that SOL spot ETFs attracted more than $2.82 million on Thursday. The Fidelity Solana ETF saw the highest total net inflows of around $1.86 million. The fund\u2019s cumulative net inflows also reached $158 million. Bitwise followed with the second-highest inflows at $1.48 million, bringing its cumulative net inflow to $682 million.\nAs SOL treasuries continue to decline, Solana Foundation President Lily Liu recently urged the crypto industry to return to blockchains\u2019 original focus: finance. She urged the industry to refrain from the years of attempts to frame blockchains as a generalized replacement for the modern internet.\nDon\u2019t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Friday marked the first time the Dow exceeded the 50,000 level. The S&P 500 jumped 1.97% and ended at 6,932.30, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.18% to 23,031.21. With those moves, the S&P 500 climbed back into the green for 2026.\nEven with Friday's pop, the S&P 500 posted a 0.1% decline for the week, while the Nasdaq fell 1.8% on the week. The 30-stock Dow rose 2.5% week to date, benefiting from some rotation into some economically cyclical stocks even as the overall market was weighed down by tech selling.\nNvidia and Broadcom were two of the key winners Friday, with the former increasing by nearly 8% and the latter growing 7% following big declines earlier in the week. Other stocks such as Oracle and Palantir Technologies also bounced back as investors reconsidered some of the names at cheaper levels. Oracle and Palantir each rose 4%. Some key software stocks like ServiceNow \u2014 which has been the epicenter of the tech sell-off because of an artificial intelligence disruption fear of software \u2014 remained weak on Friday, however.\n\"We're in a gold rush right now with AI,\" said Falcon Wealth Planning founder Gabriel Shahin.\n\"You have the investment that Google is making, Nvidia is making, that Meta is making, that Amazon is making. There is money that will be deployed,\" he also said. \"It's just the carousel [of money movement] sometimes scares people.\"\nShahin believes the market is in the midst of a \"great recalibration,\" where investors are going to move further out of growth stocks and into value. Over the coming months, his bet is on large-cap value names. That played out Friday, with investors buying up shares in areas such as industrials and financials. In those sectors, Caterpillar and Goldman Sachs were standouts, supporting the Dow's outperformance with their rise of 7% and 4%, respectively. Small-cap stocks also saw a boost: The Russell 2000 index rallied 3.6%.\nBitcoin recouped some losses Friday, adding 10% and touching a session high of $71,458.01 after briefly sinking below $61,000 overnight to its lowest level since October 2024 \u2014 more than 52% off from its record high of $126,000 hit in early October 2025. Friday's move higher helped ease some of the risk-off concerns among investors that recently plagued the broader market. The cryptocurrency has lost 16% this week, however.\nThe week was bleak heading into Friday, with the S&P 500 on pace for its worst week since last October and the Nasdaq Composite on track for its worst week since the tariff-related market plunge of last April. Friday's pop pared those declines significantly.\nAmazon was an outlier Friday, as shares sank more than 5% after the e-commerce giant posted earnings per share slightly under analyst expectations and told investors to expect $200 billion in capital expenditures this year."

                "body": "Nearly $240bn has been wiped off the value of Amazon in a sign that investors have become anxious at the eye watering sums being spent by Wall Street on AI.\nThe e-commerce giant\u2019s shares plunged by 10pc at the start of trading after it outlined a $200bn (\u00a3148bn) spending surge on AI infrastructure.\nIts fresh spending plans were announced a day after Google said its AI spending would double this year to $185bn in an arms race between the major companies.\nThe total capital expenditure on AI projects by Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft is on track to hit $650bn this year alone.\nInvestors raced to defend their backing of major tech companies in the AI race after sharp downturn on Wall Street on Thursday, which saw the tech heavy Nasdaq drop by 1.6pc. US stocks rebounded in early trading today.\nFabiana Fedeli, chief investment officer of equities at M&G Investments, said the recent sell-off was a \u201cmeaningful adjustment rather than a structural break in the AI investment cycle\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cWhile some have drawn comparisons to the year 2000, today\u2019s conditions differ significantly: public companies driving the current capex surge generally have strong cash flows and the financial flexibility to invest, even if some of that spending ultimately proves misallocated.\n\u201cInvestors are rightly questioning whether this is the \u2018AI bubble\u2019 deflating or simply another episode of volatility. Concerns around rising capex and software companies over\u2011promising on AI revenue delivery are legitimate, yet this is not a watershed moment. Instead, it marks a reset as markets reassess expectations.\u201d\nAndy Jassy, the company\u2019s chief executive, said the tech giant\u2019s capital expenditure would grow by around 60pc this year as its giant cloud computing business attempts to keep ahead of rivals.\nThe spending plans came a day after Google said its AI spending would double this year to $185bn in an arms race between the major companies.\nShares fell by as much as 10pc, wiping almost $250bn off the company\u2019s value, in after-hours trading.\nAmazon, controlled by billionaire Jeff Bezos, said profits grew by 31pc last year to $77.7bn, and annual sales grew 12pc to $717bn."

It has also benefited from the rising crude oil prices, with Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rising to over $65 amid the rising geopolitical tensions.\nBP\u2019s earnings will likely be weak because of the lower oil prices during the quarter. Just this week, Shell posted the weakest quarterly profits in five years.

Barclays stock has jumped by 56% in the last 12 months, while NatWest rose by 54%. The two shares have dropped sharply in the last two days after the BoE hinted of a rate cut in March.\nBarclays earnings will likely be strong because of its investment banking division, which is benefiting from the recovering corporate activity and trading activity. Natwest will also benefit from the rising profits as we experienced with Lloyds.\nAstraZeneca\nAstraZeneca, the biggest company in the FTSE 100 Index, will also be in the spotlight this week as it releases its numbers. These results come as the stock has jumped by over 45% from its lowest level in March last year.\nThe numbers come as the company announced a plan to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and to invest $15 billion of dollars in China through 2030. It also announced a partnership with CSPC Pharmaceuticals to boost its obesity portfolio. It also plans to invest $50 billion in the United States.\nMeanwhile, traders will also watch mining companies like Rio Tinto and Glencore, which abandoned their $260 billion merger this year. The two companies failed to agree on the price and governance for the combined company. Glencore wanted to own a 40% stake in the combined company.\nThe other top companies to watch next week will be Barrett Redrow, PZ Cussons, RELX, and Schroders.\nAdditionally, the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices will react to the upcoming UK GDP data and a potential Trump strike on Iran.\nThe post Top FTSE 250 and FTSE 100 shares to watch: BP, Barclays, NatWest, AstraZeneca appeared first on Invezz\nRead More\nTop FTSE 250 and FTSE 100 shares to watch: BP, Barclays, NatWest, AstraZeneca\nShare:\nThe FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices remained in a narrow range this week as some large companies like Shell and Unilever published their earnings, and after the Bank of England delivered its interest rate decision.

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is trading in a tense, watch-your-back zone \u2013 not a euphoric moonshot, not a meltdown, but a serious battleground between determined bulls and stubborn bears. Price action is showing choppy swings around key resistance and support areas, with German blue chips trying to shake off recession headlines while global investors selectively dip-buy Europe for value.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch deep-dive DAX 40 analysis from real traders on YouTube\n- Scroll Instagram trends to see how creators frame German stock opportunities\n- Tap into viral TikTok DAX trading setups and scalping ideas\nThe Story: The current DAX 40 story is all about tension between ugly macro headlines and quietly improving risk appetite.\nOn one side you have the classic German drama: weak manufacturing data, worries about the energy bill, and a bruised auto sector that is fighting on too many fronts (electric transition, Chinese competition, tighter regulation). On the other side you have a European Central Bank that is gradually shifting from aggressive tightening to a more cautious, data-dependent stance, plus global investors hunting relatively cheap value outside the expensive U.S. tech bubble.\nECB Policy & EUR/USD \u2013 Why Every DAX Trader Needs To Care\nThe European Central Bank, under Christine Lagarde, is still walking a tightrope: inflation has cooled from its peak, but it is not fully tamed, while growth in the euro area looks fragile. That mix forces the ECB to be tough in words, but flexible in actions. For DAX traders, this is not academic; it directly hits index flows and sector rotations.\nHere is the chain reaction in simple trading language:\n- If the ECB sounds too hawkish: bond yields in Europe can stay elevated, financial conditions tighten, and equity valuations in cyclical German names feel pressure. That tends to weigh on industrials and autos and can cap any aggressive DAX breakout.\n- If the ECB leans more dovish: markets start to price in easier conditions ahead, the euro often softens against the U.S. dollar, and export-heavy German corporates suddenly look more attractive. That is rocket fuel for DAX components that sell globally.\nThe EUR/USD pair is the silent DJ setting the mood for the DAX party. A softer euro typically helps German exporters, improving their global competitiveness and future earnings in euro terms. That can offset a lot of domestic gloom. But if EUR/USD starts to climb strongly, export margins can get squeezed just as demand is already shaky, which keeps a lid on DAX upside.\nRight now, the messaging from Lagarde and the ECB is cautiously balanced: they do not want to crush the economy with excessive tightening, but they cannot declare victory on inflation, either. That keeps traders in a constant state of alert. Every ECB press conference, every speech, every inflation print turns into a potential volatility event for the DAX.\nThe Sector Check \u2013 Auto Pain vs. Tech & Industrial Survivors\nThe German DAX 40 is not just a number; it is a mix of very different stories. To trade the index like a pro, you need to know which sectors are dragging it down and which ones are secretly keeping it afloat.\n1. The Auto Sector \u2013 From National Pride To High-Risk Trade\nVolkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and the broader auto complex have shifted from low-drama value plays to high-beta macro trades. The problems stack up fast:\n- EV Transition: German carmakers are pouring capital into electric platforms while competing head-on with Tesla and aggressively priced Chinese EV brands.

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is locked in a tense, emotional zone right now \u2013 not a euphoric moonshot, not a panic meltdown, but a nervy tug-of-war where every headline about the ECB, German industry, or US data triggers sharp swings. Think grinding range, fake breakouts, fast reversals, and aggressive profit taking on both sides. Bulls and bears are trading punches, and the index is circling around crucial zones where a decisive breakout or breakdown could define the next big multi-week move.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh DAX 40 breakdowns from pro and retail traders on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest German stock market mood on Instagram\n- Tap into viral DAX trading strategies and hype on TikTok\nThe Story: The current DAX story is not about one single catalyst. It is a cocktail of central bank policy, currency moves, structural German weaknesses, and global risk appetite.\n1. ECB, Lagarde and the Euro \u2013 the invisible hand behind the DAX\nThe European Central Bank sits at the center of the DAX narrative. After one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in its history, the ECB has shifted into a more cautious, data-dependent stance. Inflation in the euro area has been cooling from its peak, but core pressures and wage dynamics still make the ECB nervous. That keeps the door open for only cautious rate cuts instead of an ultra-dovish pivot.\nFor DAX traders, this matters on two levels:\n- Discount rate effect: Higher-for-longer rates weigh on valuations, especially for growth and high-duration names like tech and industrial automation. Every hint from Christine Lagarde about being patient with cuts tends to cap rallies and trigger rotation into more defensive plays.\n- EUR/USD impact: The euro vs. dollar is a turbocharger for DAX earnings. A softer euro makes exports from German giants more competitive and lifts reported profits in euro terms when overseas revenues are converted back. A firmer euro, often driven by more hawkish ECB tone, can work like a brake on DAX upside.\nRight now, the market is stuck in a messy middle: inflation is not scary enough for panic, but not tame enough for the ECB to unleash a full-blown cutting cycle. That keeps EUR/USD in a choppy, mean-reverting mode and the DAX in a frustrating environment where rallies can look powerful but fade quickly once traders realize the macro backdrop is still fragile.\nLagarde\u2019s press conferences have become high-volatility events for the DAX. A single line about being \"resolute\" on inflation or \"not declaring victory\" can flip intraday sentiment from a green rally to cautious sideways chop. Macro-focused funds are trading the DAX as a pure ECB and euro proxy, while local investors are forced to adjust to each new rate path narrative.\n2. Sector Check: Old economy pain vs. new economy resilience\nThe DAX 40 is no longer just an old-school industrial index, but autos and cyclicals still carry a lot of weight. Under the surface, there is a clear decoupling: traditional German strengths are struggling, while digital and high-tech champions are holding the line.\nGerman Autos: VW, BMW, Mercedes \u2013 from pride to pressure\nThe German auto complex is under multi-front attack:\n- China dependency: For years, China was the growth engine. Now, with local Chinese EV competitors rising and geopolitical tensions flaring, that reliance looks like a vulnerability. Margin pressure and slower demand for high-end combustion models are worrying investors.\n- EV transition: The shift from combustion to electric is massively capital-intensive. VW, BMW, and Mercedes are pouring mone"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is currently in a high-tension zone: not in full euphoria, not in panic, but in that dangerous middle ground where big moves are born. German blue chips are swinging between cautious profit-taking and aggressive dip-buying as traders price in the next macro wave from the ECB and fresh data from the German industrial engine. Direction is up for debate, volatility is back on the menu.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh YouTube deep dives on DAX 40 setups and strategies\n- Scroll Instagram moodboards on German stocks and Euro-zone wealth trends\n- Swipe through viral TikTok clips of DAX trading wins and fails\nThe Story: Right now, the DAX 40 is basically the global market\u2019s stress test for Europe. US traders are glued to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, but smart money is also scanning Germany because the DAX is the purest play on whether Europe can shake off its stagnation narrative.\nAt the center of the story sits the European Central Bank. Christine Lagarde and her team are stuck in a brutal balancing act:\n- Inflation in the euro area has cooled from its extreme spike, but it is still uncomfortable for policymakers.\n- Growth data for Germany looks fragile: soft industrial production, weak consumer confidence, and recurring recession chatter.\n- The market is constantly repricing the timing and speed of future rate cuts.\nWhy does this matter for the DAX? Because ECB policy is effectively the oxygen tank for European equities. When the ECB hints at future easing, bond yields tend to soften, the euro often comes under pressure against the US dollar, and export-heavy indices like the DAX suddenly look attractive again to global investors.\nThe ECB \u2013 Euro \u2013 DAX Triangle:\nThink of it as a three-way feedback loop:\n- ECB more dovish (talking about cuts, stressing weak growth) ? euro often softens vs. USD ? German exporters get a tailwind because their products become relatively cheaper on global markets.\n- ECB more hawkish (warning about sticky inflation, pushing back on cuts) ? euro can firm up ? that can be a headwind for exporters and sometimes pressure the DAX.\n- Currency volatility also shapes foreign investor appetite. A weaker euro can attract US and UK funds looking for cheaper Eurozone equity exposure.\nRight now, traders are laser-focused on every word out of Lagarde\u2019s mouth. Any tiny shift in tone during press conferences or speeches can flip the narrative from \u201csoft landing with gentle cuts\u201d to \u201cpolicy mistake, higher for longer.\u201d The DAX responds quickly, especially the rate-sensitive names like real estate, industrials, and growth stocks.\nMeanwhile, the euro\u2013dollar pair is still a major sentiment gauge. When EUR/USD drifts lower, you often see renewed interest in German exporters and cyclical plays. When the euro pops higher, traders tend to get more selective, selling weaker names and hiding in quality like SAP or healthcare.\nSector Check: Old Germany vs. New Germany\nThis is where the DAX story gets spicy. Under the hood, there is a big tug-of-war between the \u201cold economy\u201d industrial and auto titans and the \u201cnew economy\u201d tech and software champions.\n1. The Auto Problem: VW, BMW, Mercedes under pressure\nThe German auto industry is facing one of the toughest structural shifts in its history:\n- EV Transition: Electric vehicle adoption is accelerating, but legacy manufacturers are stuck between declining combustion margins and huge investment needs for battery platforms and software.\n- China competition: Chinese EV players are rolling aggressively into Europe with price-aggressive models.

                "body": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Kaiser Aluminum (NASDAQ:KALU). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\nHow Fast Is Kaiser Aluminum Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\nOver the last three years, Kaiser Aluminum has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Kaiser Aluminum's EPS skyrocketed from US$3.33 to US$5.31, in just one year; a result that's bound to bring a smile to shareholders. That's a commendable gain of 60%.\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Kaiser Aluminum maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 7.7% to US$3.2b. That's progress.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nSee our latest analysis for Kaiser Aluminum\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Kaiser Aluminum's forecast profits?\nAre Kaiser Aluminum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nIt's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. Kaiser Aluminum followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$38m. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. While their ownership only accounts for 1.7%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders."

                "body": "Tech Weekly: Chip Stocks Pop to Close Volatile Trading Week\nExplore this week\u2019s top tech news and market movers, plus key catalysts to watch next week.\nWelcome to the Investing News Network's weekly brief on tech news and tech stocks driving the market.\nWe also break down next week's catalysts to watch to help you prepare for the week ahead.\nIn this article:\nThis week's tech sector performance\nTech stocks extended their selloff into their second week, with the Nasdaq Composite (INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC) posting its steepest two\u2011day decline since last April.\nMonday (February 2) saw an early rotation out of tech ahead of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) earnings report. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) slipped on news that its proposed OpenAI\u2011backed investment hit a snag, dragging AI\u2011chip names like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and other semiconductor leaders.\nPalantir\u2019s earnings, which beat expectations and included an aggressive revenue growth guide, lifted shares in an early surge on Tuesday (February 3); however, Nvidia\u2019s OpenAI\u2011investment\u2011snag news, plus general AI\u2011disruption worries and positioning, weighed on the broader tech stack, sparking a tech\u2011growth selloff that impacted NVIDIA, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other software\u2011heavy names.\nThe Nasdaq fell deeper on Wednesday (February 4) as influential tech names such as AMD and other chip and software stocks reversed post\u2011earnings gains. AMD saw a sharp intraday plunge following its after\u2011hours earnings print on Tuesday. Its losses dragged the broader index lower.\nTech selloffs extended into Thursday (February 5), with the Nasdaq closing down 1.6 percent as major tech stocks saw profit\u2011taking and forward\u2011looking capex\u2011related concerns, later crystallized by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) aggressive 2026 spending plans.\nThe Nasdaq made an impressive recovery on Friday (February 6) as a rally in chip stocks helped pare earlier week losses, despite ongoing volatility in the mega\u2011caps.\n3 tech stocks moving markets this week\n1.Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER)\nAfter reporting Q4 2025 earnings results and strong AI-driven guidance on Monday, the stock rose sharply. The semiconductor\u2011test and robotics\u2011automation company makes equipment used to test chips, including AI\u2011related compute and memory and industrial robots.\n2. Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS)\nThe analog and RF\u2011semiconductor company, which designs and manufactures components used in smartphones, 5G infrastructure, automotive and IoT devices, reported Q1 fiscal 2026 results on Tuesday, beating expectations and guiding up, which helped it outperform the broader tech selloff.\n3. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nApple\u2019s strong performance this week was driven by a wave of analyst upgrades and bullish notes that reinforced the positive narrative from last week\u2019s record\u2011breaking Q1 print, especially around iPhone demand and China\u2011market strength.\nSkyworks Solutions, Teradyne and Apple performance, February 2 to 6, 2025.\nChart via Google Finance.\nTop tech news of the week\n- Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) said it's raising US$45 billion to $50 billion in gross cash proceeds during 2026 to fund additional capacity for its largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers' contracted demand.\n- Canada led an AI delegation to the 2026 World Governments Summit (WGS) in Dubai this week, led by SCALE AI.\n- Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE)reported Q4 2025 results after the market closed on Thursday, beating both earnings and revenue expectations. The stock rose sharply in after\u2011hours trading on very bullish 2026 guidance tied to AI data center demand; the company has secured major deals with Oracle, American Electric Power Company, Brookfield Asset Management (TSX:BAM,NYSE:BAM).\n- Alphabet Q4 numbers were driven by search revenue growth, which accelerated by nearly 17 percent, and Google Cloud revenue that jumped 48 percent YoY, helping ease fears that AI chatbots would eat into search.

                "body": "Over two days of questioning during his Senate confirmation hearings last year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. repeated the same answer.\nHe said the closely scrutinized 2019 trip he took to Samoa, which came before a devastating measles outbreak, had \"nothing to do with vaccines.\"\nDocuments obtained by The Guardian and The Associated Press undermine that testimony. Emails sent by staffers at the U.S. Embassy and the United Nations provide, for the first time, an inside look at how Kennedy's trip came about and include contemporaneous accounts suggesting his concerns about vaccine safety motivated the visit.\nThe documents have prompted concerns from at least one U.S. senator that the lawyer and activist now leading America's health policy lied to Congress over the visit. Samoan officials later said Kennedy's trip bolstered the credibility of anti-vaccine activists ahead of the measles outbreak, which sickened thousands of people and killed 83, mostly children under age 5.\nThe revelations, which come as measles outbreaks erupt across the U.S., build on previous criticism that Kennedy's anti-vaccine record makes him unfit to serve as health secretary, a role in which he has worked to radically reshape immunization policy and public perceptions of vaccines.\nThe newly disclosed documents also reveal previously unknown details of the trip, including that a U.S. Embassy employee helped Kennedy's team connect with Samoan officials. Kennedy, then running his anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, did not publicly discuss the trip at the time, but he has since said his \"purpose\" for going there was not related to vaccines and \"I ended up having conversations with people, some of whom I never intended to meet.\" Besides meeting with anti-vaccine activists, Kennedy met with Samoan officials, including the health minister at the time, who told NBC News that Kennedy shared his view that vaccines were not safe. Kennedy has said he went there to introduce a medical data system.\nThe U.S. State Department turned over the emails \u2014 many of which are heavily redacted \u2014 as a result of an open records lawsuit brought with the assistance of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.\nThese disclosures come at a time when Kennedy, as President Donald Trump's health secretary, has used his power and enormous public influence to overhaul federal immunization guidance and raise suspicion about the safety and importance of vaccines, including the measles vaccine. Meanwhile, measles outbreaks in multiple U.S. states have rolled back decades of success in eliminating the highly contagious disease, putting the country on the verge of losing its elimination status. The latest figures show more than 875 people in South Carolina have been infected.\n'Nothing to do with vaccines'\nWatch the video in the player above.\nKennedy addressed questions about his trip to Samoa during two Senate confirmation hearings for his appointment as health secretary.\n\"My purpose in going down there had nothing to do with vaccines,\" he said under questioning by Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts in his Jan. 30, 2025, hearing.\n\"Did the trip have nothing to do with vaccines as you told my colleagues in Senate Finance yesterday?\" Markey asked later.\n\"Nothing to do with vaccines,\" Kennedy replied.\nOne of the senators who questioned Kennedy about Samoa during his confirmation hearings, Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, responded to the records by saying, \"Kennedy's anti-vaccine agenda is directly responsible for the deaths of innocent children.\"\n\"Lying to Congress about his role in the deadly measles outbreak in Samoa only underscores the danger he now poses to families across America,\" Wyden said in an email. \"He and his allies will be held responsible.\"\nTaylor Harvey, a spokesman for Wyden and other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, said it is a crime to make a false statement to Congress and \"casual, false denials to Congress will not be swept under the rug"

                "body": "In early spring, the founders of the National Links Trust met with a White House adviser to talk about the future of golf in Washington, D.C.\nThe White House adviser, William Doffermyre, who was set to become the solicitor general at the Department of the Interior, pitched founders Mike McCartin and Will Smith on the idea of a partnership. According to sources familiar with the meeting, Doffermyre\u2019s plan was for the federal government to help renovate the three public golf courses the trust controlled: East Potomac Golf Links, Langston Golf Course and Rock Creek Park Golf.\nDoffermyre expressed to the founders that President Donald Trump was eager to cut red tape and could help raise money for the venture.\nSign Up for NOTUS\u2019 Free Daily Newsletter\nWhile skeptical, the founders were intrigued. But they needed something: assurances from the Trump administration that their organization\u2019s commitment to affordable and accessible golf would be maintained. Doffermyre said he would fight for that.\nThe three talked about the project throughout the summer of 2025. Doffermyre even recommended a lawyer at a Trump-aligned firm for the group to use as a conduit to help with negotiations with the White House. Near the end of the summer, Doffermyre told Smith and McCartin that he was working to arrange a meeting with Trump.\nBut a promising beginning morphed into chaos as Trump increasingly took an interest in remodeling many of D.C.\u2019s iconic buildings and public spaces. By the end of 2025, the Interior Department notified the nonprofit it was terminating its 50-year lease, signed in 2020, with the National Park Service and said the National Links Trust owed millions in back rent to the government.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t make the proper rent payments, and we\u2019re still looking at that full situation, but there\u2019s just no doubt about it. They didn\u2019t hit any of the development targets,\u201d an administration official with knowledge of the project told NOTUS. \u201cThey did perform in some other small ways, but those are serious problems.\u201d\nThe future of the courses \u2014 when there will be renovations, how much it will cost to golf on them, who will have access \u2014 is all now in limbo.\nNOTUS spoke with a dozen people involved or familiar with the planning of the project, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, and reviewed documents detailing the process of Trump\u2019s takeover of public courses and his vision for remaking them. Those conversations and documents show frenzied negotiations between the trust and the administration \u2014 with only the Trump side holding all the leverage.\nDoffermyre met with Trump, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and other senior White House advisers on Aug. 1, 2025, to discuss the project. That was where Burgum officially pitched the idea of turning East Potomac into a top-level course fit for tour events.\nAccording to documents reviewed by NOTUS, the pitch \u2014 titled America 250 Golf Project \u2014 would see the Interior Department and the National Park Service work closely with the National Links Trust to expedite the federal permits and other requirements needed to break ground on renovations in July 2026.\nThe National Park Foundation would launch an America 250 fundraising initiative to raise at-least $50 million to turn East Potomac into a world-class golf course named Washington National Golf Course, the documents show.\nThe presentation also showed a potential November 2025 groundbreaking at Rock Creek Park Golf and advocated for Langston Golf Course to also be included in the America 250 Golf Project, especially as the new Washington Commanders football stadium would bring heavy development to the area.\nWhile Trump\u2019s main interest was controlling the renovations at East Potomac, a picturesque course located on Hains Point with views of the National Mall, he also agreed to help raise funds for the renovations at the other two courses, a source familiar with the matter told NOTUS.\nDoffermyre then drafted a preliminary document of what an a"

Harold shared his love and experience for the game with his daughter. He was proud to coach his daughter\u2019s youth team, which helped lead to the success of the Pender girls\u2019 basketball program that we continue to see.\nHarold is survived by his wife, Cindy of McCook Lake, SD; son, Trevor (Carolyn) Janke and their children, Amy and Eric of Elkhorn, NE; daughter, Callie (Cody) Roeber, and their children, Karson, Collin, Conner, Layton, Lauryn, and Wren of Wynstone, SD; and sister, Kristen Krause of Lincoln, NE and her sons Michael (Marie) Krause and Brandon (Ashley) Krause.\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Leonard and Bonnie Janke; and his father and mother-in-law, Wilbur and Laura Lefler.\nSt. Mark's Lutheran Church\nSt. Mark's Lutheran Church\nMemorial Park Cemetery\nA beautifully bound keepsake book filled with memories and condolences from family and friends.\nContribute your memory to the online guestbook to be featured in this unique keepsake book.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the\nGoogle Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nService map data \u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors"

                "body": "Even so, the buck remained on track for a weekly rise and trimmed earlier losses against the Japanese yen after U.S. data showed consumer sentiment improving in February, despite lingering concerns about jobs and rising costs of living.\nMeanwhile, the yen is headed for its worst week against the dollar since October, wiping out most of January's hefty gains as traders await Sunday's national election.\n\"What we are seeing is some correlation reversals,\" said Dan Tobon, head of G10 FX strategy, Citi in New York. \"Equities are up today, and so, as a result, you're seeing a bit of dollar decline as all the high beta currencies really come back.\" Global shares have seen their biggest weekly selloff since November, as investors fret about the massive spending on artificial intelligence as well as the cascading impact of fast-advancing AI tools that could upend various sectors. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the U.S. currency against six others, was down 0.34% after earlier hitting a two-week peak. It was still up 0.5% on the week, on pace for its largest weekly rise since early January.\nThe catalyst for this week's gain was President Donald Trump's nomination last Friday of Kevin Warsh, who is not seen as a big advocate of steep rate cuts, as the next Federal Reserve chair.\nFed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said on Friday that he is \" cautiously optimistic \" about 2026, expecting slightly above-trend growth, a steadying job market, and inflation continuing toward 2%, with current policy positioned to respond to both sides of the Fed's mandate.\nMeanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly sees the economy in a \" precarious \" spot. \"Maybe the Fed is seeing something that we're not. Maybe he (Jefferson) might be forced to change his tune in the next couple of months here,\" said Matt Weller, global head of market research at StoneX, in Michigan. \"If the NFP report confirms weakness in the labor market, I think that March could well be live for the Federal Reserve.\"\nTraders are eyeing the delayed release of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for January, expected next week. Various measures of labour market strength this week have suggested the world's largest economy is losing some momentum and traders are now pricing in a higher chance that interest rates will be cut within the first half of this year, rather than in the second.\nYEN SOFTENS AHEAD OF ELECTION\nThe yen slipped 0.04% to 157.1 per dollar ahead of Sunday's vote where a victory for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi could be on the cards.\nThe vote has investors on edge because fiscal worries have sparked a stomach-churning selloff in the currency and bond markets, and a further leg lower would likely reverberate globally.\nFor StoneX's Weller, the big question is whether the election will be seen as a mandate for aggressive fiscal spending.\n\"If it is indeed what we see, it's likely that we'll see continued gains in the Nikkei, continued weakness in the yen,\" said Weller.\n\"The relative weakness of the U.S. dollar over the past few weeks masks the even greater weakness that we are seeing in the yen. So, it seems like one of those trends that could accelerate into next week and beyond. And it will likely, at some point, in my view, force some direct action from authorities in terms of potentially intervening to buy some time.\" The euro rose 0.37% to $1.1822 after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged as expected on Thursday and played down the effect of currency fluctuations on its future decisions. Sterling recouped some of Thursday's near 1% slide and rose 0.65% to $1.3614 and was headed for its worst weekly drop against the greenback since October 27. The Bank of England also kept rates on hold on Thursday in an unexpectedly narrow vote and said borrowing costs are likely to fall if an expected drop soon in inflation is sustained.

                "body": "A Reuters diary maps out next week\u2019s Q3 and full-year results calendar, giving investors a clear checklist of when major Japanese companies report.\n1 day ago \u2022 1 min\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nJapan\u2019s busiest earnings week is about to kick off, with many Nikkei 225 heavyweights set to report over the next few days.\nWhat does this mean?\nWhen lots of big companies report at once, investors get a fast reality check on the stories driving Japan\u2019s market \u2013 how exporters are faring, whether domestic demand is improving, and which industries can handle higher costs. The slate includes tech and telecom (SoftBank Group and SoftBank Corp), autos and industrials (Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Kawasaki Heavy Industries), and health care and finance (Eisai, Terumo, ORIX, Tokio Marine). A separate batch of full-year results from names like Shiseido and Japan Tobacco can..\nalso reset expectations heading into the next fiscal year. In other words, it\u2019s less about any one headline and more about whether guidance lines up across sectors.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A sector-by-sector checkup for Japan\u2019s rally.\nWith so many index heavyweights reporting in a tight window, leadership can rotate quickly if guidance surprises. Watch the tone from globally exposed firms \u2013 especially automakers and factory-automation players \u2013 since their outlooks can sway broader sentiment toward Japanese equities and the yen.\nZooming out: Timing and guidance can move prices as much as profits.\nReuters flags whether results land before the open, during the day, or after the close, because that affects liquidity and how quickly markets reprice. A few quirks, like unclear time stamps for some releases and an off-cycle report from Mercari, are a reminder to focus on the sequence of updates \u2013 each one can nudge forecasts for an entire industry.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
