                "body": "(Kitco Commentary) - Gold extended its impressive rally today, with the precious metal surging to a fresh intraday record and achieving an unprecedented closing price. The current upward momentum has been driven by a confluence of factors: mounting concerns over a looming U.S. government shutdown, optimistic investor sentiment surrounding anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, and persistent weakness in the U.S. dollar.\nThe most actively traded December 2025 gold futures contract climbed $73.10 in today's session, settling at $3,862.90 per troy ounce\u2014breaking through the psychologically significant $3,800 threshold to establish a new all-time settlement record. Intraday trading pushed even higher, with gold briefly touching $3,863.70.\nGold's 2025 performance has been extraordinary, posting year-to-date gains exceeding 45%. This marks the strongest annual performance since 1979, when the precious metal soared amid inflation rates surpassing 10%.\nKey Drivers Behind the Rally\nMarket participants have increasingly sought refuge in gold's traditional safe-haven status as the threat of a U.S. government shutdown looms. Without passage of budget legislation to fund federal programs, government operations are set to cease on October 1, prompting investors to hedge against potential economic disruption.\nSignificant dollar weakness has provided substantial support for gold prices. The U.S. Dollar Index\u2014which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies (Euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Swedish krona) established by the Federal Reserve in 1973\u2014has declined sharply from its January 6 high of 109 to its current level of 97.956. This represents a depreciation of approximately 11%, making dollar-denominated gold more attractive to international buyers.\nAdditional bullish sentiment stems from market expectations of further interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve before year-end. Lower interest rates typically diminish the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold, enhancing the metal's appeal.\nOngoing geopolitical tensions continue to fuel global uncertainty, while central banks worldwide are believed to have maintained robust gold purchasing programs throughout the year, providing fundamental support for prices.\nFor those that would like more information about our services, click here\nWishing you as always good trading,"

Futures (YM=F, ES=F, NQ=F) are pointing to a positive start to the trading week on Wall Street too. Gold (GC=F) prices surged to a new record high as rate cut hopes grew, sending the dollar lower. The looming government shutdown also increased investor appetite for the safe haven asset. Meanwhile, oil (CL=F, BZ=F) prices fell as traders expect another production hike announcement from OPEC+. For more live coverage of markets watch the full episode of Market Sunrise and head to Yahoo Finance.\nWell, the first thing you need to know is that markets look set to open higher this morning.\nWhy? Well, on Friday, we learned that core inflation was little changed in August. That's according to the PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.\nNow, the monthly number came in at 0.3% and the annual headline number 2.7%.\nThat means that the central bank is on pace for interest rate reductions ahead.\nThe next thing you need to know is that gold has hit another record high this morning. In fact, prices surged past $3,800 an ounce.\nThey were driven by rising bets on Fed rate cuts that are weakening the dollar, but also concerns over that possible government shutdown, making the safe haven asset even more attractive.\nNow gold, which benefits from lower interest rates and thrives during geopolitical and economic uncertainty, has gained more than 40% year to date.\nAnd the final thing to know is that all prices, well, they're declining. Why? Well, it's expected that OPEC Plus will likely hike oil production again in November.\nRecent price rises seem to have encouraged the cartel to try to regain market share. OPEC Plus, which includes Russia and pumps around half the world's oil has reversed its strategy of output cuts from April amid growing pressure from President Trump to lower all oil prices.\nNow OPEC Plus will actually meet on October the 5th."

Africa alone is projected to add 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in incremental oil demand, while contributing around 3 million bpd to long-term global refining capacity.\n\u201cThere are no signs of global oil demand peaking anytime soon in our outlook, and we need more investments and realistic future energy pathways,\u201d he stated. \u201cAfrica will need more energy for economic development \u2013 not just electricity, but also to expand clean cooking access and improve health and education outcomes. LPG is one of the solutions.\u201d\nAccording to OPEC, oil will retain the largest share of the global energy mix through 2050, while natural gas overtakes coal as the second-largest source. Developing countries are expected to account for 75% of incremental electricity demand, underscoring the need for targeted investment in Africa\u2019s power and downstream sectors.\nDr. Benyoucef stressed that $18.2 trillion in cumulative investments will be needed globally over the period, including $14.9 trillion for upstream oil and gas projects. \u201cWe need all energy sources, but we also need emissions reductions,\u201d he said, calling for the scale-up of technologies like carbon capture, utilization and storage.\nDr. Sulaiman Saad, Senior Oil Demand Analyst at OPEC, outlined the macroeconomic context underpinning the outlook. \u201cThe global economy is becoming more resilient \u2013 China, the U.S. and India are pushing this momentum of growth,\u201d he said. He warned, however, of challenges including rising sovereign debt, supply chain fragmentation and uneven industrial recovery.\nOn the downstream front, OPEC sees refining growth shifting toward developing economies. \u201cThe largest share of refining additions are to take place in the developing regions,\u201d said Mohammed Attaba, Senior Downstream Oil Industry Analyst at OPEC. \u201cThe migration of refining capacities will continue from developed to developing countries \u2013 we have been observing this trend for several years now.\u201d"

He will meet President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for lower fuel prices while he seeks to tame inflation and reduce interest rates.\nNo final decision has been made yet, and deliberations could still evolve ahead of Sunday\u2019s meeting, the people said.

August and September led to recovery but at this point with a little under two days until quarter-end, it\u2019s been a red quarter for the pair.\n- Last year\u2019s Q3 saw strength in EUR/USD as markets warmed up for FOMC rate cuts but even as the Fed cut rates in Q4, EUR/USD sold off hard, plummeting towards a parity handle that never ended up printing in early-2025 trade.\n- I\u2019ll be looking into EUR/USD in the weekly webinar, and you\u2019re welcome to join the next. Click here to register.\nEUR/USD set a fresh four-year high right as the Fed announced their September rate cut \u2013 and then started to sell-off. It\u2019s been a bearish sequence on the daily and four-hour chart since then and this highlights the fact that FOMC rate cuts aren\u2019t necessarily a direct push into a weaker USD and, in turn, a stronger EUR/USD.\nNonetheless, it is too early to count EUR/USD bulls out just yet and as I said in the video, I think ECB stance and Euro data will be a big determinant as to whether both trends can take-over in Q4.\nFrom the monthly chart, it\u2019s been a red quarter for EUR/USD so far following a strong first-half of the year. The pair has tried to leave behind a big spot on the chart around the 1.1748 level but bulls haven\u2019t completely given up yet. This is the expanse between the 76.4 and 78.6% Fibonacci retracements of the 2021-2022 major move. This is a big analytical item as I had highlighted this back in February in the Fibonacci article. This series saw the 61.8% retracement catch the high in 2023, the 38.2 and 50% retracements define the range that traded for a good portion of 2024, and more recently, the 23.6% retracement is what ultimately helped to catch the low earlier this year, before the reversal took over in March.\nNow, it\u2019s the 76.4 and 78.6 expanse that has been holding bulls at bay.\nEUR/USD Monthly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Weekly\nThe weekly chart highlights just how choppy this quarter has been. It started off with a notable pullback in July, alongside a USD that put in its strongest month in more than three years. This was driven by both strong inflation and the July FOMC meeting, when Powell said that policy didn\u2019t seem overly restrictive given that rising inflation and a labor market that remained near full employment.\nBut then less than two days later the NFP report sent shockwaves across markets when the prior two months saw massive revisions on the headline number, even with the unemployment rate coming in right at the expected 4.2%, which Powell had said less than two days earlier was \u2018near full employment.\u2019\nThat elicited a strong pullback in USD and bounce in EUR/USD as the pair jumped from the 1.1400 level, and while bulls did continue to push after that, they continued to show passiveness near resistance or highs, even though they did jump in to support pullbacks at higher lows.\nThat ran all the way until the Fed\u2019s rate cut two weeks ago which produced a wide upper wick, and that\u2019s what led in to a bearish sequence on the daily chart.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Daily\nThe daily chart is where the bearish sequence has shown so far following the reversal bar that printed at the FOMC meeting two weeks ago. There\u2019s still considerable interplay with the Fibonacci retracement looked at in the first image, as the initial pullback pushed down to 1.1748, which led to a bounce in early trade last week. But sellers came back on Wednesday and Thursday to force a fresh lower-low, and the bounce from that has since held a lower-high right at the same 1.1748 level.\nAs shown in the video, it\u2019s the prior lower-high from last week, at 1.1820 which spans up to 1.1830, that bulls need to take-out to wrestle back control. A hold at 1.1748 would be ideal for sellers as "

Markets bet on October and December rate cuts despite sticky PCE inflation at 2.7% headline and 2.9% core | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Price Forecast - EURO to Dollar Advances to 1.1725 as DXY Eases to 97.95, Markets Price Fed Cuts Amid Shutdown Fears\nEUR/USD Gains Ground as Dollar Weakens Under Shutdown Pressure\nThe EUR/USD pair traded near 1.1725 in the European session, marking its second straight advance as the U.S. Dollar Index stalled around 97.95. The move came as markets priced in heightened risk of a U.S. government shutdown, with funding set to expire midweek. Historical context is weighing on sentiment: the Congressional Budget Office estimated the 2018\u20132019 shutdown erased $11 billion from GDP, and traders see similar fallout if gridlock continues. Dollar weakness has provided the euro with breathing room, with buyers stepping back in after the pair briefly tested 1.1645 support last week.\nSticky Inflation Keeps Fed on the Hook for Policy Easing\nAugust\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data underscored how persistent inflation remains. Headline PCE rose 2.7% year-over-year, up from 2.6% in July, while core PCE stayed elevated at 2.9%. On a monthly basis, headline gained 0.3% and core 0.2%. These figures remain above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, yet markets are firmly betting on more accommodation. Futures markets now assign a 90% chance of a cut in October and nearly 65% odds of a second in December, pushing Treasury yields lower and weakening the dollar\u2019s appeal. That dovish tilt is acting as a tailwind for the euro despite lingering concerns about Europe\u2019s growth outlook.\nECB Caution Provides a Base for the Euro\nThe European Central Bank has opted to hold rates steady for two consecutive meetings, signaling that its easing cycle may be nearing an end. Eurozone data remain mixed\u2014services PMI shows resilience while manufacturing continues to contract. Still, the ECB\u2019s restraint has helped anchor the euro, with investors concluding that Frankfurt is unlikely to unleash fresh stimulus just as the Fed is preparing to ease further. This divergence has offered the EUR/USD pair a relative advantage, allowing it to stabilize despite structural challenges in the bloc\u2019s industrial sector.\nTechnical Crossroads at $1.1740\nFrom a charting perspective, EUR/USD is hovering just under heavy resistance at $1.1740, with the 50-SMA at $1.1734 and the 100-SMA at $1.1737 forming a confluence zone. The pair has already rebounded from the $1.1650 area, with price action showing a bullish \u201cthree white soldiers\u201d pattern, a traditional signal of strong momentum. However, repeated upper wicks in recent candles reflect selling interest at higher levels. If buyers clear $1.1740 decisively, the path opens toward $1.1780 and potentially $1.1820. Failure at this zone risks a retreat back to $1.1690, and deeper losses could revisit $1.1650.\nInvestor Positioning and Market Psychology\nSentiment indicators confirm a market at a tipping point. The RSI sits near 57, suggesting further upside room without being overbought, but the balance remains delicate. Traders are cautious heading into Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls release, especially since a government shutdown could delay or disrupt economic data. The labor report is pivotal: stronger-than-expected hiring would weaken the case for imminent cuts and bolster the dollar, while a soft report would confirm dovish expectations and send EUR/USD higher.\nRead More\n-\nQQQ ETF Holds $486 as Nasdaq-100 Rallies to 22,631 \u2014 Tech Mega-Caps Power 38% Yearly Gains\n29.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs on Nasdaq Rally \u2014 XRPR at $24.33, XRPI $17.55 as SEC Reforms Fuel Inflows\n29.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast (NG=F) Drops to $2.88 as Oversupply, R"

The reversal followed the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy move, which triggered a short-lived rally before sellers reasserted control. Traders are also factoring in a looming 70% probability of a U.S. government shutdown, which has dented risk appetite and created added volatility for the pair. While the Dollar Index (DXY) eased to 97.95, Sterling failed to sustain upside traction, highlighting the fragility of the recent rebound.\nSterling\u2019s Technical Landscape: Support and Resistance Levels\nGBP/USD is holding just above the critical 1.3267\u20131.3280 support, which represents the 78.6% retracement of the August advance and aligns with the August low-week close. A break below this region would expose 1.3140\u20131.3144, an area overlapping with the 38.2% retracement of the yearly range, the May 2023 low, and the 52-week moving average. Should bearish pressure persist, the next key floor rests near 1.3056\u20131.3080, defined by the 100% extension of the June decline. On the topside, resistance is seen first at 1.3434\u20131.3469, while a more decisive barrier remains near 1.3648\u20131.3650. A sustained breakout above that range would revive bullish momentum toward 1.3749 and potentially the 1.40 handle.\nFed Dovishness vs. BoE Restraint Defines the Macro Picture\nThe divergence between U.S. and UK monetary policy is sharpening. The CME FedWatch tool signals 88% odds of another rate cut in October and a 65% probability of a further cut in December, despite inflation data showing headline PCE at 2.7% and core PCE steady at 2.9%. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is expected to keep its policy rate at 4.0%, with Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden stressing the need to maintain a restrictive stance until inflation returns to target. This divergence offers medium-term support for Sterling but keeps near-term momentum tilted toward the dollar, particularly with shutdown fears driving safe-haven flows.\nRead More\n-\nQQQ ETF Holds $486 as Nasdaq-100 Rallies to 22,631 \u2014 Tech Mega-Caps Power 38% Yearly Gains\n29.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs on Nasdaq Rally \u2014 XRPR at $24.33, XRPI $17.55 as SEC Reforms Fuel Inflows\n29.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast (NG=F) Drops to $2.88 as Oversupply, Record U.S. Storage, and EU Sanctions Pressure Prices\n29.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nEUR/USD Price Forecast - EURO to Dollar Holds 1.1725 as Dollar Index Drops to 97.95, Fed Cuts Loom, Shutdown Risk Surges\n29.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nEconomic Data Risks Could Steer GBP/USD\nSterling\u2019s path will be shaped by incoming U.S. releases.

Realistically, unless you\u2019re trading AUD against the crosses, it\u2019s the USD side of the ledger that is dictating directional shifts, putting headlines relating to a potential U.S. government shutdown and the first batch of U.S. labour market data front-and-centre for those trading AUD/USD.\nRBA: More Bark than Bite\nLet\u2019s discuss the elephant in the room immediately so we can move to focusing on event risk that could truly impact the AUD/USD on Tuesday: the RBA interest rate decision looms as a likely nothingburger. As seen in the Bloomberg graphic below showing implied probabilities of rate movements based on swaps markets, almost zero risk is seen of the cash rate shifting from 3.6%.\nSource: Bloomberg\nWhere there will be some interest in what the bank communicates in regard to the rates outlook, with pricing for a 25-point cut in November essentially an even money bet. But this meeting has no updated forecast\u2014they\u2019ll arrive in six weeks\u2019 time. Nor does the RBA have access to the ABS quarterly trimmed mean inflation measure, the key piece of information it uses to assess policy settings on the inflation side of its dual mandate\u2014that arrives late next month. And recent economic data has printed stronger than what both markets collectively and RBA were forecasting, including household consumption which is by far the largest and most important part of the Australian economy. That\u2019s seen a hawkish repricing take place across the Australian swaps curve since the board last met and increases the risk that it will upgrade its assessment of the domestic economy. But that too is widely expected.\nAugust Statement Cheat Sheet\nRegardless, the paragraphs below outline what the RBA said relating to inflation, the domestic economy and labour market when it last met in mid-August, providing traders with a reference point when looking for any changes in the September statement.\nOn inflation, the Bank said it had \u201ccontinued to moderate\u201d and had \u201cfallen substantially since the peak in 2022,\u201d with trimmed mean outcomes \u201cbroadly as expected.\u201d It projected inflation would \u201ccontinue to moderate to around the midpoint of the 2\u20133 per cent range,\u201d while cautioning about \u201cuncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing and how firms\u2019 pricing decisions and wages will respond.\u201d\nFor the domestic economy, it judged that \u201cprivate demand appears to have been recovering gradually,\u201d with \u201creal household incomes have picked up\u201d and \u201csome measures of financial conditions have eased.\u201d Even so, it flagged \u201cuncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation,\u201d warning that \u201cconsumption growth is a little slower than expected,\u201d though households might also \u201cconsume more and save less than expected.\u201d Businesses in some areas reported \u201cweakness in demand is making it difficult to pass on cost increases.\u201d\nOn the labour market, it said conditions \u201cremain a little tight, although have eased further in recent months.\u201d The \u201cunemployment rate rose\u2026in line with the May forecasts,\u201d while \u201clabour underutilisation nevertheless remain at low rates.\u201d It added that \u201cavailability of labour is still a constraint,\u201d while \u201cwages growth has eased from its peak,\u201d \u201cproductivity growth has not picked up\u201d and \u201cunit labour costs remains high.\u201d\nUnless the RBA makes meaningfully hawkish or dovish changes to those prior views, which seems extremely unlikely, it leaves little room for the type of surprise t"

The US Dollar\u2019s weakness stems from investor caution over the looming US government funding deadline, with market participants weighing the risk of a potential shutdown if no agreement is reached by October 1.\nPolitical leaders are set to meet at the White House on Monday for last-minute negotiations, after US President Donald Trump called the meeting to strike a deal and avert a lapse in government funding.\nAt the time of writing, AUD/USD is trading near 0.6580 during the American session, up almost 0.50% on the day. Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, is struggling just below the 98.00 psychological mark.\nThe spotlight now shifts to the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) interest rate decision on Tuesday at 04:30 GMT, where the central bank is widely expected to hold its cash rate steady at 3.60%. The RBA has eased policy by 75 basis points so far this year. Investors will focus on the tone of the accompanying monetary policy statement for guidance on the policy path into the final quarter of the year.\nRecent domestic data paint a mixed picture. Australia\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 0.6% QoQ in Q2, beating expectations of 0.5% and accelerating from 0.3% in Q1, while annual growth rose to 1.8% from 1.4%. At the same time, the ABS Monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 3.0% YoY in August from 2.8% in July, and the underlying measure excluding volatile items climbed to 3.4% YoY, indicating some stickiness in near-term price pressure even as the quarterly trimmed-mean gauge eased to 2.7% in Q2 from 2.9% in Q1.\nLabour-market indicators show signs of cooling. Total Employment unexpectedly fell by 5.4K in August, against forecasts for a 22K increase, with a sharp 40.9K drop in Full-time jobs, while the Unemployment Rate held steady at 4.2%. The combination of resilient growth, sticky inflation, and a cooling labour market reinforces the RBA\u2019s case for holding policy steady for now.\nA recent Reuters poll of 39 economists showed all respondents expect the RBA to keep the cash rate steady on Tuesday. Looking ahead, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, and Westpac all expect the next rate cut in November, while NAB has ruled out further cuts this year and now projects the next move in May 2026.\nEconomic Indicator\nRBA Interest Rate Decision\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the RBA is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is usually bullish for the Australian Dollar (AUD). Likewise, if the RBA has a dovish view on the Australian economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is seen as bearish for AUD.\nRead more.Next release: Tue Sep 30, 2025 04:30\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 3.6%\nPrevious: 3.6%\nSource: Reserve Bank of Australia\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The initial market reaction to a divided Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) Summary of Opinions and the disappointing macro data from Japan turns out to be short-lived amid bets that the Japanese central bank will stick to its policy normalization path. Apart from this, rising geopolitical tensions, looming US government shutdown, and trade-related uncertainties lend some support to the safe-haven JPY.\nMeanwhile, hawkish BoJ expectations mark a significant divergence in comparison to the growing acceptance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs twice by the end of this year. The latter fails to assist the USD in attracting any meaningful buyers and turns out to be another factor benefiting the lower-yielding JPY. That said, a generally positive risk tone might hold back the JPY bulls from placing aggressive bets and act as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for the JPY remains to the upside.\nJapanese Yen is pressured by BoJ rate hike uncertainty and weaker domestic data\n- The Bank of Japan's Summary of Opinions from the September meeting, released earlier this Tuesday, showed increasing pressure from hawks to normalise policy. That said, dovish policymakers highlighted uncertainty over inflation dynamics and global grade uncertainties.\n- On the economic data front, Retail Sales in Japan fell 1.1% year-on-year in August, marking their first decline since Feb 2022 and the biggest fall since August 2021. Moreover, the reading was well below market expectations of a 1% rise and a 0.4% rise recorded in the previous month.\n- A separate government report showed that Japan's Industrial Production declined for the second consecutive month, by 1.2% in August compared to consensus estimates for a 0.7% contraction. The data suggested that businesses remained cautious amid persistent concerns about US tariffs.\n- In the latest trade-related developments, the White House announced early Tuesday that US President Donald Trump signed a proclamation adjusting imports of timber, lumber, and derivative products into the US. Meanwhile, imports from the European Union and Japan were capped at 15%.\n- Adding to this, domestic political uncertainty continues to fuel speculations that the BoJ will delay raising interest rates further, which fails to assist the Japanese Yen to build on a two-day-old move up against the US Dollar. Any meaningful depreciating move for the JPY, however, seems elusive.\n- Traders are still pricing in the possibility of a 25-basis-point rate hike by the BoJ in October. In contrast, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates twice by the year-end. The latter should cap the USD amid the looming US government shutdown and offer support to the lower-yielding JPY.\nUSD/JPY bulls have the upper hand while above the 200-day SMA near 148.40\nThe USD/JPY pair finds some support and defends a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Adding to this, oscillators on the daily chart \u2013 though they have been losing traction \u2013 are holding in positive territory. This, in turn, favors bullish traders and backs the case for additional gains. Any further move up, however, is likely to confront a hurdle near the 149.00 mark. A sustained strength beyond will reaffirm the positive outlook and allow spot prices to make a fresh attempt to conquer the 150.00 psychological mark with some intermediate resistance near the 149.40-149.45 region.\nOn the flip side, weakness below the 200-day SMA"

The BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions revealed that board members discussed a near-term rate hike, weighing on sentiment.\nNotably, the number of policymakers tilting toward a near-term rate hike was higher than the two board members who dissented from the September decision to maintain interest rates at 0.5%.\nAlthough four board members leaned hawkish, a majority remained cautious. One policymaker, notably, warned of market disruption, stating:\n\u201cA policy interest rate hike at this point, which would come as a surprise to the market, should be avoided.\u201d\nNevertheless, the more hawkish tone dented sentiment, with the Nikkei slipping in tandem with US futures\u2014a reminder that BoJ rhetoric quickly ripples through global markets.\nThe reference to surprising the markets was telling. In July 2024, the BoJ reduced its purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and unexpectedly raised interest rates, triggering a yen Carry Trade unwind.\nUSD/JPY plunged from 153.889 on July 31, 2024, to 139.576 on September 16, 2024. The USD/JPY pair\u2019s slump triggered margin calls, forcing traders to exit risk assets to repay Japanese yen-denominated debt. The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 11.2% from July 31, 2024, to August 5, 2024.\nThe potential threat of a repeat market event could weigh on risk appetite. Traders should closely monitor USD/JPY and Nikkei 225 trends to assess the risk of another yen carry trade unwind.\nWhile the Bank of Japan\u2019s monetary policy stance remains a focal point, Chinese economic data also influenced demand for risk assets.\nThe RatingDog Manufacturing PMI increased to 51.2 in September, up from 50.5 in August. A pickup in new orders lifted production. However, rising input price inflation and falling average selling prices signaled renewed margin pressures, leading to further job cuts. Rising unemployment may further weaken consumer spending, challenging Beijing\u2019s 5% GDP growth target.\nWeakness in the Hang Seng underlined investor nerves. Combined with BoJ jitters, China\u2019s renewed margin pressures dragged on US futures.\nUS stock futures posted modest losses in morning trading on Tuesday, September 30. The Dow Jones E-mini fell 20 points, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini dropped 13 points, and the S&P 500 E-mini declined 3 points.\nAttention now shifts to US labor data. A sharper drop in JOLTs openings could feed bets on an October cut, while a stronger print may stall the rally.\nEconomists forecast JOLTs job openings to drop from 7.181 million in July to 7.1 million in August.\nA sharper drop in job openings would indicate weaker demand for labor, supporting a more dovish Fed rate path. A weakening labor market may soften wage growth and curb consumer spending, cooling inflation. Rising bets on October and December Fed rate cuts could lift sentiment. However, a higher reading could weigh on US stock futures ahead of Friday\u2019s US Jobs Report.\nDespite the morning losses, US stock futures trade above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), reaffirming a short-term bullish bias.\nHowever, the near-term outlook hinges on tariff headlines, the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy outlook, FOMC members\u2019 commentary, and US labor market data. Key levels traders are monitoring include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nMarkets enter Q4 at a crossroads\u2014whether Fed cuts or a yen shock defines sentiment may hinge on this week\u2019s data.\nTraders should consider BoJ rhetoric and USD/JPY trends. Hawkish BoJ chatter and dovish Fed cues could raise the risk of a yen carry trade unwind, impacting risk sentiment. Meanwhile, trade developments and US labor market data will also affect risk assets.\nProgress toward a US-China trade deal and dovish Fed signals could lift sentiment. However, rising US recession risks and increasing trade friction could test buyer demand for US stock futures early in the final quarter.\nFollow our live coverage and consult our economic calendar.\nWith ove"

Trump also unveiled tariffs of 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities and 25% on trucks.\nStatistics Canada revised July GDP growth up to 0.2% and reported flat activity in August, easing fears of an economic downturn and shifting market attention back to growth indicators.\nThe commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) faced challenges as the crude Oil prices fell more than 3% in the previous session after Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region restarted Oil exports after a 2.5-year suspension, boosting supplies in an already oversupplied market. According to the new deal, Baghdad, the Kurdistan Regional Government, and international oil companies, initial flows of 180,000\u2013190,000 barrels per day will be shipped to Turkey\u2019s Ceyhan port.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can h"

The pair falls sharply as weakness in the US Dollar (USD) due to mounting United States (US) government shutdown risks has increased the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese Yen (JPY).\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today. Japanese Yen was the strongest against the Euro.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Japanese Yen from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent JPY (base)/USD (quote).\nThis week, the major trigger for the Japanese Yen will be the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Summary of Opinions (SOP), which will be published on Tuesday.\nIn the policy meeting this month, the BoJ held interest rates steady at 0.5%, as expected, and kept the door open for more interest rate hikes in the near term.\nOn the political front, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is scheduled to elect a new leader to replace outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on October 4.\nIn the United Kingdom (UK), traders remain increasingly confident that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates in the November policy meeting as price pressures are proving to be persistent. Last week, BoE Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Megan Greene warned of inflation risks and expressed confidence that the economy will rebound.\nOn the contrary, BoE MPC member Swati Dhingra wrote in a column published by The Times on Friday that inflation risks will fade and there is need for quick interest rate cuts to support deteriorating labor market conditions.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release "

Will this rule eventually bleed over to bitcoin-only wallets?\nBased on my interaction with the chairman, I got the impression that he doesn\u2019t currently have the answers to these questions. That is, he wasn\u2019t being evasive as much as he genuinely didn\u2019t seem to know exactly what the broader picture around tokenized securities looks like right now, as he\u2019s waiting for Congress to act.\nMuch regarding crypto market regulation hangs in the balance as the Senate discusses and revises the CLARITY Act (CLARITY), the digital asset market structure bill. The chairman stated that he\u2019s paying attention to CLARITY as it works its way through the legislative process.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the market structure act that cleared the House and is now [being discussed] in the Senate,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine will follow up with Chairman Atkins on this issue when and if CLARITY passes.\nIn the meantime, if you want to protect your right to use you bitcoin wallet privately and permissionlessly, be sure to contact your elected officials as part of the Satoshi Needs You campaign."

                "body": "- Michael Willson\n- September 29, 2025\nBitcoin halving is one of the most important events in the crypto world. It reduces the number of new bitcoins entering circulation and shapes how miners, investors, and institutions behave. The last halving happened on April 20, 2024, when the reward dropped from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. The next halving is expected in 2028, cutting rewards again to 1.5625 BTC. If you\u2019re interested in how such milestones connect with modern investing strategies, the AI powered investing certification helps explain how events like halving influence market cycles and long-term planning.\nWhat Is Bitcoin Halving\nBitcoin halving occurs every 210,000 blocks, which is about every four years. It reduces the block reward that miners receive for validating transactions. This design ensures that Bitcoin supply grows at a predictable pace and gradually slows over time. The maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins, and halving events are the mechanism that gets us there.\nWhy Halving Matters\nHalving events make Bitcoin scarcer by cutting the pace of new supply. If demand stays steady or increases, this can create upward pressure on price. In the past, halvings have often been followed by long bull runs, though the timing and intensity vary.\nBut halving doesn\u2019t just affect investors. Miners also feel the impact. Since rewards are cut, their profitability depends heavily on Bitcoin\u2019s price and their ability to run efficient operations.\nLooking Ahead to the Next Cycle\nSupply and Demand\nBy 2028, the reward will be just 1.5625 BTC. The supply side effect will still matter, but less than in earlier cycles because the total circulating supply is much larger now. That means macroeconomic factors and demand from institutions may play an even bigger role than before.\nInstitutional Adoption\nThe rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing interest from traditional finance could shape the market more than the halving itself. Some analysts believe the next bull cycle may stretch into 2026 or 2027, instead of peaking right after halving as earlier patterns suggested.\nMiner Economics\nMining will become harder for smaller players. With lower rewards, miners with high energy costs may shut down. Larger, more efficient mining operations, often using renewable or surplus energy, are more likely to survive. This could lead to industry consolidation.\nNetwork Security\nAs rewards decline, transaction fees and layer-2 solutions will become more important to sustain miner incentives. If fees don\u2019t grow fast enough, there could be short-term dips in hash rate, though historically the network has recovered.\nRisks and Challenges\nBitcoin halving does not guarantee price increases. Its impact may be weaker in the future as the reduction in new supply becomes a smaller fraction of total supply. Market behavior could be influenced more by regulation, monetary policy, and global economic shifts.\nMiner capitulation is another risk. If rewards drop sharply without matching price growth, weaker miners may be forced out. While this has happened before, it usually results in a stronger, more efficient mining sector.\nFor those who want to understand the data behind cycles and risk, a Data Science Certification can provide the analytical skills needed to evaluate trends and market signals.\nThe Bigger Picture\nBitcoin halving highlights the connection between scarcity and value. For long-term investors, it is a reminder of Bitcoin\u2019s design as a deflationary asset. For businesses and marketers exploring how such events shape user behavior and market adoption, the Marketing and Business Certification provides the tools to connect technological milestones with strategy. And for those eager to understand blockchain at its core, blockchain technology courses are a strong starting point.\nIf you want to trade cycles or position yourself around major events like halvings, practical skills from the Crypto certification can give you the structure to do so more con"

While ETH remains the pillar of the crypto market, shrewd traders are looking at alternatives to save and build up their portfolios. One top choice is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fast-rising DeFi altcoin that costs only $0.035. The project is still in presale phase 6 which is over 50% sold out.\nIt has already raised over $16.52 million in presale, with over 16,640 holders. With its dual lending system, staking rewards that can be adjusted, and real-world utility of decentralized borrowing and lending, Mutuum Finance offers both stability and the opportunity for high growth, which makes it a strategic holding asset for diversification and consolidation of crypto assets during turbulent times.\nEthereum (ETH) fell below $4,060, with fear of the bulls being able to maintain the crucial $4,000 support. A bear cross is bright warning lights, the analysts eyeing $3,750 as the next important support, and a potential fall to $3,350 should that be broken. But with the asset appearing oversold, a strong bounce can be in the cards if buying momentum is re-established. While investors weigh the pro and con of the next ETH move, others are also starting to explore newer possibilities in decentralized finance that can add to their strategies, with one such newer project, Mutuum Finance, gaining increasing interest.\nMUTM tokens are currently valued at $0.035 in presale phase 6, a 16.17% raise from the previous round. Interest among investors remains remarkably robust with more than 16,640 investors pumping in more than $16.52 million of invested capital thus far.\nTo enhance the security of the platform even more, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program where they invite white-hat researchers and developers to identify bugs. These will be categorized into four levels of severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, for sensitive identification and immediate patching of possible vulnerabilities.\nMutuum protocol is founded on good collateral management as a measure to protect the users and the ecosystem. Some of the most important safety features include infinite collateral ratios, loan limits, and deposit limits. Undercollateralized positions are quickly closed, and penalties and remediation fees stabilize the platform and minimize systemic risk.\nThe most important concept at Mutuum Finance is efficiency. Through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and, in particular, overcollateralized positions, the protocol makes the most out of capital while providing great protection. Reserve requirements act as a market shock absorber, and excess reserves can be invested profitably in riskier assets to hedge volatility.\nMutuum Finance seeks to redefine DeFi in three dimensions: long-term viability, trustworthiness, and usability. Through a scalable and secure borrowing and lending platform, the platform is democratizing decentralized finance for retail and institutional customers.\nAs an appreciation for its growing community, the team has also started a $100,000 giveaway where 10 winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The action is one of the means of showing that Mutuum values rewarding the project\u2019s first adopters and raising awareness about the cause.\nEthereum\u2019s inability to hold above the $4,000 level is an indication of the angst which has the broader crypto universe in its thrall but also the rising trend towards diversification into high-growth DeFi plays. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast emerging as one of the most promising alternatives, with strong security, good collateral management, and real-world practical utility to provide impressive growth potential. At over $16.52 million raised, with over 16,640 investors participating, and tokens yet available for purchase at a cheap rate of $0.035, momentum is clearly building. The moment to in"

                "body": "Dubai, UAE, September 29th, 2025, FinanceWire\nMutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi project built on Ethereum, has hit a notable milestone in its presale journey. Phase 6 is now halfway complete, with more than 50% of the tokens allocated at this stage already taken up by investors. Despite the uncertainty hanging over the broader crypto market, the steady progress highlights the project and its vision to bring new options for decentralized lending and borrowing.\nThe Future of Lending and Borrowing in Crypto\nAt the heart of Mutuum Finance is a dual-market system that gives users two different ways to lend and borrow. The first is the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, where people can deposit assets into shared liquidity pools and earn interest in return. For example, someone who supplies BNB would receive mtBNB, a token issued one-to-one with their deposit that grows in value as interest builds.\nAlongside this, Mutuum also offers a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace, where borrowers and lenders can connect directly and set custom terms. A borrower could, for instance, post BTC as collateral and borrow USDT, allowing them to unlock liquidity while still holding onto their BTC in case its price rises. This flexibility makes it easier for borrowers to access funds and gives lenders multiple ways to generate yield.\nPresale Progression and Investor Interest\nMutuum Finance\u2019s presale has been structured to reward early participation. The token began at $0.01 in Phase 1 and has already risen to $0.035 in the current Phase 6, a 250% increase. With the launch price set at $0.06, buyers entering today could still see close to a 2x gain by the time of listing.\nSo far, over $16.6 million has been raised, more than 730 million tokens have been sold, and the project has onboarded more than 16,650 holders. The approaching Phase 7 will potentially lift the price to $0.04, nearly 20% higher than current levels, continuing the step-based structure that has underpinned the project\u2019s momentum.\nTo drive engagement beyond the presale, Mutuum Finance has launched several community-focused initiatives. A dashboard allows investors to monitor their token holdings and calculate potential ROI, while a Top 50 leaderboard rewards the largest contributors with additional MUTM tokens at launch.\nIn addition, a $100,000 giveaway remains active, giving all investors a chance to win one of ten $10,000 prizes in MUTM tokens. These initiatives add further incentives for participation while strengthening the project\u2019s early community base.\nUpcoming Updates and Security Measures\nThe team behind Mutuum Finance recently hinted at an update on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting new roadmap details and development milestones will be shared soon. According to the roadmap, the platform is set to launch simultaneously with the token\u2019s exchange listing, a move that could improve liquidity and visibility from day one.\nSecurity has also been a priority. Mutuum Finance successfully completed a CertiK audit, achieving a Token Scan score of 90/100, placing it among the better-rated DeFi projects reviewed by the firm. A $50,000 bug bounty program further encourages developers to test the code and strengthen the system before launch.\nWith Phase 6 now half completed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is closing in on its next price increase. From its $0.01 starting point to today\u2019s $0.035, the token\u2019s presale has already shown strong appreciation. As Phase 7 approaches with a nearly 20% price rise on the horizon, the combination of fundraising success, audited security, and a clear roadmap continues to drive the project.\nAbout Mutuum Finance (MUTM)\nMutuum Finance is a DeFi project focused on creating flexible markets for lending and borrowing. The platform uses pooled markets and a peer-to-peer layer, giving users multiple ways to earn yield or access liquidity. Its native token, MUTM, is in an ongoing presale that has already raised over $16.6 million, with Phase 6 now 50% complete at $0.035.\nFor more informat"

Sky is centered around issuing the USDS (USDS) and\nSpark, the first of Sky's stars, has grown to more than $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum while allocating funds to over $1 billion in tokenized assets. Grove, the second unit launched earlier this year, is focused on collateralized loan obligations.\nKeel's mandate is acting as an on-chain capital allocator that sits between Solana DeFi protocols and the broader stablecoin economy. It receives a dedicated balance sheet from the USDS stablecoin reserves to deploy and support Solana-native protocols to generate yield. Early integrations include Kamino, Jupiter and Raydium, Solana-hosted marketplaces where liquidity can serve as a foundation for lending markets, routing and liquidity pools.\n\"Keel was founded on the belief that the next phase of on-chain finance growth needs more than new assets alone; it needs liquidity that can be accessed at speed and scale,\" said Cian Breathnach, CEO of Matariki Labs and a contributor to Keel. \"Keel is the first to provide these enablers on Solana, delivering the capital and catalyzing force for the next stage of growth in on-chain lending, borrowing, tokenization and more.\"\nKeel's plan could also help attract more tokenized real-world assets (RWA) to the Solana space, a fast-growing sector that aims to use blockchain rails to move and settle traditional financial assets like bonds, commodities and stocks.\nLily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, called Keel \"a key step\" in positioning the blockchain as a leading marketplace for internet-scale capital markets. Rune Christensen, co-founder of Sky, added that Keel is set to become the largest capital allocator on Solana and will play a key role in shaping the DeFi and RWA landscape.\nRead more: Blockchain-Based RWA Specialists Bring $50M to Apollo's Tokenized Credit Strategy\nMore For You\nCrypto Compliance Firm Notabene Introduces Platform for Stablecoin Payments\nNotabene Flow introduces pull payments and recurring subscriptions for cross-border stablecoin transactions.\nWhat to know:\n- The platform builds on Notabene\u2019s network of 2,000+ regulated entities processing $1.5 trillion annually.\n- Notabene Flow introduces pull payments, recurring billing and standardized coordination between verified participants.\n- Founding partners include Zodia Custody, Bitso, Gnosis and Borderless."

                "body": "Humidifi on Solana: How This DEX is Redefining DeFi with Dark Pools\nIntroduction to Humidifi, Solana, and the Rise of Dark Pools\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Solana is undergoing a transformative evolution, with HumidiFi emerging as a pivotal player. As a dark pool decentralized exchange (DEX), HumidiFi is redefining trading by leveraging Solana's high-performance blockchain. With record-breaking trading volumes and innovative features, HumidiFi is challenging traditional automated market makers (AMMs) and reshaping the Solana DEX landscape. This article delves into HumidiFi's impact, the advantages of dark pools, and the broader implications for the DeFi ecosystem.\nHumidifi's Record-Breaking Growth and Market Momentum\nHumidiFi has rapidly established itself as a dominant force in the Solana DeFi ecosystem. The platform recently achieved a remarkable $8.55 billion in weekly trading volume, surpassing established DEXs like Meteora and Raydium. Additionally, it set a daily trading volume record of $1.91 billion, underscoring its rapid growth and increasing market momentum.\nThis explosive growth highlights the platform's innovative approach and the rising demand for privacy-focused trading solutions. By catering to high-volume traders with unique features, HumidiFi is carving out a distinct niche in the competitive DEX market.\nWhat Are Dark Pools and Why Are They Transformative?\nDark pools are private trading venues that allow users to execute large orders without revealing their intentions to the broader market. This approach offers several key advantages:\nReduced Slippage: Large orders can be executed without significantly impacting market prices.\nFront-Running Protection: By keeping trade details private, dark pools shield traders from front-running attacks, where malicious actors exploit pending transactions for profit.\nHumidiFi leverages these benefits to attract high-volume traders, making it a preferred choice for those seeking efficient and secure trade execution. This privacy-focused model is particularly appealing in the fast-paced world of DeFi.\nHow Humidifi Stands Out Among Solana DEXs\nTraditional Solana DEXs like Meteora and Raydium rely on passive liquidity models, where liquidity providers earn fees by supplying assets to pools. While effective, these models are prone to challenges such as impermanent loss and arbitrage bot exploitation.\nHumidiFi, on the other hand, employs an active liquidity model. This dynamic approach optimizes trade execution, reduces losses from arbitrage, and offers better pricing for traders. As a result, HumidiFi is steadily capturing market share from traditional AMMs, signaling a paradigm shift in the Solana DeFi ecosystem.\nThe Role of Aggregators Like Jupiter in Boosting Humidifi\nTrade aggregators like Jupiter play a crucial role in driving volume to platforms like HumidiFi. By analyzing pricing efficiency across multiple exchanges, these aggregators ensure users receive the best possible rates. For HumidiFi, this means increased visibility and trading volume, as Jupiter routes high-value trades to its dark pool for optimal execution.\nThis symbiotic relationship underscores the importance of technical infrastructure in the success of dark pools and their ability to compete with traditional DEXs.\nSolana's Technical Edge: A Catalyst for Humidifi's Success\nHumidiFi's success is deeply tied to the technical capabilities of the Solana blockchain. Key advantages include:\nHigh Throughput: Solana processes thousands of transactions per second, ensuring fast and efficient trade execution.\nLow Transaction Fees: Minimal fees make it cost-effective for traders to execute large orders.\nThese features position Solana as an ideal platform for advanced trading models like dark pools, enabling platforms like HumidiFi to thrive in a competitive market.\nChallenges and Regulatory Concerns for Dark Pools\nWhile dark pools offer numerous benefits, they also face challenges and potential regul"

                "body": "Solana Price Forecast - SOL-USD Dips 20% to $197 as Ecosystem Activity Weakens, ETF Decision Becomes Key Catalyst\nWith $11.4B in daily volume and $17.1B futures open interest, SOL faces a critical test at $197 support \u2014 will ETF inflows drive a return to $250, or will bears drag it down to $165? | That's TradingNEWS\nSolana (SOL-USD) Under Pressure as Bears Test $197 and Investors Rotate Into High-ROI Tokens\nMacro Forces Driving the Latest Solana Slide\nSolana (SOL-USD) has come under heavy selling pressure in the final week of September, slipping to $197.20, down more than 20% week-on-week. The drop mirrors the broader crypto pullback, with over $150 billion erased from global market cap as Bitcoin slid under $110,000. Macroeconomic stress\u2014U.S. shutdown risks, looming inflation data, and a massive options expiry\u2014created a risk-off tone that amplified liquidations across major altcoins, Solana included.\nSOL Token Activity Weakens With Ecosystem Data Flashing Red\nBeyond the macro backdrop, Solana\u2019s internal ecosystem is showing cracks. Weekly token launches have plunged to their lowest level since October 2024, undermining the speculative energy that historically drove SOL higher. The sharp slowdown in new token creation translates to reduced demand for Solana as gas and staking collateral, pulling utility-driven buying power out of the market.\nAccording to DeFiLlama, Solana\u2019s total value locked slipped from $13 billion to $10.77 billion in just one week, while daily transaction volumes slid another 11%, underscoring waning momentum.\nDerivatives Market Highlights Investor Jitters\nAt the same time, Solana\u2019s derivatives market has been volatile. Open interest in futures reached a record $17.1 billion as of September 20, only to face a wave of forced liquidations when the spot price broke below $200. Hundreds of millions in leveraged long positions were wiped out, sparking a chain of stop-loss triggers. Yet open interest levels remain elevated, meaning speculative capital is still parked in SOL futures despite the downside flush.\nFunding rates flipping positive at +0.0043% signal leveraged traders are again leaning bullish, though momentum remains fragile with the Relative Strength Index hovering below 40 and MACD still tilted bearish.\nInstitutional Flows Provide a Contradictory Signal\nEven with price weakness, institutional flows into Solana-linked products remain notable. Europe\u2019s Bitwise Solana ETF drew $60 million shortly after launch, while REX-Osprey\u2019s Solana staking ETF added $12 million in inflows. In the U.S., multiple heavyweight asset managers including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale have filed for Solana staking ETFs, with decisions expected in mid-October. Approval could act as a major catalyst, unlocking new sources of demand and potentially driving SOL back toward the $230\u2013$250 band.\nPantera Capital has already highlighted Solana as \u201cnext in line\u201d for an institutional moment after Ethereum\u2019s ETF success.\nInvestor Rotation Into Bitcoin Hyper and New Presales\nAs Solana fights to defend the $185\u2013$190 support band, speculative traders have started rotating capital toward newer high-ROI narratives. Bitcoin Hyper, still in presale at $0.012975, has raised over $18.3 million and offers staking yields of 64% APY. Its pitch as Bitcoin\u2019s first Layer-2 with smart contract functionality has drawn whale accumulation and diverted attention from Solana\u2019s recent slump. With projected upside of 2,300% toward $0.32, HYPER has become a clear competitor for speculative capital once funneled into Solana-based meme tokens.\nRead More\n-\nQQQ ETF Holds $486 as Nasdaq-100 Rallies to 22,631 \u2014 Tech Mega-Caps Power 38% Yearly Gains\n29.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs on Nasdaq Rally \u2014 XRPR at $24.33, XRPI $17.55 as SEC Reforms Fuel Inflows\n29.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast (NG=F) Drops to $2.88 as Oversupply, Record U.S. Storage, and EU Sanctions Pressure Prices\n29.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS "

The S&P 500 rose about 0.4%, closing near 6,672 points. The Nasdaq Composite led with a 0.8% gain, fueled largely by strong performances in artificial intelligence (AI) and tech companies like Nvidia and Oracle. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down slightly by 0.07%, reflecting mixed sector-by-sector sentiment.\nTechnology stocks, particularly those related to artificial intelligence, were the main drivers of today\u2019s market momentum. Companies like Nvidia and Oracle saw noticeable gains as investors bet on continued growth in AI and cloud computing services.\nInvestors are also keeping a close eye on the government shutdown looming if Congress doesn\u2019t approve funding by the Tuesday deadline. A shutdown could halt some federal operations and delay key economic data releases, adding an extra layer of caution to trading decisions.\nAnother focus for traders is the upcoming jobs report. Economists expect moderate growth with about 43,000 new jobs added and an unemployment rate around 4.3%. The report\u2019s outcome could influence interest rate expectations and overall market sentiment.\nOther sectors, such as healthcare, energy, and consumer goods, showed steady performance today. Energy stocks, in particular, benefited from rising oil and gas prices, while healthcare and consumer goods provided stability amidst uncertainty.\nDespite the short-term uncertainty, September has been a positive month for markets. The S&P 500 is up approximately 2.8%, the Dow Jones has gained 1.5%, and the Nasdaq is ahead around 2.9%, suggesting that investor confidence remains intact for now.\nThe three main U.S. stock indexes showed mixed performance today.\n- S&P 500: Rose by 0.42% and closed near 6,672 points.\n- Nasdaq Composite: Led the gains, climbing about 0.8%, boosted by strong tech stock performance.\n- Dow Jones Industrial Average: Opened higher but slipped slightly, down 0.07% to 46,217 points.\nTech companies, especially those in artificial intelligence (AI) and software, are leading today\u2019s gains. Stocks like Nvidia and Oracle saw notable increases.\nInvestors see AI and cloud technology as long-term growth drivers. Strong earnings reports or positive forecasts from these companies can quickly lift indexes, especially the Nasdaq.\nTop U.S. stocks showing strong performance today include major tech and AI-related names leading gains:\n- Nvidia (NVDA) continues to rally with a 29.7% gain year-to-date, fueled by AI growth.\n- Oracle, another key tech stock, saw noticeable gains as cloud computing demand remains strong.\n- Palantir Technologies (PLTR) leads among the best-performing stocks in 2025, with over 107% gains year-to-date.\n- Newmont Corp. (NEM), Seagate Technology (STX), and GE Vernova (GEV) are also among top performers with significant gains of around 86% to nearly 100% year-to-date.\n- Energy stocks like Phillips 66 (PSX) show strength with improving earnings estimates.\n- On the income stock front, CION Investment Corporation with a 14.9% dividend yield and Grupo CIBEST (CIB) with strong earnings growth are notable.\nHow Does the Government Shutdown Affect Investors?\nThe U.S. government is on the brink of a shutdown if Congress doesn\u2019t approve funding by midnight Tuesday. This uncertainty is making investors nervous.A shutdown could temporarily halt some government services and delay economic data releases. That includes the September jobs report, which many traders are watching closely.\nEven though a shutdown might not last long, it can increase short-term market volatility. Investors often adjust their positions to avoid sudden losses.\nWhat Should We Expect From the Jobs Report?\nThe upcoming jobs report is highly anticipated. Economists expect around 43,000 new jobs in September, with the unemployment rate holding steady near 4.3%.A balanced report\u2014neither too strong nor too weak\u2014can reassure in"

Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, also held steady at 2.3% for a fourth consecutive month.\nEarlier this month, the ECB kept its three key interest rates on hold as widely expected. This decision followed eight interest rate cuts by the ECB totalling 175 basis points (bp) between June 2024 and June 2025. With inflation at the ECB\u2019s 2% medium-term target and the Eurozone economy showing resilience, no changes were made.\nThis month, the preliminary expectation is for headline inflation to rise to 2.2% year-on-year (YoY) in September and for the core measure to remain at 2.3%. Such an outcome would likely reinforce expectations for the ECB to remain on hold until the middle of 2026.\nThe European interest rate market is pricing in only a slim 10% chance of another ECB 25 bp rate cut before year-end and only a modest 33% chance of a 25 bp rate cut by the middle of 2026.\nEA headline inflation rate chart\nFTSE 100 technical analysis\nLate last month, in August, the FTSE 100 hit a fresh record high of 9357, which it retested again overnight, falling just 3 points short. A sustained break above the 9357 record high would indicate the correction is complete and the uptrend has resumed, with scope towards 9500.\nHowever, as long as the FTSE 100 remains below the 9357 record high, there is potential for a dip back to 9100 as part of a sideways correction. If the support at 9100 fails, it could pave the way for a deeper decline towards the psychologically important 9000 support level.\nFTSE 100 daily chart\nDAX 40 technical analysis\nAfter a strong rally from the April low of 18,489 to the July high of 24,639, the DAX has spent the past two and a half months consolidating those gains.\nIf the DAX achieves a sustained break above initial resistance at 24,000 and then above trendline resistance at around 24,425, it would suggest the correction is complete and the uptrend has resumed toward 25,000.\nUntil then, the expectation is for the DAX to continue consolidating the gains made between April and July. As part of this, a dip back to trendline support at 23,300 is possible.\nDAX 40 daily chart\n- Source: TradingView. The figures stated are as of 30 September 2025.

CAC 40, which tracks the biggest companies in France, was trading at \u20ac7,870, up by 16% from its lowest level this year.\nSimilarly, the DAX Index was trading at \u20ac23,740, also much higher than the year-to-date low of \u20ac18,522. This article explores some of the top catalysts for these indices this week.\nECB officials statement\nOne of the top catalysts for the CAC 40 and DAX Index will be the upcoming speeches by some European Central Bank officials, who will provide investors with an estimate on what to expect in the next meetings.\nSome of the top ECB officials to watch will be Philip Lane, the bank\u2019s main economist, and Georg Muller, Martins Kazaks, Piero Cipollone, Pedro Machado, Isabel Schnabel, and Christine Lagarde.\nIn recent statements, most of these officials have advocated for an interest rate pause, noting that European inflation has dropped to the desired 2% target. A dovish tone by most of these officials will be bullish for the German DAX and French CAC.\nEuropean consumer inflation data\nThe other notable catalyst for the CAC and DAX will be the upcoming flash European consumer inflation data.\nEconomists polled by Reuters showed that the average estimate is that the headline Consumer Price Index rose from 2% in August to 2.3% in September as it moved further away from the ECB target of 2.0%\nCore inflation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, is expected to remain unchanged at 2.3%.\nEuropean inflation has been lower than in the United States because of the stronger euro and the lower natural gas prices.\nRecent data shows that the EUR/USD exchange rate has jumped by over 12% from the year-to-date low and analysts anticipate more gains to 1.2000.\nThere will be other important European macro numbers to watch this week, including the manufacturing and services PMI data and German retail sales.\nUS non-farm payrolls data\nThe other notable catalyst for the DAX and the CAC 40 Index is the upcoming US non-farm payrolls data, which will come out on Friday this week.\nEconomists expect the report to show that the economy created 39,000 jobs in September as the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.3%.\nThe last jobs report showed that the economy added just 22,000 jobs in August, while a revision showed that the economy lost jobs in June.\nTherefore, in addition to the official report, these indices will react to the revisions for the previous NFP numbers.\nThese American numbers have an impact for European indices because of their impact on the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy. A weak jobs report will be bullish for these indices because it will raise the possibility that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming meeting.\nThe other notable catalysts for the German DAX Index are the potential US government shutdown, an announcement of tariffs by Donald Trump, and macro data like the consumer confidence and the JOLTs job vacancies numbers.\nThe post Here\u2019s what will move the CAC 40 and DAX Index this week appeared first on Invezz\nRead More\nTop catalysts for the Nikkei 225 Index in Q4\u201925\nHere\u2019s what will move the CAC 40 and DAX Index this week\nThe CAC 40 and DAX 40 indices have remained in a tight range in the past few months.

But investors can look through the potential for a shutdown, because if it does occur it will likely be resolved quickly and the market can resume focusing on the things that do matter, like earnings, monetary policy and AI investments.\u201d\nAn earlier Goldman Sachs research report noted that financial markets generally shrug off government shutdowns even as it cautioned that \u201cprior shutdowns are not fully analogous to the potential shutdown this week.\u201d\nInvestors are also monitoring commentary from several Fed policymakers for any signs of concern over the potential loss of economic visibility should a shutdown materialize.\nCleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, among the most hawkish Fed officials and not a voter on policy this year, said on Monday the central bank needed to maintain restrictive monetary policy to cool inflation. Traders, however, are pricing in a 91.4% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the next Fed meeting.\nAs of 2:19 p.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.90 points, or 0.02%, to 46,255.19, the S&P 500 gained 14.98 points, or 0.23%, at 6,658.68 and the Nasdaq Composite added 120.10 points, or 0.53%, at 22,604.17.\nWith oil prices falling sharply, the energy sector was the biggest laggard among the S&P 500\u2019s 11 major industry sectors.\nTechnology was the biggest gainer with big pushes from AI chip leader Nvidia along with Microsoft.\nElectronic Arts climbed 4.6% after the game publisher agreed to be taken private in a $55 billion deal, fueling hopes for broader deal prospects, said Bell of 248 Ventures, who saw the transaction as \u201cconfirmation that the M&A market is open.\u201d\nLam Research advanced 2.6%, after Deutsche Bank upgraded the rating on the chip-making equipment firm to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201chold.\u201d\nAppLovin set a new record and was last up 5.4%, also providing one of the biggest lifts for the S&P 500. Morgan Stanley raised the target price on the stock to $750 from $480.\nAfter U.S. President Donald Trump shared a video on Sunday promoting the health benefits of hemp-derived cannabidiol, U.S.-listed shares of cannabis-related companies rose. Canopy Growth was up 17% and Cronos Group climbed 15%, while Tilray Brands surged more than 48%.\nAdvancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.22-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 295 new highs and 72 new lows.

That is more than 170,000 fewer global tourists than last year.\nIn August alone, arrivals slipped by 7.5% compared to 2024.\nThe region\u2019s economy and image suffered significant setbacks this year. Shocking images of the destructive Eaton and Palisades fires in January, followed by the immigration crackdown in June, made global news and repelled visitors. Meanwhile, President Trump\u2019s fickle tariff policies and other geopolitical posturing have convinced many international tourists to avoid America.\nOn Hollywood Boulevard, there are fewer tourists, and the ones who show up spend less, says Salim Osman. He works for Ride Like A Star, an exotic car company that rents to visitors looking to take a luxury vehicle for a spin and snap the quintessential L.A. selfie.\nLast year, crowds lined up to rent its Ferraris and Porches for around $200 an hour, Salim says. However, this summer, foot traffic dropped by nearly 50%.\n\u201cIt used to be shoulder to shoulder out here,\u201d he said, looking along the boulevard. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder for people to come here, or they\u2019re afraid of what\u2019s going on here, so they just don\u2019t come.\u201d\nBusiness has been slow around the TCL Chinese Theater, where visitors place their hands into the concrete handprints of celebrities like Kristen Stewart and Denzel Washington.\nThere were fewer people to hop onto sightseeing buses, stop inside Madame Tussauds wax museum and snap impromptu photos with patrolling characters such as Spider-Man and Mickey Mouse. Souvenir shops nearby say they have also had to increase the prices of many of their knick-knacks because of tariffs and a decline in sales.\nOf all the state\u2019s international travelers, the most significant absence was from Canadian tourists. Arrivals from visitors from up north fell 32% in the three months of Summer.\nPresident Trump\u2019s talk of making Canada the 51st state and his decision to hit Canada with tariffs have not endeared him to Canadian travelers. Meanwhile, media overseas have been bombarded with stories of capricious denials and detentions at U.S. border crossings.\nSummer in Palm Springs was OK this year, said its mayor, Ron deHarte, but only because domestic tourists offset the sharp decline in Canadians.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hurt our Canadian friends with actions that the administration has taken. It\u2019s understandable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long they won\u2019t want to travel to the States, but we\u2019re hopeful that it is short-term.\u201d\nVisitors from China, India, Germany and Australia also avoided the state.\nSurprisingly, Mexican tourists didn\u2019t stay away. There were around 5% more arrivals from our southern neighbor despite the ICE raids, which often targeted Latino people.\nThere was a dip in traffic to most Los Angeles airports. With the World Cup on the books for next year and the Summer Olympics gearing up in 2028, the growing decline in tourism is worrisome for many across all industries.\nCynthia Guidry, the director of the Long Beach Airport, says reduced airline schedules, economic pressures and rising costs also impacted airport traffic. She\u2019s currently seeking out ways to best prepare for the Olympics, which don\u2019t involve flight revenue, such as dining at the airport and so"

Not even Black people want to vote for us anymore, even Latinos hate us, so we need new voters, and if we give all these illegal aliens free health care, we might be able to get them on our side so they can vote for us.\u201d\n\u201cThey can't even speak English so they won\u2019t realize we\u2019re just a bunch of woke pieces of s***, you know, at least for a while until they learn English and they realize they hate us too,\u201d the fake Schumer says.\nThe funding crisis is largely centered on health care policy disputes but the Democrats say undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in federally funded health coverage under existing law or under their Democrats\u2019 funding proposals.\nThe real Schumer responded to Trump's post with his own social media comment, saying on X: \"If you think your shutdown is a joke, it just proves what we all know: You can\u2019t negotiate. You can only throw tantrums.\"\nVice President JD Vance said Monday that he thinks the government is headed for a shutdown because \"Democrats won't do the right thing\" after Trump met Democratic Party leaders at the White House.\nSchumer said after the meeting: \u201cThere are still large differences between us.\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nVance, on X September 25: \u201cDemocrats are about to shutdown the government because they demand we fund healthcare for illegal aliens.\u201d\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, in an interview with CNN on Monday: \u201cChuck Schumer \u2026 wants to reinstate free health care for illegal aliens paid by American taxpayers. We are not doing that. We can't do that.\u201d\nU.S. Senator Patty Murray, top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement, as reported by The New York Times: \u201cUndocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in federally funded health coverage under existing law or Democrats\u2019 funding proposal \u2014 but millions of American citizens will see their health care premiums double next year if Republicans keep refusing to act.\u201d\nWhat Happens Next\nTo avoid a government shutdown, a deal needs to be struck by Wednesday. A shutdown would bring widespread disruption to federal operations and could imperil the income and benefits of thousands of government workers, along with services."

                "body": "Seventeen\u2019s S.Coups and Mingyu Talk About Their Cool, Chill New Mini Album\nThe 13 members of Seventeen have been shuffling through new pairings and subunits beyond their official units of vocal, hip-hop, and performance over the past year, starting with Jeonghan and Wonwoo\u2019s JxW and Hoshi and Woozi\u2019s HxW. (And of course we can\u2019t forget the beloved BSS, with DK, Hoshi, and Seungkwan, who debuted a few years earlier.) Now, get ready to meet the latest Seventeen spin-off: Leader S.Coups and Mingyu\u2019s CxM, who have a new mini album called HYPE VIBES.\nThe way the members of Seventeen are so close-knit and truly like brothers is something their fans, known as Carats, adore. With each unit that the group reveals, they\u2019re unveiling a deeper look at the chemistry and synergy between the members.\nS.Coups and Mingyu are both part of Seventeen\u2019s hip-hop unit, so they\u2019ve always been close collaborators, but CxM takes them to the next level as a duo. At the time of their chat with Rolling Stone, we\u2019re still over two weeks out from the mini album\u2019s Sept. 29 release. The two members have been building up anticipation by teasing photos from a shoot in Hawaii, which they say they approached with the goal of making the photos feel truly raw.\nThere\u2019s been a handful of sub-units within Seventeen at this point. How would you describe CxM? What makes this unit feel like you?\nS.Coups: [Laughs.] I feel like if I say the wrong thing, it\u2019ll sound like I\u2019m saying something about the other units. But I think we put in a variety of genres into the album. And compared to the other units, rather than a put-together look, we aimed to be more effortless, thinking there could be a type of coolness that comes from being natural.\nMingyu: It might not be right to say we were \u201cnot flashy,\u201d but I think that encapsulates how we tried to be more comfortable and natural? This is a hard question.\nS.Coups: It is hard. [Laughs.] I don\u2019t want to put down the other units.\nMingyu: If we say \u201cOur songs are chill and cool!\u201d it may end up sounding like we\u2019re saying the other members\u2019 weren\u2019t. [Laughs.]\nYou can all be cool, though! You went to Hawaii to do your shoot for this mini album\u2013 I heard that the collective goal for these photos was for it to feel like a trip with close friends. Can you share any fun stories from the shoots?\nMingyu: First off, it was so tiring. Instead of having a set time for the shoot to start and end, like how you said, we were trying to shoot while we\u2019re comfortably hanging out. We shot from the second we opened our eyes in the morning to the moment we went to sleep. Once we were done I was so exhausted. I had so much fun all day, rested, and felt like I was relaxing, but physically it still took a toll on me. It was a hard shoot. We wore a lot of different outfits too.\nS.Coups: [Laughs.] I feel the same way. The shoot was certainly less tiring than if it was on a set, and we went into it thinking \u201cWe can just take photos of us hanging out.\u201d But compared to any shoot we\u2019ve done for Seventeen, suprisingly, it actually was more exhausting.\nAny specific things that you remember from the trip?\nS.Coups: For me, I haven\u2019t travelled internationally much, but Mingyu kept telling me how nice Hawaii is. The nature left a big impression on me. To go somewhere like that with someone I\u2019m so comfortable with \u2014 someone like Mingyu, who can guide me to try a variety of experiences\u2026. I really enjoyed surfing. Being able to experience those things and also do a shoot was really great.\nWhat did you guys listen to while shooting to set the vibes?\nMingyu: When we were in Hawaii for the shoot, the early versions of our music were just starting to come in, guides were coming in, so we listened to the album a lot. Like the super early versions, versions we recorded in Hawaii. We really listened to the music as we were making it.\nYou\u2019ve been together for many years now, and even though you are already so close, I\u2019m sure you spent a lot of one-on-one time together to prepare f"

These moves point to ongoing economic stresses: although China\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index rose slightly to 49.8 in September, it\u2019s still signaling contraction, prompting caution among rubber producers. Oil prices also played a part, with OPEC+ suggesting more supply and renewed oil exports from Iraqi Kurdistan making synthetic rubber cheaper compared to natural. The recent strengthening of the yen to 148.66 against the US dollar further dented Japanese rubber\u2019s export appeal, and Singapore\u2019s key contract fell 1.1% as well.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Commodities markets ride out the turbulence.\nThe slide in rubber prices is rippling through the entire commodities sector, encouraging a more cautious stance among investors. Moves in other markets reflect the uncertainty: the Nikkei 225 slipped in early Tuesday trade, and a firmer yen plus ongoing US dollar jitters ahead of a possible government shutdown are keeping global flows unpredictable. While falling rubber and oil prices may lower manufacturing input costs, the downside is tighter margins for rubber-exporting countries.\nThe bigger picture: Industrial demand still stuck in low gear.\nRubber\u2019s latest drop highlights ongoing global concerns around manufacturing and trade. China\u2019s sluggish economic recovery is suppressing demand for goods from car tires to factory equipment, while swings in oil and currency markets add to the headwinds. Until global policy becomes clearer and demand trends stabilize, industrial commodities like rubber could struggle to find solid footing.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nInsight\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 13 hours ago\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 18 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
