From a trading standpoint, rallies would need to be limited to 1.1775 IF price is heading for a deeper correction here..\u201d Euro plummeted more than 3.1% from the yearly highs with price exhausting into technical support for the past two-weeks and the focus is on possible inflection into this zone with the medium-term risk still weighted t0 the downside while below the monthly open (1.1734).\nInitial weekly support rests with the July low-week close (LWC) / 61.8% retracement of the July advance at 1.1586/93 and is backed by 1.1497-1.1505- a region defined by the March 2020 high, the 2022 high, and the 100% extension of the September decline. Look for a larger reaction there IF reached with a break / weekly close below needed to suggest a more significant high is in place / a larger correction is underway within the broader uptrend. Subsequent support objectives eyed at the Aril high close at 1.1394 with the next major technical consideration eyed at the 2024 high-week close (HWC) / 38.2% retracement of the yearly range at 1.1228/54.\nWeekly resistance is eyed at the 1.1747/75- a region defined by the 2025 HWC, the June high-close, and the 61.8% retracement of the September decline. A breach / weekly close above this pivot zone is needed to mark resumption of the broader uptrend with key resistance steady at the 100% extension of the 2022 advance / 38.2% retracement of the broader 2008 decline at 1.1917-1.2020 (area of interest for possible exhaustion / price inflection IF reached. Subsequent resistance eyed at the 2021 HWC at 1.2218 in the event of a breakout.\nBottom line: Euro is trading just above support, and the focus is on inflection off this zone in the days ahead with a weekly close below needed to fuel the next leg of this pullback.

The major currency pair struggles to gain ground as the US Dollar (USD) holds its recent upside move, which came in the wake of easing trade tensions between the United States (US) and China.\nDuring the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, holds onto recent gains near 99.00.\nTrade tensions between the US and China appear to be receding following comments from President Donald Trump that both Washington and Beijing will reach a consensus after his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.\nAnother reason behind firmness in the US Dollar is growing expectations that the federal government could reopen after almost three weeks of shutdown. On Monday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett stated that he thinks the shutdown will likely end sometime this week.\nMeanwhile, the Euro (EUR) trades with caution ahead of speeches from European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde and Vice-President Luis De Guindos, which are scheduled during the early North American session.\nThe next major trigger for the Euro would be the ECB\u2019s monetary policy announcement scheduled for next week.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing in new purchases. It is usually positive for the US Dollar.\nAuthor\nSagar Dua\nFXStreet\nSagar Dua is associated with the financial markets from his college days. Al"

The euro\u2019s early gains faded as investors reacted to soft Eurozone fundamentals, lingering political uncertainty in France following its A+ credit rating downgrade, and fresh signs of resilience in the U.S. economy. The pair currently trades near 1.1628, down 0.24%, after failing to sustain bids above 1.1670, a zone capped by the 200-period exponential moving average on intraday charts.\nFed Policy Expectations Anchor the Dollar Ahead of CPI Data\nInvestors continue to price in a 25-basis-point Federal Reserve rate cut at the upcoming October 29 meeting, with nearly 95% probability of an additional move in December. However, the key inflation data due October 24 could redefine expectations. Consensus calls for headline U.S. CPI to rise to 3.1% year-over-year, up from 2.9%, while core CPI is projected at 3.1%. A hotter print would force traders to pare back easing bets, lifting the dollar and pressuring EUR/USD further toward the 1.1550\u20131.1500 region. Fed officials have refrained from public comments during the blackout period, leaving rate expectations fully dependent on economic releases.\nEurozone Fundamentals Struggle to Inspire Confidence\nThe euro\u2019s weakness reflects persistent softness in Eurozone macro data. Germany\u2019s producer prices (PPI) fell 0.1% in September, underscoring fading industrial momentum, while the Eurozone current account surplus plunged from \u20ac29.8 billion to \u20ac11.9 billion, signaling slower export performance. ECB President Christine Lagarde is expected to address inflation and growth risks later today, though markets remain skeptical that verbal intervention alone can offset deteriorating fundamentals. Weak credit growth and stagnant manufacturing PMIs have reinforced expectations that the ECB will maintain its current rate stance through year-end, limiting euro upside potential.\nFrench Fiscal Concerns Deepen Euro Vulnerability\nThe S&P downgrade of France\u2019s sovereign rating from AA- to A+ on Friday reignited worries about fiscal sustainability across the Eurozone. Investors are increasingly questioning whether France\u2019s elevated debt burden\u2014now exceeding 111% of GDP\u2014could strain the region\u2019s overall credibility. ING analysts warned that \u201cgiven the fragility of the French government, it\u2019s too early to price out the French effect from the euro,\u201d adding that political divisions may hinder fiscal reform. This credit stress has contributed to wider spreads between French and German bonds, putting renewed downward pressure on EUR/USD during European trading hours.\nTrade and Geopolitical Developments Support the Dollar\nOptimism surrounding U.S.\u2013China trade talks helped stabilize the dollar, offsetting its prior losses. Both Washington and Beijing have eased rhetoric after weeks of tariff escalation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier Lifeng held \u201cproductive\u201d discussions, while President Donald Trump hinted that the planned 100% tariff deadline could be extended to allow continued negotiation. The potential Trump\u2013Xi meeting in South Korea in early November is now being viewed as a pivotal event for global markets. Improved trade sentiment has strengthened equities, reduced demand for safe havens, and consequently reinforced the greenback\u2019s short-term momentum against the euro.\nTechnical Analysis: 1.1600 Support Under Threat\nThe technical picture for EUR/USD remains bearish. The pair is pinned below both the 50-period EMA (1.1650) and the 200-period EMA (1.1662), forming a downwa"

                "body": "British Pound Outlook: GBP/USD Awaits Verdict from Inflation Showdown\n- Correlation with U.S. rates increasing\n- U.S. CPI likely trumps U.K. inflation\n- Fed cuts priced deeper than BoE\nSummary\nGBP/USD faces a pivotal week as inflation reports from both sides of the Atlantic collide. Correlations with U.S. rate expectations are growing, likely making Friday\u2019s CPI the key driver over the U.K. print. With Fed easing bets priced deep and technicals flashing caution, any shift in U.S. outlook could tip the scales for GBP/USD.\nU.S. Rates Relationship Strengthens\nGBP/USD has shown an increasingly strong relationship with movements at the front of the U.S. interest rate curve over the past fortnight, recording correlation coefficients with market pricing for Fed rate cuts out to September next year and two-year U.S. Treasury yields of 0.73 and -0.68 respectively. Not strong by any stretch of the imagination, but certainly more meaningful than what was seen earlier this month.\nSource: TradingView\nInterestingly, the relationship between short and longer-dated yield differentials between the U.S. and U.K. has either been insignificant or contrary to what fundamentals would suggest, meaning the U.S. rate outlook likely matters more for GBP/USD right now. Backing that view out, it hints that in the battle of this week\u2019s inflation reports, it\u2019s the U.S. data on Friday that may pack more market-moving clout. Details of what\u2019s expected from both reports are shown below. The following link will also take you to a more in-depth preview of what to look out for in the U.S. report.\nSource: TradingView\nFed Cut Pricing Dwarfs BoE\nHeading into the inflation prints, the U.S. swaps curve points to a far larger and quicker pace of easing from the Federal Reserve relative to the Bank of England, not only reflecting where markets assess the relative neutral policy level sits in both nations, but also the very public desire of the U.S. President to see lower interest rates.\nSource: Bloomberg\nWhile it\u2019s not the only factor, with the Fed expected to cut nearly five times over the next year with only two priced from the BoE, it\u2019s contributed to the uplift in GBP/USD seen this year. Therefore, should market pricing shift, especially from the U.S. side of the equation, it will likely impact GBP/USD direction.\nAs conveyed in earlier analysis, when it comes to the balance of risks from the Fed, based purely on economic factors, the risk appears skewed towards less easing than has been priced, not more. All things considered, that would point to upside risks for the dollar should it eventuate.\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at the technical picture for GBP/USD, the price finds itself sitting on 1.3371, a minor level that acted as both support and resistance earlier this month. Over recent days, we saw a three-candle evening star pattern completed, warning of downside risks. They\u2019ve obviously materialised, so the question now is whether that\u2019s it for the move?\nBeneath 1.3371, 1.3252, the 200-day moving average and 1.3142 are the levels to watch. On the topside, a rebound last week stalled just below the 50-day moving average, making it relevant along with 1.3534 and 1.3589.\nMomentum indicators are providing marginally bearish signals, with RSI (14) beneath 50 while MACD remains in negative territory. However, with the former trending higher and the latter having already crossed the signal line from below, the overall message is one that points to the need for bears to be cautious about getting too aggressive around these levels.\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

Pound Sterling (GBP) traders are pulling back from their bids ahead of the latest round of Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data due from the UK on Wednesday, with the US side of the CPI data docket due on Friday.\nHeadline UK CPI inflation is expected to rose to 4.0% YoY in September, while core CPI is forecast to tick up to 3.7%. With UK inflation pressures still on the rise, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) room to maneuver in the face of a steepening recessionary outlook is severely restricted.\nUS markets are facing less of the same problem, but could simply be less along the same spiral. US CPI inflation data due on Friday is expected to show a comparative increase in price pressures, with headline annualized CPI expected to rise to 3.1% from 2.9%. While US CPI moves are expected to match UK inflation changes, the figures remain low enough that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is still well on its way to delivering at least two more interest rate cuts before the end of the year.\nGBP/USD price forecast\nThe GBP/USD daily chart shows the British pound trading around 1.3360, with recent price action suggesting a period of consolidation after a series of lower highs and higher lows. The pair remains caught between its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near 1.3440 and the 200-day EMA around 1.3290, a range that reflects indecision among traders.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently hovering near 44, which indicates that momentum is leaning slightly bearish but not yet in oversold territory. This suggests sellers have an edge, though conviction remains moderate.\nPrice action has respected the 200-day EMA several times, showing it continues to act as a key dynamic support level. Meanwhile, rallies toward the 50-day EMA have struggled to gain traction, highlighting the importance of that level as near-term resistance.\nUntil the pair breaks decisively above 1.3450 or below 1.3290, GBP/USD is likely to remain range-bound. A close under the 200-day EMA could open the door toward the next key support around 1.3140, while a push above the 50-day EMA would bring the 1.3780 area back into view.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the "

The Federal Reserve aims for further interest rate cuts amid differing inflation challenges between the UK and US.\nGBP/USD is in a consolidation phase, trading around 1.3360. The pair is caught between the 50-day EMA at 1.3440 and the 200-day EMA at 1.3290, indicating trader indecision.\nThe RSI near 44 suggests slight bearish momentum, not yet oversold, with minor selling advantage. Price action respects the 200-day EMA as support, while the 50-day EMA acts as resistance, maintaining the current range.\nPotential Breakout Scenarios\nShould GBP/USD move decisively above 1.3450 or below 1.3290, it may break free from the range. Falling below the 200-day EMA could lead to further declines, while surpassing the 50-day EMA could provoke gains.\nPound Sterling, the UK\u2019s currency, is impacted by the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policies, economic data, and trade balance, all influencing its value and attractiveness globally.\nWe are seeing GBP/USD weaken below the 1.3400 mark as traders brace for today\u2019s UK inflation data. The core issue is a widening policy gap, with the Bank of England stuck fighting inflation while the US Federal Reserve is expected to continue cutting interest rates. This divergence is the main driver for derivative plays over the next few weeks.\nToday\u2019s UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) is forecast to rise to 4.0%, a difficult number for a central bank facing a slowing economy. Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics confirmed the UK entered a technical recession in the third quarter of 2025 with a -0.2% GDP reading. This situation severely limits the Bank of England\u2019s ability to raise rates, putting a ceiling on the pound\u2019s potential.\nIn contrast, the US CPI due this Friday is expected at a more moderate 3.1%, giving the Fed more flexibility. In fact, the CME FedWatch Tool now shows an 85% probability of another 25-basis-point rate cut at the November 2025 meeting. This outlook continues to weigh on the US dollar\u2019s long-term strength.\nThe upcoming data releases guarantee a spike in volatility, which options traders can use to their advantage. A simple strategy is to buy near-term at-the-money straddles to capitalize on a significant price swing, whether it is up or down. This approach allows a trader to profit from the movement itself without needing to predict the direction correctly.\nFor those anticipating further sterling weakness, the critical level to watch is the 200-day moving average near 1.3290. We saw this level provide strong support back in the summer of 2024, but a break below it now could open the door to a slide towards 1.3140. Buying put options with a strike price of 1.3250 offers a defined-risk way to position for such a downward move.\nOn the other hand, a surprisingly high UK inflation figure could force the Bank of England to sound more aggressive, pushing the pound higher. A sustained move above the 50-day moving average at 1.3440 would be a bullish signal. Traders anticipating this outcome could use call options with a strike price around 1.3500 to capture potential upside."

The pair depreciates as the Australian Dollar (AUD) loses ground, likely weighed down by foreign outflows reflected in the decline of commodity-related stocks, including Gold and major mining companies. It is important to note that Australia is one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of Gold.\nGold miners fell nearly 10% to their lowest level in more than three weeks and are heading for their steepest decline since April 23. The drop came after a sharp fall in bullion prices, as investors took profits following Gold\u2019s record high earlier in the week.\nHowever, the downside of the Australian Dollar could be restrained due to the optimism over a breakthrough in the United States (US)-Australia trade agreement. US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a USD 8.5 billion critical minerals agreement at the White House on Monday, aimed at securing access to Australia\u2019s abundant rare-earth resources amid China\u2019s tighter export controls.\nThe US Dollar (USD) could come under pressure amid concerns over a prolonged federal government shutdown and potential delays in key US economic data releases, including Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), adding uncertainty for financial markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed).\nThe US government shutdown has entered its fourth week as the Senate on Monday failed for the 11th time to advance a House-passed measure to fund the government and end the ongoing shutdown. The 50-43 vote fell mostly along party lines. This marks the third-longest funding lapse in modern history.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination.

The appointment of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan\u2019s first female leader, has triggered new speculation over the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) policy direction, with markets anticipating a delay in rate normalization. This comes as the Federal Reserve remains in blackout mode ahead of its next meeting, leaving macro signals subdued. The pair trades just above its 20-day Simple Moving Average at 150.14, a level that has repeatedly served as technical support through October. The USD/JPY has rallied nearly 0.5% since Friday\u2019s low of 149.37, supported by widening policy divergence between the BoJ and the Fed.\nBoJ Policy Uncertainty Intensifies After Takaichi\u2019s Election Victory\nPolitical developments in Japan have become a defining catalyst for the yen\u2019s weakness. The Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) agreed to form a coalition government, handing Takaichi control of the lower and upper houses, though still short of the 233-seat majority needed for unrestricted legislation. Investors interpret her expansionary stance as a signal that the BoJ could postpone tightening, maintaining negative real rates longer than previously expected. BoJ Board Member Hajime Takata confirmed this view on Monday, stating that Japan has \u201croughly achieved\u201d its 2% inflation target, while Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida reiterated that policy normalization will remain data-dependent. The combination of stable inflation and political support for looser fiscal stimulus has kept the yen under pressure, reinforcing bullish sentiment in USD/JPY.\nFederal Reserve Blackout and U.S. Shutdown Limit Dollar Volatility\nIn the United States, macro visibility remains limited by the ongoing government shutdown, now entering its third week, and the Fed\u2019s pre-meeting blackout period. Despite the lack of new data, market expectations have stabilized around a dovish bias: futures markets via CME FedWatch Tool fully price in 25-basis-point rate cuts at both the October and December FOMC meetings. The prospect of lower U.S. rates has capped some of the dollar\u2019s upside, but the yen\u2019s underperformance continues to dominate. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) trades near 96.20, up 0.32%, showing resilience despite political gridlock. Traders note that the lack of hawkish communication has not deterred bullish positioning in USD/JPY, with intraday demand emerging near 150.50\u2013150.45, a critical pivot zone aligned with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of October\u2019s rally.\nTechnical Structure Shows Bulls in Control with 151.75 Resistance in Sight\nThe technical configuration remains favorable for USD/JPY buyers. The pair has printed three consecutive bullish daily candles, confirming the strength of the rebound from last week\u2019s lows. A sustained move above 151.00 would pave the way for a test of the 151.75 confluence zone, which aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent correction and the 200-hour SMA. If this resistance breaks, the next upside targets stand at 152.00 and 152.25, with a potential extension toward 153.00, matching the October 10 high. On the downside, firm support rests at 150.00, followed by 149.35, the intraday trough that halted last week\u2019s slide. A break below 148.45\u2013148.40 would flip momentum toward a short-term correction, but current price action suggests consolidation above 150 remains the dominant trend.\nMarket Sentiment Favors Yen Weakness Amid Global Risk Appetite\nGlobal risk sentimen"

Crude Oil prices appreciate after an industry report showed falling stockpiles.\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API) data indicated US inventories fell 2.98 million barrels last week, the first decline in four weeks. Additionally, US President Donald Trump reiterated that India plans to reduce its Russian Oil purchases.\nThe USD/CAD pair also faces challenges as the US Dollar (USD) declines amid concerns over a prolonged federal government shutdown and potential delays in key US economic data releases, including Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), adding uncertainty for financial markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed).\nThe US government shutdown has entered its fourth week as the Senate on Monday failed for the 11th time to advance a House-passed measure to fund the government and end the ongoing shutdown. The 50-43 vote fell mostly along party lines. This marks the third-longest funding lapse in modern history.\nA Reuters poll suggested that 115 out of 117 economists have predicted that the Fed will reduce interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75%-4.00% in the monetary policy announcement on October 29. For the year, 83 of 117 economists expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice, while 32 anticipate one cut.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This "

                "body": "Key Drivers of the Cad Include the Boc\u2019s Interest Rates\nKey drivers of the CAD include the BoC\u2019s interest rates, which aim to keep inflation between 1-3%, and the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s primary export. Macroeconomic indicators like GDP, employment, and consumer sentiment also impact CAD\u2019s value. A strong economy could lead to higher interest rates, strengthening CAD, whereas weak economic data might result in a decline.\nThe BoC influences CAD through its interest rate policies, with higher rates typically benefiting the currency. Economic data releases, including GDP and PMI indices, play a critical role in shaping the Canadian Dollar\u2019s trajectory. An increase in Oil prices usually boosts the CAD, as it is a major export for Canada.\nThe latest Canadian inflation data, coming in hotter than expected at 2.4% for September, puts the Bank of Canada (BoC) in a difficult position. This persistent inflation complicates their ability to lower interest rates, even as the economy shows signs of weakness. Last month\u2019s data from Statistics Canada confirmed this slowdown, with Q2 2025 GDP growth being a meager 0.8% on an annualized basis.\nWe See a Clear Divergence in Central Bank Policy\nWe see a clear divergence in central bank policy that is driving the currency markets. While overnight index swaps are pricing in a 65% chance of a BoC rate cut in December, the U.S. Federal Reserve is signaling a \u201chigher for longer\u201d stance, with futures markets not expecting a cut until mid-2026. This policy gap is the primary force pushing the US Dollar higher against the Canadian Dollar.\nLooking at the USD/CAD chart, the uptrend is well-established, supported by the recent \u201cgolden cross\u201d formation from early in the month. We see significant resistance forming around the 1.4100 level, which has capped recent rallies. Any pullbacks toward the support zone between 1.3900 and 1.3950 should be viewed as potential opportunities to join the trend.\nWe must also acknowledge that oil, a key Canadian export, is providing little support. WTI crude has struggled to hold the $85 per barrel level amid renewed concerns over slowing global demand, particularly out of Asia. This weakness in energy markets directly translates to pressure on the loonie, making it harder for it to gain ground.\nFor derivative traders, this outlook favors strategies that profit from further USD/CAD strength. Buying call options on USD/CAD with expiry dates in the coming months allows for participation in a continued move higher. A bull call spread could also be an effective strategy to reduce premium costs, targeting a move towards that 1.4100 resistance level while defining risk."

                "body": "Ottawa, Canada \u2013 October 21, 2025 \u2013 Canada's financial markets are recalibrating after a surprisingly robust inflation report for September, which saw the annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerate to 2.4%. This unexpected uptick, surpassing both August's 1.9% and market forecasts of 2.3%, has significantly cooled expectations for an imminent interest rate cut from the Bank of Canada (BoC) at its upcoming October 29 policy meeting. In response, the USD/CAD exchange rate, a key barometer for the Canadian economy, initially dipped before stabilizing around the 1.4030 mark, reflecting a newfound resilience in the Canadian dollar.\nThe \"hotter-than-expected\" CPI data has injected a fresh wave of uncertainty into the BoC's monetary policy path, which had previously signaled a leaning towards further easing. With headline inflation now exceeding the central bank's 2% target for the first time in six months, policymakers face a delicate balancing act between supporting a slowing economy and taming persistent price pressures. This development has effectively trimmed the perceived urgency for rate reductions, prompting a reassessment of investment strategies across various sectors.\nUnpacking the Inflationary Surprise and Market Reaction\nThe September CPI report, released just days before the crucial Bank of Canada policy meeting, revealed an annual inflation rate of 2.4%, a notable jump from the 1.9% recorded in August. This figure not only defied market consensus but also marked the first instance in half a year that headline inflation has breached the BoC's symmetrical 2% target. On a monthly basis, the CPI edged up by 0.1%, contrary to forecasts that had anticipated a 0.1% decline.\nSeveral factors converged to fuel this inflationary surprise. A smaller year-over-year decline in gasoline prices, recorded at -4.1% in September compared to -12.7% in August due to a base-year effect, played a substantial role. Food costs also exerted upward pressure, with prices for groceries rising 4.0% year-over-year, an acceleration from 3.5% in August, driven notably by fresh vegetables and sugar. Furthermore, a slower year-over-year decline in travel tour prices and persistently rising shelter costs, particularly rent, which accelerated to 4.8% nationally, contributed significantly to the overall inflationary environment.\nAdding to the central bank's dilemma, the Bank of Canada's preferred core CPI measures, designed to strip out volatile components, also exhibited stubborn underlying price pressures. The core CPI rose 2.8% over the last twelve months, with a 0.2% monthly increase. Other closely watched gauges, such as Common CPI (2.7%), Trimmed CPI (3.1%), and Median CPI (3.2%), further underscored that inflation is proving more entrenched than previously hoped, despite some policymakers recently questioning the reliability of these metrics.\nPrior to this CPI release, market participants had largely priced in another 25-basis-point rate cut by the Bank of Canada at its October 29 meeting, following a similar cut in September amid concerns over a softening labor market and sluggish GDP growth. However, the unexpected inflation data has dramatically shifted this outlook. The probability of a 25 bps rate cut at the upcoming meeting has now eased to approximately 74%, a significant drop from 86% before the report. This reassessment led to an immediate strengthening of the Canadian dollar, with the USD/CAD pair dipping towards the 1.4000 level before steadying around 1.4030, as traders unwound some of their bearish CAD bets.\nCorporate Implications: Winners and Losers in a Higher-for-Longer Rate Environment\nThe recalibration of interest rate expectations and the Canadian dollar's stabilization following the CPI data will undoubtedly create ripple effects across various sectors of the Canadian economy, impacting public companies differently.\nFinancial institutions, particularly the major Canadian banks, stand to benefit from a \"higher-for-longer\" intere"

The Yen is right now trading above 151.00.On the other hand, the Pound is lacking upside momentum, as investors await the release of the key UK CPI figures, due on Wednesday, for further clues about the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy path. Markets are bracing for a hotter CPI inflation reading, which might hit the 4% yearly growth, forcing the BoE to adopt a more cautious view on monetary easing. Japanese Yen FAQs What key factors drive the Japanese Yen? The Japanese Yen is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors. How do the decisions of the Bank of Japan impact the Japanese Yen? One of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen. How does the differential between Japanese and US bond yields impact the Japanese Yen? Over the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential. How does broader risk sentiment impact the Japanese Yen? The Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nIndonesia Berita Terbaru, Indonesia Berita utama\nSimilar News:Anda juga dapat membaca berita serupa dengan ini yang kami kumpulkan dari sumber berita lain.\n"

                "body": "The British Pound maintains a mild upward trend against the Yen, fluctuating from session highs at 202.80 to around 202.30. The currency pair remains within the previous week\u2019s trading range, lacking a decisive direction.\nThe Japanese Yen has seen some recovery after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi announced her cabinet. Satsuki Katayama\u2019s appointment as finance minister has supported the Yen, as she contrasts with expectations for a low JPY and loose monetary policy.\nYen\u2019s Economic Fundamentals\nKatayama criticized the Yen\u2019s weakness, stating that Japan\u2019s economic fundamentals suggest a real value of 120 to 130 USD. Currently, the Yen trades above 151.00.\nThe British Pound lacks upward momentum, with attention on upcoming UK CPI figures for insight into the Bank of England\u2019s policy. An anticipated increase in CPI to 4% could prompt a cautious stance from the BoE on monetary easing.\nThe Yen\u2019s value depends on Japan\u2019s economy, BoJ policy, bond yield differentials, and trading risks. The BoJ\u2019s currency control measures are pivotal, often refraining from intervention due to political risks. The shift from ultra-loose policy in 2024 and interest-rate cuts elsewhere are reducing the US-Japanese bond yield gap.\nAs a safe-haven asset, the Yen often strengthens during market stress, attracting investments due to its perceived stability.\nMarket Strategies and Predictions\nAs of October 21, 2025, we see the British Pound against the Yen trading without a clear direction, which is confirmed by its one-month implied volatility falling to a three-month low of 8.5%. This indicates that the options market is not pricing in any large moves in the immediate future. The main event for traders this week will be the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) report due tomorrow.\nWe are positioning for Wednesday\u2019s UK inflation data, as a higher-than-expected figure could significantly impact the Bank of England\u2019s policy outlook. Current market consensus points to a yearly rate of 3.9%, and any number surpassing the 4% mark would likely force the BoE to adopt a more cautious stance on monetary easing, providing support for the Pound. Traders could consider short-term call options on the pound to hedge against or speculate on such a surprise.\nOn the Japanese side, the appointment of Satsuki Katayama as finance minister is a new and important factor for the Yen. Her previous comments criticizing a weak yen create a risk for anyone betting against the currency, as she could signal a less tolerant stance towards depreciation. We have already noted in the latest CFTC data from the week ending October 14th that large speculators have slightly reduced their net short positions on the Yen.\nThis political shift complements the gradual policy normalization we have seen from the Bank of Japan since it began to move away from its ultra-loose policy back in 2024. With recent government data showing that Japanese nominal cash earnings rose by 2.5% in September year-over-year, the strongest pace in over a year, there is a fundamental basis for further policy tightening. This underlying economic improvement could provide a floor for the Yen\u2019s value in the medium term.\nConsidering these opposing pressures\u2014a potentially stronger Pound from UK inflation versus a resilient Yen from Japanese political and economic shifts\u2014the GBP/JPY pair could remain within its recent range. We think that selling volatility could be a viable strategy over the next few weeks. Derivative traders might look at selling strangles, with strike prices placed outside the recent 201.50 to 203.50 trading band, to collect premium from the expected lack of a major directional breakout."

                "body": "GBP/JPY steady as Japan\u2019s new leadership weighs on Yen, UK fiscal strain persists\n- The Japanese Yen weakens broadly after Japan\u2019s parliament elects Sanae Takaichi as Prime Minister, ending weeks of political uncertainty.\n- In her first remarks, Takaichi pledges political stability and closer coordination with the Bank of Japan to support wage-led inflation.\n- UK fiscal concerns linger ahead of the November budget, while traders await Wednesday\u2019s CPI data for monetary policy clues.\nThe British Pound (GBP) gains traction against the Japanese Yen (JPY) on Tuesday, as the Yen weakens across the board following Japan\u2019s parliamentary vote earlier in the day that confirmed Sanae Takaichi as the country\u2019s new Prime Minister. At the time of writing, GBP/JPY trades around 203.26, after briefly touching a one-week high near 203.53 earlier in the European session.\nJapan\u2019s parliament elected Takaichi, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), after she secured 237 votes, surpassing the 233 needed for a majority in the 465-seat lower house. Her victory came after the LDP struck a coalition deal with the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin).\nIn her first remarks as Prime Minister, Takaichi emphasized the need for political stability to achieve a strong economy, pledging to \u201cdefend Japan\u2019s national interest through diplomacy and security.\u201d She dismissed speculation of an early election, saying \u201cthere is no time for dissolving the lower house,\u201d and stressed that \u201cthe BoJ and government must work closely.\u201d\nTakaichi added that there are no immediate plans to revise the government-BoJ joint agreement, reiterating that the central bank\u2019s 2% inflation target should be met not through cost-push factors but through price gains accompanied by wage growth.\nOn the UK side, sentiment toward the Pound Sterling remains mixed amid escalating fiscal pressures and lingering inflation risks. The latest data showed Public Sector Net Borrowing rose more than expected in September, bringing total borrowing for the fiscal year to date to \u00a399.8 billion, around \u00a37 billion above the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s projection. The figures highlight growing strain on public finances ahead of November\u2019s budget, adding to concerns about limited fiscal space as the government faces persistent inflation and slowing growth.\nLooking ahead, traders will monitor the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) due on Wednesday, along with Japan\u2019s September trade balance for near-term cues. A stronger UK inflation print could reinforce Sterling\u2019s strength and extend GBP/JPY gains, while any rebound in Japan\u2019s exports may lend the Yen brief support.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

And during the 2008 financial crisis the S&P 500 dropped about 56% as credit froze and GDP fell.\nThose events happened before crypto existed, which is why Woo says crypto has not yet been stress-tested by a full-scale recession. Based on reports, that concern is about how liquidity would change and how quickly investors would sell riskier holdings.\nLiquidity And Recession SignalsThe National Bureau of Economic Research tracks employment, personal income, industrial production and retail sales to spot recessions. Right now there is no across-the-board signal that a deep downturn is imminent, though some risks are elevated.\nTrade tariffs are one factor that trimmed growth in the first half of 2025 and are expected to weigh on GDP into the first half of 2026, analysts said. That kind of slower growth can sap liquidity and pressure markets.\nWhat Traders Are Watching Next$BTC has reclaimed the $109,000-$110,000 support zone.\nThe next crucial level to reclaim is $112,000, which could push Bitcoin higher.\nWith US-China trade tensions easing, I think BTC could rally more from here. pic.twitter.com/D8VNses1ix\n\u2014 Ted (@TedPillows) October 20, 2025\nAnalyst Ted Pillows said Bitcoin has regained a foothold between $109,000 and $110,000, and he pointed to $112,000 as the next resistance that matters.\nA clean move above that zone could invite more buyers. Conversely, a sharp liquidity squeeze from a broader recession could force Bitcoin to move more like tech stocks did in past downturns, not like gold.\nThe Real TestWoo said the real test for Bitcoin will come when cash gets tight and investors must choose where to park money \u2014 not from the usual crypto triggers.\nThis period, he said, will expose who treated Bitcoin as a hedge and who treated it as a high-risk bet, and that outcome will shape institutional behavior and market rules going forward.\nFeatured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView"

Traders are looking for signs of volume strength and structure in the meantime.\nAs ETH strengthens at these landmark levels, so too are early-stage investors that look for such long-term potential opportunities eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new crypto coin with the same sort of early-stage momentum that ETH enjoyed during its formative years.\nMutuum Finance Sees Strong Growth in 6th Presale Phase\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is breaking through the whole DeFi space and establishing itself as the top crypto to buy in the market for retail and institutional investors alike. Its 2025 project presale has already been a record one, with more than 17,330 investors so far and more than $17.7 million raised overall. Now having reached Phase 6 and already 70% sold out, the project is making waves on record investor interest and momentum building among prospects looking for the next new crypto coin to break out.\nThe power of Mutuum Finance lies in its live risk management engine with liquid terms of liquidation and intelligent Loan-to-Value mechanism. Both adaptive and automatically scale up and down with shifting market conditions to control volatility and provide platform stability even in stress situations, making it a top crypto to buy with authentic DeFi innovation that investors are closely watching.\nMutuum Finance\u2019s Lending and Borrowing Protocol Revolution\nMutuum Finance is set to introduce its much awaited lending and borrowing protocol on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025. V1 of the platform will come online with core DeFi functionalities such as mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot with a long-term vision of providing users with scalability, security, and efficiency. As it grows, Mutuum Finance remains at the top of analysts\u2019 lists as a new crypto coin with real-world use and solid fundamentals.\nMutuum Finance Leaderboard\nMutuum Finance is revolutionizing the manner in which investors engage through its leaderboard feature. Biggest 24-hour buyers have bought MUTM tokens worth $12,538, $11,667, $1,027 respectively to indicate interest and competition for presale. No. 1 day customer receives a $500 MUTM reward, which triggers engagement and community.\nSimilar to Ethereum (ETH) at $0.75, the hot subject of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves. Already in Phase 6 at $0.035, more than 70% sold and $17.7M funded, MUTM\u2019s Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract combined dual-lending DeFi framework delivers real-world utility.\nWith its upcoming Q4 2025 protocol launch in view, Mutuum Finance is the top "

This move signals renewed investor confidence and may set the stage for further gains as market sentiment turns increasingly positive.\nThe breakout follows a period of steady accumulation, and on-chain data shows rising wallet activity and trading volume\u2014two classic signs of a sustained uptrend.\nWhat\u2019s Behind Ethereum\u2019s Rally?\nSeveral factors are fueling Ethereum\u2019s price surge:\n- Anticipation of Ethereum upgrades and improved Layer 2 scalability.\n- A broader crypto market rally, with Bitcoin also showing strength.\n- Increased institutional interest in ETH as a long-term investment.\n- Growing use of Ethereum in DeFi , NFTs, and Web3 applications.\nAnalysts suggest that if ETH holds above the $4100 level, the next resistance could be around $4400\u2013$4500, with support forming near $3900. The momentum also appears to be supported by strong fundamentals and macro factors like potential interest rate cuts.\nMarket Outlook: Is $4500 Next?\nBreaking the $4100 barrier has not only lifted Ethereum but also brought optimism across altcoin markets. Historically, Ethereum price breakouts often lead to strong altcoin seasons, as capital rotates through the crypto ecosystem.\nIf momentum continues and no major external shocks emerge, ETH could be eyeing a move toward its all-time high region again. Traders are watching closely, and long-term holders are seeing their conviction rewarded.\nRead Also:\n- Trump Hints at Tariff Payouts \u2014 Boost for Bitcoin?\n- Batched Threshold Encryption Aims to End MEV in DeFi\n- $258M in Crypto Positions Liquidated in 4 Hours"

Sign up here.\nLast week, Ethereum lost one of its top researchers, Dankrad Feist.\nFeist left for Tempo, a blockchain being built by payment processor Stripe and crypto venture firm Paradigm.\n\u201cWhile payments used to be front and centre in the early days of crypto, I see a special opportunity to finally achieve this ambitious goal,\u201d Feist wrote on X.\nThe Ethereum community was blindsided. Feist\u2019s partial departure \u2014 he will continue to advise the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 led to a fair amount of hand-wringing and finger-pointing.\nAfter all, it\u2019s not the first high-profile loss for the world\u2019s largest blockchain.\nLast year, researcher Max Resnick left for Solana\u2019s development firm, Anza. He and Feist have both been advocates for scaling the Ethereum mainnet, something that has become a priority for the new leadership at the Ethereum Foundation.\nGeth founder and former Foundation employee P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi seemingly waded into the debate over the weekend when he shared a letter on social media he sent the organisation\u2019s leadership last year.\nAmong other things, he dinged the Foundation for underpaying employees.\nSzil\u00e1gyi said he\u2019d only made a little more than $100,000 per year working there, before taxes \u2014 a modest salary for a software engineer.\n\u201cAlmost all the initial employees of the Foundation have left long ago as that was the only reasonable way to actually have a compensation proportional to the value being created,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cSome people remained, and I feel the Foundation overly abused the fact that some people were in this for principles, not for the money.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not alone in voicing those concerns. More recently, a Protocol Guild survey found that software developers who work to maintain and improve the Ethereum blockchain earn a median salary of $140,000, below Coinbase employees\u2019 base salary of $150,000.\nAs for the finger-pointing, some gently admonished Tempo co-creator Paradigm for poaching top Ethereum talent to staff a competing project, a \u201ccorpo-chain.\u201d\n\u201cThe goal of Paradigm and many other VCs is to suck as much value as possible from the Ethereum and broader ecosystem, while also adding value to the ecosystem in the service of maximizing their own gains,\u201d Consensys founder Joe Lubin said.\nBut it\u2019s not all bad, said the Ethereum co-founder.\n\u201cThat said, I don\u2019t believe there is reason for concern,\u201d Lubin added. \u201cThe gold rush of corpo-chains is validating for the traditional economy and signals our mainstreaming.\u201d\nTop DeFi stories of the week\nThis week in DeFi governance\nVOTE: Arbitrum DAO votes on algorithmic delegate incentive system\nVOTE: Aave DAO considers Certora as security partner for v4\nVOTE: GMX DAO votes to fund Solana expansion\nPost of the week\nLost amid all the Feist-y (sorry) drama was Tempo\u2019s acquisition of Ithaca, a company Paradigm started last year with a $20 million investment.\nparadigm acquired paradigm so paradigm can now be far more valuable and help paradigm accelerate with paradigm\n\u2014 bunny (@ConejoCapital) October 17, 2025\nexcited for paradigm x paradigm! https://t.co/araLHrD2Lq\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": "Solana is back in an uptrend after experiencing one of the worst price dips it has ever had. SOL tokens are currently trading for $192.27, which is an increase of 2% in the past 24 hours. However, according to the latest Solana price prediction, SOL is preparing for a massive breakout that could reach prices as high as $400 in the upcoming months.\nAs Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem expands, investors are also turning to Bitcoin Hyper \u2014 a high-speed presale project seen as the next major Layer-style breakout. It aims to revolutionize Bitcoin trading forever by introducing instant transactions and minimal fees, which makes it the best crypto to buy now for high ROI. Let's analyze Solana's potential moving forward and see how SOL compares to the explosive potential behind $HYPER.\nDespite extremely unfavorable market conditions, Solana has remained mostly stable. While it did drop below $200 per token after weeks, it managed to regain over half of its losses due to its growing DeFi ecosystem and increased use cases.\nHowever, Solana is not out of the woods yet. It's trading below the 50-day average of $216, and short term price predictions point toward a maximum of $210 in October. Long-term price predictions, on the other hand, are much more optimistic. Some analysts put SOL at above $400 as adoption increases and more platforms are built on the Solana blockchain.\nSolana is still one of the best Layer 1 cryptos on the market, and its full potential is yet to be unlocked in the upcoming years. Compared to other networks, Solana offers high performance which makes it ideal for NFT platforms, SocialFi projects, and the DeFi sector that all require low fees and fast transaction times. No matter how we look at it, Solana is likely to keep scaling in the future, eventually finding its way to institutional and retail investors alike.\nThat said, Bitcoin Hyper is another crypto project with the potential to lead to a major breakout and the power to revolutionize the way Bitcoin is traded forever. Let's delve deeper and see why it's the best crypto to buy now, and why you should consider visiting the official presale right now to grab your tokens early.\nLike Solana, Bitcoin Hyper is building its reputation as a revolutionary crypto project that could redefine Bitcoin trading forever. As you may know, Bitcoin transactions can take up to 1.5 hours to complete, and they can often come with massive fees, especially during times of increased demand. Bitcoin's blockchain was never designed to handle as many transactions as it has to handle today, and it things will only get worse in the future.\nThat's where Bitcoin Hyper jumps into the picture. It introduces the world's first-ever Bitcoin Layer 2 solution allowing investors to transfer their BTC tokens from one wallet to another instantly. It does so by bypassing Bitcoin's outdated blockchain and harnessing the power of the Solana Virtual Machine that can handle up to 700,000 transactions per second. Moreover, it comes with minimal fees, making BTC trading available to the average investor.\nThe implications of this type of Bitcoin transactions are massive. BTC Hyper will attract millions of new holders to Bitcoin, allowing them to use their tokens to pay for everyday goods and services instantly. Considering that the native $HYPER tokens are used to cover the fees, Bitcoin Hyper secures long-term sustainability and growth potential. It will change the way we use BTC tokens forever and that's something you don't want to miss.\nVisit the official Bitcoin Hyper website today, secure your tokens early, and secure another of positive Solana price predictions in the future.\nThe Bitcoin Hyper presale has been one of the most sought-after crypto ICOs in the past few months. It raised over $24.3 million to date, and the number of investors is in a steady increase still. If you invest before $HYPER tokens go live, you have the exclusive option to stake them and earn an APY of 49% over the next two years.\nThe latest"

Compared to existing SPL architecture, it might reduce resource usage by 200x.\n98% less resource usage: Meet SIMD-0266: Efficient Token Program upgrade\nSIMD-0266: Efficient Token Program, one of the most crucial Solana improvement proposals of 2025, is expected to be a breakthrough in the efficiency of token creation on Solana SOLUSD. As explained by Anza, Solana's infrastructure company and proposal author, the compute resources economy might reach 98%.\nAnza@anza_xyzOct 20, 20251/ SIMD-0266: Efficient Token Program, authored by @0x_febo, propose replacing the current SPL token program with a new compute optimized version called p-token. The upgrade will reduce Token program CU usage by up to 98%. Here\u2019s how it works \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/5ASETDEYqu\nCurrently, 10% of block compute units are spent on token program instructions. Designed to replace the SPL standard, p-token will free nearly 12% of block space for other transactions, which, in turn, will enlarge Solana's effective transaction throughput.\nNamely, new types of instructions will be added to handle more complex DeFi structures, saving the blockchain compute unit spending:\nNew instructions like Batch and UnwrapLamports further reduce compute for common DeFi patterns, allowing multiple token ops per CPI and removing the need for temporary native accounts. Programs can now execute complex flows far more efficiently.\nEquipped with 100% backward compatibility, p-token introduction will be a drop-in upgrade: no changes will be expected for existing SPL tokens.\nThis, in turn, will pave the way for bigger resource allocations for new blocks, with a faster and better performing Solana SOLUSD as the endgame goal.\nSolana SOLUSD up for crucial Alpenglow upgrade in early 2026\nSolana SOLUSD community enthusiasts are welcoming the new design, highlighting that it will unlock previously unseen opportunities for decentralized finance here.\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Solana SOLUSD is incing closer to its Alpenglow upgrade. Slated for early 2026, it is set to retire proof of history and replace it with a more efficient consensus scheme.\nThe security, performance and speed of Solana SOLUSD blockchain will experience a massive boost."

                "body": "Dow heads higher thanks to upbeat earnings at 3M, GM, and Coca-Cola, even as most sectors stumbled and the government shutdown drags on.\nabout 8 hours ago \u2022 2 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average set a fresh record at 46,924.7, with upbeat earnings from 3M, General Motors, and Coca-Cola boosting Wall Street \u2013 even as much of the broader market slipped and a government shutdown stretched into its third week.\nWhat does this mean?\nInvestors focused on earnings reports, helping the Dow notch its third straight gain, while the S&P 500 basically treaded water and the Nasdaq edged down 0.2%. 3M led the charge, beating expectations and hiking its profit targets, which sent its shares up nearly 8%. General Motors surged 15% after outpacing estimates and dialing down tariff cost concerns, and Coca-Cola got a lift from strong sales. There were outliers too: Warner Bros. Discovery jumped double digits on talk of a sale and a price hike for streaming. Not all parts of the market kept pace \u2013 utilities lagged, but consumer stocks held steady. Meanwhile, import tariffs proved less harmful to company margins than expected, and hopes are growing for looser Federal Reserve policy and improved US-China trade dynamics. Commodity markets reacted too, with gold and silver falling as the dollar climbed, Treasury yields dipped, and oil prices stayed calm, all while political drama and new international minerals agreements kept markets on edge.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Earnings keep Wall Street shining.\nStrong showings from blue-chip heavyweights like 3M, GM, and Coca-Cola powered the Dow right through market choppiness and a stalled Washington, spotlighting how fundamentals can drive the major indices higher. Even with political gridlock and mixed sector performance, investors are prioritizing solid earnings and potential rate cuts, fueling cautious optimism as volatility hangs around.\nThe bigger picture: Trade, tariffs, and shifting alliances matter.\nRecent minerals deals and changing tariff policies are reshaping the backdrop for global business. The US-Australia $3 billion minerals pact signals a push to limit China\u2019s influence as hefty new tariffs on Chinese goods loom. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the diplomatic tug-of-war between President Trump and President Xi, since their next moves could send ripples through global supply chains and keep uncertainty flashing in markets worldwide.\nThis isn\u2019t a riddle: it\u2019s financial sense. A savings account might seem sensible \u2013 but unless its interest is keeping up with rising prices, you\u2019re losing purchasing power.\nOur analyst\u2019s free guide can help you decide what to do instead.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nResearch\nRussell Burns \u2022 about 14 hours ago\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 17 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

It was up at almost $4,380 per oz last night, and has plunged over $200 or 5.9%.\nAt $4,122 now, it's only wiped off the gains in the past week, but that's stil the biggest one-day drop in five years.\nThis unwinding of the price, with silver also dropping even more sharply, down 7.8% is pretty abrupt.\nThere has been \"no single event that has caused today\u2019s sell off,\" says Kathleen Brooks at XTB.\n\"Instead it is most likely caused by a confluence of factors including stretched valuations and signs that US CPI, which will be released at the end of this week, could come in softer than expected.\"\nThe risk, she adds, is that the precious metals sell-off \"infects\" other asset classes, with gold and stocks having moved in tandem to both hit various record highs in recent months.\nEuropean and US stock indices are mixed, with the FTSE and DAX up 0.1%-0.2% and the Dow Jones also in the green.\nPrecious metals miners Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES), Hochschild Mining PLC (LSE:HOC, OTCQX:HCHDF) and Endeavour Mining PLC (LSE:EDV, TSX:EDV, OTCQX:EDVMF) are holding back the FTSE 100 and 250, with falls of between 10% and 15%.\n\"If this sell off continues then we could see the FSTE 100 come under pressure,\" Brooks says.\n\"If this is a prolonged sell off, then the FTSE 100 could be at risk, since Endeavour and Fresnillo have both risen by 270% and 130% respectively, so far this year. Thus, the focus will be on how far the gold price can fall.\"\n2.51pm: Wall Street mixed open\nA mixed open on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones up 31 points or less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 is just over fiove points to the bad, down less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq has started with a 0.25% decline.\nWorst is the small cap Russell 2000, which is down 0.6%, reversing some of its gains from the day before, when it was out in front.\nGeneral Motors and Warner Bros Discovery are both up over 10%, as the top of the S&P leaderboard.\nWBD has launched a strategic review in light of recent takeover interest, with chief executive David Zaslav seeking to fend off 'unsolicited' takeover interest.\n1.42pm: Tax expert wants corporate tax cuts\nSome doubts have been cast over Rachel Reeves' plan to apparently save businesses \u00a36 billion by scrapping paperwork \"dressed up as an economic growth plan\".\nMark Tan, partner at law firm Spencer West, says: \"Businesses aren\u2019t held back by forms - they\u2019re held back by short-term policy swings and the absence of a coherent tax and investment framework.\"\nHe says other states are competing by \"creating a competitive tax environment for investment and growth\", but the UK \"seems to believe that growth will come from rewriting its reporting templates\".\n1.22pm: A bonfire of SME red tape\nRachel Reeves says she will scrap \"needless form-filling\" for businesses, helping firms save almost \u00a36 billion a year by the end of the parliamentary term.\nThe Chancellor has been speaking at a regional investment summit in Birmingham, while the Treasury has announced that the \"blitz on business bureaucracy\" will include reforms to the company merger proc"

That upbeat mood stuck around, even as the US floated potential 100% tariffs on Chinese imports starting in November. Meanwhile, European investors are waiting on clues from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde\u2019s speech in Oslo about the direction of interest rates. Daiwa Capital Markets expects those rates to hold steady through 2026, and with a major ECB meeting right around the corner, investors are keeping their ears open for hints. Plus, economic activity is front and center, with German, French, and eurozone PMI readings for October about to give the first read on how businesses are faring across the region.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Trade moves and policy signals are setting the pace.\nHopes for US-China trade breakthroughs are helping calm investors after rocky weeks, but looming tariff threats still hang over the market. Stable ECB rates are keeping eurozone stocks and the euro on more even ground. Big names like MTU Aero Engines jumped 4.96% on fresh partnership news, while Airbus saw steady gains. Tech and defense stocks are also in favor, with secunet Security Networks rallying 8.48% thanks to growing government demand and increased digitalization budgets.\nThe bigger picture: Data and central banks guide the long view.\nUpcoming German, French, and eurozone PMI releases will shape expectations for economic momentum as investors hunt for signs of renewed growth. At the same time, the ECB\u2019s stance on rates is anchoring market expectations throughout Europe. With analysts forecasting little change in policy and governments upping defense and tech budgets, some longer-term stability might be on offer after months of geopolitically driven swings.\nSo, we thought it was only right to bring 21shares into our Modern Investor Summit.

Despite previously criticizing the Social Democratic party he had to build a coalition with them to rule the country.

A potential breakout to the upside might happen if the positive risk sentiment continues. The German DAX also looks set to push higher and also got a boost during yesterday\u2019s trading.

                "body": "Stock market today: Dow jumps 200 points to record high as Wall Street cheers start of earnings season\nThe Dow closed at a fresh record on Tuesday as Wall Street welcomed the latest wave of quarterly results from the likes of General Motors (GM) and Coca-Cola (KO).\nGains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lifted the blue-chip benchmark 0.5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed the session little changed, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped roughly 0.1%.\n(^DJI)\nInvestors are focused on the flood of major earnings reports due this week, headlined on Tuesday by streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) and GM. The Big Three automaker's stock surged after GM raised its full-year profit outlook. Meanwhile, shares in Dow components Coca-Cola (KO) and 3M (MMM) popped after upbeat earnings reports.\nLater, investors will watch Netflix's results after market close for insights into its ad business and live programming. The streaming giant has recently weathered a volatile stretch for its stock.\nWorries about US-China trade tensions moved to the back burner even as the two countries prepared the ground for negotiations to resume. Trump signed a rare earths deal with Australia, a move aimed squarely at China. But the president said he expects to reach a \u201cfair deal\u201d when he meets his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, in South Korea next week.\nMeanwhile, the government shutdown continues, now the third-longest federal work stoppage in US history. There are no plans in motion to end the closure, even as economic pressures mount.\nThat puts the spotlight on Federal Reserve speakers, with ears pricked for clues into the central bank's thinking on interest rates ahead of its policy meeting next week.\nFed Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled to appear on Tuesday in the run-up to the Bureau of Labor Statistics finally releasing the September Consumer Price Index report on Friday. That inflation data could move the needle for markets, which are currently pricing in another quarter-point rate cut.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 23 updates"

                "body": "CHARLOTTE\u2014 There are several reasons Andy Dalton and Xavier Legette seem to have a chemistry that just pops off the field.\nSome of it is all the work the two put in together last offseason, ahead of Legette's rookie year. Some of it is the growth Legette experienced during the time Dalton was starting last season. Some of it is just a matter of circumstance, and the plays that unfold when those two happen to be on the field together.\nDave Canales also has another theory, a new layer that could be added to the relationship.\n\"Maybe his history,\" Canales posed Monday of Dalton's time with the Cincinnati Bengals. \"A.J. Green, big bodies, throwing to those guys, he had a good group of receivers, tight ends in Cincinnati in his past, so maybe it's that comfort level, just seeing that big frame and just getting him a ball within his frame that he can do something with.\"\nFor what it's worth, during their time together in Cincy, Dalton and Green connected for 591 receptions for 8,772 yards and 61 touchdowns. Legette, in his young career, has pulled in 27 catches for 269 yards and three touchdowns in seven games with Dalton.\nSunday, in a 13-6 win against the New York Jets, Dalton came in at the beginning of the fourth-quarter after Bryce Young exited with an ankle injury. Dalton's first pass was to Legette. By the end of the game, Dalton had gone 4-of-7 for 60 yards. All of his completions were to Legette. It helped bring Legette a career day. Between the passes (and touchdown) he caught from Young, and his production with Dalton, the second-year receiver finished with nine receptions for 92 yards\u2014both career highs\u2014and the score.\n\"One thing, I feel like you just got to give him a chance to make some plays,\" Dalton said of Legette on Sunday. \"And I think he showed today he's been making plays obviously than early on in the season. We're giving him more opportunities as well.\n\"So when you get those chances, give him one-on-one. I mean, he's physically\u2014there's not very many people like him with his size and strength and everything that he can do and we haven't seen the best of X yet and he's just going to keep getting better.\"\nLegette's previous career highs were six receptions for 66 yards and his first career touchdown against the Bengals in Week 4 of his rookie season, also with Dalton throwing him the ball.\n\"I mean, Andy's a good quarterback,\" said Legette. \"He finds me, so I'm going to keep it with that right there.\"\nNo rep between the duo on Sunday was more important than the final pass of the game. Facing third-and-8 from their own 45-yard line with 1:36 remaining, the Panthers needed a first down to effectively end the game and walk out of MetLife Stadium with a win. When the offense received the play call in the huddle, Legette wasn't 100 percent sure the ball would come to him\u2026but he had a feeling.\n\"When they call the play, I mean I don't know who he's going to throw it to,\" shared Legette. \"I kind of had a feeling he was going to throw it to me, so I was prepared just in case if he did and he did and I was able to make the play.\"\nThe conversion, not only an impressive catch, moved the chains and allowed the Panthers to kneel out the rest of the clock.\n\"I think just in that situation, they brought a pressure and we had him one-on-one,\" explained Dalton. \"I told him right before that last drive, 'Hey you're going to make a play that's going to help us win this game.' So, in that moment, I gave him the opportunity and he made a great play and we were able to seal it at the end.\"\nAs for Legette's career day, the receiver isn't putting much heed behind the numbers. To his mind, there haven't been enough big days to celebrate this one yet.\n\"No, no,\" Legette shook his head when asked if he celebrated the accomplishment. \"I want to stack more games like that. I don't want to get too high and I ain't going to be too low about it either. I mean, I want to keep it even.\"\nThere is a chance Dalton plays on Sunday against the Bills. The Panth"

Well, I'm not happy with where we are right now, and I'm determined to get it fixed.\"\nBeamer, 48, is 32-26 at South Carolina, which gave him his first head coaching opportunity. He had AP Top 25 finishes in 2022 and 2024.\nBeamer played long snapper and wide receiver at Virginia Tech from 1995 to 1999, while Frank coached there. He also served as a Hokies assistant under Frank Beamer from 2011 to 2015, after four years as a South Carolina assistant.\nVirginia Tech is looking for a coach after firing Brent Pry on Sept. 14. In January, Beamer received a new contract with South Carolina that runs through the 2030 season.\n\"I've conveyed many times how much I want to be here,\" Beamer said. \"This is my dream job. I said that when I came here. Nothing has changed. I am pissed off at the way we are performing right now, and it's not acceptable.\"\nThe Gamecocks host No. 4 Alabama this week."

Still, the wider Topix index rose 0.3%, showing strength outside the headline-grabbing sectors. Transport equipment stocks stood out: Toyota climbed 3%, helped by a sharply weaker yen that made exports more valuable. Automaker optimism was turbocharged by General Motors raising its profit outlook, boosting GM shares in the US and lifting sentiment for carmakers globally. Meanwhile, Sanae Takaichi\u2019s appointment as Japan\u2019s first female prime minister has fueled optimism about potential pro-growth policies, drawing increased attention to Japanese markets. But analysts note that uncertainty around US-Japan and US-China trade relations could keep the Nikkei in check and drive more short-term profit-taking, while the bond market remains stable for now.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Automakers ride the currency wave.\nWhile tech shares have slowed the Nikkei\u2019s momentum, automakers like Toyota have outperformed as the weaker yen boosts their international earnings. Investors are shifting focus to sectors that benefit from these currency moves and a strong global auto market, pointing to where potential value may appear if the Nikkei keeps consolidating.\nThe bigger picture: Japan\u2019s policy pivot gains traction.\nSanae Takaichi\u2019s historic rise is spotlighting Japan's potential for policy shifts that appeal to international investors. As global markets look for alternatives to the US and Europe, Japan\u2019s pro-growth signals and reform prospects are drawing new interest, even as trade policy uncertainty lingers in the background.\nSo, we thought it was only right to bring 21shares into our Modern Investor Summit.

                "body": "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is expected to continue Abenomics and announce economic stimulus measures, officially took office, sparking expectations for \"Takaichinomics\" and driving the yen to a weaker position (higher exchange rate).\nOn the afternoon of the 22nd, the yen-dollar exchange rate hovered in the high 151 won range. The previous night, the yen briefly fell to its lowest level in a week, surpassing 152 yen against the dollar.\nAt the same time, the Nikkei Average was trading around 49,300. The Nikkei surged over 3% on the 19th, breaking its all-time high for the first time in ten days as the \"Takaichi trade\"\u2014reflecting expectations for expanded fiscal policy\u2014resumed.\nThe dollar index, which measures the dollar\u2019s value against six major currencies, briefly rose to 98.98, its highest level in six days, driven by the yen\u2019s weakness. On the same day, the won-dollar exchange rate opened at 1,431.5 won, up 3.7 won from the previous day, before falling to the 1,429 won range in the afternoon.\nHowever, forecasts suggest the yen\u2019s weakening trend may ease after Prime Minister Takaichi appointed Satsuki Katayama, who advocates for a \"stronger yen,\" as the next finance minister. According to Reuters, Finance Minister Katayama stated, \"Considering Japan\u2019s economy, the yen\u2019s actual value is closer to 120\u2013130 yen per dollar.\"\nThis implies the yen needs to appreciate by 13\u201315% from its current level in the 150 yen range. The key question is how much Prime Minister Takaichi will accept Finance Minister Katayama\u2019s stance on a stronger yen.\nTakuji Aida, a senior economist at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Japan and known as an economic advisor to Prime Minister Takaichi, mentioned, \"The defeatist idea that a weaker yen is bad is a critical error. The yen\u2019s weakness is positively impacting Japan\u2019s economy by aligning with rising stock prices and expanding investor confidence.\"\nJane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank, said, \"If Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi fails to meet market expectations for accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, the yen could rebound. She likely does not want to be perceived as pursuing a weak-yen policy.\"\nThe Bank of Japan will hold a monetary policy meeting on the 29th\u201330th to decide on interest rate direction. The central bank ended its 17-year negative interest rate era in March of last year by raising rates."
