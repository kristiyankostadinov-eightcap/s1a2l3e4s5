                "body": "With doubts over near-term U.S. growth and inflationary pressures likely not going away anytime soon, demand is on the rise for products that may help investors ride out potential volatility.\nOne solution advisors frequently turn to in the face of rising inflation is gold. The precious metal has long served as a vehicle for weathering the risks of inflation for a multitude of factors. Not only does gold function well as a store of value, but its limited supply and lower currency correlation helps the precious metal retain its luster regardless of how the economy is performing.\nThat said, gold is not the only investment choice that looks to offer a store of value, limited supply, and low currency correlation. All of these factors are present within bitcoin as well, which has ignited a years-long debate over whether folks should be looking to gold or bitcoin during periods of inflationary risk.\nBoth gold and bitcoin can certainly perform well as an inflationary hedge, but there are differences between the two, especially regarding long-term growth potential and volatility. In fact, these differences could actually help highlight the advantages of pairing gold and bitcoin. By allocating into both gold and bitcoin, investors can tap into the perks of both investments while diversifying into two distinct hedges against potential inflation.\nHow CBXY Operates as an Inflation Hedge\nThe Calamos Bitcoin 90 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF \u2013 July (CBXY ) can help investors gain bitcoin access through the versatile ETF wrapper. CBXY uses an options strategy to gain access to bitcoin\u2019s price performance, up to a predetermined upside cap. When the fund launched in July, that cap began at around 24%.\nMeanwhile, a key advantage of CBXY comes through its promise of downside security. Investors that pay its fees and expenses have their overall loss limited to 10% over the fund\u2019s outcome period, regardless of how far bitcoin may be in the negative. Given how drastic bitcoin drawdowns can be at times, this level of risk control can be valuable. This is especially true when employing bitcoin as an inflation hedge.\nThis strategy gives CBXY a good use case as a complementary piece for a gold strategy within an advisor\u2019s portfolio. The fund may help investors hedge against inflation while offering volatility-adverse bitcoin growth, giving it extra value as a risk management tool. When slotted in with a gold strategy, advisors and investors may benefit from two distinct inflation hedges, with each hedge bringing their own distinct strengths to the table.\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Content Hub.\nDisclosure Information\nBefore investing, carefully consider a Fund\u2019s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

In this quarterly update, we review petroleum markets price developments in 3Q25, covering crude oil prices and refinery margins.\nCrude oil prices\nThe Brent crude oil price traded in a narrow range in 3Q25 as expected increased production from OPEC countries offset geopolitical tensions. The Brent price began the quarter averaging $70/b in July, following the Israel-Iran 12-day war at the end of 2Q25, before declining to an average of $67/b in August and $68/b in September.\nOPEC+ announcements in July, August, and September to increase production put downward pressure on crude oil prices. Uncertainty related to global trade flows and potential macroeconomic impacts on petroleum consumption have also increased concerns of an oversupplied market. However, so far in 3Q25, increases to global crude oil supplies have not contributed to widespread increases in observable inventories. According to our Weekly Petroleum Status Report, U.S. crude oil inventories have remained closer to the five-year (2020\u201324) low than the five-year average.\nIncreased geopolitical risk offset downward price pressure from increased supply. In 3Q25, Russia increased attacks on Ukraine, and Ukraine successfully targeted Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure. In August, the United States levied a 25% punitive tariff on India for purchasing Russia\u2019s crude oil, raising total U.S. tariffs on the country to 50%. The European Union is planning additional punitive measures against processors of Russia\u2019s crude oil following Russia\u2019s military flights over Estonia, Poland, and Romania. In the Middle East, drone attacks by unknown saboteurs on oil fields in Iraq have contributed to rising regional risks as well. This tension comes alongside ongoing risks associated with continued military strikes between Israel and Hamas.\nRefinery margins\nDiesel crack spreads\u2014a measure of the refinery margins for diesel\u2014at New York Harbor reached a high of 85 cents per gallon (gal) in July, its highest level since February 2024 and almost double the crack spread from the same time last year. This rise was partly in response to elevated pressure from international markets as geopolitical tensions threatened supplies from Middle East refiners. These pressures eased going into August, and diesel crack spreads fell as low as 60 cents/gal, dropping below the previous five-year (2020\u201324) average. Diesel crack spreads began to climb slowly again in September. This climb partly reflects renewed international pressure on distillate markets following disruptions to Russia\u2019s distillate production and a Russian ban on diesel exports following attacks on its refineries.\nUnlike distillate, refinery margins for gasoline began the quarter below the previous five-year (2020\u201324) average because of relatively high inventories on the East and West Coasts in July and early August. U.S. refinery margins for gasoline tend to decrease toward the end of summer, partly because of the shift from summer grade gasoline, which is more expensive to produce, to winter grade gasoline. This year, refinery margins decreased less than usual during the third quarter because of above-average motor gasoline inventory draws, bringing inventories below 2024 levels. In early September, gasoline crack spreads were more than double their level from the same time last year. As a result, the gasoline refinery margin exceeded its five-year average in mid-August for the first time since last April.\nPrincipal contributors: Petroleum & Liquid Fuels Markets Team\nTags: crude oil, oil/petroleum, liquid fuels, prices, refineries, international"

                "body": "Oil prices have risen at the start of the week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC +) once again delivered what I would call a strategic under-delivery of the expected output hike.\nOPEC+ announced a modest production increase following their recent meeting, agreeing to raise output by 137,000 barrels per day (bpd).\nSource: LSEG\nWhat Does the OPEC + Decision Tell Us?\nThe rise in production may be a signal that OPEC + cares more about keeping supply tight than grabbing extra market share or making oil cheaper for buyers.\nI for one had been of the school of thought that the increases were partly down to a desire by the group to gain more market share. However, I am beginning to doubt my own narrative.\nA bump of about 137,000 barrels per day may seem almost nothing in a world that moves millions, yet it holds some psychological weight.\nIt may be read as a small give\u2011in to political and market pressure while therefore holding members to a disciplined output plan.\nBy choosing a lift below what many expected, OPEC+ probably tried to dodge a sudden plunge a supply surge could cause.\nMoreover, this defensive stance suggests a stable price floor remains especially crucial for budget health for the member economies.\nDecoding the Price Action: A Rally Based on Relief, Not Demand Strength\nBrent crude settled a little above the $65 per barrel line, around $65.30, a level many traders watch as a mental barrier. This jump in price is similar to the one we saw after the last OPEC + meeting, but more from a sigh of relief in the market.\nMarket participants' worries about a \u201cbig rise\u201d in supply appear to have eased after the group announced its output decision. The less than expected output increase may have led some to cover short exposure to Oil prices which could in part be behind the rally. The rally was nonetheless welcomed after last week's 8% decline.\nNavigating a Potential Structural Surplus Moving Forward\nWhile OPEC+ successfully managed short-term price volatility, the longer-term outlook remains shadowed by significant structural bearishness. Market sentiment continues to be fundamentally weighed down by \"ongoing concerns about oversupply projected into 2026\".\nThat worry comes mostly from big rises in non\u2011OPEC output, like the surge in US shale rigs in Texas and new offshore wells off Brazil. Those sources sit outside the cartel\u2019s cap system, so OPEC+ ends up fighting a tactical cut war while the rest of the world keeps adding barrels.\nThe International Energy Agency tossed out a figure that a record surplus could show up in 2026. If that number sticks, it backs the idea that growth in oil production will beat demand.\nPrices have slipped year\u2011to\u2011date, and a bigger surplus could push them even lower. That would leave OPEC+ with little room to breathe. They may need to carve deep cuts, hurting their own members, to stop prices from falling below the target zones. Yet, some claim a softer approach, hoping demand\u2011side shifts could balance things out.\nTechnical Analysis - Brent Crude\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, Brent Crude is back above the $65/barrel mark with upside likely to remain limited.\nThere is a host of hurdles just ahead of current price with the 20,50 and 100-day MAs all resting between the 66.71 and 67.58 handle.\nThis confluence zone may prove a tough nut to crack and may cap any attempt at a move higher for Oil prices.\nLooking at the downside, immediate support below the 65.00 handle may be found at the swing low printed on May 30 which rests at 62.60.\nBelow that, the next key point of interest will be the psychological 60.00 mark which could offer support should price reach those levels.\nBrent Crude Oil Daily Chart, October 6, 2025\nSource: TradingView (click to enlarge)\nFollow Zain on Twitter/X for Additional Market News and Insights @zvawda\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiarie"

The group also indicates that adjustments to production could be halted or reversed if circumstances warrant.\nBy end-September 2025, OPEC+ had fully phased out the 2.2 million b/d voluntary production cuts introduced in late 2023, completing the process months earlier than initially signaled. They also confirmed their intention to fully compensate for any overproduced volume since January 2024. The next meeting will be hold on Nov. 2.\n\"The market was expecting a somewhat larger increase from OPEC+ as shown in the structure last week. However, the modest 137,000 b/d bloats the already-oversupplied balance for the fourth quarter of 2025 and 2026,\" said Janiv Shah, an analyst at Rystad Energy.\nGlobal crude oil markets are experiencing a significant bearish trend, with ICE Brent prices dropping from last week's peak of $70/bbl to $65/bbl on Oct. 5, following OPEC's announcement to increase production.\nRystad Energy forecasts that under these circumstances, price dynamics will likely shift substantially downward. It is unlikely that ICE Brent will remain above $60-65/bbl in 2026 unless OPEC+ alters its approach or sanctions on Russia and Iran drastically curtail exports from those countries."

                "body": "EUR/USD (Euro/US Dollar) Under Pressure as Political Instability and Fed Policy Bets Shape Direction\nThe EUR/USD pair traded near 1.1707 in the late European session, maintaining its weakest level in over a month as simultaneous fiscal and political crises grip both sides of the Atlantic. The euro\u2019s failure to sustain momentum above 1.1750 reflects a fragile equilibrium between European political risk and U.S. monetary uncertainty. The market continues to digest the French Prime Minister\u2019s resignation, deepening Eurozone instability just as the U.S. government shutdown enters its fifth day, halting key data releases and undermining investor confidence in fiscal governance.\nDollar Stability Caps Euro Recovery Despite Fed Rate-Cut Odds at 95%\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) traded marginally higher around 98.05, supported by cautious sentiment but capped by growing expectations of a 25-basis-point Federal Reserve rate cut at the October 29 meeting, with an additional 83% probability of another cut in December. Fed policymakers remain divided: Governor Stephen Miran has urged deeper cuts to counter economic slowdown, while Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan warns of persistent inflationary risks in non-housing services. This divergence leaves traders hesitant to aggressively short the dollar, limiting upside for the euro. As liquidity dries up amid the shutdown, the dollar\u2019s role as a global reserve hedge has slowed the pair\u2019s rebound, even as yields flatten across the Treasury curve.\nEurozone Political Volatility Erodes Confidence in the Common Currency\nIn Europe, politics have turned into a headwind for the euro. S\u00e9bastien Lecornu\u2019s resignation as French Prime Minister triggered a 1.36% drop in the CAC 40, widening the French-German 10-year yield spread to its highest since 2020. The development reignited fears of political fragmentation within the Eurozone, with investors shifting to U.S. assets despite the American fiscal crisis. Meanwhile, ECB policymaker Martins Kazaks described current interest rates as \u201cvery appropriate,\u201d signaling the central bank\u2019s reluctance to alter policy in response to short-term volatility. The ECB\u2019s cautious stance has given the euro some stability but not enough to counter systemic risk from France\u2019s turmoil and uneven growth in Germany and Italy.\nMacro Fundamentals Weaken but ECB Stability Prevents Sharp Sell-Off\nRecent data underscores a slow but uneven Eurozone recovery. Retail sales rose 1.0% year-on-year in August, down from 2.1% in July, showing reduced household spending momentum. The Sentix Investor Confidence Index is expected to remain negative, reinforcing a cautious outlook for Q4 growth. On the inflation front, ECB minutes reveal a preference for maintaining current policy until clear evidence of demand weakness emerges. This policy stability contrasts sharply with the Fed\u2019s dovish pivot, explaining the euro\u2019s relative steadiness despite heavy downside pressure.\nTechnical Structure: Euro Trapped Between 1.1660 Support and 1.1740 Resistance\nTechnically, the EUR/USD pair is trapped within a narrowing range. After failing to hold above the 50-day SMA (1.1734) and 100-day SMA (1.1733), the pair broke below its ascending trendline at 1.1693, confirming a short-term bearish bias. The RSI near 42 highlights fading bullish momentum, while the oversold threshold near 27 on the hourly chart suggests potential for mild rebound attempts. Key support rests at 1.1660, followed by 1.1640 and 1.1600, where the 200-day SMA (1.1615) sits as the next critical floor. If this level gives way, bearish extensions could target the 1.1570\u20131.1550 zone. On the upside, resistance lies at 1.1720, with a confirmed breakout above 1.1742 required to regain bullish traction toward 1.1810 and the psychological 1.1900 target.\nGovernment Shutdown Extends U.S. Fiscal Uncertainty, Limiting Dollar\u2019s Upside\nThe ongoing U.S. government shutdown, now in its fifth day, continues to disrupt economic visibility.

The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in a 94% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and an 84% possibility of another reduction in December.\nThe US government shutdown has postponed the key economic data release, including September\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report. US ADP Employment Change and Job Openings data indicate a softening labor market and strengthen expectations of an imminent rate cut.\nThe White House backed off US President Donald Trump\u2019s claim on Monday that government employees were already being laid off due to the shutdown but cautioned that job losses could occur as the impasse appeared likely to extend into a seventh day. Meanwhile, the Republican-led Senate rejected competing funding measures for federal agencies for the fifth time. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer also refuted Trump\u2019s assertion that negotiations with Democrats were still taking place.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar.\nQuantitative ti"

                "body": "Global Risk Aversion Intensifies as Europe\u2019s Political Instability Deepens\nPolitical turbulence across Europe has further fueled flows into the dollar. The resignation of France\u2019s Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu and widening French-German bond yield spreads have intensified fears of fiscal fragmentation within the eurozone. The 10-year French OAT yield climbed to 3.48%, the highest since 2012, pulling the euro down toward 1.1660 and indirectly weighing on the pound via correlated risk sentiment. In this context, the GBP/USD pair is trading as a proxy for broader transatlantic confidence, reflecting a battle between U.S. fiscal uncertainty and Europe\u2019s political deterioration. While the euro\u2019s collapse has partially cushioned sterling, both currencies remain vulnerable against the dollar, which benefits from global capital flight and defensive positioning ahead of key Fed communications later this week.\nTechnical Setup Shows GBP/USD Confined in Bearish Channel Below 1.3500\nTechnically, GBP/USD is consolidating within a descending channel, oscillating between 1.3400 and 1.3500, with momentum indicators still skewed to the downside. The 100-day simple moving average (SMA) sits at 1.3495, acting as a key ceiling, while the 20-day SMA near 1.3500 reinforces that resistance zone. Bulls would need a decisive daily close above 1.3500 to confirm any short-term recovery, targeting 1.3585\u20131.3600, followed by 1.3726, the September 17 high. On the downside, a break below 1.3400 exposes the September 25 swing low at 1.3324, with further downside risk toward 1.3300, where Fibonacci retracement levels cluster. The Average True Range (ATR) currently measures 88 pips per day, consistent with its 90-day mean of 89 pips, highlighting a volatility equilibrium that suggests controlled, measured declines rather than disorderly drops.\nDollar Dynamics: Safe-Haven Strength Overrules Fed Dovishness\nThe contradiction of a firming dollar amid rising Fed cut expectations is explained by relative value. The dollar remains the world\u2019s deepest and most liquid refuge during fiscal or geopolitical turbulence. With the Japanese yen weakening sharply following Japan\u2019s leadership transition and the euro sliding due to France\u2019s instability, global investors have rotated back into USD-denominated assets. The DXY Index holding above 97.7 confirms that demand is driven more by global risk aversion than by domestic yield advantage. Fed officials, including Governor Schmid, reiterated that the central bank must \u201cmaintain inflation credibility,\u201d signaling reluctance to ease too aggressively despite the market\u2019s expectations. This hawkish undertone keeps Treasury yields anchored near 4.21% on the 10-year note, sustaining dollar appeal relative to its European counterparts.\nPound Crosses Reflect Broad Weakness Against Majors\nThe pound\u2019s softness is not confined to GBP/USD. Monthly heat map data show GBP up only 0.21% vs USD, 0.44% vs EUR, but down 1.68% vs JPY, highlighting uneven performance. Sterling remains 0.51% weaker against the New Zealand dollar and 0.16% softer against the Australian dollar, revealing that sentiment toward the UK currency has deteriorated globally, not just relative to the dollar. The uneven performance reflects how foreign investors perceive the UK as vulnerable to a stagflationary mix\u2014sluggish growth, sticky inflation, and high debt service costs.\nMarket Positioning and Forward Indicators Show Limited Upside Potential\nFutures data indicate that speculative traders hold a net short position of 18,400 GBP contracts, reflecting modest bearish conviction but not yet oversold conditions. Option skew has shifted slightly in favor of puts, with one-month risk reversals at -0.29, suggesting mild downside hedging but not panic. The pair\u2019s forward points remain flat, signaling that rate differentials have stabilized around current levels. The combination of neutral forward pricing and bearish technicals points to a grinding decline rather than a sharp br"

                "body": "As the Federal Reserve signals an aggressive path of interest rate cuts, driven by concerns over a softening U.S. economy, the British Pound to US Dollar (GBP/USD) exchange rate finds itself at a critical juncture. With the Bank of England (BoE) adopting a more measured approach to monetary policy, the divergence between the two central banks is creating significant ripples in global currency markets. This dynamic is setting the stage for potential volatility and strategic re-evaluations for investors and multinational corporations alike.\nThe immediate implications are palpable: while the U.S. Dollar (USD) has shown unexpected resilience on October 6, 2025, largely due to safe-haven flows amidst a U.S. government shutdown, the underlying sentiment points to a cautious outlook for Sterling. The Fed's anticipated easing cycle, which began with a 25 basis point cut in September 2025, is expected to continue with further reductions in October and December. This stark contrast to the Bank of England's current holding pattern, despite earlier cuts in 2025, is the primary driver influencing the GBP/USD pair, pushing it towards technical downtrends and raising downside risks for the Pound.\nThe Mechanics of Influence: How Fed Policy Reshapes GBP/USD\nThe intricate dance between central bank policies and currency valuations is on full display as the Federal Reserve's actions continue to dictate the trajectory of the British Pound to US Dollar (GBP/USD) exchange rate. The Fed wields its influence through several key mechanisms, primarily impacting interest rate differentials, employing quantitative easing (QE) or tightening (QT), providing forward guidance, shaping global risk sentiment, and managing inflation expectations.\nAt its core, interest rate differentials are a fundamental driver. When the Fed signals or implements rate cuts, it generally diminishes the attractiveness of USD-denominated assets compared to those in the UK, where the Bank of England (BoE) is currently holding rates steady. This divergence can lead to capital outflow from the U.S. and into the UK, strengthening the Pound against the Dollar. Conversely, a hawkish Fed stance would typically bolster the USD. Beyond direct rates, the Fed's balance sheet policies, such as QE (which injects liquidity and typically weakens the USD) or QT (which withdraws liquidity and strengthens the USD), also play a crucial role. Furthermore, the Fed's forward guidance\u2014its communication about future policy intentions\u2014is meticulously scrutinized by traders, acting as a compass for market expectations and reducing volatility. Finally, the dollar's role as a global safe-haven asset means that Fed policies impacting risk sentiment can trigger significant capital shifts, while its ability to manage inflation expectations directly affects the dollar's purchasing power.\nThe path to October 6, 2025, has been marked by a series of pivotal events. Throughout 2024, global economies grappled with inflation, leading to widespread monetary tightening. The GBP/USD saw significant fluctuations, with a high of 1.3434 in September and a low of 1.23 in April 2024. The narrative shifted dramatically in 2025, with the Bank of England initiating its easing cycle in March, followed by further cuts in June and August, bringing its benchmark rate to 4%. This aggressive easing by the BoE was initially met with a rally in GBP/USD during the first half of 2025, reaching a high of 1.3743 in July, largely fueled by a broader USD sell-off. However, the tide began to turn in September 2025 when the Federal Reserve, in a move largely anticipated by markets, delivered its first rate cut of the year, bringing the federal funds rate to 4.00%-4.25%. This \"risk management\" cut was driven by concerns over a weakening U.S. labor market, despite persistent inflation. Simultaneously, the Bank of England paused its cutting cycle in September, holding rates at 4% due to sticky UK inflation (CPI at 3.6% in August) and robust wage g"

Meanwhile, the Republican-led Senate rejected competing funding measures for federal agencies for the fifth time, per Reuters.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Bala"

                "body": "The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthens against the US Dollar (USD) after the TD-MI Inflation Gauge data shows a 0.4% rise in September, following a 0.3% decrease in the previous month. Annual inflation increased to 3% from 2.8%, suggesting challenges for the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) 2\u20133% target.\nThe RBA maintained its Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 3.6% in September, noting persistent inflation, particularly in market services, and a tight labour market. Traders anticipate further insights from RBA officials\u2019 speeches this week concerning the central bank\u2019s policy.\nUs Dollar Index And Potential Fed Rate Cuts\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading around 98.00; however, the likelihood of US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in October and December could affect its strength. A government shutdown adds to USD concerns, delaying economic reports like September\u2019s jobs data.\nUS private sector payrolls decreased by 32,000 in September, with a 4.5% annual pay growth. Job Openings slightly increased to 7.23 million in August, while hiring rates declined to 3.2%.\nAustralia\u2019s Trade Surplus reduced significantly to 1,825 million MoM in August, with exports down by 7.8%. The AUD/USD pair remains around 0.6610, with technical analysis indicating a bullish trend within an ascending channel.\nKey drivers for the AUD include RBA interest rates, Iron Ore prices, and the Chinese economy\u2019s performance. A stronger Chinese economy boosts Australian exports and AUD value, while Iron Ore prices significantly affect Australia\u2019s Trade Balance.\nThe RBA\u2019s interest rate policy, Iron Ore prices, and economic conditions in China play a pivotal role in determining the direction of the AUD.\nGiven the current divergence, we should position for potential Australian Dollar strength against a weakening US Dollar. Australian inflation is proving sticky, with the latest TD-MI gauge for September showing a 3.0% annual increase, right at the top of the RBA\u2019s target range. This puts pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia to maintain a hawkish stance, even after holding rates steady at 3.6% last month.\nIn contrast, the US Federal Reserve appears ready to start cutting interest rates, with markets pricing in a 95% chance of a cut later this month. This expectation is fueled by weak economic signals, such as the surprising decline of 32,000 private payrolls shown in the September ADP report. The ongoing US government shutdown only adds to this uncertainty, delaying key economic data and weighing on the dollar.\nSupporting The Aussie Dollar\nWe\u2019ve seen this pattern before, particularly in late 2019, when a slowdown in the US labor market preceded a series of Fed rate cuts. The current hiring rate, which has fallen to its lowest level since June 2024, mirrors that kind of slowdown. This historical context strengthens the case for anticipating a more dovish Fed in the coming weeks.\nSupporting the Aussie dollar, demand from China for key exports appears resilient for now. Recent customs data from China showed a slight uptick in iron ore imports, and prices for the commodity have remained firm above $115 per tonne. This helps to offset some of the concerns from Australia\u2019s recently narrowed trade surplus.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the AUD/USD pair remains in a clear ascending channel, suggesting the bullish trend is intact. The Relative Strength Index is above 50, supporting further upward movement. We should view the current level around 0.6610 as a potential entry point for bullish positions.\nFor derivative traders, this outlook favors buying AUD/USD call options with strike prices approaching the 12-month high of 0.6707. Alternatively, selling put options with a strike price below the immediate support level of 0.6600 could be a viable strategy to collect premium. These positions would profit from the expected rise in the currency pair based on monetary policy divergence.\nWe must also manage risk, as a sudden resolution to the US government shutdown or surprisingly s"

                "body": "USD/JPY Bulls On High Alert For Breakout As Japanese Yen Slumps\nUSD/JPY extended its rally on Monday as the Japanese yen sold off sharply amid political shifts in Tokyo. Traders reacted to reports that Sanae Takaichi \u2014 a pro-stimulus candidate and vocal critic of Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate hikes \u2014 is poised to become Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, triggering a broad yen decline and renewed interest in carry trades.\nView related analysis:\n- AUD/USD Q4 Outlook: Bears Target Slower Growth, RBA Cut\n- Gold Outlook: Rising Implied Volatility on Path to $4000\n- Australian Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, GBP/AUD\n- ASX 200 Morning Market Outlook: Bulls Hesitate Near Record Highs\nJapanese Yen Slumps As Takaichi\u2019s Stimulus Agenda Takes Centre Stage\nThe Japanese yen was sharply lower against its FX peers on Monday, as a dovish, pro-stimulus candidate took the lead to become Japan\u2019s next prime minister. Sanae Takaichi looks set to become Japan\u2019s first female PM and has been a vocal critic of Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate hikes. Odds of a near-term 25bp hike have fallen from around 68% to 41%, triggering a surge in Japan\u2019s bond market, weighing on yields and sending the yen lower across the board.\nHowever, an advisor close to Takaichi suggested she may still tolerate one more 25bp hike. An ex-BOJ official also noted recently that she might have limited influence over the central bank even if she does take office. While it remains up in the air whether her victory would spell the end of BOJ tightening or simply slow its pace, the news was enough to prompt many yen bulls to reassess their exposure.\nCommodity currencies took the lead as the carry trade sprang back into action, with AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY, and NZD/JPY all rising around 2% by Monday\u2019s close. USD/JPY climbed 1.9% to finish above 150, while GBP/JPY accelerated beyond 200 to a 15-month high. EUR/JPY now trades at its highest level since 1991, and both CHF/JPY and the Nikkei surged to record highs, marking their best day since April.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nJapanese Yen Futures Positioning (JPY/USD) \u2013 Weekly COT Report Analysis\nLast week\u2019s commitment of traders (COT) report shows that pre-emptive bulls were caught off guard. Net-long exposure for large speculators and asset managers rose by a combined 25.6k contracts on the week by Tuesday\u2019s close. The proportion of which came from the initiation of fresh bullish bets, with large specs increasing their gross-long exposure to the yen by 9% and asset managers by 8%, or a combined 22.5k contracts. Large specs also reduced gross-short exposure by -3.5% (-3.6k contracts).\nMany of these pre-emptive bulls may have covered their longs, and that see the yen face further selling pressure over the near term until we get greater clarity over Takaichi\u2019s sway over the BOJ and their ability to hike interest rates.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: CME, IMM, LSEG\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nThe 192-pip gap from Friday\u2019s close to Monday\u2019s open was the largest on the USD/JPY daily chart since May 1990, which incidentally was also a gap lower from similar levels around 150. Monday\u2019s 1.9% daily gain marked its strongest single-day performance in nine weeks and lifted USD/JPY to within 23 pips of the August high.\nThe surge has invalidated last week\u2019s bearish bias and has bullish breakout traders on high alert, though a sustained rally will likely depend on confirmation that Japan\u2019s incoming prime minister can influence the BOJ\u2019s hiking path.\nTraders will also eye Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls for clues on the Fed outlook \u2014 a weak print could reinforce expectations for back-to-back rate cuts in October and December. For now, however, dips appear likely to attract buyers, with focus on a retest of the 151.28 double-top high.\nA decisive break above that level would expose the weekly R3 pivot and the 152 handle over the near term.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nView"

                "body": "Asia stocks buoyed by tech gains, Japan at record high as rate hike bets unwind\nInvesting.com -- As traders hunt for a contrarian angle, BofA lays out out five fresh reasons why USD/JPY is set for a renewed rally even as consensus lines up on the other side.\n1. Bets on hawkish BoJ overdone vs Fed rate-cut bets\nThe pricing of more than 50% for a Bank of Japan rate hike at the October meeting is at risk \"given [Sanae] Takaichi\u2019s victory over the weekend.\" Sanae Takaichi, seen as a pro-growth and extending \u2019Abenomics,\u2019 is set to become the Japan\u2019s first female prime minister.\nThe risk for bets on a Fed rate cut could also be a risk \"if concern over the US labor market declines and the government shutdown ends...which would have a bigger impact on USD/JPY than a BoJ hike,\" BofA said.\n2. Cooling inflation could limit BoJ rate hikes\nBofA expects Japan\u2019s inflation to fall below 2% year-on-year in 2026 and remain subdued into 2027, complicating the BoJ\u2019s task of justifying hikes. Although BoJ tightening with inflation below 2% is possible, opposition voices could cite undershooting the price stability target. Takaichi, meanwhile, has expressed caution on inflation dynamics, emphasizing government-BoJ policy alignment and likely raising the bar for hikes in the near term.\n3. Modest tariff pass-through could benefit USD\nJapanese exporters have so far absorbed the cost of U.S. tariffs rather than passing them fully through to prices. This slower pass-through moderates inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy and benefits the dollar at Japanese exporters\u2019 expense, supporting USD/JPY further.\n4. US-Japan investment deal could boost demand for USD\nThe U.S. remains the largest destination for Japanese direct investment, a trend expected to accelerate under the new investment deal. BofA highlights that Japanese government-led funding initiatives and corporate participation may increase capital outflows, lifting dollar demand without direct FX market intervention.\n5. Position liquidity a key risk to JPY\nPosition liquidation risk remains a wild card. While markets often see the yen as a safe haven during stress, BofA notes that the strong short USD/long JPY positioning, though not extreme, could amplify dollar gains if there is a sudden unwind.\nWith inflation turning more subdued but political change raising uncertainty, BofA keeps a bullish tilt on USD/JPY into year-end, raising its forecast to 155 from 153. The key to the pair\u2019s path remains a delicate balance between BoJ caution and evolving U.S. economic conditions.\nWhich stocks should you consider in your very next trade?\nThe best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.\nThat's why smart investors use our Stock Screener with 50+ predefined screens and 160+ customizable filters to surface hidden gems instantly.\nFor example, the Piotroski's Picks method averages 23% annual returns by focusing on financial strength, and you can get it as a standalone screen.

The dollar gained over 300 pips from Friday\u2019s close after Sanae Takaichi\u2019s victory in Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election ignited expectations of prolonged monetary easing. Her policies, rooted in Abenomics-style stimulus, signal an era of aggressive fiscal expansion and delayed tightening from the Bank of Japan (BoJ).\nJapan\u2019s Political Transition Fuels Yen Weakness and \u201cTakaichi Trade\u201d Momentum\nThe political shift in Tokyo has redefined the yen\u2019s trajectory. Takaichi\u2019s stance against rate hikes suggests the BoJ could postpone normalization well into 2026, directly weakening the yen. Traders have dubbed the current move the \u201cTakaichi Trade\u201d \u2014 a dynamic play of a softer yen and rising Japanese equity benchmarks such as the Nikkei 225, which climbed nearly 1.7% following her win. With BoJ rate-hike bets for October fading rapidly, the yen\u2019s earlier safe-haven bid has eroded, sending the USD/JPY pair to levels not seen since late August.\nMarket data shows speculative long positions in USD/JPY climbing by 12% week-over-week, while Japanese Government Bond yields retreated to 0.68%, signaling reduced expectations of policy tightening. The pair\u2019s rally above 150.00 triggered intervention chatter from Tokyo officials, yet the Ministry of Finance remained silent \u2014 a decision interpreted by traders as tacit approval of further yen depreciation.\nU.S. Government Shutdown Deepens Dollar Uncertainty but Doesn\u2019t Stop Bulls\nWhile Japan\u2019s domestic policy backdrop clearly weakened the yen, the dollar\u2019s strength is more complex. In the U.S., the federal government shutdown entered its second week, with negotiations between Democrats and Republicans stalled and former President Trump warning of large-scale layoffs in public services. Normally such dysfunction would drag on the greenback, yet the dollar index (DXY) held near 95.46, supported by haven demand and Treasury yields stabilizing around 4.15%.\nHowever, sentiment toward the U.S. currency remains fragile. Traders anticipate the Federal Reserve could begin rate cuts by March 2026, pricing in roughly 75 bps of easing through next year. The divergence between the Fed\u2019s expected path and the BoJ\u2019s reluctance to act sustains the dollar\u2019s near-term dominance against the yen despite U.S. political paralysis.\nTechnical Structure: USD/JPY Targets 151.60 While RSI Flashes Overbought\nOn the charts, USD/JPY has extended more than 2% higher from the prior week\u2019s low at 146.54, building on a rebound from critical support defined by the March trough and the 38.2% retracement of the April advance. The pair\u2019s surge above the 50-day EMA at 149.30 confirms a breakout, with the next resistance seen at the 100% Fibonacci extension of the April rally near 150.88 and a more formidable ceiling at the 61.8% retracement of the yearly range at 151.62\u2013151.94.\nMomentum indicators remain stretched. The RSI hovers around 74, suggesting overbought conditions, while the MACD histogram shows fading upside acceleration \u2014 a hint that the pair could consolidate near current levels before attempting another leg higher. Short-term support lies at 148.65\u2013148.84, aligning with the December low and May high overlap. A daily close below 148.60 would neutralize the bullish bias, whereas sustained closes above 150.90 open the door to a test of 152.00 \u2014 a l"

                "body": "A new trading week begins, and USD/CAD shows an average variation of less than 0.1% in the short term amid growing indecision in the pair\u2019s movements. This situation is mainly due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which remains unresolved, leaving uncertainty about how much this event might start to affect the dollar\u2019s strength in the short term. In addition, the lack of key economic data releases is creating uncertainty for the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision-making process, which could eventually increase selling pressure on USD/CAD.\nWhere Does the Shutdown Stand?\nIt has now been six days since the U.S. government shutdown began, and there is still no concrete solution to this political impasse, which has started to generate market uncertainty. The White House and Congress have failed to reach an agreement to end the measure, and it is estimated that around 750,000 federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay.\nGiven this situation, concerns are growing that the shutdown could drag on too long, similar to the one that took place in 2018\u20132019, which lasted 34 days. If a similar scenario unfolds, the cost to the U.S. economy could reach $3 billion.\nAs a result, the market is starting to doubt the dollar\u2019s ability to maintain its strength. The DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s performance against a basket of currencies, is fluctuating around the 98-point level but without showing a consistent upward slope. On the contrary, the index has begun to reflect recurrent signs of indecision, suggesting that in the coming sessions, confidence in the dollar could weaken further.\nSource: MarketWatch\nIn conclusion, if the U.S. government fails to reach an agreement soon, this event could undermine confidence in the dollar, creating room for the Canadian dollar to stage a more sustained recovery and generate stronger selling pressure on USD/CAD in the short term.\nWhat\u2019s Happening with the Central Banks?\nBeyond the political uncertainty, the shutdown has prevented the release of key U.S. economic data, such as the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP), which were scheduled for Friday, October 3. This complicates the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to make concrete monetary policy decisions and keeps the likelihood high that the central bank will continue its rate-cutting cycle.\nAccording to the CME Group, the probability of a 0.25% rate cut at the October 29 meeting stands at 92.5%, while the probability for the December 10 meeting is 81.3%. This suggests that the Fed will likely maintain a low-rate outlook as long as no new economic data points to a change in direction.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nIn contrast, for the Bank of Canada, the path toward rate cuts is less clear. For the upcoming October decision, there is roughly a 55% probability that the bank will cut rates by 0.25%, while 45% of the market expects a neutral stance, meaning rates would remain unchanged.\nAs these dynamics between the two central banks evolve, they could become a key driver for USD/CAD movements. If the Federal Reserve maintains its low-rate policy amid limited data and the Bank of Canada refrains from following the same path in the short term, the interest rate differential between the two economies could continue narrowing. This would make U.S. dollar investments less attractive, allowing the Canadian dollar to strengthen further and exert downward pressure on USD/CAD in the coming sessions.\nUSD/CAD Technical Forecast\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend: Since late July, USD/CAD has maintained a steady upward trend, pushing prices toward the main resistance barrier at the 200-period simple moving average (SMA). The minor pullbacks seen so far are not strong enough to break the current bullish structure, although growing neutrality in price action could mark the beginning of a sideways range if buying momentum continues to fade.\n- RSI: The RSI line remains oscillating above the 50 level, showing that buying momentum has dominated the last 14 sessions.

                "body": "The GBP/JPY exchange rate rose to around 201.70 during Monday\u2019s early European session. This increase comes after Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party elected Sanae Takaichi, who is on course to become the country\u2019s first female Prime Minister.\nA shift in market perception has influenced traders, with reduced expectations for a Bank of Japan rate hike in October. Overnight index swaps now show a nearly 25% chance of a rate increase, down from 60% before the leadership vote.\nUK Labour Market Concerns\nThe UK labour market presents concerns that might limit the GBP/JPY\u2019s rise. The Bank of England\u2019s recent survey indicated firms\u2019 expectations for employment growth remained flat, marking a first since November 2020.\nThe Bank of Japan has historically influenced the Yen\u2019s value through its monetary policy. Policy divergence between Japan and the US primarily affects the Yen value, with a reduction in divergence since 2024 providing some support.\nThe Japanese Yen tends to appreciate during market stress due to its safe-haven status. This characteristic often leads to its strengthening against currencies perceived as riskier investments during turbulent times.\nThe victory of Sanae Takaichi in the LDP leadership election is causing significant weakness in the Japanese Yen. We see this as her policy stance is expected to oppose any further monetary tightening from the Bank of Japan. Consequently, the GBP/JPY cross has surged past 201.50, a level we have not seen since the summer of 2024.\nRate Hike Bets and Economic Indicators\nIn response, we have seen traders rapidly unwind bets on a Bank of Japan rate hike this month. Overnight index swaps show the probability of a 10-basis-point hike at the October 31st meeting has collapsed to below 25%, down from over 60% just last week. This repricing suggests options that profit from a weaker Yen, like long calls on GBP/JPY, are gaining popularity.\nHowever, any further upside for the cross could be limited by growing concerns about the UK labor market. The most recent data from the Office for National Statistics, released on September 15th, showed the UK unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.5%. This reinforces the view that the Bank of England will likely keep interest rates on hold for the remainder of 2025.\nThe current price action is reminiscent of the period in 2022-2023, where widening interest rate differentials were the primary driver of Yen weakness. The spread between the UK 10-year Gilt yield and the Japanese 10-year Government Bond has now expanded back to over 420 basis points. This differential makes holding Sterling more attractive than the Yen, supporting the cross.\nAs GBP/JPY approaches the key psychological resistance level of 202.00, we anticipate increased volatility. One-month implied volatility in the options market has risen to 9.8%, indicating that traders are positioning for larger price swings ahead of the formal parliamentary vote on October 15th. This suggests that strategies which can profit from significant price movement could be effective in the weeks ahead."

                "body": "GBP/JPY jumps to fresh year-to-date high as Yen weakens amid Japan's political shift\n|- GBP/JPY kicks off the week with a sharp gap up, hitting its highest level since July 2024 and setting a new year-to-date high.\n- The Japanese Yen weakens after Sanae Takaichi\u2019s LDP leadership victory, reinforcing expectations of a more dovish policy stance.\n- Sterling supported despite UK fiscal concerns, with markets awaiting BoE Governor Bailey\u2019s speech later Monday and FPC meeting minutes on Wednesday.\nThe British Pound (GBP) strengthens against the Japanese Yen (JPY) on Monday, opening the week with a sharp gap higher as the Yen weakens following Japan\u2019s political transition. At the time of writing, the cross is trading near 202.15, up almost 1.65% on the day, marking its highest level since July 2024 and setting a fresh year-to-date high.\nThe sharp move reflects renewed selling pressure on the Yen after Sanae Takaichi won the leadership contest of Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Saturday, positioning her to become the country\u2019s first female prime minister when parliament votes on October 15.\nThe shift in leadership has already rippled into expectations about monetary policy. Takaichi\u2019s policy stance is seen as dovish, favoring continued fiscal support and a cautious approach to tightening. According to a BHH report, the swaps market has slashed the probability of a Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike at its October 30 meeting from around 60% to just 25%.\nInvestors will be watching closely in the coming weeks for how Takaichi\u2019s new administration and BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda align on fiscal and monetary priorities. Reports suggest Takaichi may appoint a heavyweight political figure as Finance Minister to reassure markets about fiscal discipline. Analysts caution that if the BoJ does raise interest rates at its October meeting, the Yen\u2019s current weakness could prove short-lived.\nOn the United Kingdom (UK) side, Sterling\u2019s gains come despite lingering fiscal concerns ahead of the government\u2019s November budget and ongoing scrutiny of the country\u2019s debt outlook. The Bank of England (BoE) kept interest rates steady at its last meeting, with policymakers divided over the timing of future easing. All eyes will be on Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s speech later Monday, and on the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) meeting minutes due Wednesday, for clues about how the BoE plans to balance financial stability risks with future rate decisions.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoE's Governor Bailey speech\nAndrew Bailey is the Bank of England's Governor. He took office on March 16th, 2020, at the end of Mark Carney's term. Bailey was serving as the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority before being designated. This British central banker was also the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England from April 2013 to July 2016 and the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England from January 2004 until April 2011.\nRead more.Next release: Mon Oct 06, 2025 17:30\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: -\nPrevious: -\nSource: Bank of England\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) weakens against the Pound Sterling (GBP) as a ruling-party vote for Sanae Takaichi to become Japan\u2019s next Prime Minister.\nTakaichi was elected as the leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Takaichi would become the first female Prime Minister of Japan and is expected to oppose any further monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which weighs on the JPY. A vote in parliament to replace outgoing Shigeru Ishiba is scheduled on October 15.\n\u201cSanae Takaichi\u2019s surprise victory in the LDP leadership election marks an important turning point for Japan\u2019s policy and market outlook,\u201d Societe Generale strategists wrote in a note, pushing back the likely timing of the BOJ\u2019s next rate hike to December from October.\nTraders reduce their bets of a Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike at its October meeting. Overnight index swaps are currently priced in nearly a 25% odds of an increase, down from 60% odds before the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s (LDP) leadership vote.\nGrowing UK labor market concerns could create a headwind for the cross. Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) Decision Maker Panel (DMP) survey last week showed that firms' year-ahead expectations for employment came in flat in the three months to September. This is the first time since the quarter to November 2020, when companies didn't anticipate increasing their staff numbers. The UK central bank is likely to hold rates steady through the end of 2025, with potential cuts expected in 2026.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

Analysts say the price of Bitcoin today reflects its increasing role as a hedge against inflation and traditional market instability, attracting both retail and institutional investors.\nBitcoin Hits New Milestones Amid Macro Factors\nBitcoin (BTC) has surged past $125,000, marking fresh all-time highs as investors react to macroeconomic developments and growing institutional inflows. The rally has been supported by Bitcoin-linked ETFs and safe-haven buying amid the ongoing US government shutdown. Market watchers see this as a sign of BTC\u2019s increasing role as a hedge against traditional financial uncertainty.\nBTC jumps nearly 10% amid the US government shutdown, proving sometimes the worst events bring the best pump. Source: @TedPillows via X\n\u201cSometimes the worst events bring the best pump,\u201d said crypto analyst Ted Pillows, referencing Bitcoin\u2019s nearly 10% surge since October 1, 2025, following congressional failure to pass federal funding bills. The government shutdown, rather than hurting Bitcoin, triggered expectations of Federal Reserve policy easing, weakening the dollar and boosting the price of Bitcoin.\nHalving Cycle Spurs Long-Term Optimism\nBitcoin\u2019s strong performance also aligns with its historic four-year halving cycle, which reduces mining rewards and historically precedes bull runs. IBCIG noted, \u201cThe pattern hasn\u2019t changed, just the price. 2013 \u2192 2017 \u2192 2021 \u2192 2025. Halving. Rally.

Source: @ibcig via X\nPast cycles highlight this trend: after the 2012 halving, BTC rose to ~$1,150; after 2016, it peaked at ~$20,000; and post-2020, it reached ~$69,000. The 2024 halving has already pushed BTC from roughly $30,000 to $122,000, a +307% gain, indicating early momentum that could propel Bitcoin toward $150K if historical patterns and market conditions persist.\nInstitutional Inflows Drive the Rally\nThis rally differs from previous retail-driven booms because institutional investors are taking the lead. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $35 billion in inflows this year, with projections reaching $50 billion by mid-2025. Heavy allocations in funds like BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), including single-day inflows above $1.17 billion, demonstrate large-scale participation in BTC.\nInstitutional capital is amplifying the impact of traditional market uncertainty, providing stability to Bitcoin prices even during brief corrections. Analysts highlight that these inflows, coupled with ETF accessibility, have shifted Bitcoin from a speculative asset to a mainstream financial instrument.\nTechnical Analysis: Trend Holds Firm\nEven when there was a short-term correction later after some above-estimate US inflation readings, Bitcoin recovered lost ground shortly above $124K. Technical levels such as the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) held up well with firm support levels. Momentum indicators such as the stochastic oscillator suggest new buying pressure, and the uptrend is likely to continue.\nBTC forms a perfect descending triangle above a strong demand zone, signaling a potential volatility spike.

                "body": "In brief\n- Grayscale has added staking functionality to its two spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States.\n- It also added staking to its Solana Trust, which has yet to be approved for an ETF conversion.\n- Investors will be able to earn ETH staking rewards from the exchange-traded products.\nU.S. investors in exchange-traded funds tracking Ethereum\u2019s spot price can receive staking rewards for the first time.\nGrayscale has introduced this functionality to its Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), the second-largest such fund on Wall Street with assets of $4.82 billion, as well as its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH).\nThe firm, which filed its staking addendum with the SEC on Monday, will rely on institutional custodians like Coinbase and a \u201cdiversified network of validator providers\u201d to stake its Ethereum.\nStaking has also been activated within the Grayscale Solana Trust, which is awaiting regulatory approval to be turned into an ETF. The move is a significant development, given that institutional investors have only been able to capitalize on ETH's price gains until now.\nEthereum made an ambitious upgrade to a proof-of-stake blockchain in 2022, meaning validators voluntarily lock ETH away and receive rewards for taking a role in securing the network. It\u2019s a much less energy-intensive approach than the previous proof-of-work consensus model, which Bitcoin and some other chains still use.\nGrayscale\u2019s Ethereum exchange-traded products were among the first to hit the traditional financial market, with its trust-style product ETHE dating back to 2017. Last year, after Ethereum spot ETFs gained SEC approval, the firm successfully converted its products into spot Ethereum ETFs in July.\nThe absence of staking rewards in ETFs have been cited as a key factor in the slower adoption of Ethereum funds since they launched in the summer of 2024.\nData from SoSoValue shows the total net assets in Bitcoin ETFs currently stands at $164.5 billion\u2014equivalent to 6.7% of its market capitalization. Ethereum ETFs lag behind with net assets of $30.5 billion, 5.6% of this cryptocurrency's valuation.\nHowever, demand has been growing in recent months\u2014driven by ETH's outperformance in the crypto market. Ethereum has surged by 156% over the past six months, compared with BTC's gains of about 50%, and set a new all-time high price mark shy of $5,000 in September.\nIn a statement, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg said staking was \"exactly the kind of first-mover innovation\" that the company was designed to deliver.\n\u201cAs the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors,\" he added.\nGrayscale says it plans to roll out staking to more of its products \"as the digital asset ecosystem evolves.\" The unique selling point could help Grayscale close the gap with BlackRock, whose Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominate the market.\nCrypto exchange-traded products just capped off a record week, pulling in a total of $5.95 billion worth of investments last week, according to CoinShares. That tally included $1.48 billion worth of inflows into Ethereum funds, with both Bitcoin and ETH funds rebounding after being in the red the previous week.\nAdditional reporting by Logan Hitchcock"

                "body": "Ethereum (ETH) is back in the news again as professionals are predicting that it can soar to $10,000 in the next big bull run. Nevertheless, while ETH\u2019s upside potential remains strong, smart investors are casting their nets wide in the search for bigger returns, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the forefront. Cheap at a mere $0.035 and already over 60% sold out in Stage 6, MUTM has 35\u00d7 growth potential when listed on leading exchanges. For those who are hunting for the next DeFi champion, MUTM can potentially be the altcoin breakout of 2025.\nEthereum (ETH) Aims at $10,000 as Key Resistance Levels Come into Play\nEthereum (ETH) is on the verge of a turning point as it hits stiff resistance at the $4,500 level, which analysts suggest might signify its next big move. A move above this level could trigger a surge to the $4,700\u2013$4,750 level, continuing to build bullish momentum and setting up for a long-term ascendancy towards the highly anticipated $10,000 level.\nBut if it fails to reclaim this level of resistance, ETH might test deeper support areas at or around $10,000 or lower before making a more powerful breakout later in the cycle. And while Ethereum\u2019s potential remains enormous, increasingly more and more investors are looking for newer options with far higher upside, of which the most attractive option thus far has been Mutuum Finance (MUTM).\nMutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum\nMutuum Finance is building hype during its presale, with the platform already having collected over $16.85 million and having attracted over 16,770 investors so far. MUTM tokens can be purchased at a price of $0.035 per token in phase 6. As an appreciation for early birds, Mutuum Finance has a $100,000 giveaway promotion whereby 10 users receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens per user.\nThe protocol would also include a dynamic floating rate of interest mechanism that achieves maximum usage of liquidity. Borrowing and participation in the ecosystem are encouraged at high liquidity and low rate times, and loan repayment and influx of capital at high demand and high rate times. Fixed rate mechanisms work best when liquidity is stable, reacting to regular market forces in a natural manner.\nMutuum Finance Announces Lending & Borrowing Protocol\nMutuum Finance is moving forward with the development of its lending and borrowing protocol, a significant step toward the establishment of its decentralized finance network. Its first release (V1) will go live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and be packed with functionalities like liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be the initial assets enabled for borrowing, lending, and collateralization, and with a goal of providing users with a seamless and secure DeFi experience.\nThere must be effective valuation of assets in lending, borrowing, and profit realization. Mutuum Finance does this using Chainlink oracles to receive real-time USD and base crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform gets the best available data through the use of fallback oracle mechanisms, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages of decentralized exchanges for high-quality valuations during the most illiquid and distressed times in markets.\nMUTM Awaits 35\u00d7 Growth Potential\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming increasingly the altcoin of the year 2025, combining early-stage momentum with real utility and strong fundamentals. Its Stage 6 presale is already more than 60% sold out, with more than 16,770 investors registered and more than $16.85 million raised, a very strong signal of market confidence. The imminent release of its lending and borrowing protocol, dynamic liquidity system, and Chainlink-valued valuation instruments all point to a robust, scalable DeFi network.\nAlthough Ethereum\u2019s vision for $10,000 is extremely tempting, MUTM can potentially offer investors the chance to realize much greater upside, with analysts forecasting gains of up to 35\u00d7 when it gets listed on big exchanges.

The bug bounty starts on Monday, Oct. 6, and, so far, has no deadlines.\nOverall, the program is structured in two categories: (i) smart contracts and (ii) websites and applications. Smart contracts pay the highest bounties, structured by threat level: critical, high, and medium.\nAny reported critical vulnerability will reward the independent auditor with 10% of the funds directly affected, up to a maximum of $1.5 million and down to a minimum of $150,000 for encouragement. High- and medium-level smart contract bugs will pay up to $100,000 and a flat $10,000, respectively. The website and applications rewards are up to $50,000 and $10,000 for critical- and high-level threats.\nBefore this ImmuneFi campaign, Kamino had been self-hosting its bug bounties for three years, with significant security improvements. Moreover, the protocol counts on an open-source and publicly verifiable code, more than 18 previous audits, and verifiable onchain builds\u2014putting security as a priority.\nNow, \u201cthrough this partnership, Kamino\u2019s contracts are tested by the largest network of security researchers in the industry,\u201d says the announcement\u2019s thread on Oct. 6.\nNotably, ImmuneFi\u2019s track record speaks for itself as a key security services provider in the industry. According to Kamino\u2019s post, the project has effectively protected over $190 billion in users\u2019 funds, paying more than $120 million in rewards to independent security experts, uncovering \u201ccountless critical vulnerabilities that audits alone had missed.\u201d\nSecurity Breaches in DeFi in 2025\nWhile ImmuneFi has directly contributed and disclosed significant numbers on prevented exploits thanks to its bug bounties, many other projects in DeFi have accumulated huge losses due to exploited vulnerabilities not found in due time via private or independent audits.\nAccording to multiple sources, there were approximately 144 successful exploits in DeFi in 2025. Q1 registered 38 incidents, Q2 had a rough estimate of 75 incidents, and Q3 approximately 31 incidents.\nYet, crypto hack losses dropped 37% in Q3 to $509 million, according to Cointelegraph, but September saw a record surge in million-dollar incidents, led by exchange and DeFi exploits. Before that, August registered the third consecutive month of a rise in crypto hacks, Coinspeaker reported. Another report from July calculated over $2.1 billion lost in over 75 crypto hacks in 2025 H1. Out of the $2.1 billion by July, $357 million was registered in April alone\u2014a number 11 times higher than the one in May.\nRead original story DeFi Kamino Launches Solana's Largest Bug Bounty, Up to $1.5M by Vini Barbosa at Coinspeaker.com"

If this support does hold and SOL bounces higher, analysts indicate that the altcoin stands a possibility to outperform Bitcoin over the coming weeks and even retest its former all-time highs around $295.\nThis bullish scenario has turned Solana into one of the strongest plays on the market today, yet while SOL is poised to go on a huge rally, smart money is also watching emerging DeFi token Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could potentially yield much bigger returns.\nMUTM Presale Momentum Building\nMUTM tokens currently stand at $0.035 in Round 6 of Presale, which is a growth of 16.17% from the previous round.

Four levels of bug severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, have been employed such that bugs can be detected and remediated in the initial stage.\nEfficiency is the very foundation of the Mutuum Finance mechanism. Optimizing Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and taking overcollateralized positions, the protocol utilizes all available capital with fearless guardians. Reserve requirements provide to serve as a buffer for risk in the market with reserves overlying to borrow against riskier holdings to hedge risk.\nMUTM Emerges as 2025\u2019s Largest DeFi Opportunity\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as one of the most promising altcoins in 2025, boasting a convincing combination of low price, practicality, and potential for expansion.

For instance, Doodles, an Ethereum-based NFT collection known for its pastel characters, also rolled out its own DOOD token on Solana earlier in May to seed DreamNet, a storytelling protocol that rewards creators, while also distributing a sizable airdrop to holders and \u201cNew Blood,\u201d a program designed to attract new users to the ecosystem.\nSimilarly, the well-known Bored Ape Yacht Club introduced ApeCoin (APE) in March 2022, a utility and governance token that enables holders to participate in ecosystem decisions and access exclusive events and services.\nMore recently, Pudgy Penguins launched its PENGU token in December 2024.\nThe Moonbirds token launch also comes amid a broader rebound in the NFT market. As The Defiant reported earlier, NFTStrategy, an ecosystem of NFT projects that have introduced native tokens to fund community rewards, governance, and creator incentives, now has a market capitalization of $183 million, according to data from NFT Strategy Stats.\nWhile this shows growth within the tokenized NFT sector, the broader NFT market remains far below its April 2022 peak of roughly $17 billion. Still, the space has recovered somewhat this year, with total market capitalization more than doubling from about $3 billion in April to $6.6 billion today.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

Lower interest rates typically reduce borrowing costs for companies and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds. Derivative traders should consider strategies that benefit from a continued rise in major indices like the Dow Jones and S&P 500.\nThis expectation for rate cuts is supported by a clear trend of cooling inflation and a softening labor market. We have seen Core PCE, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, trend down from the persistent levels of 2024, now sitting closer to the 2% target. Recent ADP jobs data, showing additions of only around 150,000, confirms the slowdown that began to take hold late last year.\nMarket Strategies and Considerations\nFor traders looking to capitalize on upward momentum, buying call options on broad market ETFs like the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) is a direct approach. This strategy provides leveraged exposure to the upside while limiting the maximum potential loss to the premium paid for the option. Expirations in November or December would capture the period where rate cuts are widely expected.\nThe technology sector continues to show exceptional strength, building on the powerful AI-driven rally we witnessed throughout 2024. Given the recent news about OpenAI, traders might find opportunities in call options on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ). This allows for targeted exposure to the market\u2019s leading growth drivers.\nThe ongoing government shutdown introduces a layer of uncertainty and could cause short-term volatility spikes. While the market is currently viewing the shutdown as a reason for the Fed to cut rates, a prolonged event could spook investors, as we saw briefly during the 35-day shutdown back in 2018-2019. This environment makes selling out-of-the-money put spreads an interesting strategy, as it allows traders to collect premium while betting that the market will not experience a sharp decline.\nEven with a bullish outlook, it is wise to manage risk against any unexpected negative news from the shutdown or the Fed. We see value in purchasing VIX call options or a small number of out-of-the-money put options on the S&P 500. This acts as a relatively cheap form of portfolio insurance against a sudden market reversal."

                "body": "London's benchmark FTSE 100 index, after a period of exhilarating record-breaking ascents, has begun to retreat, signaling a cautious shift in investor sentiment. This pullback, observed on October 6, 2025, saw the index ease back from its recent all-time intraday high, reflecting broader concerns emanating from European political uncertainty and fiscal sustainability. Concurrently, global packaging and paper giant Mondi (LON: MNDI) experienced a significant downturn in its stock, plummeting on the back of a disappointing trading update, highlighting specific sector headwinds amid the wider market turbulence.\nThe twin developments underscore a period of heightened sensitivity in the financial markets, where macroeconomic factors and company-specific performances are creating a challenging landscape for investors. While the FTSE 100's retreat is a modest adjustment from its peaks, it serves as a crucial indicator of underlying anxieties. Mondi's sharp decline, however, points to more profound challenges within specific industries, demanding closer scrutiny from market participants.\nA Rollercoaster Ride for the FTSE 100 and Mondi's Steep Decline\nThe FTSE 100 has been on a remarkable trajectory over the past year, achieving multiple record highs that captivated market observers. The index first broke new ground in May 2024, reaching 8,445.80 points, and continued its upward climb through 2025, crossing the 9,000-point threshold in July and even touching an intraday high of 9,494.64 on October 6, 2025. However, this impressive rally has often been met with periods of retreat, with the index struggling to consolidate its gains. On October 6, 2025, the FTSE 100 eased back 0.2%, or 16.89 points, to 9474.36 from its previous Friday's peak, indicating a hesitancy to push higher.\nThis latest retreat is largely attributed to renewed political uncertainty in France and broader concerns regarding fiscal sustainability across Europe, which have cast a shadow over continental markets. Earlier in 2024, weaker sentiment in the US and deteriorating consumer confidence also contributed to pullbacks. While a recovery in the value of the pound in February 2025 initially weighed on the export-heavy FTSE 100, the current pound weakness against the US dollar offers some support to multinational constituents, though not enough to prevent the recent pullback. Despite reaching these all-time highs, the FTSE 100's rallies have frequently \"fizzled out,\" with analysts often noting a \"lack of enthusiasm\" from global investors for UK stock markets.\nIn stark contrast to the FTSE 100's somewhat volatile but generally upward trend, Mondi (LON: MNDI) has faced significant headwinds. On October 6, 2025, Mondi shares plunged by a staggering 14% (148.4p to 898.6p), even touching a decade-low of 866p at one point. This dramatic fall was triggered by a deeply disappointing third-quarter trading update, which revealed underlying EBITDA had fallen to 223 million euros, marking its worst quarter since Q1 2024. The company cited \"subdued\" demand, persistently lower paper selling prices, and key markets being in oversupply as primary reasons for its underperformance.\nCompanies Navigating a Treacherous Landscape\nMondi's recent woes highlight the acute pressures faced by companies operating in cyclical industries, particularly those sensitive to global demand and commodity prices. The packaging and paper sector, in which Mondi is a prominent player, is currently grappling with oversupply and a challenging pricing environment. Mondi's decision to extend plant closures for annual maintenance and delay planned investments, such as a new sack kraft paper machine, are direct responses to these difficult market conditions, aimed at preserving cash. The company's underlying EBITDA for the full year 2024 was already 13% lower than 2023, partly due to a significantly lower forestry fair value gain and a one-off currency loss from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, setting a prec"

I've sent her texts asking for her to let me know when she is putting it in to my account... no answer at all. What are my legal options?\nTony, via comments box\nThanks for your message, Tony - I wish I had a neighbour as generous as you.\nFrom what you describe, there was an oral agreement here, which isn't the best grounds for getting your money back.\nThe neighbour might argue that there were no particular payment terms (so that the loan is not due by the end of the month) or even that there was no loan at all (that the money was instead a gift).\nIt would then be up to the court to decide on the evidence whether a loan existed and what its terms were.\nI spoke to solicitor Alex Kennedy, a dispute resolution expert at Gannons, to get some firm guidance for you.\n\"Evidence of messages, bank payments etc are so important,\" he says.\n\"If there are no documents at all, the person who is owed the money could still present their case, it is just the trial judge would be weighing their witness evidence against that of the borrower.\"\nSo what can you do now?\nKennedy says the most obvious legal route now is to send a formal letter before action to your neighbour, setting out:\n- The amount owed;\n- The basis of the debt (ie, the loan made and her agreement to repay by the end of the month);\n- What steps you have already taken to request payment;\n- A clear deadline (usually 14 days) for repayment before you take legal action.\nThis can be done by you or a solicitor and could well prompt your neighbour to cough up.\n\"Tony will need to bear in mind whether the relatively small value of the loan means that instructing a solicitor is a disproportionate expense, especially given that it is unusual to recover legal costs in respect of a small claim,\" Kennedy says.\n\"If the cost of a solicitor is considered to be excessive, we would still recommend that the person who is owed the money drafts a letter before action themselves.\"\nIf your neighbour is still not budging, there's the option to issue a claim online via the Money Claim Online service or through the local county court.\nThe claim fee depends on the size of the debt (for \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500 it is \u00a370 if issued online).\nIf successful, you will obtain a county court judgment.\nKennedy says your reader can enforce the judgment in several ways, including:\n- Instructing bailiffs (county court or high court enforcement officers);\n- Obtaining an attachment of earnings order (if she is employed);\n- A charging order against property (if she owns her home).\n\"Interest and some legal costs can be claimed as part of proceedings, but as I have set out above, they may be limited given the value of the debt,\" Kennedy says.\nOf course, only you can decide whether taking any of these steps against someone you'll be seeing all the time is the right way to go.\nGood luck with it!\nThis feature is not intended as financial advice - the aim is to give an overview of the things you should think about.

Despite several new models due to come off the production line, the company is forecasting a \u201cmid-high single-digit percentage\u201d decline in wholesale volumes for the year to December \u2013 steep for an outfit that only sold 6,030 cars last year.\nLosses are now expected to be greater this year than the \u00a3110m it had previously predicted, which was already at the lower end of expectations.\nEven more concerning is the revelation that it no longer expects free cash flow to be in positive territory in the second half of its financial year.\nIt is an admission that raises the prospect of Aston Martin having to tap investors yet again for emergency funds, at which point surely there needs to be an honest conversation about whether the company will ever be financially viable without repeated shareholder handouts.\nThe Aston Martin show has been kept on the road thanks to the exceptional generosity of those that, for reasons not entirely clear, still own Aston Martin stock \u2013 chief among them is executive chair and majority shareholder Lawrence Stroll \u2013 plus, of course, the debt markets.\nSince Stroll arrived on the scene in January 2020 with a promise to end the constant car crashes, it has tapped investors for \u00a31.9bn via no fewer than seven fund-raisings.\nBillions more have been raised from banks and bondholders \u2013 often on the sort of punitive terms that only the most financially-stretched businesses find themselves having to pay.\nThough several refinancings have helped bring down some of its borrowing costs, indebtedness has shot up leaving the company with net debt of \u00a31.5bn as of June 2025 \u2013 a 43pc jump in just six months.\nThe reasons given for the latest setback are numerous, covering the full gamut of macro-economic headwinds and external shocks from US tariffs disruption and new taxes in China to even pressure on its suppliers from the JLR cyber attack.\nThe impact of Trump\u2019s trade war on the car industry has been unquestionably severe, despite Sir Keir\u2019s Starmer\u2019s claims that he negotiated a good deal with America, and Aston Martin is particularly exposed because it has no US manufacturing base.\nHowever, its problems pre-date the President\u2019s second term by many years so the excuses are somewhat unconvincing to say the least.\nAs analysts have pointed out, one of the biggest challenges Aston Martin consistently faces is that demand for its cars rarely lives up to expectations.\nThat\u2019s potentially a much bigger issue. With losses, cashflow and debt all going in the wrong direction too, there is risk that shareholders and lenders become increasingly reluctant to ride to the rescue.\n"

                "body": "Time for Germany's 'sugar rush' to hit: Mike Dolan\nBy Mike Dolan\nOne of the most transformative economic policy shifts in a turbulent year - Germany's market-moving fiscal boost - is about to kick in, but there's some trepidation about how all this spending and reform will actually pan out.\nDespite all the focus on Washington's sweeping upheavals over the past nine months, arguably the biggest macro market driver of 2025 has been Germany's post-election plan to lift its stifling, self-imposed debt brake and spend almost a trillion euros on defense and infrastructure.\nWhile the multi-year investment plan was always expected to truly begin hitting in 2026, markets almost immediately priced in a significant boost to the long-dormant growth potential of Europe's biggest economy as well as expected ripple effects across the continent.\nThis explains a sizeable chunk of the dollar's drop this year, as much as anything that's happened in Washington.\nThe euro's 13% surge against the greenback this year has all come since Germany's election in February. And this fiscal boost is one of the main reasons investors think the European Central Bank will not cut interest rates below the current 2% level through next year.\nExpectations of a borrowing binge have pushed up 10-year German bund yields almost 30 basis points this year, even as the ECB has cut rates by a full percentage point. And 30-year rates have climbed about 70bp.\nBut the real lift came to the equity market, with the German DAX benchmark up 22% in the year to date and the mid-cap MDAX index also up over 20%, both outstripping Wall Street benchmarks by almost 10 percentage points. The electrified euro defense sector has climbed a whopping 75% in 2025 thus far - more than three times the gains for Wall Street's megacap 'Magnificent Seven'.\nAnd even though euro zone aggregate corporate earnings growth estimates for 2025 have dwindled to zero, forecasts for 2026 have inflated to more than 12%.\nIn short, there's quite a lot riding on Germany delivering.\nThe problem is that the excitement around the plans went a bit flat over the summer amid wrangling over how and where the spending should be allocated, what vehicles should be used and how much of the other promised reforms will emerge in 2026.\n\"SUGAR AND PROTEIN\"\nDeutsche Bank argues that investor frustration at the lack of delivery so far is \"somewhat moot\", as nothing was ever likely to happen before the final quarter of this year anyway, as the 2025 budget law was only passed last month.\nChief economist Robin Winkler reckons the 2025 federal government draft implies a steep rise in spending in the fourth quarter, not least because the deficit through July was only running at about 41 billion euros against a plan for 143 billion euros, or 3.3% of GDP.\nHowever, he said investor concerns about existing spending items being shifted to the country's infrastructure fund are more \"substantive\" as this means less of this fund may now be used for new investment projects.\nAs a result, Deutsche Bank said its original estimate that the overall plan could lift potential German growth by about half a percentage point to 1% by the end of the decade looks \"increasingly hopeful\".\n\"The sugar rush is coming and likely to boost cyclical growth for a while,\" Winkler wrote late last month. \"Yet the long-term growth implications look dimmer than in the spring.\"\nWhat's just as important for business confidence, Deutsche argues, is the government's structural reform plan - the \"protein\" to back up the \"fiscal sugar\".\nAnd there's mixed progress on these. Areas such as reducing energy levies and red tape or speeding up planning processes are in the works for next year, but there's less movement on reforming social security, pension systems and work incentives or on changing the longer-term debt brake.\nEconomic data is sending mixed signals. German firms' six-month business expectations, captured by the monthly Ifo survey, hit the highest level in more than "

                "body": "Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) jumps 3.2% this week, though earnings growth is still tracking behind five-year shareholder returns\nWhen you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) stock is up an impressive 263% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 63% in about a quarter.\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Tower Semiconductor achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 29% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nDive deeper into Tower Semiconductor's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Tower Semiconductor's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nA Different Perspective\nIt's good to see that Tower Semiconductor has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 64% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 29% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Tower Semiconductor you should know about.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "About 90 seconds into his presentation on Covid-19 vaccine safety at a closely watched meeting of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month, Dr. Bruce Carleton made a startling revelation: The government grant supporting his research had been abruptly terminated.\nThe statement was surprising for a few reasons. Carleton had been asked to share his findings with a group entirely put in place by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after Kennedy summarily dismissed all 17 previous experts on the committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP, in June. In its first two meetings, the newly composed committee has shown an outsized interest in vaccine safety, in line with Kennedy\u2019s frequent protest that he\u2019s \u201cnot anti-vaccine; I am pro-safety.\u201d\nYet Kennedy\u2019s HHS canceled a major CDC grant focused on the subject in March, curtailing Carleton\u2019s work to understand genetic drivers of rare vaccine safety risks.\n\u201cThey canceled [a grant to study] vaccine safety, and yet now we\u2019re talking about vaccine safety,\u201d Carleton later told CNN.\nCarleton\u2019s statement in the meeting was also surprising because, almost immediately, an HHS spokesperson denied that it was true.\n\u201cFYI \u2013 as you see below, we did not cancel the grant,\u201d HHS Director of Communications Andrew Nixon said in an email to reporters during the ACIP meeting, providing a link to the grant information on the agency\u2019s website.\nNixon noted that the grant\u2019s \u201cperiod of performance\u201d ended March 25. The website, though, shows a negative subtotal of more than $2 million, suggesting money allocated to the grant that was unspent. Paperwork ending the grant shared with CNN states that \u201cthe purpose of this amendment is to terminate this award.\u201d And it\u2019s included on an HHS list of terminated grants.\n\u201cThe grant was canceled,\u201d said Dr. Steven Black, the primary investigator of the project and co-director of the Global Vaccine Data Network, which received the award and supported Carleton\u2019s work. It \u201cwas supposed to run for more than a year after that.\u201d\nNixon didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.\nStudying rare vaccine risks\nThe idea of harnessing data from multiple countries to assess rare vaccine safety risks came about long before the Covid-19 pandemic; the playbook was established more than a decade earlier, for vaccines targeting the 2009 H1N1 flu, said Dr. Frank DeStefano, who was head of the CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office from 2009 to 2021.\nFinland, and then several other European countries, detected an increased risk of narcolepsy, or excessive daytime sleepiness, after the rollout of 2009 flu vaccines, and the CDC funded a multinational study to look at the issue, DeStefano told CNN. The connection was never detected in the US, and an association remained only in Sweden in the CDC\u2019s study; DeStefano noted it still remains somewhat of a mystery.\n\u201cWe learned a lot from that project,\u201d DeStefano said. \u201cWe developed some of the methodology to be able to align data systems for different countries, establish standardized case definitions and how to gather the data so it could be analyzed comparably from different countries.\u201d\nSo as billions of people were being vaccinated against Covid-19 in 2021, DeStefano and others reached for that playbook again; the CDC awarded $5.6 million to the Global Vaccine Data Network in April 2021 and an additional $4.5 million in 2022, for a total of a planned $10.1 million through April 2026, according to Black.\n\u201cWe wanted a big database, covering the different vaccines and different populations,\u201d DeStefano said. \u201cOne that would be able to detect these rare adverse events sooner.\u201d\nMyocarditis, or heart inflammation, emerged as a rare risk of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines as they were rolled out broadly, with the risk most pronounced in teenage boys and young men. It also was found to be a risk of infection with the coronavirus itself. People who experienced it after vaccination typical"

The broader Topix index finished 96.89 points, or 3.10 percent, higher at 3,226.06, also marking a record high close.\nAlmost all sectors on the top-tier Prime Market gained ground, led by machinery, electric appliance and real estate issues.\nThe Japanese currency briefly fell about 3 yen to a two-month low versus the dollar, as expectations of an interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan this month receded after Takaichi, a proponent of easy monetary policy, won the Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race on Saturday, dealers said.\nThe Japanese currency also slid to the lower 176 yen zone against the euro at one point, its lowest level since the 1999 launch of the single European currency.\nAt 5 p.m., the dollar fetched 150.01-03 yen compared with 147.39-49 yen in New York and 147.40-42 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Friday.\nThe euro was quoted at $1.1662-1663 and 174.95-99 yen against $1.1739-1749 and 173.09-19 yen in New York and $1.1732-1734 and 172.94-98 yen in Tokyo late Friday afternoon.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond briefly rose to 1.680 percent, its highest level since July 2008, during after-hours trading, as the debt was sold amid speculation that Takaichi's possible expansionary fiscal policies will prompt more bond issuances.\nThe selling was also spurred as sharp rises in Tokyo stocks increased investors' risk appetite. It had ended at 1.670 percent, up 0.010 percentage point from Friday's close.\nOn the stock market, the Nikkei index briefly soared over 5 percent to above the 48,000 mark, as Takaichi's surprise victory boosted hopes that the Japanese economy would be supported by expansionary policies, brokers said.\nShe is likely to become the country's first female prime minister later this month.\n\"Today's steep rise was likely driven by her surprise victory and a celebratory mood that Japan will have the first female prime minister,\" said Maki Sawada, a strategist in the Investment Content Department of Nomura Securities Co.\nStocks were lifted by expectations of economy-boosting measures such as increased government spending and tax cuts, while exporter shares gained on a weaker yen, which boosts overseas profits when repatriated.\nThe market's next focus will be whether the ruling coalition under Takaichi can implement policy measures, given that the LDP is currently running a minority government, brokers said.\n\"It remains uncertain whether Ms. Takaichi's proposed policies will be enforced since she will need cooperation from opposition forces,\" said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management Co.\n\"The market is eager to find out which parties she will seek to cooperate with and if things don't go smoothly, hopes for expansionary fiscal policies are likely to fade,\" Ichikawa added.\nMeanwhile, the benchmark price of gold set by Tokyo's Tanaka Precious Metal Technologies Co. hit an all-time high at 21,039 yen per gram, exceeding 21,000 yen for the first time, driven by the weaker yen."
