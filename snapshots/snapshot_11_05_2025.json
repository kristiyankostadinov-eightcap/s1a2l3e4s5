                "body": "Gold prices face challenges due to a firm US Dollar and cautious Federal Reserve stance. Prices dropped below $4,000, currently trading at $3,970, influenced by geopolitical uncertainties and a softer risk appetite in global equities.\nChina has adjusted its VAT regulations, which impacts retail gold demand, with VAT exemption reduced from 13% to 6%. This move is expected to temporarily decrease retail purchases, affecting short-term demand in China.\nFederal Reserve Signals\nFederal Reserve officials have provided varied signals, discussing inflation risks and employment trends. Markets reassessed December rate cut probabilities, seeing a current 70% likelihood of a 25 basis point cut.\nGold\u2019s directional strength is unclear, with XAU/USD showing neutral momentum, hovering around $4,000. Technical indicators signal consolidation, with resistance and support levels indicating possible trading ranges at $4,020 and $3,928, respectively.\nThe Federal Reserve is responsible for monetary policy, adjusting interest rates to maintain price stability and full employment. Quantitative Easing and tightening are key tools, influencing the US Dollar\u2019s strength. These measures reflect broader economic strategies involving various rate adjustments to counter inflation and influence international market attractiveness.\nGiven gold\u2019s failure to hold the $4,000 level, we are in a period of consolidation. The price is currently caught between a strong US Dollar pushing it down and underlying economic uncertainty offering support. This tug-of-war suggests that range-bound strategies could be effective in the immediate term.\nMarket Volatility and Trading Strategies\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s mixed signals are creating indecision in the market, which is reflected in gold\u2019s neutral momentum. We just saw the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for October 2025 come in at 3.5%, which explains the Fed\u2019s reluctance to signal more aggressive rate cuts. The market\u2019s probability of a December rate cut has fallen from 94% to 70% in just a week, indicating that traders should be prepared for heightened volatility around Fed announcements.\nFor derivative traders, this uncertainty points toward volatility plays. Options strategies like long straddles or strangles, which profit from a large price move in either direction, could be considered ahead of the next FOMC meeting. These positions would capitalize on a decisive breakout from the current tight trading range.\nThe new VAT rules in China are a significant short-term headwind, curbing demand from a key retail market. This policy is a notable shift, especially since we\u2019ve seen the People\u2019s Bank of China add over 250 tonnes to its gold reserves since the beginning of 2024. Traders should watch for weakness below the $3,928 support level, as a break could trigger further selling.\nWith the price testing lower levels, buying put options with a strike price around $3,900 could serve as a good hedge or a speculative play on further downside. This would be a direct bet that the strong dollar and cautious Fed narrative will win out in the coming weeks. A sustained move below $3,900 would likely signal a deeper correction.\nHowever, the broader uptrend is supported by persistent risks, including the prolonged US government shutdown. This shutdown, now resembling the 35-day stoppage we saw back in late 2018 and early 2019, is creating a floor for gold prices. Therefore, traders anticipating an escalation of political or geopolitical risks could use this consolidation to accumulate long-dated call options at lower premiums."

                "body": "On Tuesday (November 4), spot gold fell by 1.7%, closing at USD 3,931.78 per ounce, while the December U.S. gold futures dropped 1.3% to settle at USD 3,960.50. Growing divisions among Fed officials have cooled market expectations for a December rate cut by the Federal Reserve, aiding the dollar index in breaking through the 100-mark and refreshing its highest level in over three months, significantly pressuring gold prices. However, concerns over a bubble in the U.S. stock market and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history still provide safe-haven support for gold prices. In the short term, gold bears have a slight upper hand, with prices facing further downside risks, but if Wednesday's ADP private employment data disappoints, gold could stage a dramatic reversal. On Wednesday (November 5) in early Asian trading, spot gold traded narrowly, currently at USD 3,936.59 per ounce.\nCooling expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December pushed the dollar index above 100, hitting a fresh three-month high.\nLast week, the Federal Reserve delivered the expected 25-basis-point rate cut, but Chairman Powell dampened sentiment during the subsequent press conference by stating that another rate cut in December was \u201cnot a done deal.\u201d This remark instantly undermined market confidence in the easing path. Compounded by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown entering its 35th day\u2014tying the record for the longest shutdown under Trump\u2019s first term\u2014official economic data has gone entirely \u201coffline,\u201d leading to starkly contrasting interpretations of the same set of private-sector data among Fed officials. Some worry about an overheating economy, while others fear policy errors amid this data vacuum.\nA week ago, the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool showed a near-100% probability of a December rate cut; now it has fallen to 70%. Other data metrics indicate only a 65% chance.\nThe cooling of rate cut expectations provided the dollar with strong upward momentum, which in turn pressured gold price movements.\nOn Tuesday, the dollar index surged past the 100 mark, closing at 100.21 after five consecutive trading days of gains, reaching a fresh three-month high of 100.22 since early August. This surge in the dollar directly increased the purchasing cost of gold for non-dollar holders, deterring global buying interest.\nDavid Meger, Director of Metals Trading at High Ridge Futures, noted: \u201cWith the dollar hitting new highs, the gold market is naturally under pressure. The deeper reason is the sharp drop in the probability of a December rate cut.\u201d\nStock Market Bubble Alert Raised as Capital Flees to U.S. Treasuries\nWall Street heavyweights collectively sounded the alarm: CEOs from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan took turns warning of excessive stock valuations and looming risks of a tech bubble driven by AI stocks. The Nasdaq plummeted 2.04% in a single day, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index plunged 4.0%, with six out of seven major tech giants experiencing significant declines. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.17% and 0.53%, respectively, marking their largest single-day drops since October 10. Panic spread rapidly as funds withdrew from high-risk assets and flowed into U.S. Treasury bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note closed down 1.8 basis points at 4.089%, while the 30-year yield fell 2.1 basis points to 4.669%.\nGreg Faranello, Head of Interest Rate Strategy at AmeriVet Securities, pointed out: 'A broad decline in AI stocks has cast a risk-off tone over the market, making U.S. Treasuries a high-quality safe haven.' Gold, which should have benefited from the risk aversion wave, lost its luster due to a strong dollar and elevated interest rate expectations.\nGovernment Shutdown for 35 Days Makes ADP Report a Critical Indicator\nThe U.S. government shutdown has lasted 35 days, ensuring that the Labor Department\u2019s monthly employment report will be absent on Friday.

At the time of writing, XAU/USD is trading around $3,970, down nearly 1% on the day, after recovering modestly from an intraday low near $3,928.\nGold appears to be in a healthy consolidation phase following its correction from the record high of $4,381 reached on October 20. A pullback in global equities is helping to limit losses in Bullion, as the softening risk appetite offers some support to the metal. However, the upside remains limited amid reduced safe-haven flows and fading expectations of another Fed interest rate cut this year.\nNevertheless, the broader uptrend remains intact as persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainties continue to keep investors cautious. At the same time, the prolonged United States (US) government shutdown remains a drag on market sentiment.\nMarket movers: Traders reassess December rate cut odds after Fed remarks\n- China\u2019s new Gold VAT rules prompted several state banks to halt physical Gold redemptions and new retail account openings, as authorities moved to cool speculative demand in the domestic bullion market. The revised policy, which cuts the VAT exemption on certain Gold transactions from 13% to 6%, is expected to temporarily curb retail buying and is likely to weigh on short-term demand from one of the biggest global buyers of physical Gold.\n- Fed officials offered mixed signals on Monday, with some emphasizing inflation risks while others highlighted a gradual cooling in the labor market. Fed Governor Lisa Cook said inflation remains above the 2% target and could stay elevated through next year due to tariff effects. However, she stressed the need for policy to remain \u201cappropriately focused\u201d to restore price stability. She added that the recent 25-basis-point rate cut was suitable given the rising downside risks to employment, but reiterated readiness to act forcefully if inflation proves more persistent.\n- Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he remains uneasy with front-loading rate cuts and views inflation as still \u201cworrisome,\u201d while Fed Governor Stephen Miran warned it is \u201ca mistake to make conclusions about monetary policy from financial conditions alone.\u201d Goolsbee noted the threshold for further easing is now higher than at the past two meetings, and Miran said the Fed could \u201cget to neutral in a series of 50-basis-point cuts but does not need 75-basis-point cuts,\u201d adding that policy has \u201cpassively tightened despite Fed cuts.\u201d\n- Based on the latest Fed remarks, traders reassessed the outlook for a December rate cut as policymakers offered mixed signals. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets now assign roughly a 70% probability of a 25 bps cut at the next meeting, down from 94% a week ago but slightly higher than 65% on Monday.\n- UBS said the recent pullback in Gold is likely temporary and maintained its forecast of $4,200 per ounce, with an upside scenario toward $4,700 if geopolitical or market risks intensify. The bank noted that \u201cthe much-anticipated correction has taken a breather,\u201d adding that while fading price momentum triggered a second leg down in futures open interest, \u201cunderlying demand remains strong\u201d and there is \u201cno fundamental reason for the sell-off.\u201d\nTechnical analysis: XAU/USD lacks momentum, consolidation persists below $4,000\nGold (XAU/USD) lacks clear directional momentum, trading within a narrow range just below the $4,000 mark. On the 4-hour chart, the metal faces immediate resistance at the 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), which aligns closely with the $4,020-$4,050 zone \u2014 a form"

Speaking at ADIPEC 2025, Dr. Ayed S. Al-Qahtani, Director of Research Division at OPEC, outlined the 2025 edition's long-term projections, investment requirements, and the evolving energy mix.\nOPEC's 2025 outlook confirms that oil will remain central to the global energy system. \"Oil and gas will still constitute north of 50% of the global energy mix, even by 2050,\" Dr. Al-Qahtani noted, whilst electricity demand is projected to surge 80% over the next 25 years.\nThe outlook identifies developing economies as the primary drivers of future energy growth. \"Oil growth going forward will be exclusively in developing countries...all of it will be in developing countries,\" Dr. Al-Qahtani confirmed.\nIndia alone is expected to account for \"8 million barrels\" of new demand, with China, the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America also experiencing strong growth. OECD countries, by contrast, face \"stagnation and even contraction.\"\nMeeting this demand will require substantial investment across the energy value chain. \"We see a lot of investments required, needing north of $18.2 trillion on the upstream, midstream, and downstream only on oil,\" Dr. Al-Qahtani stated.\n\"Going forward, the world would need around $15 trillion in the upstream...the bulk...will be on the OPEC countries, because they will have to fill in the gap. They are the lowest cost producers. So the last barrel that would hit the market will come out of the Middle East region.\"\nOPEC's modelling incorporates multiple scenarios to account for different policy and technology pathways. \"Scenario planning is science and art at the same time...we mapped out two: the equitable growth...and the technology-driven scenario,\" Dr. Al-Qahtani explained. Even in the most ambitious technology-driven scenario, \"we still see oil growing at healthy levels, remaining above 100 [million barrels/day].\"\nDr. Al-Qahtani emphasised the collaborative approach needed to meet global energy needs: \"We need all sources of energy, because the global economy is like a growing child that is thirsty for all sources of energy.\"\nHe underscored the importance of dialogue between producers, consumers, and policymakers, noting that \"the importance of balancing energy security, environmental responsibility, affordability, and sustainability is reiterated\" throughout the outlook."

While Saudi Arabia and Iraq chipped in most of the increase, the details tell a trickier story: Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE set out to lift output by 86,000 bpd, but Iraq and the UAE had to cut an extra 140,000 bpd to make up for past overshoots. That whittled the actual gain down to just 114,000 bpd, nearly offset by falling output from Nigeria, Libya, and Venezuela.

                "body": "(Oil Price) \u2013 OPEC+ just agreed to boost oil production for another month. Luckily for U.S. shale, they also decided to pause the hikes, which would help the shale industry dodge the bullet of WTI of $50. This is good news for an impressively resilient industry, because its resilience seems to taper out around $50 per barrel.\nThis weekend, the OPEC+ group said it would add another 137,000 barrels daily to global supply. That was bearish news after an extended streak of monthly hikes. Yet the producer cartel also said it planned to suspend the hikes next year for three months. It is now time for investment bank commodity teams to revise their price assumptions and for shale operators to breathe a sigh of relief\u2014they may have avoided having to see their output shrink by 700,000 barrels daily by the end of 2026.\nIt is no secret that shale oil in the United States has a higher breakeven price than conventional wells in Saudi Arabia. Yet, not all wells are created equal, and some can make money at less than $60 per barrel while others need $70 per barrel and more to break even. Not only this, but costs in the shale patch have been rising, as reported by the Dallas Fed in its quarterly energy survey. Even so, shale production continues growing, hitting another all-time high of 13.7 million barrels daily in August, according to new data from the Energy Information Administration.\nA lot of this is thanks to efficiency improvements, energy market analytics firm Kpler said in a report on oil prices and their effect on the U.S. shale industry. The report noted the adverse effect of tariffs, OPEC+ output hikes, and President Trump\u2019s ambition to keep prices at the pump low. It then went on to point out that despite these, U.S. shale production has continued growing even with a lower rig count, thanks to drilling efficiencies and an ample supply of drilled but uncompleted wells.\nHowever, things are about to change if prices remain where they are or go lower, as some analysts expect. Currently at $61 per barrel, if West Texas Intermediate falls lower, it would start hurting shale, Kpler said, forecasting a 700,000-bpd drop in output by the end of 2026 if the benchmark falls to $50 per barrel and stays there for long enough.\nEven at $60 per barrel, the price of U.S. crude is affecting activity. According to Kpler, the drilled but uncompleted well inventory in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken basins has shrunk by between 25% and 30% since the start of the year, to 280 and 310, respectively, as of September. \u201cThis downward trend is unsustainable, unless drilling ramps back up \u2013 a scenario that is unlikely under the current price environment,\u201d Kpler analyst Johannes Raubal wrote in the report. What\u2019s more, he added, a smaller inventory of DUCs makes shale producers less nimble in their response to international price fluctuations.\nThis is not the best of news, especially with the predictions of even lower international prices due to what many see as a sizable supply overhang. Indeed, Goldman Sachs said back in August it expected oil prices to dip below $60 per barrel next year on the back of that overhang, coming mainly from non-OPEC producers, led by the United States. Non-OPEC supply is actually the chief reason for the glut predictions across analytical outlets, including the International Energy Agency. Yet Kpler expects supply growth among non-OPEC oil producers to peak next year, relieving some of the price pressure. If it peaks before WTI falls to $50\u2014if it ever does, that is\u2014a production squeeze would be avoided. Yet if that growth everyone points to when predicting a glut takes longer to peak, WTI may indeed fall below sustainable production growth levels, even for Big Oil, which often enjoys much lower breakeven prices than independents.\n\u201cAlthough majors and large independents can operate below $50/bbl, this price level would enforce cautious activity for most,\u201d Rauball wrote.

                "body": "OPEC projects oil demand to reach 123 million barrels daily by 2050\nGlobal energy demand is set to grow substantially over the coming decades, presenting significant investment opportunities as the world works to meet the needs of developing economies, according to OPEC's World Oil Outlook 2025.\nOPEC's flagship annual publication analysing medium- and long-term outlooks for the oil industry projects that global energy needs will expand by 23% by mid-century, with oil demand climbing to 123 million barrels per day. Speaking at ADIPEC 2025, Dr. Ayed S. Al-Qahtani, Director of Research Division at OPEC, outlined the 2025 edition's long-term projections, investment requirements, and the evolving energy mix.\nOPEC's 2025 outlook confirms that oil will remain central to the global energy system. \"Oil and gas will still constitute north of 50% of the global energy mix, even by 2050,\" Dr. Al-Qahtani noted, whilst electricity demand is projected to surge 80% over the next 25 years.\nThe outlook identifies developing economies as the primary drivers of future energy growth. \"Oil growth going forward will be exclusively in developing countries...all of it will be in developing countries,\" Dr. Al-Qahtani confirmed.\nIndia alone is expected to account for \"8 million barrels\" of new demand, with China, the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America also experiencing strong growth. OECD countries, by contrast, face \"stagnation and even contraction.\"\nMeeting this demand will require substantial investment across the energy value chain. \"We see a lot of investments required, needing north of $18.2 trillion on the upstream, midstream, and downstream only on oil,\" Dr. Al-Qahtani stated.\n\"Going forward, the world would need around $15 trillion in the upstream...the bulk...will be on the OPEC countries, because they will have to fill in the gap. They are the lowest cost producers. So the last barrel that would hit the market will come out of the Middle East region.\"\nOPEC's modelling incorporates multiple scenarios to account for different policy and technology pathways. \"Scenario planning is science and art at the same time...we mapped out two: the equitable growth...and the technology-driven scenario,\" Dr. Al-Qahtani explained. Even in the most ambitious technology-driven scenario, \"we still see oil growing at healthy levels, remaining above 100 [million barrels/day].\"\nDr. Al-Qahtani emphasised the collaborative approach needed to meet global energy needs: \"We need all sources of energy, because the global economy is like a growing child that is thirsty for all sources of energy.\"\nHe underscored the importance of dialogue between producers, consumers, and policymakers, noting that \"the importance of balancing energy security, environmental responsibility, affordability, and sustainability is reiterated\" throughout the outlook."

                "body": "The Euro has dipped below 1.1500 against the US Dollar, reversing prior gains amid a risk-averse market atmosphere and Fed rate expectations. Over the last five trading days, EUR/USD has fallen by about 1.5%, with the US Dollar gaining strength due to Fed hawkishness and a dismal market sentiment.\nUS Manufacturing Sector and Fed Officials\nThe US Dollar\u2019s resilience was undeterred by a continued contraction in the US manufacturing sector, with October\u2019s ISM Manufacturing PMI recording its eighth monthly decline. Federal Reserve officials are divided on future policy, with some advocating for caution due to high inflation, while others argue current policies are too restrictive.\nIn Europe, ECB President Christine Lagarde\u2019s upcoming speech is not expected to provide fresh insights on monetary policy. Key US data will be absent due to a government shutdown, but markets are anticipating Wednesday\u2019s ADP Employment report. Futures markets have decreased the likelihood of a December rate cut to 67% from 90%, supporting US Treasury yields and maintaining US Dollar strength.\nEUR/USD is finding resistance below 1.1530 after an unsuccessful attempt to stabilize above this level. If EUR/USD stays below 1.1500, it could move towards 1.1450, while to the upside, surpassing 1.1500 could shift focus to 1.1530 and beyond.\nAs of November 4, 2025, we are seeing the EUR/USD pair under significant pressure, currently trading near the 1.0750 mark. The market mood is decidedly risk-averse, pushing capital towards the safety of the US Dollar, a dynamic we have seen many times before. This environment suggests that any rallies in the Euro are likely to be short-lived selling opportunities.\nDriving Factors and Technical Levels\nA key factor driving this is the growing divergence in monetary policy between the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve. With the latest flash estimates for October 2025 showing Eurozone inflation cooling to 2.4%, the ECB is facing more pressure to consider rate cuts early next year. Meanwhile, US core inflation has remained stubbornly above 3%, giving the Fed reason to maintain its \u201chigher for longer\u201d stance.\nWe are now looking ahead to this Friday\u2019s US Non-Farm Payrolls report for further clues on the economy\u2019s strength. The October 2025 report showed a resilient labor market, adding a solid 170,000 jobs, which continues to support the case for a hawkish Fed. A similar strong reading would likely reinforce dollar strength and push the EUR/USD lower.\nFor derivative traders, this situation is increasing implied volatility in EUR/USD options contracts. The uncertainty surrounding future central bank moves means markets are pricing in the potential for larger price swings. This suggests that strategies that profit from volatility, rather than a specific direction, could be worth considering in the weeks ahead.\nThe key technical level to watch is the 1.0700 support area. A firm break below this psychological mark could open a path toward the year-to-date lows we saw in September 2025, around 1.0630. To invalidate the current bearish view, we would need to see a convincing move back above the resistance at 1.0820."

The euro\u2019s weakness reflects a clear market verdict: the U.S. dollar\u2019s monetary and yield advantage remains firmly intact. The pair\u2019s retreat from 1.1600 highs early last week to current levels near 1.1520 underscores a powerful trend driven by reduced Fed cut expectations, U.S. political instability, and a muted European recovery.\nThe shift was triggered when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dismissed aggressive easing bets, stating that policy remains \u201cdata dependent.\u201d Following his remarks, the CME FedWatch Tool showed December rate-cut odds collapsing to 65% from 94%, propelling the Dollar Index (DXY) back to 99.97, its highest in a month. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.09%, reinforcing the greenback\u2019s carry appeal. In contrast, the European Central Bank (ECB) maintained its rates unchanged for the third consecutive meeting, offering no catalyst for buyers.\nEUR/USD Technical Breakdown: Support Zones Emerge Near 1.1450\u20131.14\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains entrenched in a downward channel that has dominated price action since September. The pair trades below all major moving averages: the 20-day EMA at 1.1608, the 50-day EMA at 1.1582, and the 100-day EMA at 1.1639, confirming that momentum remains decisively bearish.\nImmediate resistance sits at 1.1570\u20131.1600, a convergence of the short-term EMA cluster and channel midpoint. A sustained close above this level would be required to neutralize the current bearish sequence. However, as long as the pair remains below 1.1550, downside pressure persists, targeting the 1.1450\u20131.1400 support range.\nThe Parabolic SAR dots remain firmly positioned above the price line, reinforcing downward control. Momentum oscillators show limited recovery\u2014RSI near 34, MACD in deep negative territory\u2014both confirming that sellers dominate. Should EUR/USD breach 1.1450, the next critical level emerges at 1.1386, corresponding to the 200-day EMA (1.1399) and May\u2019s prior demand region. A slide below this level could expose 1.1350\u20131.1300, marking a potential five-month low and a full retracement of the summer advance.\nFed\u2013ECB Policy Divergence Intensifies Dollar Advantage\nThe primary driver behind the pair\u2019s collapse lies in the U.S.\u2013Eurozone policy divergence. Fed officials have retained flexibility while the ECB appears cornered by slowing growth and stagnant wage momentum. Recent data show Eurozone GDP growth of just 0.2% QoQ and headline inflation falling to 2.6% YoY, both diminishing the case for further tightening.\nAcross the Atlantic, U.S. macro resilience remains intact. The ISM Manufacturing PMI rebounded to 51.4, its first expansion in nearly a year, while U.S. job openings (JOLTS) stood at 9.47 million, defying slowdown expectations. These figures not only justify the Fed\u2019s cautious stance but also elevate the dollar\u2019s yield differential advantage\u2014now at 1.82% over German 10-year Bunds, the widest since August.\nMeanwhile, ECB policymakers including Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Martins Kazaks adopted a balanced tone, acknowledging that inflationary risk has moderated but stopping short of signaling any easing. Their neutrality failed to offset Powell\u2019s firmness, leaving EUR/USD vulnerable to further downside.\nMacro Drivers: Political Risk and Safe-Haven Rotation Fuel USD Demand\nThe ongoing U.S. government shutdown impasse paradoxically boosted dollar demand as investors sought liquidity amid political uncertainty. While the stalemate in Washington threatens fiscal operations, "

Even here, little change is expected. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to vote six-to-three to keep interest rates unchanged. The addition of another rate cut vote will be of some note for particularly attentive central bank policy wonks; however, meaningful changes in the BoE\u2019s interest rate stance are unlikely to materialize with the UK\u2019s headline inflation rate standing at 3.8% as of August, nearly double the BoE\u2019s preferred 2% target band.\nUS ADP Employment Change figures for October are due on Wednesday. ADP numbers have a historically disastrous correlation to actual official datasets from one release to the next, but that is unlikely to stop investors from placing additional importance on the volatile month-to-month ADP figure while the ongoing US government shutdown shuts off the flow of more meaningful sample estimates such as the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) jobs report.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive "

With the U.S. Dollar Index at 99.85 and 10-year gilts at 4.42% | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD (British Pound to U.S. Dollar) Slumps Toward 1.3000 as BoE Dovish Turn, Reeves\u2019 Fiscal Warning, and Fed Resilience Trigger Broad Sterling Selloff\nThe British pound (GBP/USD) has entered a critical downward phase, sliding to a six-month low at 1.3070, pressured by fiscal tightening warnings from UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves, renewed expectations of a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut, and persistent U.S. dollar strength ahead of key macro events. The currency pair, once trading near 1.3725 in September, has now erased nearly 4.8% of its value, with traders eyeing the 1.3000 threshold as the next test amid deep policy divergence between London and Washington.\nThis week\u2019s moves encapsulate a toxic combination of domestic and global factors: fears of higher UK taxes, weak growth data, and a dollar bolstered by fading Fed rate-cut expectations. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), hovering near 99.85, reached its highest level since August, while U.S. Treasury yields firmed above 4.4%, amplifying downside pressure on sterling.\nFiscal Anxiety: Reeves\u2019 Pre-Budget Statement Hammers Confidence in Sterling\nThe pound\u2019s latest selloff intensified after Chancellor Rachel Reeves issued a pre-Budget address outlining her intent to raise taxes to close a \u00a322 billion fiscal gap. Reeves emphasized that \u201cdifficult decisions on tax and spending\u201d are needed to \u201cprotect families from high inflation and borrowing costs,\u201d triggering immediate bond market volatility. The UK 10-year gilt yield fell briefly to 4.38%, before rebounding to 4.42%, as investors priced in slower growth and dovish BoE pressure.\nAnalysts interpret Reeves\u2019 rhetoric as political groundwork for an Autumn Budget that could shift the BoE\u2019s stance toward easing. Reeves\u2019 comments are widely seen as an implicit nudge for Governor Andrew Bailey to accelerate rate cuts, potentially as early as December 2025. This perception contributed to the pound\u2019s breakdown below 1.3100, erasing weeks of accumulation and confirming a bearish technical bias.\nBoE Policy Divide: 35% Odds of a Cut, 3.75% Rate Target in Focus\nMarkets are pricing in a 35% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the upcoming BoE policy meeting, which would lower the bank rate to 3.75%. This follows softer UK data, including headline inflation at 3.1% in October, slightly above forecasts, but far from the double-digit peaks seen in 2023.\nLabor market conditions have cooled, with hiring slowing across manufacturing and construction. The Office for National Statistics reported falling vacancies and subdued wage growth \u2014 key data that reinforce expectations of a dovish shift.\nHowever, BoE officials remain divided. Some members, including MPC\u2019s Breeden, continue to highlight sticky service inflation. Others favor preemptive cuts to stimulate activity. This division fuels volatility around GBP/USD, which currently oscillates between 1.3070\u20131.3140, awaiting a catalyst from Thursday\u2019s announcement.\nU.S. Dollar Strength: Powell\u2019s Resilience and Fed Data Undermine Sterling\nAcross the Atlantic, the U.S. dollar (USD) continues to assert dominance, supported by a resilient economy and hawkish rhetoric from the Federal Reserve. Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that no decision has been made regarding rate cuts, dismissing expectations for a December easing.\nThe U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report added 195,000 jobs in October, beating expectations and reinforcing the Fed\u2019s \u201chigher for longer\u201d stance. Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Chicago Fed\u2019s Austan Goolsbee both stressed that inflation remains above the 2% target, signaling continued policy restraint.\nThis hawkishness keeps the dollar bid, contrasting sharply with the BoE\u2019s dovish drift.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) extends losses after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decided to keep its Official Cash Rate (OCR) steady at 3.6%, as widely expected by markets.\nThe RBA justified its pause by citing still-elevated inflation despite signs of softening domestic demand. Data released last week showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1.3% in the third quarter, beating estimates of 1.1%.\nDuring her press conference, RBA Governor Michele Bullock said that core inflation above 3% was \u201cnot ideal,\u201d though she viewed current policy as \u201cclose to neutral.\u201d Bullock refrained from offering guidance on when and by how much the central bank might resume easing, emphasizing the high degree of uncertainty surrounding inflation dynamics.\nAt the same time, the US Dollar (USD) strengthens, supported by reduced expectations of additional interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (Fed) this year. The US Dollar Index (DXY) hovers near a three-month high around 100.00, reflecting stronger confidence in the Greenback.\nRecent remarks from Fed officials, including Lisa Cook and Austan Goolsbee, have offered mixed signals. Some highlight lingering inflation risks, while others acknowledge a gradual cooling in the labor market. Markets now assign roughly a 70% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December, down from over 90% a week ago.\nLooking ahead, market attention turns to the Australian Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data due later in the day, which could offer fresh insights into domestic economic momentum and shape short-term moves in the Aussie.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

Are traders underestimating the hawkish tone?\n- RBA left cash rate at 3.6%, as expected.\n- Trimmed mean inflation is not back to 2.5% before 2027.\n- Unemployment forecast steady at 4.4%, growth outlook solid.\n- Swaps trim rate cut odds.\nSummary\nThe RBA\u2019s November decision was a hold, but not a dovish one. Updated forecasts show inflation staying above target for years, unemployment barely rising, and growth holding firm despite fewer cuts than previously assumed. Markets have pared back, easing expectations, and AUD/USD is probing key technical levels. With momentum signals neutral, price action will dictate the next move.\nRBA Cash Rate May Have Bottomed\nThe RBA kept Australia\u2019s cash rate steady at 3.6% in November, as widely expected by markets and economists. However, despite suggesting last week\u2019s hot Q3 inflation report was in part driven by temporary factors, it does not see underlying inflation returning to the midpoint of its 2\u20133% target band by the end of 2027, pointing to the potential they may have already delivered the last rate cut for the cycle.\nAs this meeting coincides with the release of updated economic forecasts from the RBA, a lot of its commentary was devoted to the changes to the outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation. The new update is found below.\nSource: RBA\nOn the hotter-than-expected Q3 consumer price inflation report released last week, the RBA described it as \u201cmaterially higher\u201d than its prior forecasts. However, it noted \u201csome of the increase in underlying inflation\u2026was due to temporary factors.\u201d Initially, markets took that line as being dovish, but that\u2019s where the bank\u2019s dovishness ended.\nFor a start, despite pointing to temporary factors partly driving the acceleration, its updated trimmed mean inflation profile does not have it returning to the 2.5% target before the end of 2027, deviating from the view presented three months earlier. And that was with two fewer rate cuts than what were factored in previously, a substantial hawkish recalibration that could have seen the RBA easily forecast it returning to the midpoint or even lower.\nThe RBA also refrained from forecasting a material increase in unemployment despite the shallower rate cut profile, pinning it at 4.4% out to the end of 2027, a tenth lower than the 4.5% level it sits today. Even its growth forecasts remained solid, with near-term expectations revised higher with only minor changes elsewhere. The RBA could have signalled growth risks from continued slightly restrictive policy settings but didn\u2019t. That\u2019s not dovish.\nA Slightly Hawkish Hold\nConsidering trimmed mean inflation is not seen returning to the midpoint over the forecast horizon, and with little weakness seen in the labour market and economy, it hints the RBA may have already delivered its last rate cut for the cycle, even though one more was incorporated into the latest forecasts. That view is bolstered by its acknowledgement that \u201cit will take some time to see the full effects of earlier cash rate reductions.\u201d\nIt also repeated that labour market conditions \u201cremain a little tight\u201d with the recovery in household consumption \u201congoing\u201d and the housing market \u201ccontinuing to strengthen.\u201d\nGiven those statements, and considering what it could have forecast with the shallower rate cut profile, the broad assessment is this was a marginally hawkish hold from the RBA relative to market pricing.\nSource: Bloomberg\nSwaps agree at this stage with a minor hawkish recalibration across the AUD OIS curve, with a 25bp cut by September next year now priced at 77%, down from a touch over 80% beforehand.\nAUD/USD Bounces from Support\nSource: TradingView\nAfter testing support at .6521 immediately following the RBA decision, AUD/USD has bounced to trade at .6529.

Fears of potential intervention from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance and the recent hawkish tone from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda lend further support to the JPY. Ueda hinted last week that a rate hike could come by the end of this year or early next year, reinforcing expectations of a gradual policy shift by the BoJ.\nHowever, the Japanese Yen\u2019s upside remains limited. Uncertainty over the exact timing of the next BoJ rate increase persists, particularly as Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, is expected to pursue expansionary fiscal policies. Such a stance could prompt the central bank to proceed cautiously to avoid derailing economic growth.\nIn the United States, investors remain focused on the Federal Reserve (Fed) outlook. Recent comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, emphasizing the need to maintain a restrictive stance amid inflation still above 2%, support the US Dollar Index (DXY), which hovers around 100.00 on Tuesday.

                "body": "During the last trading session, the USD/JPY began to show a consistent bearish bias, allowing the Japanese yen to post a gain of more than 0.6% in the short term. For now, selling pressure remains steady, driven by a heightened risk aversion sentiment in financial markets. This has once again positioned the yen as a temporary safe-haven currency. If this scenario persists, a sustained bearish trend in the USD/JPY could consolidate over the coming sessions.\nIs the Yen Regaining Its Safe-Haven Role?\nHistorically, the yen has been viewed as an attractive currency during periods of global risk, due to the stability of its interest rates and the predictability of the Bank of Japan\u2019s decisions, in addition to being perceived as a hedging currency for capital preservation. In the current environment, market sentiment has shifted from a \u201crisk-on\u201d phase, characterized by greater risk appetite, to a more pronounced \u201crisk-off\u201d phase. This shift is reflected in the Fear & Greed Index, which has fallen below 25 points, moving from the \u201cfear\u201d zone to \u201cextreme fear\u201d territory \u2014 signaling a steady decline in confidence and a reduction in risk appetite in the short term.\nSource: CNN\nIn this environment of weakened confidence, part of the capital seeking safety may have shifted toward the yen, as higher-risk investments such as equities have lost appeal. This capital rotation could explain the yen\u2019s recent recovery, which may continue in the short term as risk sentiment remains low, exerting persistent selling pressure on the USD/JPY.\nAre Central Banks Influencing the Market?\nThe long-term outlook for USD/JPY, however, paints a different picture. Currently, the Federal Reserve maintains its interest rate at 4.00%, well above the Bank of Japan\u2019s 0.5%, and it remains uncertain whether this interest rate differential will narrow in the short term. According to CME Group data, there is currently a 69.9% probability that the Fed will deliver a 0.25% rate cut at its December meeting, down from 80% the previous week. This uncertainty raises doubts about whether the U.S. will indeed end the year with rates below the current level.\nSource: CMEGroup\nIn this context, if the Federal Reserve decides to hold its rate steady, this could benefit the U.S. bond market, which is also regarded as a safe-haven asset, similar to the yen. As long as Treasuries continue to recover and offer higher yields than Japanese bonds, capital flows may shift back toward the U.S. dollar, limiting the yen\u2019s appreciation in the medium term. If this scenario persists, the USD/JPY could see a renewed bullish momentum in the coming weeks.\nUSD/JPY Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Consistent Uptrend: Since mid-April, the USD/JPY has maintained a steady upward trend, with a dominant bullish bias across the broader technical structure. So far, no significant corrections have threatened this formation, keeping long-term buying pressure intact. If selling pressure fails to strengthen meaningfully, the uptrend could continue to dominate price action in the coming sessions.\n- RSI: The RSI line remains above the 50 level, indicating that buying momentum continues to dominate the 14-session average. However, the indicator has begun to show a downward slope, which could signal a potential shift from bullish to bearish bias if it crosses below the 50 threshold in the near term.\n- MACD: The MACD shows oscillations near the neutral (0) line, suggesting neutral momentum in the short-term moving averages. If this behavior persists, price indecision may become more pronounced, potentially paving the way for a more consistent bearish bias in the short term.\nKey Levels:\n- 154.931 \u2013 Key Resistance: This level represents the highest point since February and serves as the primary barrier for bullish movements. A sustained breakout above it could extend the current uptrend, reinforcing strong buying momentum.\n- 153.256 \u2013 Current Barrier: A recent retracement area that serves as the main sho"

                "body": "The Yen\u2019s strength against the US Dollar is driven by safe-haven demand and potential interventions from Japanese authorities. Speculation about a rate hike by the Bank of Japan, along with a hawkish Federal Reserve outlook, influences market fluctuations. The USD/JPY declines to around 153.50, dropping 0.40% as renewed global risk aversion boosts the Japanese Yen. The Bank of Japan\u2019s hawkish stance, expressed by Governor Kazuo Ueda, signals a possible rate hike, encouraging expectations of a policy shift.\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s growth faces limitations due to uncertainty about the Bank of Japan\u2019s next rate change. The potential for expansionary fiscal policies by Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, could lead to cautious central bank actions. In the US, focus remains on the Federal Reserve perspective. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments emphasising the need for a restrictive stance support the US Dollar Index at around 100.00.\nMonetary Policy Odds\nThere is approximately a 70% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December, down from over 90% a week ago. The forthcoming ADP Employment Report will offer insights into private-sector hiring in the US, which is critical given the ongoing government shutdown\u2019s impact on labor data. Markets will assess private payroll information to adjust monetary policy expectations and USD/JPY direction.\nThe market is caught between a hawkish Bank of Japan and a Federal Reserve that is reluctant to ease policy. This tug-of-war is keeping USD/JPY volatile around the 153.50 level. We must now navigate the uncertainty of when, not if, the BoJ will raise interest rates.\nThe likelihood of a BoJ rate hike is growing, especially after Japan\u2019s national core inflation for October, released last week, came in at 2.9%, slightly above the 2.8% forecast. This persistent inflation reinforces the warnings from Governor Ueda and increases the chance of currency intervention to support the yen if it weakens again. For us, this means the risk of a sudden, sharp JPY rally is very real.\nIn the US, the picture is becoming less clear for the dollar, especially with the prolonged government shutdown delaying key data. The recent ADP Employment report for October showed private payrolls grew by only 110,000, missing expectations and signaling a cooling labor market. This has slightly increased the odds of a Fed rate cut in the first quarter of 2026, putting a cap on the dollar\u2019s strength.\nVolatility Strategies\nWith global risk aversion confirmed by the VIX index holding above 20, we are seeing a significant impact on options pricing. One-month implied volatility for USD/JPY has risen to 11.5%, making long options positions more expensive. This suggests strategies that benefit from this high volatility, such as strangles, might be more appropriate than simple directional bets.\nWe should remember the extreme moves we witnessed back in 2022 and 2023 when central bank policies diverged so sharply. Given the current uncertainty, buying yen call options or US dollar put options offers a defined-risk way to position for a JPY strengthening. These positions can protect against a sudden drop in USD/JPY while limiting potential losses if the pair continues to drift sideways."

The next major technical consideration is eyed at 1.4292-1.4314- a region defined by the 2025 high-week close (HWC) and the 61.8% retracement of yearly range. Look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nWeekly support now rests at former resistance around 1.3978-1.4019. This confluence zone is defined by the 2022 swing high, the 52-week moving average and the 38.2% retracement. Note that the 2022 trendline converges on this region and further highlights the significance of this pivotal zone. USD/CAD needs to stabilize above this level for the June rally to remain viable with broader bullish invalidation now raised the 2022 HWC at 1.3881. A break / close below this threshold would be needed to suggest a more significant high is in place / a larger trend reversal is underway. Subsequent support seen at the 2025 low-week close (LWC) at 1.3734.\nBottom line: USD/CAD has broken above pivotal resistance and keeps the outlook weighted to the topside into the monthly open. From a trading standpoint, losses would need to be limited to 1.3978 IF price is heading higher on this stretch. Look to reduce portions of long-exposure / raise protective stops on a rally towards channel resistance with a close above 1.4183 ultimately needed to fuel the next major leg of this advance.\nKeep in mind we get the release of the ADP jobs report tomorrow in the U.S. with the Canadian employment report on tap Friday.

                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/amid-us-dollar-strength-and-declining-crude-oil-prices-usd-cad-rises-above-1-4050/",
                "body": "USD/CAD rose to around 1.4070 during Asian trading on Tuesday. This climb was due to the US Dollar\u2019s strengthening against the Canadian Dollar as traders revised their expectations for further US Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Fed recently lowered its key rate by 25 basis points, now between 3.75% and 4.0%.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that another rate cut at the December meeting is uncertain. Currently, traders estimate a 70% likelihood of a December rate cut, reduced from 93% previously. Falling crude oil prices also contributed to the Canadian Dollar\u2019s weakness, affecting Canada\u2019s Loonie adversely. Canada is the largest oil exporter to the US, and lower oil prices typically diminish CAD value.\nBank of Canada Interest Rate Trends\nThe Bank of Canada recently reduced its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 2.25%, marking a continued trend of cuts. Governor Tiff Macklem emphasized preparedness to respond to major changes in Canada\u2019s economic outlook. Economists predict potential rate cuts next year, despite a current pause.\nThe Canadian Dollar is driven by factors including BoC interest rates, oil prices, economic health, inflation, and trade balance. Aspects like US economic conditions heavily influence the CAD. BoC actions and oil price shifts have direct impacts on the currency\u2019s strength and balance.\nWith USD/CAD pushing above 1.4070, we are looking at the highest levels since the market turmoil of early 2020. This move is fueled by a strengthening US Dollar and falling crude oil prices, creating a clear trend. The path of least resistance for the pair appears to be upward in the coming weeks.\nThe primary driver is the growing gap in central bank policy. The Federal Reserve sounds hesitant to cut rates further, while the Bank of Canada has cut twice in a row and signaled openness to more easing. This has pushed the interest rate differential to over 150 basis points, making it more attractive to hold US dollars.\nPressure on the Canadian Dollar\nPressure on the Canadian dollar is also coming from the energy markets, a critical factor for the nation\u2019s economy. WTI crude oil has recently broken below $65 a barrel for the first time since mid-2023, as recent data from the Energy Information Administration continues to show a build in inventories. This price drop directly weakens the commodity-linked loonie.\nGiven this backdrop, we see value in strategies that profit from a rising USD/CAD. Buying call options with expirations in late December or January 2026 offers a way to capture potential upside while defining our maximum risk. This allows us to position for a move towards the 1.4200 level, which has not been seen in over five years.\nWe will be watching for any shift in tone from upcoming Fed speakers and Canadian economic data. This morning\u2019s merchandise trade report already showed a wider-than-expected deficit, confirming the economic drag from US tariffs. Any further signs of Canadian economic weakness would likely add more fuel to the pair\u2019s upward trend."

                "body": "It's budget day in Canada and it's a big one as it's Prime Minister Mark Carney's first edition. He's promised a transformational budget that's likely to include some heavy cuts to operational government spending along with some heavy spending on capital projects. What's less clear is how tax policy will change. There is some suspicion that he will cut corporate taxes in order to stay ahead of US rates but that could be offset somehow on the personal side.\nCBC today reports that the budget will include 'a change in the tax structure to promote competition.'\nThe source, who spoke to CBC News on the condition they not be named since they were not authorized to speak about the budget before it's public, said the changes to the tax structure are aimed at spurring growth and removing risks to invest in Canada.\nFor the market, the bottom line will be a big one with the deficit forecast to rise to $70-100 billion from $42 billion projected a year ago. I don't see that number as a problem for the loonie as Canada's debt-to-GDP is well below US and international standards. If anything, some growth-boosting policies could boost the loonie and force the BOC to hold (or even hike down the line)."

                "body": "USD/JPY Outlook: Japanese Yen Dominates Amid Wall Street Selloff\nThe Japanese yen was the strongest FX major during a risk-off session on Tuesday, though the US dollar was not far behind. A sharp decline in Palantir\u2019s stock despite a positive outlook, combined with warnings from the Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley CEOs that a pullback could be \u201chealthy,\u201d weighed heavily on Wall Street sentiment \u2014 ultimately prompting the very pullback they warned of.\nNasdaq 100 futures led Wall Street lower, falling 2% to a seven-day low in their worst session in more than three weeks. Palantir (PLTR) was the worst performer, dropping 9% from its record high and sliding below $200. The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, with eight of its 11 sectors declining, led by Information Technology (-2.5%) and Consumer Discretionary (-1.5%). The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped 3%, as traders grew concerned that the AI rally may be overextended.\nWhile the yen was the preferred destination for risk-off flows among currency traders, the US dollar also regained some of its safe-haven appeal less than a week after the Fed delivered a relatively hawkish interest rate cut. Traders are also likely mindful of recent comments from Japan\u2019s finance officials, who continue to watch the currency \u201cvery closely\u201d in the hope that verbal intervention can stem volatility.\nView related analysis:\n- US Dollar Probes 6-Month High, AUD/USD Steady Into RBA\n- The Nasdaq-to-Bitcoin Correlation Is Alive and Well (During Risk-Off)\n- US Dollar Eyes Breakout as EUR/USD, GBP/USD Probe Support, USD/JPY Rallies\n- Gold Shows Tentative Signs Of Stability, Options Hint At Mild Recovery\nUS Dollar Index (DXY) Technical Analysis\nThe US dollar index has closed above 100 for the first time in six months \u2014 though only slightly. The combination of a less-dovish Fed and safe-haven demand continues to shake dollar bears out of the tree, allowing the greenback to rise for a fifth consecutive day. My bias for a deeper wave C and a move closer to the May high remains in place, with the possibility of a rally towards the 138.2% Fibonacci extension near 101.50 still on the cards.\nStill, the marginal close above 100, alongside a fifth-day high, could warrant at least some caution around current levels. However, momentum remains clearly behind the dollar\u2019s bullish camp, and dips seem more likely to be bought than sold for now.\nOnce wave C is complete, I anticipate momentum will realign with the broader bearish move from the January high to the June low.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView U.S. Dollar Index Futures\nJapanese Yen (JPY) Technical Analysis\nYen pairs were lower across the board, even against the mighty US dollar. The performance of the major currencies against the yen serves as a useful lesson in relative strength.\n- The New Zealand dollar led the declines, with NZD/JPY falling 1.3% in its worst session in 17 days. The RBNZ retains a dovish bias, making the Kiwi dollar more sensitive to risk-off flows than usual. The cross printed a firm daily close beneath its 200-day EMA \u2014 a level bears may look to fade into should it be retested.\n- The Australian dollar could have fallen further were it not for the relatively hawkish RBA meeting on Tuesday, where policymakers held rates as expected and trimmed their forecasts to allow for just one 25 bp cut in 2026. AUD/JPY fell 1.1% and closed back below 100, though support has been found around its 20-day EMA for now.\n- The Swiss franc weakened against the yen for a third straight day, with CHF/JPY dropping below 190 and extending its decline from the record high to 1.7%.\n- A bearish outside day formed on USD/JPY as the yen found slightly more appeal than the US dollar for safe-haven flows. However, its broader bullish trend remains intact and could still attract dip-buyers.\n- EUR/JPY fell beneath its prior swing low on the daily chart, warning of a potential trend change \u2014 or at least the start of a three-wave corrective move, of whi"

Here lies an opportunity for a more accessible, regulated entry into the world of Bitcoin.\nStriking the Balance with Regulatory Frameworks\nOne of the IBIT\u2019s standout attributes is its solid regulatory grounding, a keystone in cultivating trust among institutional players. With an annual management fee set at a competitive 0.39%, this fund operates as a \u201cwrapper\u201d around BlackRock's established U.S. Bitcoin Trust, which holds an eye-watering $98 billion in managed assets. This compliance isn\u2019t just a box-ticking exercise; it reassures those investors who desire safety in this volatile market, transforming the landscape for cautious participants who previously shied away from direct crypto involvement.\nImplications for Altcoins Amid Institutional Rush\nThe advent of BlackRock into the Australian crypto market raises crucial questions about the fate of altcoins. As institutional dollars flock to Bitcoin via the IBIT, lesser-known cryptocurrencies may struggle to capture the spotlight without the heavyweight backing of a giant like BlackRock. This movement could create hurdles for existing altcoin initiatives, making them appear less viable in a market increasingly dominated by a favored few.\nRecord Holdings and Liquidity Rejuvenation\nRecent statistics reveal a seismic shift in Bitcoin holdings, with institutional investors now controlling around 1.69 million BTC\u2014not a figure to overlook. This surge reflects a growing conviction among institutions that Bitcoin is evolving into a robust asset class. With formidable players like BlackRock at the helm of Bitcoin ETF movements, we can anticipate a buoyancy in market liquidity that may further reinforce Bitcoin\u2019s foundational status within diversified investment portfolios.\nThe Double-Edged Sword of BlackRock's Influence\nYet, BlackRock's substantial imprint on the cryptocurrency realm unveils a complex duality. On one hand, it fortifies market integrity and fosters investor confidence; on the other, it risks suppressing competition. Critics are wary that the influence wielded by a single titan can stifle innovation, posing challenges for smaller crypto projects and asset managers striving to carve out their own identities in a space now dominated by established giants. The narrative ensuing from BlackRock's ETF roll-out could leave budding entrants beleaguered in their quest for legitimacy.\nCharting the Course for Crypto's Future\nAs the iShares Bitcoin ETF anticipates significant capital inflows, industry watchers are abuzz with speculation. What might this mean for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem? Growing institutional interest will likely heighten demand for regulated investment products, opening doors for groundbreaking financial instruments tied to cryptocurrencies. Startups and Web3 innovators could find themselves pressed to rethink their strategies, innovatively linking crypto with fiat solutions while tackling the nuances of compliance.\nConclusion\nThe impending arrival of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF on the ASX marks a watershed moment for not just Australian investors, but the entirety of the cryptocurrency market.

                "body": "Ethereum (ETH) had a very rough trading day on November 3, 2025. The price fell by about 7%, dropping from $3,910 in the morning to $3,610 by the day\u2019s end. The lowest point was around $3,579 in the afternoon before a small recovery. It was one of Ethereum\u2019s sharpest single-day falls in months, leaving it over 25% below its August high of $4,950.\nThe main reason for the panic was a hawkish comment from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He said another interest rate cut in December is \u201cnot a foregone conclusion\u201d after October\u2019s small cut. Powell also warned that high rates were pushing some parts of the economy \u201cinto recession\u201d.His comments made traders nervous, and they started selling risky assets like crypto. So, the earlier optimism in the morning quickly turned into fear.\nThe crash led to a wave of forced sell-offs (liquidations) in crypto futures. Over $1.14 billion in long positions were wiped out across the market. Ethereum alone saw $85.6 million in long trades liquidated in 24 hours. Around 162,000 traders lost nearly $396 million that day. Analysts said these liquidations made the fall worse but could also mean the market was \u201cclearing out weak positions\u201d.\nEven with the chaos, big investors (called whales) were buying the dip. In October, wallets holding 1,000\u2013100,000 ETH added 1.64 million ETH (~$6.4 billion worth). As per the report by TechStock2, Analyst Shawn Young (MEXC) said, \u201cRecalibration into higher-beta assets is expected\u2026 Ether fits this positioning well,\u201d explaining whale buying. However, some old holders sold part of their ETH as the Holder Accumulation Ratio fell from 31% to 30.4%. This showed mixed investor sentiment \u2014 whales buying, old holders selling.\nIn October 2025, stablecoin transactions on Ethereum hit $2.82 trillion, showing very strong use. Daily transactions stayed near all-time highs. U.S.-based ETH ETFs held over $300 billion in reserves by August. Big firms like BlackRock were also adding ETH. This shows Ethereum is shifting from just speculation to a real financial network.\nETH started Nov. 3 around $3,908 and peaked at $3,912, then dropped fast to $3,579. It closed near $3,610, down 7.5% for the day. The fall pushed ETH 27% below its all-time high. Bitcoin only fell 15\u201316% from its top, showing Ethereum was hit harder. Traders watched if ETH could stay above $3,500\u2013$3,600 support levels.\nETF investors also pulled out money \u2014 $1.15 billion in Bitcoin ETF outflows in late October. On crypto Twitter, traders joked that \u201cUptober\u201d had turned into \u201cDownvember\u201d.\nEthereum\u2019s staking participation keeps increasing \u2014 about 36.1 million ETH now locked. This means fewer ETH are available to sell, reducing supply pressure. Gas fees stayed very low (1\u20135 Gwei) during the sell-off, showing no panic on-chain. In October, more than $2.8 trillion moved on Ethereum \u2014 more than many countries\u2019 GDP. Developer activity also stayed high, with work continuing on the \u201cFusaka\u201d upgrade set for December 2025. Fusaka aims to cut transaction costs and boost speed, improving scalability.\nEthereum\u2019s RSI (momentum indicator) dropped to 31, meaning it\u2019s oversold and may rebound. Key supports, $3,550\u2013$3,600, and then $3,300 if it falls lower. Resistance zones, $3,800\u2013$3,900, then $4,000\u2013$4,100 for a bullish comeback. Analysts say ETH might consolidate between $3,650\u2013$3,850 before a rebound. But if it breaks below $3,300, it could slide toward $3,000. The Nov. 7 U.S. jobs report could change sentiment \u2014 weak data might lift crypto, strong data could hurt it.\nStill, risks remain \u2014 competition from Solana and Cardano, high fees, and regulatory pressure. Analyst Shawn Young (MEXC) summed it up, \u201cThe macro structure appears constructive \u2014 the network continues to scale, transaction demand remains robust, and staking keeps absorbing supply pressure\u201d. Ethereum\u2019s long-term story stays strong \u2014 active network, big developer base, and real-world use.\nOn November 3, 2025, Ethereum\u2019s drop below $3,500 was caused by a mix of gl"

The modern crypto industry is a winding maze of fresh ideas and tools. As you may conclude, basic virtual currency skills are insufficient today.\nIf you are keen on getting into crypto like a big game participant, this overview is designed to decipher Solana (SOL), a high-speed blockchain that is now leading the way. You can hold onto it as a wise investment or even buy solana with credit card to promote growth in your digital portfolio.\nIn this overview, we aim to explain the Solana blockchain and its features, and offer a list of core payment methods for this currency.\nHistorical Background\nTo make the most of the crypto space, the chronological foundation can help turn vision into reality. First off, Solana\u2019s development kick-started in 2017, when a talented developer, Anatoly Yakovenko, published a chronicle of the Proof of History (PoH) mechanism. This advanced consensus algorithm was engineered to automate the ordering of transactions on the blockchain, scaling down turnaround times and ensuring accelerated settlement.\nShortly thereafter, Greg Fitzgerald and Stephen Ukridge got on board, initiating the project named Loom. The initial testnet was performed in February 2018. Throughout that time, the blueprint transformed radically, developing a long-term interest and thriving crypto culture.\nIn April 2018, the SOL token sale came into action, raising over $20 million by July 2019. Meanwhile, the development of new blockchain versions was underway.\nThe mainnet and Solana cryptocurrency (SOL) were officially launched in March 2020. That same year, the Solana Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to maintaining the blockchain, was established. In October 2020, the Solana-Ethereum cross-chain bridge and the first stablecoin (SOLUSDT) went into orbit quickly.\nToday, the platform fuels traders and developers\u2019 urge for progressive tools, ranging from the Solana compiler to its own blockchain smartphone, Saga. In March 2025, the Solana (SOL) futures were introduced as an ultimate addition to this long-lasting blockchain journey.\nSolana\u2019s Technical Features\nSolana is a blockchain on which the SOL coin is based. Interestingly, a small denomination of the coin is nicknamed lamport (0.000000001 SOL) in honor of Leslie Lamport, a prominent figure in the sphere of distributed systems theory.\nAt present, SOL is incessantly traded on diverse exchanges. Its price undergoes volatile changes, depending on market conditions.\nLike any notorious cryptocurrency, Solana demonstrates full-fledged potential, reinforced by its unique technical features. In particular, this platform is famous for its fast performance. If you crave speed and flexibility all rolled into one, Solana will definitely be the optimal choice.\nLet\u2019s compare Solana\u2019s number of transactions per second to a couple of other well-recognized blockchains:\n- Bitcoin: 4-5 transactions per second;\n- Ethereum: 15 transactions per second;\n- Solana: up to 65,000 transactions per second.\nConclusively, Solana runs more than 16,000 times faster than other cryptocurrencies. This speedy blockchain platform is ideal for breaking free of limiting transactions and securing your funds in no time.\nAnother remarkable feature of this robust network is smart contracts built into the blockchain system. Just like Ethereum, Solana is made up for building applications and services rather than trading on exchanges. In simple terms, Solana can be defined as a speedier analogue of Ethereum and other trustworthy blockchains.\nIn addition, Solana is perceived by many as a high-throughput network that incorporates a hybrid Proof-of-History + Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. What does it mean? PoS mechanism is used to confirm transactions by validators, verifying their legitimate origins. Meanwhile, PoH guarantees node synchronization, responsible for smooth transactions.\nIn a nutshell, Proof o"

                "body": "Solana Price Prediction\u2014Can Solana ETF Inflows and Whale Bets Power a 2025 Comeback?\nOver the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has seen a marked decline, with blue-chip assets posting significant losses. Solana (SOL), in particular, has emerged as one of the biggest decliners, shedding about 6% and trading near the $175 mark. This comes as a surprise to some, especially considering the positive ecosystem developments and strengthening institutional interest, including new Solana spot ETFs.\nIn this article, we provide a detailed assessment of the factors driving Solana\u2019s decline, recent updates in the Solana ecosystem, activity from on-chain whales, the potential boost from partnerships like that with Western Union, and a comprehensive price forecast.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nWhy Is the Crypto Market Going Down?\nThe current decline in Solana price is part of a broader correction across the cryptocurrency sector. Several macroeconomic and crypto-specific factors are at play:\n-\nOutflows Across Major Assets: Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen net outflows from exchange-traded products (ETPs), as have altcoins, intensifying sell pressure across the board. Bitcoin, for example, notched some of its largest ETF outflows in weeks, and Ethereum faced additional pressure as spot ETFs debuted to diminished enthusiasm.\n-\nCrypto-Specific Headwinds: Security incidents\u2014including DeFi exploits and scams on various blockchains\u2014as well as concerns around large token unlock events, have added to negative sentiment.\nThese combined elements have affected Solana price, with many investors fearful of further downside, even as new financial products like the Solana ETF gain traction.\nSolana Price Performance and Market Triggers\nSolana price has dropped approximately 6% within the most recent trading session, dipping toward the key $175 support zone. Network-related activity has also shown a short-term slowdown; for example, Solana\u2019s DEX volume has declined notably, and there has been concern over upcoming token unlocks worth over $1.7 billion. Additionally, the Solana ecosystem was recently hit by a high-profile $107 million rug pull incident associated with the Libra project. This has amplified caution among retail investors and contributed to short-term volatility in Solana price.\nDespite these setbacks, Solana\u2019s network strength remains evident in a broader context, especially as new initiatives and institutional movements unfold.\nSolana ETF Launch: A Vote of Confidence from Wall Street\nA defining moment for Solana price and perception has been the substantial inflows into Solana ETF products. Wall Street signaled strong market confidence with the launch of the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which saw more than $417 million in inflows\u2014outperforming even established Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in its debut week, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Similarly, the newly-launched Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) attracted over $1 million on its first day.\nThese developments in the Solana ETF market underscore rising institutional conviction in Solana\u2019s long-term potential. Increased institutional exposure via Solana ETF not only boosts Solana price sentiment but also reinforces Solana\u2019s profile among large-scale investors.\nOn-Chain Activity: Whale Movements During the Dip\nAmidst the recent pullback in Solana price, noteworthy on-chain data shows continued whale confidence. According to Lookonchain, a prominent Solana whale placed a $26 million long position at the height of the decline, employing significant leverage. This bold move suggests that major market participants still see opportunity in Solana price at these levels, with anticipation of a future rebound.\nFurthermore, there have been large SOL transfers between notable crypto trading firms, pointing to strategic positioning and continued activity from key stakeholders in the Solana network.\nWestern Union Partnership and Ecosystem Growth\nWhat\u2019s the latest?

Key companies earnings reports, government economic releases to influence market future and outlook\nSynopsis\nUS stock market futures, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq today saw a decline as tech stocks led a pullback after Monday\u2019s AI-driven rally. Amazon\u2019s OpenAI deal lifted optimism, but Palantir\u2019s post-earnings drop and mixed global trends kept investors cautious. Futures fell ahead of key earnings and delayed economic data.\nTech Stocks Pull Back After AI-Fueled Gains\nUS stock market futures, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq today opened lower as investors reassessed the surge in technology shares.S&P 500 futures dropped 0.9%, Nasdaq 100 futures fell 1.3%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures declined 0.6%. Monday\u2019s rally had been fueled by Amazon\u2019s new partnership with OpenAI, which pushed the Nasdaq Composite up 0.46% and the S&P 500 higher by 0.17%, though the Dow fell 0.48%.\nThe deal, valued at $38 billion, will see Amazon Web Services providing computing power for OpenAI\u2019s next-generation artificial intelligence models. The announcement strengthened Amazon\u2019s position in AI services, helping major indices recover some earlier losses before Tuesday\u2019s decline.\nPalantir Falls Despite Positive Earnings\nPalantir Technologies reported strong third-quarter results, raising its annual revenue outlook to $4.4 billion and beating analyst estimates. Despite this, Palantir stock fell over 4% in extended trading as analysts pointed to an overvaluation.The company\u2019s shares had risen more than 150% this year, closing Monday at $207.18, with a price-to-sales ratio of 85\u2014the highest in the S&P 500 Index. Analysts at D.A. Davidson commented that the stock\u2019s valuation was disconnected from fundamentals, even with a 63% growth rate.\nPalantir\u2019s decline reflected broader market caution around high-growth technology companies that had surged due to AI-driven expectations but now face valuation scrutiny.\nInvestors Await Key Earnings Reports\nUS stock market futures, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq today also reacted to anticipation surrounding upcoming corporate results. Over 100 companies are set to report earnings this week.Key reports expected include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Uber (UBER), Spotify (SPOT), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Pfizer (PFE), Pinterest (PINS), and Rivian (RIVN).\nThese earnings are expected to provide insight into consumer demand and corporate spending amid ongoing uncertainty in the US economy and potential delays in federal economic reporting.\nGovernment Shutdown Delays Economic Data\nInvestors are watching developments in Washington as the US government shutdown continues. The shutdown has delayed several key economic releases, including the monthly jobs report. This delay has reduced clarity on labor market conditions and inflation trends, making it difficult for investors to assess the Federal Reserve\u2019s next policy moves.The lack of data has added to market volatility, as traders rely more on earnings and global signals to guide short-term positions.\nMarket Indicators Show Mixed Global Picture\nAt 3:41 a.m. EST on November 4, Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.25%, S&P 500 futures declined 0.94%, and Dow Jones futures dropped 0.73%. The US 10-year Treasury yield hovered near 4.09%, while WTI crude oil futures traded around $60.67 per barrel. Gold spot prices fell to about $4,004 per ounce.In Europe, markets opened lower on Tuesday as investors booked profits following recent gains and monitored corporate results. In Asia, major markets also traded weaker.\nThe Hang Seng Index dropped 0.79%, Shanghai Composite declined 0.41%, Shenzhen Component lost 1.67%, Nikkei fell 1.74%, and Topix slipped 0.65%.\nGlobal Outlook and Investor Sentiment\nUS stock market futures, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq today reflected a cautious tone in global markets.

The FTSE indices were dragged down alongside losses for Germany\u2019s DAX, France\u2019s CAC 40, and over a 1% drop in US stock futures. Falling UK government bond yields and a softer pound underscored investors\u2019 shift to safe-haven assets, while sectors tied to commodities\u2014especially metal miners\u2014suffered as a stronger US dollar and falling copper prices weighed on outlooks. Financial giants like HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Barclays all lost over 1%, pointing to widespread pressure in the sector. Even upbeat news, like BP\u2019s better-than-expected profit, couldn\u2019t reverse three consecutive weekly losses, while Diversified Energy\u2019s near-10% surge on strong guidance was a rare bright spot.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Investor nerves are driving volatility.\nThe FTSE\u2019s decline and weakness across European bourses highlight growing caution among investors, faced with uncertain fiscal plans and softer economic signals. Commodity and banking stocks are taking the brunt\u2014pressured by falling resource prices and global currency moves\u2014while even consumer-facing companies like Associated British Foods are feeling the sting from gloomy profit outlooks. Despite Diversified Energy\u2019s rally, overall sentiment remains subdued, and with the Bank of England geared up to hold rates steady, markets may need to buckle up for more swings ahead.\nThe bigger picture: Policy signals are shaping expectations everywhere.\nRachel Reeves\u2019 upfront message hints that the UK government is preparing the public for budgets focused on stability over aggressive stimulus. Coupled with easing inflation and moderating wage growth, these signals could bring Bank of England rate cuts into view if growth flags. As governments across Europe and beyond navigate similar fiscal headwinds, market attitudes may stay sensitive to every policy hint\u2014reminding investors that what happens in one capital can ripple quickly through global markets.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nRosa Leo \u2022 30 Oct 2025\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 17 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "DAX News Today, Nov 5: Wall Street Tech Fluctuations Affect German Indices\nToday, the DAX index reflects the challenges of global tech fluctuations, spurred by volatility in the U.S. tech sector. With the DAX currently priced at 23,949.11, it marks a 0.76% drop from earlier figures. Wall Street\u2019s robust tech earnings have not carried over to Germany, showcasing distinct market dynamics. Such differences underscore the broader influence of international markets on the DAX, primarily led by tech sector movements. The interaction between these markets paints a complex picture for investors assessing the DAX\u2019s current performance.\nImpact of Wall Street on the DAX\nWall Street\u2019s tech sector continues to create ripples, strongly influencing the German stock market. NASDAQ\u2019s fluctuations have especially affected indices like the DAX, as they opened today at 23,801.24, below yesterday\u2019s close of 24,132.41. Analysts suggest a response to Wall Street\u2019s tech gains, not quite reaching German firms. This reflects a divergence in investor sentiment, explaining the DAX\u2019s struggle to match American counterparts.\nDAX News Updates on Tagesschau provide insights into these shifts, highlighting how external tech movements drive the DAX\u2019s volatility.\nVolatility in the Tech Sector\nThe technology sector on Wall Street, with significant players like Apple and Microsoft, remains volatile. Such movements impact indices globally, including our focus symbol, ^GDAXI. Investors note this sector\u2019s unpredictability, influencing decisions within the DAX. Current Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels indicate tension between supply and demand with the DAX high at 23,974.31 today.\nGerman Stock Market Response\nIn Germany, despite robust industrial performance, the stock market has shown mixed responses to tech-driven turbulence internationally. While Wall Street saw 7% sector gains, the DAX declined, underscoring tech impact. The 0.76% drop today emphasizes it. For investors, understanding the broader market cues becomes crucial. RSI indicators reflect a median position at 50.03, pointing towards neutral momentum but rising concerns.\nInvestment Sentiment\nInvestor sentiment varies with these international tech swings. The DAX\u2019s underperformance amidst positive Wall Street momentum shows caution. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signals at -36.36 illustrate waning investor confidence on short-term growth. Analysts caution about rising interest-rate jitters influencing this sentiment. Social discussions like this Twitter mention highlight cautious optimism reflecting tech influences on DAX strategies.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe German DAX is caught amidst waves of international tech fluctuations. Despite Wall Street\u2019s promising tech earnings, the DAX has not mirrored this buoyancy. Today\u2019s decline to 23,949.11 from previous heights calls for careful strategy. For investors, understanding these dynamics is essential. Comparing Wall Street\u2019s tech influence to the DAX offers insights into potential market shifts. Tools like Meyka can provide real-time insights and predictive analytics to navigate these complex landscapes effectively, offering a clearer understanding of market movements and future trends.\nFAQs\nWall Street\u2019s tech fluctuations directly influence global indices like the DAX. Strong U.S. tech earnings can buoy global confidence, but discrepancies remain due to regional market dynamics influencing performance differently.\nDiffering market conditions, regulatory environments, and investor sentiments contribute to the DAX not always mirroring Wall Street. Local economic factors and sector-specific challenges also play pivotal roles.\nInvestors should monitor international tech movements and interest rate changes. Tools that offer real-time data, like Meyka, can aid in analyzing these complex interactions, helping to identify potential investment opportunities.\nDisclaimer:\nThe content shared by Meyka AI PTY LTD is solely for research and informational pur"

That's up marginally from 52.4 in September, and it moves further above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.\nIn the currency market, the Aussie dollar is trading at $0.648 on Wednesday.\nThe Japanese stock market is trading sharply lower on Wednesday, extending the losses in the previous four sessions, following the broadly negative cues from Wall Street overnight. The Nikkei 225 is tumbling 4.7 percent to the 49,100 level, with weakness across most sectors led by index heavyweights and technology stocks.\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 Index closed the morning"

                "body": "Stocks fell on Tuesday, pressured by declines in artificial intelligence-related names like Palantir, as investors grew increasingly concerned about valuations in the bull market-leading shares.\nThe S&P 500 declined 1.17% to close at 6,771.55, while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 2.04% to finish at 23,348.64. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 251.44 points, or 0.53%, to 47,085.24.\nPalantir shares shed about 8%, even after the software company beat Wall Street's estimates for the third quarter and gave strong guidance, fueled by growth in its AI business. The stock, which has risen more than 150% this year, trades at more than 200 times forward earnings. That means investors in that name and the other AI stocks expect the companies to keep ratcheting up their profit and revenue forecasts by large magnitudes in order to justify investors continuing to buy the shares.\nOracle, which sports a forward P/E of more than 33 moved almost 4% lower, chipping away at its almost 50% gain this year. Chipmaker AMD, which has more than doubled this year, lost nearly 4%. Other AI stocks such as Nvidia and Amazon pulled back as well.\nAI stock gains have driven the S&P 500's forward price-earnings ratio to above 23, near its highest level since 2000, per FactSet. As those stocks have lifted the broader market to new heights in recent months, Anthony Saglimbene of Ameriprise said in an interview with CNBC that without a pullback, valuations are beginning to get \"really stretched.\"\n\"We haven't really seen any major corrections or any real pressure on stocks since April,\" the firm's chief market strategist said. \"Profits are good, but I think investors are starting to ask themselves, based on the pace of [capital expenditure] investments from some of these key Big Tech companies, 'Are you going to see the profit growth over the next year to justify the levels of capex?'\"\nComments from chief executives at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley added to the loss of confidence among investors Tuesday. Overnight, Goldman's David Solomon said it's \"likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months.\" Additionally, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said: \"We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect.\"\n\"Fundamentals are still good, but I would fully expect that you're going to see a little bit of some periods of pullback,\" Saglimbene said. \"Whether that leads to a 5% or 10% or 15% correction by the end of the year, we'll have to see.\"\nWall Street is coming off a mixed session, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both ended Monday higher, while the Dow fell more than 200 points. More than 300 stocks in the broad-market index closed in the red in the previous session, adding to concerns about weak breadth and high levels of tech concentration \u2014 particularly after the number of S&P 500 stocks that gained last month was smaller than the amount that declined.\n\"Breath in the market has been pretty narrow for the last several months,\" Saglimbene added. \"If there is a slowing momentum or a near-term downturn in AI or tech, there really [aren't] other areas that have performed as well, and if we don't have a lot of clear data on the economy, and profitability across the rest of the S&P 500 isn't as strong, where do you go?\""

                "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. -- When Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. takes the field at AT&T Stadium on Monday night against the Dallas Cowboys, his dad will be sitting at home, 1,500 miles away in Philadelphia, watching on TV.\nThat will be a struggle for the Hall of Fame wide receiver.\nAny time Marvin Harrison Sr. turns on his son's games, he sees an NFL that looks vastly different from the sport he left in 2008 after playing 13 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts. He sees a quarterback primarily in the shotgun, his son being moved around the field from wideout to the slot and back again, and motions from every direction.\nHe also sees a Cardinals offense that's struggled to produce yards and points as it has slogged to a 2-5 record, heading into \"Monday Night Football\" on a five-game losing streak.\n\"It's very hard for me to watch the Cardinals' offense,\" Harrison Sr. told ESPN. \"And you can quote me on that.\"\nA season and a half into his son's NFL career, the elder Harrison has been forced to grapple with being a former player who's the father of a current player. The balance needed to navigate that isn't always easy to find. Harrison Sr. can't help but watch his son's games with the critical eye of a former player, and he wants, desperately, to help his son, to tell him what to do, to try to fix Arizona's issues. But Harrison Jr. is an adult, a well-compensated professional, a fourth pick, and Harrison Sr. knows it's his time to sit on the sideline, watch and try to enjoy his oldest son's professional career.\nBut it's hard. The 53-year-old Harrison Sr. is aware of how he sounds.\n\"The style of offense that I am accustomed to, that I'm used to watching as a professional eye, as a wide receiver ... I just can't relate to watching that [current] offense, that style of offense,\" Harrison Sr. said. \"Basically, I can't relate to what goes on there.\n\"I think that's just peacefully put, without pointing fingers or anything. It's just me. I'm giving you the professional eye. I can't relate to it. It don't add up to me. I can't deal with it.\"\nThose words aren't new to his son.\nHarrison Jr. has heard his dad's concerns and complaints dating back to last season. But Harrison Sr. walks a tightrope when he brings up football with his son, a rare occurrence these days. He stays away from talking about the day-to-day, not wanting to be an armchair quarterback from across the country because he's not there, in the meetings, and he doesn't understand the intricacies of the Cardinals' scheme like he did the Peyton Manning-led offense in Indianapolis.\n\"I don't get into what goes on the field and the things that I see,\" Harrison Sr. said. \"I just leave it alone. I don't even bother bringing it up no more.\"\nThat might be wise, considering the Cardinals' struggles, especially in the passing game. They're 23rd in passing yards per game at 199.9, 26th in passing yards per play at 5.78 and quarterback Kyler Murray is 24th in QBR at 44.1. Murray is ranked 29th in yards per attempt, 31st in yards per dropback and 33rd in yards per attempt while throwing six touchdowns and three picks in five starts.\nJacoby Brissett will start a third straight game in place of Murray (foot) on Monday, but it's possible Murray will see some action.\nHarrison Jr. averages 56.6 receiving yards per game and has 40 targets over seven games, which is 54th, and he has just two touchdown catches. ESPN's receiver score ranks him as the NFL's 48th-best receiver -- a notable improvement from 2024, when he ranked 93rd.\nHe is second on the Cardinals in targets and receiving yards per game behind tight end Trey McBride (66 targets, 60.1 yards per game).\nWhen father and son talk on the phone, whether that's a couple of days in a row or if weeks pass between calls, they typically stick to discussing Harrison Jr.'s younger brother, Jett, a high school sophomore at St. Joseph's Prep School in Philadelphia who is in line to be the next great Harrison receiver. Or they don't talk about f"

                "body": "Concerned about subscription price increases, the ERP giant\u2019s client base is having difficulty making the business case to upgrade to the cloud, new survey finds.\nA huge percentage of SAP customers are wary about the company\u2019s efforts to move its customers away from perpetual licenses to subscription pricing, with most worried about future pricing increases, according to a recent survey.\nSAP is ending support for its legacy ECC ERP solution, generally sold with a perpetual license, at the end of the year, with some extended maintenance options available from SAP until 2030.\nThe vendor has encouraged customers to switch to the subscription-based S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, but many customers have resisted. Nine in 10 SAP customers are concerned about rising and unpredictable subscription costs over time, according to a survey of 455 organizations by Rimini Street, a company offering third-party support for software from SAP and other vendors.\nIn addition, most of those surveyed have questions about S/4HANA\u2019s return on investment, with 95% saying that making an ROI case for the newer ERP solution is difficult or takes significant effort.\nThe survey points both to concerns about SAP\u2019s pricing models and to customer questions about the future of the ERP market, says Scott Hays, senior director for portfolio marketing at Rimini Street.\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough understanding that giving up perpetual licenses and switching to a subscription is something that limits future options for clients,\u201d he says. \u201cIt also relinquishes control.\u201d\nNearly half of those surveyed don\u2019t plan to be running S/4HANA in the cloud five years from now, and nearly a quarter plan to stay with on-premises ECC.\n\u201cThey believe that there is a much longer lifetime value of the software that they implemented than SAP is willing to support,\u201d Hays says. \u201cSAP has announced the end of mainstream maintenance deadlines, and that has created a lot of consternation.\u201d\nSAP cloud revenue rises\nWhile there\u2019s a significant percentage of ECC users that have not yet made the move to S/4HANA, SAP says it is happy with the progress toward the SaaS model. SAP reported that cloud ERP revenue increased 31% between the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2025, according to a statement.\nThese results indicate \u201cstrong uptake of core cloud offerings like S/4HANA,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cThese figures suggest that customers are not only subscribing but doing so at scale.\u201d\nThe questions about licensing don\u2019t appear to be related to the quality of SAP\u2019s solutions. Many SAP customers see the vendor\u2019s ERP software as high quality and, in some situations, irreplaceable, Rimini Street\u2019s Hays notes. At the same time, many see an all-in-one ERP solution as an outdated concept and instead want to deploy best-of-breed solutions for specific ERP needs, he says.\nNearly eight in 10 SAP customers surveyed expect to deploy a modular ERP approach and engage with multiple vendors in the future, according to the survey.\n\u201cInnovation is happening very rapidly outside of the big software vendors that we all know of,\u201d Hays says. \u201cInnovation is happening with IT providers, software providers, AI providers and agent builders that we\u2019ve never heard of. Putting all your eggs into the SAP basket is going to limit your future options.\u201d\nStaying with SAP\nWhile Hays isn\u2019t alone in predicting that a more modular approach to ERP is coming, there hasn\u2019t been a significant shift in the market so far, says Gartner analyst Mike Tucciarone. While SAP customers have concerns about licensing, relatively few have decided to dump SAP, he adds.\n\u201cSAP ERP remains a trusted solution, and while a more composable or fragmented approach is possible as technology evolves, it is still very uncommon among organizations and CIOs today,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have not observed widespread movement in this direction yet.\u201d\nConcerns about subscription licensing costs also aren\u2019t unique to SAP, Tucciarone says, with many organizations seeing SaaS price i"

The main decliners were nonferrous metal, information and communication, and machinery issues.\nThe U.S. dollar briefly weakened to around the 153 yen line in Tokyo as the yen, seen as a safe-haven asset, was bought amid sharp declines in Tokyo stocks, dealers said.\nAt noon, the dollar fetched 153.30-34 yen compared with 153.61-71 yen in New York and 153.58-60 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Tuesday.\nThe euro was quoted at $1.1488-1490 and 176.12-18 yen against $1.1476-1486 and 176.39-49 yen in New York and $1.1527-1529 and 177.04-08 yen in Tokyo late Tuesday afternoon.\nStocks took heavy losses as investors continued to lock in gains after the benchmark Nikkei advanced over 3,000 points last week, with heavyweight chip shares and stocks related to artificial intelligence dropping steeply.\nAmong notable decliners, Softbank Group ended the morning down 14.3 percent at 21,555 yen, while semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest fell 9.9 percent to 19,615 yen.\n\"As it was confirmed that AI-related demand remains strong through recent earnings reports, once the sense of temporary overheating fades, those stocks are likely to move in line with results that reflect their growth,\" said Maki Sawada, strategist in the Investment Content Department of Nomura Securities Co.\nThe market also tracked overnight losses on Wall Street, where the tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq index closed down 2 percent, falling from recent highs with concerns over the prolonged U.S. government shutdown lingering."
