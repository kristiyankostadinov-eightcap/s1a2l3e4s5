Meanwhile, the US dollar hovered near a one-week high, which can weigh on dollar-priced bullion by making it costlier abroad. Fed minutes showed broad agreement that rates should stay put for now, but less clarity on what comes next \u2013 some officials still see another hike as possible if inflation stays hot, while others think cuts are on the table if price pressures cool. Markets are still leaning toward..\na first cut around June, so attention is turning to jobless claims and Friday\u2019s PCE inflation report, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Gold is trading the Fed more than fundamentals.\nGold often benefits when investors expect lower US rates, because it pays no interest and competes with yield-bearing assets. If PCE or labor data comes in cooler, rate-cut expectations could firm up and the dollar could ease \u2013 typically supportive for bullion. If inflation stays sticky, markets may push cuts out, keeping the dollar stronger and gold under pressure. Other metals can echo that rate-driven mood, especially silver.\nZooming out: Thin markets can blur the signal.\nHoliday-thinned trading can make price action look calmer than investor conviction really is. That\u2019s why the next batch of US data may do more to set direction than this quiet session. The big driver for precious metals remains the same: where inflation is headed and how the Fed responds.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "Gold prices edged higher in subdued trading on Thursday, building on gains of more than 2 percent in the previous session, as investors awaited crucial U.S. inflation figures that could shape the Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves on interest rates.\nAs of 5:59 GMT, spot gold rose 0.19 percent to $4,997.47 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures for April delivery advanced 0.10 percent to $5,014.10 per ounce. Meanwhile, spot silver gained 0.44 percent to $77.96.\nIn the UAE, gold rates posted marginal increases, with 24-carat gold gaining AED0.25 to AED600.75 and 22-carat gold holding steady at AED556.25. Additionally, 21-carat gold and 18-carat gold edged up AED0.25 to AED533.5 and AED457.25, respectively.\nMeanwhile, 14-carat gold increased AED0.25 to AED356.75.\nLunar New Year amplifies price moves amid thin trading\n\u201cGold, silver and copper have started the Lunar New Year week under pressure, with much of Asia \u2014 and crucially China \u2014 closed. The subdued trading environment has amplified price moves while underscoring how heavily the recent rally relied on Asian participation,\u201d said Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy, Saxo Bank.\nGold prices remained under pressure as markets in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holidays, leading to thinner regional trading volumes. At the same time, the U.S. dollar hovered near a more than one-week peak, making gold that is priced in the greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n\u201cDespite short-term softness, the structural drivers supporting gold remain firmly in place in our opinion. Persistent central bank reserve diversification continues to underpin structural buying, while expanding fiscal deficits and elevated sovereign debt levels reinforce gold\u2019s role as a store of value amid currency debasement concerns,\u201d added Hansen.\nMarket awaits PCE report\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s January meeting showed policymakers were almost unanimously in favor of keeping rates unchanged, though opinions diverged on the next move. Several officials signaled they would consider further rate hikes if inflation remains sticky, while others indicated a willingness to back additional cuts should price pressures ease.\nAccording to CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool, markets are currently pricing in June as the most likely timing for the first rate cut this year.\nInvestors are now turning their attention to weekly jobless claims data due later on Thursday, as well as Friday\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred gauge of inflation. Gold prices, which do not offer a yield, typically perform better in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\u201cAt the same time, ongoing geopolitical fragmentation sustains long-term demand even when not immediately reflected in price, and continued portfolio diversification away from dollar-centric assets supports strategic allocations. Together, these forces suggest that, although corrections are inevitable after parabolic advances, the broader bull trend remains intact,\u201d added Hansen.\nOther precious metals\nAs gold and silver prices rose, the broader precious metals market witnessed mixed movement. Spot platinum gained 0.16 percent to $2,074.38, while palladium dipped 0.41 percent to $1,708.5.\nHansen explained that silver\u2019s long-term fundamentals remain supportive, particularly given its dual role in monetary demand and solar photovoltaic expansion.\n\u201cFor 2026, the Silver Institute forecasts a sixth consecutive annual structural deficit of around 67 million ounces, down from 95 million in 2025. Although total supply is rising toward decade\u2011high levels, it remains insufficient to fully meet the current surge in investment demand,\u201d he added.\nFrom a technical perspective, the latest rebound has produced two lower highs, signalling fading conviction among buyers. After outperforming during the rally phase, silver bore the brunt of the correction and is still digesting that volatility shock."

Historically, it trails other investment options, like stocks. From 1921 onward, silver has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 96%. That means an equal sum invested in silver and stocks back then would now be worth 96% less in silver holdings than stocks.\nInstead, silver is prized for its stability and its power to hedge against inflation. Often dubbed a \u201cstore of value,\u201d it tends to sustain purchasing power when inflation climbs.\nCompared with gold, silver prices generally swing more sharply due to industrial demand\u2014solar equipment, healthcare devices, and more\u2014whereas gold is almost purely a safe-haven asset.\nWhat does \u201cspot silver\u201d mean?\n\u201cSpot silver\u201d refers to the live market rate at which silver can be bought or sold instantly. That said, real-world buyers usually pay a premium over spot for markups, shipping, insurance, and other fees.\nThe spot price serves as a gauge of immediate market demand: a higher spot price means stronger buying interest.\nWhat is \u201cprice spread\u201d in silver trading?\nThe term \u201cprice spread\u201d describes the difference between the buying (ask) and selling (bid) prices for silver. Here\u2019s how those terms are defined.\n- Ask price: the cost to purchase silver.\n- Bid price: the amount you receive when you sell silver.\nA narrower spread indicates high demand.\nHow to invest in silver\nSilver exposure can be achieved through physical ownership or via silver-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs let you own a stake in a fund that holds silver, sparing you storage and insurance responsibilities.\nKey silver investment options include:\n- Bullion bars and rounds. These are sold by weight and purity\n- Government-minted silver coins. Iconic examples include American Silver Eagles and Canada\u2019s Silver Maple Leafs, which often trade at premiums for their rarity and backing.\n- Silver jewelry. Custom pieces that fetch prices above equal-purity bullion.\n- Silver mining equities. Stocks in companies extracting silver, offering a sort of indirect investment in silver.\nOn exchanges, bullion and coins must meet a minimum 99.9% purity. Lower-purity silver generally falls into collectible or industrial categories. Our guide to the best silver IRA companies provide more information on how to shrewdly invest in silver (and other precious metals).\nIs it a good time to invest in silver?\nSilver has surged more than 150% over the past year, hitting its highest levels in over a decade.\nDeciding whether to invest now depends on your unique attitude toward the market. If inflation is top of mind, adding precious metals can be prudent. Or, if you foresee rising industrial applications\u2014such as electronics\u2014demand could potentially push prices even higher.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 8:15 a.m. ET today\nGold remains the benchmark metal, while platinum and palladium exhibit volatility patterns similar to silver due to smaller market caps. Gold\u2019s larger market makes it comparatively stable.\nThe takeaway\nWith economic volatility persistent in the current market, precious metals deserve at least a quick look. Silver\u2019s recent performance has outshined gold\u2019s, and many experts forecast the likelihood of seeing further upside, potentially p"

Hungary insists it has adequate reserves and describes the halt as political.\n- The escalating energy dispute reflects PM Orb\u00e1n\u2019s defiance of EU sanctions on Russian fuel ahead of his most challenging election in April.\nBUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Hungary is suspending its shipments of diesel to neighboring Ukraine until interruptions to Russian oil supplies via a pipeline that crosses Ukrainian territory are resolved, Hungary\u2019s foreign minister said Wednesday.\nRussian oil shipments to Hungary and Slovakia have been interrupted since Jan. 27 after what Ukrainian officials say were Russian attacks that damaged the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude into Central Europe.\nHungary and Slovakia, which have both received a temporary exemption from a European Union policy prohibiting imports of Russian oil, have accused Ukraine \u2014 without providing evidence \u2014 of deliberately holding up supplies.\nIn a video posted on social media Wednesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said the interruption to oil deliveries was \u201ca political decision made by the Ukrainian president himself.\u201d\nUkraine has denied such accusations.\nSzijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 added that Hungary has enough oil reserves to last more than three months, and that its energy security was assured.\nAs nearly every country in Europe has significantly reduced or entirely ceased Russian energy imports, Hungary \u2014 an EU and NATO member \u2014 has maintained and even increased its supply of Russian oil and gas since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine in February 2022.\nHungary\u2019s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has long argued Russian fossil fuels are indispensable for its economy and that switching to energy sourced from elsewhere would cause an immediate economic collapse \u2014 an argument some experts dispute.\nWidely seen as the Kremlin\u2019s biggest advocate in the EU, Orb\u00e1n has vigorously opposed the bloc\u2019s efforts to sanction Moscow over its invasion, and blasted attempts to hit Russia\u2019s energy revenues that help finance the war.\nFacing what promises to be the most challenging election of his last 16 years in power in April, Orb\u00e1n has launched an aggressive anti-Ukraine and anti-EU campaign, seeking to convince voters that the neighboring country poses an existential risk to Hungary and that he is the only guarantor of its safety.\nFollowing the interruption to Druzhba oil supplies at the end of January, Hungary\u2019s government asked neighboring Croatia to allow Russian oil delivered by sea to be pumped to refineries in Hungary and Slovakia via the Adria pipeline.\nCroatia\u2019s Economy Minister Ante \u0160u\u0161njar has said his country would not allow energy supplies in Central Europe be threatened, but pushed back on Hungary\u2019s request.\nWriting on social media site X on Monday, \u0160u\u0161njar said there are \u201cno technical excuses left for staying tied to Russian crude for any EU country.\u201d\n\u201cA barrel bought from Russia may appear cheaper to some countries, but helps fund war and attacks on Ukrainian people,\u201d he wrote.\nSpike writes for the Associated Press."

                "body": "Asia stocks rise as tech gains offset rate uncertainty; ASX, KOSPI hit record high\nEUR/USD is oscillating around 1.1840\u20131.1850 after a clean slide from last week\u2019s highs. The pair has already tested the 1.1820\u20131.1830 demand pocket and bounced, but every recovery into 1.1860\u20131.1870 is being sold. Price action is a controlled grind lower inside a wider 1.1765\u20131.2000 range, with the market now sitting in the lower half of that band where sellers historically have the upper hand. Intraday, the tape is heavy: lower highs, shallow bounces and quick rejections as soon as the pair pokes its head above 1.1850.\nThe macro balance still tilts toward the USD. Markets are pricing roughly 62 basis points of Fed easing for 2026, equivalent to two 25 bp cuts and about a 50% chance of a third, with the first move pencilled in around June. Softer inflation data recently encouraged that path, but the labour report showing the strongest employment growth in more than a year and an unexpected fall in unemployment reminded everyone that the US economy can still absorb tighter policy without stalling.\nThat combination keeps US real yields elevated and limits how far the dollar can fall ahead of the FOMC minutes and the next PCE core inflation release. On the European side, Germany\u2019s and the euro area\u2019s ZEW indices eased in February, confirming a weak growth pulse and leaving the EUR without a strong domestic catalyst. The ECB is trapped between sluggish activity and restrictive real rates, while the Fed at least enjoys better growth, and that relative gap is exactly what you see reflected in EUR/USD holding heavy below 1.19.\nThe dollar index is sitting around 97.2\u201397.6, respecting support and leaning against resistance without breaking either side decisively. On the four-hour chart, DXY is holding above a 0.382 Fibonacci retracement near 96.82 and pushing toward the 0.5 retracement zone around 97.21, with a rising trendline from roughly 95.55 still intact. The 200-period EMA around 97.9\u201398.0 caps the topside and forms a clear ceiling for now. Candles with small bodies and long wicks near 97.6 show indecision at resistance rather than a clean reversal lower, even as sentiment surveys show USD bearishness at the most extreme levels since roughly 2012. For EUR/USD, that mix means rallies struggle to extend: the euro does not get the full benefit of dollar dips, and any dollar stabilization quickly pushes the pair back toward the 1.1830\u20131.1800 area.\nOn the daily chart, EUR/USD is sliding inside a downward-tilting channel carved out below the mid-range of 1.1890\u20131.1900. The broader structure is a 1.1765\u20131.2000 box, and price is now pressing the lower half of that box. The key reference levels are clear on the chart. The 1.2000 handle is the upper boundary and psychological ceiling that has repelled prior advances. The 1.1927 and 1.1997 zones cluster recent swing highs and act as a resistance shelf capping rebounds. The 1.1890\u20131.1900 band is the mid-range; a daily close back above it would neutralise the immediate bearish tone but would not flip the trend on its own.\nThe 1.1856 zone is a tactical pivot that has flipped between resistance and support over the past sessions. The 1.1835 level is intermediate daily support and effectively the first structural line in the sand inside the range. The 1.1820\u20131.1830 pocket marks short-term demand, where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. The 1.1810 and 1.1800 levels are round-number supports that map closely to signal levels used in intraday strategies. Finally, 1.1765\u20131.1766 is the key structural floor where the wider range bottom and the 200-period EMA on the four-hour chart meet. As long as the pair trades below 1.1890\u20131.1900 and keeps respecting these lower supports, the medium-term trend remains a controlled down-drift rather than a reversal.\nShort-term, EUR/USD order flow is clustering around three narrow bands that define the day\u2019s battle lines. The 1.1831\u20131.1835 zone has behaved as an intraday fulcrum. When"

This decline comes as traders worldwide adopt a cautious stance ahead of the imminent release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes. Consequently, market participants are scrutinizing every data point for clues on the future path of US monetary policy and its stark divergence from the European Central Bank\u2019s stance.\nEUR/USD Technical Breakdown Below 1.1850\nThe breach of the 1.1850 handle represents a major technical development for the Euro Dollar pair. This level had previously acted as a key support zone throughout the latter part of the previous quarter. Market analysts immediately noted increased selling volume accompanying the break. Furthermore, the move triggered a cascade of stop-loss orders, accelerating the downward momentum. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) subsequently entered oversold territory, signaling potential for a short-term correction. However, the overall chart structure now suggests a bearish bias in the near term.\nSeveral key technical levels now come into focus for traders. The next significant support zone resides near the 1.1780 area, which aligns with the 200-day simple moving average. A break below this level could open the path toward 1.1700. On the upside, any recovery attempt will likely face immediate resistance at the former support-turned-resistance level of 1.1850. Additionally, stronger resistance sits near the 1.1920 region, which coincides with a confluence of Fibonacci retracement levels.\nMarket Anticipation Builds for FOMC Minutes\nThe primary catalyst for the current forex market volatility is the scheduled release of the FOMC Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy meeting. These minutes provide a detailed record of the discussions among Fed officials. Investors meticulously parse this document for nuances on inflation outlook, employment goals, and the potential timing of future interest rate adjustments. The previous meeting had already signaled a more hawkish tilt from the central bank, with discussions beginning around the pace of balance sheet reduction.\nMarket expectations are currently centered on the language concerning inflation persistence. Specifically, traders are looking for any shift in the committee\u2019s assessment of whether current price pressures are \u201ctransitory\u201d or more entrenched. Any hint of concern over sustained inflation could reinforce expectations for a more aggressive tightening cycle. Conversely, a dovish undertone regarding economic growth risks could temper those expectations. This binary outcome creates significant uncertainty, which typically leads to heightened volatility and a stronger US Dollar as a safe-haven currency.\nExpert Analysis on Policy Divergence\nFinancial institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have published research notes highlighting the growing monetary policy divergence. The Federal Reserve has clearly entered a tightening phase, initiating rate hikes and outlining quantitative tightening plans. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank maintains a decidedly more accommodative stance, citing fragmented economic recovery across the Eurozone and lower underlying inflation pressures. This fundamental divergence creates a powerful tailwind for the US Dollar against the Euro.\nAccording to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), speculative net long positions on the Euro have decreased for three consecutive weeks. This shift in market positioning indicates that large funds are already betting on further Euro weakness. Historical data also shows that the USD tends to strengthen in the 48-hour window preceding the release of major Fed communic"

The US Dollar (USD) strengthens against the Euro (EUR) on hawkish FOMC minutes that revived speculation about potential interest rate hikes if inflation remains elevated.\nAccording to the FOMC Minutes from its January policy meeting, almost all participants favored holding rates steady, with only a couple preferring a rate cut. However, policymakers did not close the door on further reduction if inflation declined in line with their expectations. At the same time, Fed officials said they would have supported describing future decisions in more two-sided terms. Several members suggested that interest rate hikes could be necessary if price pressures persist.\nAcross the pond, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde may step down from her position earlier than her planned retirement in October 2027, per the Financial Times. The source said Lagarde wants to enable French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to find her replacement, without indicating when she may exit.\nTraders will closely monitor the preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) readings from Germany and the Eurozone, which are scheduled for publication on Friday. In case of stronger-than-expected outcomes, this might help limit the shared currency\u2019s losses in the near term.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone\u2019s economy.\nAnother sig"

The Bank of England's (BoE) preferred measure of regular private sector wage growth dropped to a five-year low of 3.4%, removing a key obstacle that has kept the more hawkish Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members from backing rate cuts. Markets now fully expect a 25-basis-point reduction by April, with a 76% probability of a March move. Wednesday's UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) did little to ease the burden on Bank of England (BoE) policymakers, especially after Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation and Retail Price Index figures all missed expectations.\nSharp sell-off drives Stochastic toward oversold as price tests the 50-day EMA\nOn the daily chart, GBP/USD shed 0.5% on Wednesday, extending the decline from four-year highs posted in January. Price is now toying with chart regions below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The 200-day EMA sits nearby at 1.3435, providing a deeper support floor. The Stochastic Oscillator is approaching the oversold zone, suggesting selling momentum is becoming stretched, and the pair may find some stabilization near current levels. The sell-off from recent highs high has now retraced roughly half the rally from the December lows, placing the pair at a key decision point. A sustained break below 1.3490 would target 1.3400 and the 200-day EMA. Recovery above the 50-day EMA at 1.3529 is needed to ease the bearish pressure.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is we"

In fact, several Federal Reserve (Fed) officials indicated that more rate cuts could be warranted if inflation declines as expected, while others cautioned that easing too early could compromise the central bank's 2% inflation target.\nMeanwhile, reports that the US military is prepared to strike Iran as early as this weekend keep geopolitical risks in play, assisting the safe-haven Greenback in preserving the overnight strong gains to over a one-week high. This further backs the case for an extension of the GBP/USD pair's weekly downtrend, suggesting that any attempted recovery might now be seen as a selling opportunity and runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly.\nTraders now look to Thursday's US economic docket \u2013 featuring the release of Weekly Initial Jobless Claims, the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, and Pending Home Sales data. Apart from this, speeches from influential FOMC members will drive the USD and the GBP/USD pair later during the North American session. The focus, however, will remain glued to the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, due on Friday.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. "

                "body": "AUD/USD drifts lower after RBA minutes as jobs data looms\n- RBA minutes confirmed a hawkish tilt; Thursday's Australian employment report is the next test for the Australian Dollar\n- Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) February meeting minutes showed the Board saw a \"stronger case\" for a 25 basis point hike to 3.85%, citing materially higher inflation and tight labour market conditions.\n- Australian January employment data on Thursday is forecast at 20K (prior 65.2K), with the unemployment rate expected to edge up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\nThe RBA minutes released on Tuesday reinforced the hawkish tone set by Governor Bullock's post-decision press conference, noting that private demand is growing faster than expected and capacity pressures are greater than previously assessed. The Board signalled it is prepared to hike again if inflation proves persistent, and Wednesday's Wage Price Index (WPI) at 0.8% MoM only underscored that message. Attention now shifts to Thursday's January employment report, where a forecast of 20K new jobs (down sharply from December's 65.2K) and a small tick higher in the Unemployment Rate will test whether the labour market is cooling quickly enough to cap further tightening. On the US side, Initial Jobless Claims and the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey on Thursday will add or hinder further US Dollar momentum.\nShallow pullback holds above 0.7000 as Stochastic begins to roll off overbought\nOn the daily chart, AUD/USD drifted lower on Wednesday, closing near 0.7040 and shedding 0.56% in a session confined to a narrow range. The pair continues to hold well above the rising 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6860 and the 200-day EMA at 0.6640, keeping overall bullish momentum from the late-December rally off 0.6600 firmly in place. The Stochastic Oscillator has crossed bearish from the overbought zone, suggesting near-term momentum is fading, and the pair may consolidate further before its next directional move. Recent candles show a series of small-bodied sessions near the 0.7050 area, pointing to indecision ahead of Thursday's employment release. Immediate support sits at 0.7000, with resistance at the year-to-date high of 0.7147; a break above would target the 0.7200 handle.\nAUD/USD daily chart\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore"

The trade-weighted index (TWI), which measures our dollar against a suite of other currencies, is at five-year highs of around 65.\nThat's partly due to interest rates, which have a lower short-term outlook in other Western economies than at home, but also thanks to surging commodity prices, which have historically boosted the Australian dollar.\nIs the higher dollar here to stay?\nWithout a reliable crystal ball to turn to, it's impossible to say for certain, but the signs are good \u2013 certainly a retreat to 60-US-cent lows appears highly unlikely.\nEqually, don't bank on a return to the good old days of the early 2010s, when the Aussie was at and even above parity with the greenback.\n\"The fair value of the Australian dollar is around 0.72 US cents, relatively close to its current value,\" Mousina said.\n\"So, on this measure the Australian dollar may not have much more upside.\n\"However, (it) has a tendency to overshoot once momentum builds, meaning a short-term move towards 0.75-0.80 US dollars cannot be ruled out.\n\"That said, such high levels are unlikely to be sustained.\n\"Over the next few months, we expect the Australian dollar to average around $US0.70-0.75 with a trade-weighted index of around 69.\"\nWhat does that actually mean for the Australian economy?\nObviously a stronger dollar is fantastic for any Australians heading overseas, who get far better bang for their buck than when the currency is trading lower (although it's bad news for tourists arriving here, who'll have to contend with a more expensive holliday).\nThe same is true for Australian businesses that import goods, however the opposite applies to exporters, whose wares become more expensive to international buyers.\nOverall, higher exchange rates can be a slight handbrake on the overall economic growth.\nWhile that's not great news for an economy that is only growing gradually, there's a silver lining here for businesses and borrowers worried about the potential for more interest rate hikes this year: a stronger currency can take the sting out of inflation \u2013 which is, of course"

However, beyond March, the outlook has turned more hawkish. A majority, 58%, now see the policy rate reaching 1% by the end of June, compared with just 36% in the January survey. Among those specifying timing, June was the most popular call, though a notable minority see April as a live possibility, while others expect July.\nThe shift reflects mounting concern over upside inflation risks, a still-weak yen and the implications of expansionary fiscal policy. The BOJ raised rates to 0.75% in December, the highest level in three decades, and signalled readiness to continue tightening, diverging from many global peers nearing the end of their rate-cutting cycles.\nCurrency dynamics remain central to the policy outlook. After briefly approaching the psychologically important 160 per dollar level in January, the yen rebounded sharply, but volatility has kept markets on alert. In the poll, 69% of economists said they expect Japanese authorities to intervene again in currency markets if the yen weakens materially. Among those, 40% identified the 160 per dollar level as the most likely trigger for action.\nFiscal policy is also influencing expectations. More than half of respondents expressed concern that a proposed two-year suspension of the consumption tax on food could strain public finances, potentially complicating the BOJ\u2019s inflation outlook and bond market stability.\nWage growth remains a key variable. While economists expect solid increases in this year\u2019s wage negotiations, expectations have moderated slightly compared with late last year, though still consistent with inflation running above target.\nOverall, the consensus is clear: March is likely a pause, but tightening toward 1% by mid-year is now the base case, with intervention risks rising should yen weakness re-emerge.\n\"Bid 160?

Despite a growth miss in Japanese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures earlier this week, Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike expectations remain firmly in place; former board member Adachi said an April move is likely, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated that Japan should continue normalizing policy. Thursday's Japanese National Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data is critical: a firm core reading would reinforce the case for BoJ tightening and could push the Yen stronger again, while a soft print would give the pair room to extend Wednesday's bounce.\nBounce off oversold zone meets resistance at the 50-day EMA\nOn the daily chart, USD/JPY opened Wednesday near the 153.00 handle before rising around 1%. The bounce produced a solid bullish candle, but price has stalled just below the 50-day EMA at 155.30, which is acting as immediate resistance. The 200-day EMA sits lower near 152.60, and price is trading between the two averages, suggesting the pair is in a transitional phase after the sharp sell-off from the January high near 159.45. The Stochastic Oscillator is turning higher from the oversold zone, suggesting downward momentum is fading, and a near-term relief rally could develop. A break above the 50-day EMA at 155.30 would target 156.00 and the mid-January consolidation area. Failure to clear it would leave the pair vulnerable to a retest of the 153.00 support and the 152.10 year-to-date low.\nUSD/JPY daily chart\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nA"

                "body": "USD/JPY Forecast: Stands firm as fiscal woes counter hawkish BoJ ahead of FOMC Minutes\n- USD/JPY regains some positive traction on Wednesday as renewed fiscal concerns weigh on the JPY.\n- A positive risk tone also weighs on the safe-haven JPY and supports spot prices amid a firmer USD.\n- The divergent BoJ-Fed policy expectations warrant caution for bulls ahead of the FOMC Minutes.\nThe USD/JPY pair attracts fresh buyers following the previous day's good two-way price swings and sticks to intraday gains near the 153.70 region through the first half of the European session on Wednesday. The Japanese Yen (JPY) is pressured by renewed concerns about Japan's fiscal health and fears that Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaich will push back against further interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Apart from this, the prevailing risk-on mood further undermines the JPY's safe-haven status, which, along with a modest US Dollar (USD) uptick, turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the currency pair.\nData released earlier this week showed that Japan's Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.1% during the October-December quarter, undershooting market forecasts of 0.4% rise. Adding to this, the previous quarter's reading was revised down to show a contraction of 0.7%, putting extra pressure on Japan's PM Takaichi to announce more stimulus. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), however, warned against cutting the consumption tax, saying that it would erode Japan's fiscal space and raise debt risks. This adds to market worries that Takaichi\u2019s fiscal spending would balloon Japan\u2019s elevated debt-to-GDP ratio and weighs on the JPY.\nMeanwhile, traders have been pricing in the possibility that the central bank could raise interest rates as soon as March or April. That said, Takaichi's historic election victory has heightened market attention to whether the dovish premier will renew her calls for the central bank to keep interest rates low. This, to a larger extent, overshadowed data showing that Japan's exports rose at the fastest pace since November 2022. Moreover, the Reuters Tankan poll revealed that Japanese manufacturers' confidence rose for the first time in three months in February. Furthermore, the IMF urged Japan to raise rates to keep inflation expectations well anchored.\nThis comes on top of hopes that Takaichi could be fiscally responsible and that her policies will boost the economy, which might prompt the BoJ to stick to its policy normalization path. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations and should hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bullish bets. Investors might also opt to wait for the release of the FOMC Minutes for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. Apart from this, Japan's National Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, both due on Friday, will provide a fresh impetus to the USD/JPY pair.\nUSD/JPY daily chart\nTechnical Analysis:\nFrom a technical perspective, spot prices once again showed some resilience near the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) earlier this week, and the subsequent move up favors bullish traders. The SMA is trending higher, preserving a broader bullish bias and cushioning setbacks.\nMoreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) sits below the zero line with its negative reading contracting, suggesting fading bearish pressure. Adding to this, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42 (neutral) is edging higher, aligning with stabilization attempts.\nMeasured from the 140.13 low to the 159.28 high, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 151.97 offers near-term support, and a rebound from that area could target the 23.6% retracement at 154.76. A daily close beneath the said support would open room for deeper consolidation, while a close back above the 23.6% threshold would strengthen recovery prospects.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the "

Meanwhile, bulls await a sustained strength and acceptance above the 1.3700 mark before placing fresh bets amid mixed fundamental cues.\nThe US Dollar (USD) preserves the previous day's strong gains and stands firm near its highest level in over a week on the back of less dovish FOMC Minutes, which, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the USD/CAD pair. Meanwhile, Crude Oil prices gain some follow-through positive traction amid renewed US-Iran tensions, underpinning the commodity-linked Loonie and capping gains for the currency pair.\nFrom a technical perspective, this week's breakout through the 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, for the first time since January 22, favors the USD/CAD bulls. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram remains positive and has turned marginally higher, suggesting strengthening bullish momentum. With the MACD line above the Signal line near the zero mark, the tone improves. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) prints 65, above the midline and supportive of buyers.\nMeanwhile, the 100-period SMA\u2019s gentle downward slope tempers conviction, but price action above the average preserves an upside bias. The MACD line staying above the Signal line and a widening positive histogram would underpin continuation, whereas a fade back toward the zero line would flag waning momentum. RSI at 65 is not overbought and could allow further extension if buyers maintain control. The SMA stands at 1.3617 and offers nearby dynamic support, and a close below it would open a corrective phase.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nUSD/CAD 1-hour chart\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls.

Nonetheless, softer Canadian inflation data has raised prospects the Bank of Canada (BoC) would resume its interest rate cutting campaign, which could weigh on the Canadian Dollar (CAD) against the Greenback.\nCrude oil prices rebounds amid persistent tensions between the US and Iran.

Spot prices, however, lack bullish conviction and remain below mid-209.00s, warranting caution before positioning for an extension of this week's bounce from the 207.30-207.25 region, or a nearly two-month low.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) continues with its relative underperformance amid concerns about Japan's fiscal health and turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the GBP/JPY cross. Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is expected to roll out policies to help revive the economy after a landslide victory in a general election earlier this month. Moreover, Japan's weak GDP growth data puts extra pressure on Japan's PM Takaichi to announce more stimulus.\nMeanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned against cutting the consumption tax, saying that it would erode Japan's fiscal space and raise debt risks. This, along with the underlying bullish sentiment, undermines the JPY's safe-haven status and lends additional support to the GBP/JPY cross. Investors, however, seem convinced that Takaichi's policies will boost the economy and prompt the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to stick to its policy-tightening path.\nThe hawkish BoJ expectations mark a significant divergence in comparison to the growing acceptance that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates as early as the March meeting. The bets were reaffirmed by the disappointing UK jobs report and a fall in the UK consumer inflation to its lowest level in nearly a year. This, in turn, might hold back bullish traders from placing aggressive bets around the GBP/JPY cross and keep a lid on any meaningful appreciation.\nThe market focus now shifts to the release of Japan's National Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Friday. Furthermore, the flash global PMIs will influence the broader risk sentiment, which will drive demand for the JPY and provide some meaningful impetus to the GBP/JPY cross. From a technical perspective, bearish traders need to wait for a sustained break and acceptance below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) support before positioning for any further losses.\nJapanese Yen Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies this week.

This dramatic rebound comes as the Japanese Yen shows unexpected weakness against major currencies, while traders position themselves ahead of Thursday\u2019s crucial UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) announcement. Market analysts now watch closely as this currency cross demonstrates renewed volatility amid shifting global monetary policy expectations.\nGBP/JPY Technical Analysis: Understanding the Rebound Pattern\nThe GBP/JPY pair\u2019s recovery represents a significant technical development in forex markets. After testing support near 205.50 earlier this month, the currency cross has gained approximately 1.2% in just three trading sessions. This movement reflects changing sentiment toward both currencies involved in this important financial instrument. Furthermore, the Bank of Japan\u2019s continued accommodative stance contrasts with the Bank of England\u2019s more hawkish positioning, creating fundamental divergence that traders actively monitor.\nSeveral technical indicators now suggest potential for further GBP/JPY gains. The pair recently broke above its 20-day moving average, typically considered a short-term bullish signal. Additionally, trading volume increased significantly during the recovery phase, indicating genuine institutional interest rather than temporary market noise. Market participants particularly note the 208.00 level\u2019s psychological importance, as this round number often serves as both support and resistance in currency trading.\nKey Technical Levels for GBP/JPY Traders\nProfessional traders currently monitor several critical price zones for the GBP/JPY pair. The immediate resistance sits near 209.50, where previous price action created selling pressure in March. Conversely, support has established itself around 206.80, where buying interest emerged during last week\u2019s decline. These technical levels gain additional significance when combined with fundamental developments, creating potential trading opportunities for both short-term and position traders in the forex market.\nJapanese Yen Weakness: Fundamental Drivers Behind the Movement\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s recent underperformance stems from multiple interconnected factors. Primarily, the Bank of Japan maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy despite global tightening trends. This policy divergence creates natural pressure on the Yen against currencies from central banks pursuing higher interest rates. Additionally, improving risk sentiment in global markets reduces demand for traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese currency. Consequently, the Yen has weakened against most major counterparts this month, not just the British Pound.\nSeveral specific developments contributed to the Yen\u2019s softness. First, Japanese inflation data surprised to the downside, reducing expectations for imminent policy normalization. Second, equity markets showed resilience despite earlier concerns, diminishing defensive currency flows. Third, commodity price stability reduced demand for the Yen as a hedge against volatility. These factors combined to create what analysts describe as a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of Yen weakness, providing tailwinds for the GBP/JPY recovery.\nBank of Japan Policy Outlook\nMarket participants increasingly believe the Bank of Japan will maintain its yield curve control framework through mid-2025. Governor Kazuo Ueda recently emphasized the need for continued monetary support until sustainable inflation reaches the 2% target. This commitment to accommodation contrasts sharply with other major central banks, creating what currency strategists call \u201cpolicy divergence trades.\u201d The "

January\u2019s Retail Price Index has dropped 0.5% on the month and slowed down to a 3.8% yearly growth after growing 0.7% and 4.2% respectively in December.\nProducer prices have been mixed, with the Input PPI bouncing up 0.4% after a 0.5% contraction last month and falling 0.2% from January last year. Output prices, however, have stalled in January and slowed down to a 2.5% yearly growth from 3.1% last month.\nIn Japan, data released on Wednesday revealed the Merchandise Trade Balance improved for the fifth consecutive month, although the weak Japanese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released earlier in the week keep weighing on Yen rallies.\nEconomic Indicator\nConsumer Price Index (MoM)\nThe United Kingdom (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly basis, is a measure of consumer price inflation \u2013 the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall \u2013 produced to international standards.

                "body": "Ethereum USD Faces 2.7% Decline Amid DeFi Oracle Failures\nEthereum USD is trading at $1,945.31 as of February 18, 2026, down 2.7% over the past day. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap faces headwinds from recent DeFi platform failures tied to misconfigured price oracles. These technical glitches have exposed vulnerabilities in the broader Ethereum ecosystem, raising questions about data integrity and smart contract security. Understanding why Ethereum USD is declining requires examining both the immediate market catalysts and the underlying technical signals that suggest further volatility ahead.\nWhy Is Ethereum USD Declining Today?\nEthereum USD\u2019s 2.7% daily decline reflects broader concerns about DeFi protocol security. On February 15, 2026, Moonwell, a lending platform built on Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 networks, suffered a critical oracle misconfiguration that resulted in $1.78 million in bad debt. The error caused cbETH (Coinbase Wrapped ETH) to be valued at just $1 instead of its actual market price near $2,200, triggering automated liquidations and exploits.\nThis incident highlights systemic risks within Ethereum-based DeFi applications. When price feeds fail, liquidation cascades can wipe out collateral positions and create cascading losses across interconnected protocols. The Moonwell incident follows similar oracle failures at Ribbon Finance in December 2025, which cost $2.7 million. These recurring vulnerabilities suggest that Ethereum USD price movements are increasingly tied to smart contract risks, not just macroeconomic factors. Source\nEthereum USD Technical Analysis\nEthereum USD\u2019s technical indicators reveal deeply oversold conditions with a strong downtrend in place. The RSI at 31.46 signals extreme selling pressure, with readings below 30 typically indicating oversold territory where bounces become possible. The MACD histogram at -23.47 shows bearish momentum, though the signal line at -257.26 suggests the selling pressure may be stabilizing.\nThe ADX at 46.04 confirms a strong downtrend with conviction, meaning lower prices are likely to persist without a reversal catalyst. Ethereum USD is trading well below its 50-day moving average of $2,724.41 and 200-day average of $3,529.08, indicating a sustained bearish structure. Support levels are critical: the Bollinger Band lower level at $1,518.97 and the day low of $1,922.59 represent key technical floors. If Ethereum USD breaks below $1,922, the next support zone sits near $1,800.\nEthereum USD Price Forecast\nMonthly Forecast: Ethereum USD could test $1,542.36 by end of February, representing a -20.7% decline from current levels if selling pressure intensifies. Quarterly Forecast: By end of Q1 2026, Ethereum USD may recover to $2,571.46, a +32.2% gain if DeFi concerns ease and technical oversold conditions trigger a relief rally. Yearly Forecast: By February 2027, Ethereum USD could reach $3,118.61, a +60.3% increase if regulatory clarity improves and oracle infrastructure upgrades restore confidence in smart contract platforms.\nThese forecasts assume that Ethereum USD stabilizes after the current technical washout. A sustained break below $1,900 could accelerate declines toward $1,500. Conversely, if the RSI bounces from oversold levels and the ADX weakens, a relief rally toward $2,200-$2,400 becomes probable within 2-4 weeks. Forecasts may change due to market conditions, regulations, or unexpected events.\nMarket Sentiment and Trading Activity\nTrading volume in Ethereum USD remains elevated at 346.7 million against a 30-day average of 311.3 million, indicating active participation during the decline. The relative volume of 1.03 shows slightly above-average activity, suggesting institutional and retail traders are actively positioning for further downside or accumulating at lower prices.\nLiquidation data reflects the stress in leveraged positions. The Money Flow Index at 29.76 signals that selling volume is outpacing buying volume, confirming bearish sentim"

Bitcoin's demand remains strong amidst geopolitical tensions, while ETH may retest its ATH of $4,946 as DeFi continues to thrive. New project Bitcoin Hyper raised $31.5 million, combining Bitcoin's features with enhanced capabilities, indicating significant interest in crypto innovation.\nAlthough current prices sit well below recent peaks, ongoing industry developments and technical indicators suggest XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum may be setting new all-time highs (ATHs) sooner than you think.\nBelow is a closer look at what could be happening in the news and on the price charts over the next fiscal quarter and a half.\nDiscover: The best meme coins in the world right now.\nXRP (XRP): Ripple\u2019s On-Chain SWIFT Replacement Could Rally to $5\nWith a market cap of $88 billion, XRP ($XRP) remains the leading cryptocurrency in global remittance.\nRipple designed the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as a blockchain for the traditional SWIFT system, offering faster transaction settlement and significantly reduced costs for both institutions and individuals.\nRecently, Ripple has reaffirmed its vision, highlighting XRPL\u2019s preparedness for stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization, while hghlighting XRP\u2019s central role within the ecosystem.\nFurthermore, reports by United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House emphasize XRP\u2019s utility as a global solution.\nOn the regulatory front, U.S. authorities recently approved spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), opening the door for regulated exposure for more traditional investors.\nIf broader market sentiment flips bullish, XRP could rally 3x to $5 before the end of summer. Should bearish conditions persist, strong support is likely to keep XRP above $1.\nBitcoin (BTC): A New ATH by Summer?\nThe world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ($BTC), recorded a ATH of $126,080 on October 6. before shedding 46% over the last five months to trade at.\nSince then, BTC has declined by about 46% and now trades below $70,000, following two sharp selloffs triggered by geopolitical concerns tied to possible U.S. military actions involving Iran and Greenland.\nOften compared to digital gold, Bitcoin continues to attract demand from both institutions and individual investors looking for protection against inflation and broader economic instability.\nRising institutional adoption, reduced post-halving supply and incoming US crypto legislation could have a catalytic effect, pushing Bitcoin to multiple new highs this year.\nAdditionally, if Trump delivers on his proposal for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, this OG crypto could remain the daddy for a long time yet.\nEthereum (ETH): DeFi\u2019s Backbone May Retest Record Levels\nEthereum ($ETH) is the dominant force powering decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications, with a market capitalization of approximately $244 billion.\nWith nearly $55 billion locked across the network, Ethereum continues to be the most economically active blockchain.\nIn a bull market, ETH could push past the $5,000 resistance level as early as June, surpassing its previous ATH of $4,946 recorded last August.\nOver the longer term, Ethereum\u2019s path toward five-figure prices will depend heavily on clearer regulatory frameworks in the United States and supportive macroeconomic trends.\nBoth factors are critical for accelerating institutional adoption, particularly in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization.\nAt present, ETH is trading below its 30-day moving average, with the relative strength index hovering near oversold territory around 36. For bullish investors, this range may represent an attractive accumulation zone.\nNew Bitcoin Hyper Presale Turns Bitcoin into an Ethereum Challenger\nWhile established networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP offer relative stability in a volatile market, the largest ga"

                "body": "Deep Dive: Has Solana Lost Its Soul?\nThe Solana crowd hype from 2025 has appeared to have all but vanished, along with its market cap (now -67% since its $249 price top on September 18, 2025). Social dominance toward SOL was well over 6% when vibes were high toward the #7 market cap asset, but now sit below 0.4% on a daily basis.\nBut how did we get here? Obviously all of cryptocurrency has taken a major beating since the retraces began at the beginning of Q4, 2025. But for Solana specifically, a big part of the recent frustration has come from the community's increased urgency for a validator security patch and the messy reality of getting everyone to install it fast. In January, Solana\u2019s client maintainers urged validators to upgrade to Agave/Jito v3.0.14 after two critical vulnerabilities were disclosed, including one that could crash validator nodes and another tied to vote processing that raised concerns about consensus integrity. The fixes arrived quickly, but the bigger confidence issue was coordination: when updates are labeled urgent, markets pay attention to how smoothly a decentralized validator set can respond, because that response directly affects uptime, finality, and the safety of funds moving through DeFi.\nDevelopers and validators began discussing rollback options, patch releases, and how to diagnose node instability. Some advised users to check validator status pages and retry transactions once congestion eased. At the same time, Zora made headlines by migrating its new \u201cattention markets\u201d product from Base to Solana, charging around 1 SOL per creation. The move sparked debate. Some saw it as a vote of confidence in Solana\u2019s speed and culture, while others questioned incentives and token implications. The contrast between new apps launching and the network facing performance issues left the community split.\nFor many long-time holders, the emotional rollercoaster is nothing new. Solana\u2019s identity was shaped by viral, meme-driven moments that defined entire market cycles. Traders still reminisce about Madlads minting chaos, the Pengu and Trump memecoin launches, the FTX crash fallout, Solbears and Baloonsville experiments, and Jupuary 2025 airdrop fever. They remember the USDC depeg panic, the Melania token buzz, the celebrity meme craze, and even the painful September 2021 network outage.\nThere were explosive NFT runs like Okay Bears, Degenerate Ape Academy, and DeGods pumping to 1000 SOL. Bonk\u2019s 500B DeGods allocation burn and later Bonk airdrops brought fresh waves of retail energy. Magic Eden\u2019s rise, Solanart\u2019s early days, Metaplex Candy Machine v1 launches, and meme launchpad wars made Solana feel like the wild west of crypto. Even oddities like the Saga phone Bonk airdrop, Solana Mobile\u2019s harsh reviews, LA Vape Cabal rumors, Mango Markets drama, LIBRA controversy, Sahil\u2019s memecoin promotions, and the Hawk Tuah rug all became part of Solana folklore. The highs were unforgettable, but so were the scars. And over time, the character and 'fun' of Solana's ecosystem has dissipated to the massive market cap losses accrued by the community.\nInfrastructure debates have also resurfaced surrounding Solana. After a February 4, 2026 network disruption, DoubleZero posted that connectivity across the continental US was temporarily rerouted through Europe and Asia due to infrastructure issues. In normal internet networking, fiber cuts and rerouting are not unusual. DoubleZero emphasized that its system incentivizes redundant metro-to-metro paths, claiming traffic continued to flow along the fastest available routes between New York and Los Angeles with fallback options in place. Still, for validators, infrastructure reliability is not just technical talk. It determines whether blocks are produced smoothly or rewards are missed. In a high-speed chain like Solana, milliseconds matter, and underlying hardware and routing can mean the difference between profits and losses.\nLooking at the TA outlook from the crowd, the forme"

Nasdaq 100 Futures fell nearly 0.1% to 24,942.75 points, while Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 49,685.0 points.\nFutures steadied after Wall Street indexes advanced during the main session, aided chiefly by a sustained rebound in technology shares, and as data reflected some resilience in the U.S. economy. But indexes were kept off intraday highs by caution over the Fed.\nFed minutes show officials split on inflation, rate hikes\nThe minutes of the Fed\u2019s January meeting showed policymakers unanimously supported leaving interest rates unchanged at 3.50% to 3.75%.\nBut policymakers were largely split over the central bank\u2019s next steps, with several members of the central bank cautioning that inflation may take even longer to come below the Fed\u2019s 2% annual target.\n\u201cSeveral\u201d policymakers also indicated that an increase in interest rates could be warranted if inflation remained above target levels for prolonged periods. The messaging largely contrasted with general market consensus that inflation and interest rates will fall further this year.\nArtificial intelligence was a major point of uncertainty for the Fed, with policymakers split over whether the fast-growing industry will boost or dull inflation.\nWalmart to report Q4 earnings, outlook in focus\nWalmart Inc (NASDAQ:WMT) is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, with focus squarely on the retail giant\u2019s outlook for 2026\u2013 which is likely to offer more cues on U.S. consumer spending and health.\nWalmart is expected to post earnings per share of $0.7269 on revenue of $190.4 billion, Investing.com data showed.\nThe company is the world\u2019s largest retailer by valuation, and is widely regarded as a bellwether for the U.S. consumer. Its fourth quarter earnings come amid increasing signs of strain on U.S. retail spending from sticky inflation.\nBeyond Walmart, U.S. trade data for December, and weekly jobless claims, are also due on Thursday.\nWall St rises past rate uncertainty on tech gains\nWall Street indexes rose on Wednesday, with tech shares leading gains as the sector recovered further from recent losses.\nBut indexes ended off their intraday highs, while tech shares also remained tenuous amid heightened concerns over the impact of artificial intelligence on the sector.\nConcerns over AI were a major driver of recent tech losses, especially among software and logistics stocks. Fears of stretched AI-related spending also weighed on broader tech shares, especially those with exposure to data centres.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 6,881.32 points. The NASDAQ Composite rose 0.8% to 22,753.64 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 49,662.66 points.\nShould you be buying WMT right now?\nProPicks AI evaluates WMT alongside thousands of other companies every month using 100+ financial metrics.\nUsing powerful AI to generate exciting stock ideas, it looks beyond popularity to assess fundamentals, momentum, and valuation.

The FTSE 250 ended up 130.62 points, 0.6%, at 23,686.44, and the AIM all-share closed up 5.13 points, 0.6%, at 811.74.\nIn European equities on Wednesday, the Cac 40 in Paris closed 0.8% higher, while the Dax 40 in Frankfurt ended up 1.1%.\nThe pound was higher at 1.3548 dollars on Wednesday afternoon from 1.3531 at the equities close on Tuesday.\nThe euro stood lower at 1.1813 dollars from 1.1830.\nUK consumer price inflation slowed last month, the Office for National Statistics reported.\nConsumer prices rose 3.0%, as expected, slowing from a 3.4% rise in December.\n\u201cThe latest inflation figures are encouraging, although they effectively turn the clock back to where we were a year ago, before the impact of Rachel Reeves\u2019 first budget and Donald Trump\u2019s trade skirmishes made their mark,\u201d said AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson.\n\u201cFor the Bank of England, the latest data could give a green light for an interest rate cut in March, with market expectation for a cut rounding off at 85% after today\u2019s release.\n\u201cThe last time members of the [Monetary Policy Committee] met the vote was split 5-4 to hold rates steady versus a cut to 3.5%, and the plethora of recent data should be more than enough to give at least one member a good shove to the other side of the seesaw.\u201d\nMs Hewson added: \u201cThere\u2019s growing expectation that economic conditions might be in such a way that the bank can deliver not two but three rate cuts this year, although that\u2019s far from nailed on.\n\u201cThe bank\u2019s rate setters will be acutely aware that service sector inflation is still stubbornly high at 4.3% and January\u2019s headline rate of 3% is slightly above the bank\u2019s own forecast.\u201d\nThe BoE has a 2% inflation target.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Sanjay Raja commented: \u201cPerhaps in some comforting news, the disinflation path remains largely intact. Despite stronger services price momentum to start the year, we see CPI taking another big step down in spring, as some of the big administrative prices wash out of the annual rate calculation. We expect CPI to track nearer 2% by spring.\u201d\nStocks in New York were higher.

Think choppy ranges, sudden squeezes, and no clear winner between bulls and bears. No clean moonshot, no full-on crash \u2013 just a nervous, twitchy market where every ECB headline or macro data point can flip the script in seconds.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Dive into fresh DAX 40 chart breakdowns on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest German stock market mood on Instagram\n- Watch viral DAX trading setups and scalps on TikTok\nThe Story: If you only look at the surface, the DAX 40 looks like it is just drifting. But under the hood, there is a massive narrative battle going on: ECB policy uncertainty, a wobbling German economy, stressed automakers, but at the same time a surprisingly resilient tech\u2013industrial backbone driven by names like SAP and Siemens. The index is basically Europe\u2019s macro story in one chart.\n1. ECB, Christine Lagarde, and the EUR/USD Shockwaves \u2013 Why the DAX Cares So Much\nThe European Central Bank is the invisible hand on every DAX intraday candle. Traders are obsessed with one question: are we closer to more rate cuts, or will the ECB stay tight and keep financial conditions restrictive?\nHere is the chain reaction you need to understand:\nECB policy ? Euro vs. US dollar ? DAX export power ? Earnings expectations ? Index trend\nWhen the ECB sounds dovish and opens the door for easier policy, the euro often softens against the dollar. That weaker euro is secretly bullish for the DAX, because German export giants suddenly look cheaper on the global stage. Think autos, industrial machinery, and chemicals. Their products become more competitive, their foreign earnings look beefier when converted back into euros, and equity analysts start nudging their models higher.\nBut if Christine Lagarde and the ECB push a more hawkish tone \u2013 keeping rates elevated to fight sticky inflation \u2013 traders immediately price in slower growth. Financing stays expensive, credit risk rises, and the euro can strengthen, which hits exporters right where it hurts. The result: nervous selloffs around ECB press conferences, whipsaw moves on every new inflation or growth print, and a DAX that feels like it is constantly reacting rather than trending.\nRight now, the market is caught in a tug-of-war. On one side, you have rate-cut hope and the argument that the worst inflation is already behind us. On the other, you have recession fear and the uncomfortable reality that Germany\u2019s growth engine has been sputtering. The ECB is trying to walk a very thin line, and every hint from Lagarde about future cuts or a longer plateau in rates acts like a trigger for algorithmic flows straight into or out of the DAX.\nIn simple trading terms: the DAX is not just an equity index, it is a leveraged bet on where EUR/USD and ECB policy go next. If the euro weakens and rate-cut expectations rise, German bulls come back fast. If the ECB stays stubborn and the euro firms up, rallies get sold into by macro funds and systematic strategies.\n2. Sector Check: German Autos Under Pressure vs. SAP and Siemens Holding the Line\nIf you want to understand why the DAX is not ripping higher, look directly at the auto sector. VW, BMW, and Mercedes are facing a multi-front war:\n- China risk: A huge share of their profits still depends on Chinese demand. But local EV competitors in China are gaining ground fast, price wars are brutal, and geopolitics are adding another layer of risk.\n- EV transition costs: The shift from combustion engines to electric vehicles is cap"

All three major indexes eked out tiny gains on Tuesday in a volatile session driven by rising and ebbing tech jitters.\nThe minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting revealed starkly diverging views among policymakers on the appropriate path of monetary policy. Some officials want to leave the door open for the Fed to raise rates if inflation remains sticky, while others are eager to continue cutting, according to the minutes released Wednesday.\nThe majority of officials voted in late January to leave interest rates unchanged for the first time since July. The odds of more cuts in the next few months dwindled last week following surprisingly rosy inflation and jobs reports. The December Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is set to be released on Friday morning.\nTech stocks found their footing Wednesday. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose 1.6% after social media giant Meta (META) announced a new deal to buy millions of its chips. Several of Wall Street's favorite AI \"pick and shovel\" stocks rose, including Micron (MU) and Western Digital (WDC). Meta shares rose 0.6%.\nThe remainder of the Magnificent Seven closed in the green. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) rose nearly 2% despite Berkshire Hathaway reporting on Tuesday it had sold nearly all of its stake in the e-commerce giant. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) posted marginal gains.\nOn the earnings front, shares of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) slid 7% after its earnings guidance came up short of expectations. The stocks of chip firms Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and Analog Devices (ADI) rose 8% and 3%, respectively, after each topped estimates on the top and bottom lines.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans including mortgages, was recently 4.08%, up from 4.06% at Tuesday's close.\nWest Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, rose about 4.5% to $65.10 a barrel after Vice President JD Vance cast doubt on the progress of diplomatic negotiations between the U.S. and Iran. Gold and silver futures rebounded from their slump yesterday. Gold climbed 1.8% to $4,995 an ounce, while silver rose 4.9% to $77.10 an ounce.\nBitcoin traded around $66,300 in the late afternoon, down from its overnight highs above $68,000. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of currencies, ticked up 0.6% to 97.70.\nHoops or Hockey? Investors Might Get to Own Shares of the Knicks and Rangers\nIf you've always wanted to own a piece of a pro basketball team, this deal might be a slam dunk. (If you prefer ice hockey, insert your favorite metaphor here.)\nMadison Square Garden Sports (MSGS), which owns the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers, said its board would explore a spinoff that would create publicly traded companies for each team. (The stadium itself is owned by Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSGE), which was created by the 2020 separation of the teams from the facility.)\n\"We believe this proposed transaction would provide each company with enhanced strategic flexibility, its own defined business focus, and clear characteristics for investors,\" MSGS CEO Jim Dolan said.\nThe company's statement said no timetable had been set for a deal, and that it was not certain one would happen. League approval would be required, the company said.\nThe deal would offer investors an opportunity to do something comparatively rare: put their money where their rooting mouths are.\nMost sports teams are privately owned, and none of the organizations in the top U.S. leagues\u2014the NBA and NHL, but also the NFL, Major League"

                "body": "Wall Street ends higher, lifted by Nvidia and other AI stocks\nWall Street ended higher on Wednesday, lifted by gains in Nvidia, Amazon and other technology-related heavyweights following recent jitters about artificial intelligence. Nvidia climbed 1.6% after the world's most valuable company said it had signed a multi-year deal to sell to Meta Platforms millions of its current and future AI chips. Meta added 0.6%.\nSandisk, Western Digital and Seagate Technology Holdings climbed between 1.7% and 4.4% each, adding to strong gains in recent months fueled by massive AI-related demand for their storage technology.\nAI-related stocks lost ground earlier this month as investors worried about high valuations and how long it might take for AI investments to boost revenue growth.\nAmazon added 1.8% and Microsoft rose 0.7% on Wednesday.\n\"At a certain point, weakness in tech was bound to bring in the marginal buyer. These are still high-growth names. They were expensive and they've gotten cheaper,\" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. \"There are still a lot of people who want to be exposed to tech for the next several years.\"\nSoftware makers also showed signs of recovery following recent worries that improved AI tools could lead to more competition and squeeze their profit margins. The S&P 500 software and services sector increased 1.1% after tumbling earlier this month. It was helped by advancing Cadence Design Systems shares, after the chip-design software provider beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates. Palo Alto Networks dropped 6.8% after trimming its annual profit forecast.\nEnergy leads S&P sector indexes up\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.56% to end the session at 6,881.31 points.\nThe Nasdaq gained 0.78% to 22,753.64 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.26% to 49,662.66 points.\nThe Nasdaq was up as much as 1.4% before trimming its gains in the afternoon.\nEight of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by energy , up 2%, followed by a 1% gain in consumer discretionary .\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was light, with 16.8 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 20.7 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.\nWith Wednesday's gains, the S&P 500 is up about 0.5% in 2026, while the Nasdaq is down 2.1%. Federal Reserve officials were in nearly unanimous agreement to keep interest rates on hold at their meeting last month, but remained split over what might happen next, according to minutes of their January 27-28 meeting released on Wednesday.\nTraders are pricing in a roughly 50% chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points by the Fed's June meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. Data released on Wednesday showed solid business spending and U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter.\nAnalog Devices rose 2.6% after the chipmaker forecast second-quarter results above Wall Street estimates.\nGlobal Payments jumped over 16% after the payment technology firm projected annual adjusted profit above expectations.\nModerna climbed about 6% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration agreed to review its influenza vaccine, reversing an earlier decision rejecting the application.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 1.7-to-one ratio.\nThe S&P 500 posted 23 new highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 101 new highs and 120 new lows.\n___\nReporting by Shashwat Chauhan and Twesha Dikshit in Bengaluru, and by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Pooja Desai, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Rod Nickel"

As the oldest of five, she grew up alongside her brothers Bernard, Willard, and Gary, and her baby sister, Sally, offering steady guidance and setting a loving example from the very beginning.\nIn 1964, she married Dr. Gerald \u201cJerry\u201d Gehl, beginning a love story that spanned over six decades. Their early married life took them to San Diego while Jerry served in the United States Navy, where they welcomed their first daughter, Holly.\nFollowing their time in California, Carol and Jerry returned to Wisconsin and settled in Madison. There they experienced both profound sorrow and deep joy, losing their beloved son, Paul, at the age of two and welcoming their cherished daughter, Sara. Through every season of life, Carol showed what it meant to move forward with grace. The family later lived in Neenah before ultimately settling in Chippewa Falls, which they called home for the past 35 years.\nCarol was a devoted mother and an extraordinary role model for her daughters. As a registered nurse, she lived out her calling to care for others with skill and compassion. She was also deeply committed to defending the rights of women and gave generously of her time in service to her community. Among her many contributions, she was instrumental in creating a car seat distribution program for newborns when car seat laws were first enacted in the 1970s, a legacy that continues to protect families.\nCarol loved art and music and was an incredible seamstress, cook, and pianist. Her music filled the house, her meals gathered family, and her handmade creations became treasured heirlooms. She and Jerry also shared a love of travel and were fortunate to enjoy many adventures together, building a lifetime of memories side by side.\nCarol was preceded in death by her husband, Jerry, in 2023, and by her son, Paul. We take comfort in imagining their reunion and the continuation of a love that endures.\nShe is lovingly survived by her daughters, Holly (Tim) Reiter and Sara (Scott) Eidam; her grandchildren, Sophia and Joel Reiter, Gale and Andrew Eidam; and her great-grandson, Atlas, born in 2025. Carol was overjoyed to meet Atlas in December, a moment of pure happiness.\nIn every era of her life, Carol led with steadfast love, resilience, service, and strength. She leaves behind a family shaped by her example and a community better because she lived in it.\nThe family is deeply grateful to St. Croix Hospice for the extraordinary compassion, dignity, and comfort they provided during Carol\u2019s final days.\nA private family service will be held.\nIn lieu of flowers, those wishing to honor Carol\u2019s legacy of compassion and advocacy may consider a donation to Family Support Center, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, or the ACLU of Wisconsin, organizations whose missions reflect the causes she cared about deeply.\nVisits: 1257\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the\nGoogle Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nService map data \u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors"

US industrial production had its biggest jump in nearly a year, business equipment orders beat forecasts, and housing starts hit a five-month high \u2013 a mix that suggests US demand is holding up. That tends to support Japan\u2019s export-heavy, tech-leaning market because global growth expectations and US tech sentiment often spill over into Tokyo. Next up is the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ\u2019s) bench. Japan\u2019s government is expected to name replacements for two of the central bank\u2019s nine boar..\nd seats, and Bloomberg says nominations could come as soon as February 25. Those picks matter because the board shapes the policy outlook that influences bond yields and the yen \u2013 two big inputs for Japanese company profits.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Tokyo still takes cues from US tech.\nWhen US megacap tech stabilizes, Japan often benefits fast \u2013 many Nikkei heavyweights sit in semiconductors, electronics, and export supply chains. But the flip side is sensitivity: if US data re-accelerates inflation worries and pushes global yields up, riskier growth stocks can lose their shine again.\nThe bigger picture: Personnel moves can steer policy expectations.\nBoJ leadership changes can shift how investors price the next phase of monetary policy, even before any decision is made. A board that looks more hawkish could keep the yen firmer and lift funding costs, while a more dovish lineup would point to easier conditions lasting longer \u2013 and that would ripple across global FX and rate markets.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
