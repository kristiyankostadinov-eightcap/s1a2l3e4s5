The precious metal in October contributed close to half or more of the 1.2% jump in the core index, which excludes food and energy, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co."

                "body": "Gold prices increased by over 2% on Monday as expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut at the December meeting grew. Despite news of a potential US government reopening pushing the US Dollar higher, gold maintained its gains, with XAU/USD trading at $4,092.\nThe US Senate has approved a measure that could reopen the government, supported by Democratic lawmakers, with President Donald Trump expressing optimism. Senate Republican leader John Thune hopes for a rapid vote on stopgap funding, paralleled by House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s actions to get the bill voted on by Wednesday. Recent US data indicated economic softening, with the Fedwatch Tool showing a 61% probability of a December rate cut, down from 66.8% the previous week.\nMarket Dynamics\nDespite a recovering US Dollar Index, which rose over 0.12% to 99.67, gold continued its surge. US Treasury yields remained steady, and US real yields, inversely correlating with gold, climbed nearly two basis points. The University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index dipped, while gold ETFs saw inflows of 54.9 tonnes in October, and significant job cuts were reported for the month.\nGold\u2019s current technical outlook is bullish, targeting the $4,100 level. The Relative Strength Index supports this upward momentum, while major resistance and support levels are noted at $4,100 and $4,000, respectively.\nWe are seeing gold rally strongly toward the $4,100 level, a move that is primarily fueled by market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. Despite a stronger US Dollar and some hawkish comments from Fed officials, traders are holding onto the 61% probability of an upcoming cut. This conviction is keeping bids for the yellow metal firm.\nGiven the bullish momentum, derivative traders might consider call options to capitalize on a potential breakout. With the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) hovering around 17, buying calls with a strike price just above $4,100 could capture further upside toward the October high of $4,161. This strategy positions for the market continuing to price in easier monetary policy ahead of the Fed\u2019s actual decision.\nInvestment Strategies\nHowever, we must factor in the risk of a reversal, as the dollar\u2019s recovery is a significant headwind. The latest official Consumer Price Index report for October 2025 showed inflation still at 3.2%, giving credibility to the Fed\u2019s cautious stance. This makes purchasing put options with a strike price below the $4,000 psychological support a reasonable hedge against a hawkish surprise.\nThe economic signals are notably mixed, which creates opportunity in the options market. We saw the economy grow at a surprisingly strong 4.9% annualized rate in the third quarter of 2025, which clashes with the recent drop in consumer sentiment and the spike in layoffs. This divergence suggests that volatility could increase as new data is released in the coming weeks.\nLooking back, this scenario has historical parallels; we saw a similar pattern back in 2019 when gold rallied for months in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s pivot to easing. That precedent suggests the market will continue to front-run the Fed, favoring gold as long as rate cut odds remain elevated. The key will be watching if upcoming inflation or jobs data can meaningfully shift those expectations."

However, Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan recommends buying the dip, rather than chasing the rally. The analyst shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:\nGold Performance:- Although expectations of the ongoing US shutdown ending soon boosted risk appetite, spot gold extended its Friday's rally to surge sharply higher on Monday on the Fed rate cut expectations, wobbly US Dollar and China's Central Bank adding gold reserves for 12th month in a row in October.\n- Gold gained on inflation concerns also as President Donald Trump once again floated the idea of sending Americans rebate checks of at least $2000 a person (excluding high income people) for the tariffs that his administration has collected.\n- At the time of writing this article, spot gold was trading with a huge daily gain of 2.34% at $4,096, while MCX Gold December contract at Rs 123,707 was up 2.07%.\n- In the week ending November 7, spot gold prices posted a weekly loss of $1 to close at $4001, which amounts to a third straight weekly loss per se.\nUS Shutdown likely to end:- On November 9, the US Senate advanced a plan to end the longest-ever US government shutdown that entered the week. A faction of moderate democrats defied their party leaders and voted to support a deal to end the ongoing shutdown.\n- As flight disruptions have worsened due heavy snow, the ongoing shutdown may intensify the stress on the US air-traffic system ahead of the busy Thanksgiving travel period as controllers may have to continue to work without pay checks.\nFedspeak:- Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis President Musalem expects the US economy to bounce back strongly early next year due to rate cuts, fiscal support, deregulation and the government shutdown ending. He urged the Fed officials to be cautious on additional rate cuts as he thinks that the current Fed policy is close to the level where it would not put any downward pressure on inflation.\n- On the contrary, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly warned against keeping interest rates too high for too long due to softening labour market and moderating wage growth.\nUS Dollar Index and yields:- At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index at 99.72 was up around 0.15% for the day. Day\u2019s low has been 99.45.\n- Ten-year US yields at 4.11% were up by around 1.50 bps, while 2-year yields at 3.59% were up by around 3 bps.\nUS Data roundup:- US employment report has not been published in November, which makes it the second month without a national employment report.\n- Bloomberg estimates that depending on the US government reopening date, September employment report may be published on November 19/November 26. Even then the report may not offer true picture due to uncertainty over Federal government employment figures. Other reports will also be delayed.\n- October CPI report may not be released though.\n- Data released in the week ending November 7 were largely mixed as US ISM manufacturing trailed the forecast and contracted for the seventh straight month in October, while ISM services at 52.40 beat the forecast of 50.80 to rise at the fastest pace since February.\n- University of Michigan Consumer sentiment fell from 53.60 in October to 50.30 in November, near record-low and even lower than 2008 global financial crisis and Covid levels.\n- It is to be noted that ADP data released last week showed that US companies added 42K jobs in October, which signalled a moderate stabilization in the US job market. Challenger job cuts report showed almost 950,000 US job cuts this year through September, the highest year-to-date total since 2020.\nGold ETFs and COMEX inventory:- Total known global gold ETF holdings rose for two straight days through November 7 to 97.24 MOz, though were"

Dollar weakness on Monday was supportive for crude prices. Crude also rose with stock prices on Monday amid speculation that the US is close to reopening the government, which would be supportive of economic growth and energy demand.\nDon\u2019t Miss a Day: From crude oil to coffee, sign up free for Barchart\u2019s best-in-class commodity analysis.On Sunday, a group of eight Senate Democrats broke with their party to vote with Republicans to advance a bill to reopen the government. The move boosted market sentiment and sparked a risk-on mood in asset markets.\nStrength in crude demand from China, the world's second-largest crude consumer, is supportive of prices, after a report last Friday showed that China's Jan-Oct crude imports rose +3.1% y/y to 471 MMT.\nEnergy demand concerns are bearish for oil prices after Saudi Arabia last Thursday lowered the price of its main crude grade to Asia for delivery next month to the lowest level in 11 months.\nOil prices also have support on recent reports that the US military may be on the verge of launching military strikes on Venezuela, which is the world's 12th largest oil producer.\nOPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members will raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus. The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026. OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore. OPEC's October crude production rose by +50,000 bpd to 29.07 million bpd, the highest in 2.5 years.\nReduced crude exports from Russia are supportive of oil prices. Ukraine has targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past three months, exacerbating a fuel crunch in Russia and limiting Russia's crude export capabilities. Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries and oil export terminals curbed Russia's total seaborne fuel shipments to 1.88 million bpd in the first ten days of October, the lowest average in over 3.25 years, and have knocked out 13% to 20% of Russia's refining capacity by the end of October, curbing production by as much as 1.1 million bpd. New US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have also curbed Russian oil exports.\nVortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days rose +11% w/w to 95.18 million bbls in the week ended November 7.\nLast Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of October 31 were -5.3% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -4.3% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -8.8% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending October 31 rose +0.1% w/w to a record high of 13.651 million bpd.\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending November 7 remained unchanged at 414, modestly above the 4-year low of 410 rigs set on August 1. Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

                "body": "China has imposed new export\u2026\n\"It's most important 8 minute read of my week\u2026\"\nThe Changqing shale oil field in Northwestern China has produced a cumulative 20 million tons of crude, Chinese media reported, noting the amount marks the start of a new phase in domestic oil production.\nThe amount, equal to some 146.6 million barrels, is notable mostly because of the challenging geology of China\u2019s shale deposits, which has made it more difficult to tap the oil and gas resources in them. However, on Beijing\u2019s orders, the industry has delivered, boosting domestic production of both oil and gas considerably, notably from shale basins.\nThe Changqing field accounted for over half of China\u2019s shale oil production in 2024 and is currently producing at a rate of 10,000 tons daily, equal to some 73,300 barrels daily. This does not sound like a whole lot, but CNPC, which operates the field, is constantly working to boost its output, planning an annual average of over 3.5 million tons for this year. The amount would be equal to some 2.56 million barrels. The Changqing field has proven reserves of over 1 billion tons of crude oil.\nBecause of the complicated geology, it took years for the field to achieve a cumulative production of 10 million tons. More specifically, it took 12 years. Doubling that to 20 million tons, however, only took three years, the People\u2019s Daily reported. Thanks to that production boost, China\u2019s total shale oil output last year booked a 30% increase on the year to 6 million tons, or some 44 million barrels in total. The country\u2019s total crude oil production hit 213 million tons in 2024.\nCNPC is not the only one working on ramping up shale production. Such efforts are underway across basins. Earlier this year, China\u2019s authorities certified over 1.4 billion barrels of new reserves at several shale plays operated by the state-owned major Sinopec.\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nIrina is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry."

The pair is steady at 1.1560, with US government closure hitting 41 days, and Federal Reserve commentary influencing market sentiments amid sparse data releases. Recent US data signals economic strain, while caution is seen in European Central Bank stances.\nThe White House supports a bipartisan deal to reopen the government shortly. Despite Senate approval, the House Representatives await notice to return for passing the bill. The US Dollar Index holds at 99.56, driven by mixed Federal Reserve signals on economic resilience and inflation.\nThe Challenger report revealed a high of 153,000 job cuts in October, the most in two decades, indicating expectations for policy easing by the Fed. Divergent monetary policies between the ECB and Fed may influence further EUR/USD changes. Eurozone inflation closer to the 2% target is noted by ECB Vice President de Guindos, with caution advised by other policymakers.\nLooking ahead, market attention shifts to Europe\u2019s economic sentiment indices. Despite recent bullish days, EUR/USD may remain downward biased without strength to surpass key resistance levels. Key upcoming economic indicators and sentiment surveys will play roles in dictating currency movements.\nAs of November 11, 2025, we see EUR/USD trading flat around 1.1560, caught between two major forces. The primary drag on the US Dollar is the ongoing 41-day government shutdown and signs of a cooling American economy. Meanwhile, the Euro is finding support from a more cautious European Central Bank, creating a clear policy divergence that we must watch.\nEconomic Implications of the Shutdown\nThe shutdown is beginning to bite, with the Congressional Budget Office recently estimating it shaves 0.2% off quarterly GDP for every week it continues. This confirms the weak data we\u2019ve seen, like last week\u2019s Challenger report on job cuts and the most recent Non-Farm Payrolls for October 2025, which came in at just 95,000, far below expectations. This economic strain is fueling bets that the Federal Reserve will have to act soon to support the economy.\nWe are now looking at a 66% probability of a Fed rate cut in December, a stark contrast to the ECB\u2019s position. Recent Eurozone data showed core HICP inflation holding stubbornly at 2.8% year-over-year, giving ECB officials reason to maintain current interest rates. This growing gap in monetary policy outlook, which is reminiscent of the dollar weakness we saw in late 2023 when the Fed first signaled a policy pivot, makes a stronger Euro the more likely outcome.\nFor derivative traders, this outlook suggests buying EUR/USD call options to capitalize on potential upside in the coming weeks. We should consider options with December 2025 or January 2026 expiries to cover the period of the next Fed meeting. Strikes around 1.1650 or even 1.1700 could offer significant returns if the expected policy divergence plays out and the pair breaks through its key resistance levels.\nHowever, we must manage the downside risk, as a sudden deal to end the shutdown could cause a sharp, short-term rally in the Dollar. If the pair fails to break above the 20-day average at 1.1592, the upward momentum may fade. We can use put options with a strike below 1.1500 as a hedge or to position for a potential slide towards the August cycle low of 1.1391."

                "body": "EUR/USD, FTSE 100 Forecast: Two trades to watch\nEUR/USD rises on hopes the US government could reopen soon, EZ sentiment data weakens\nEUR/USD has recovered from its recent multi-month low, rising above 1.16 to its highest level since October\u2014 amid optimism over the end of the US government shutdown and ahead of a slew of ECB and Fed speakers across the week.\nOn Sunday, the US Senate moved forward on a measure to reopen the federal government and end the shutdown, with President Trump saying that the shutdown was closer to an end. Safe havens such as the Japanese yen and the US dollar were under pressure, whilst riskier currencies such as the AUD and GBP were pushing higher. The improved market mood was also helping the EUR.\nThe ending of the US government shutdown means attention would return to U.S. economic data. Last week, the Challenger job report showed 153,000 job cuts in October, marking the highest level for that month in 2 decades. The market is currently pricing in around a 66% probability of a Fed rate cut in December, up from 62% a week ago.\nAttention will be on Fed speakers this week for further clues on the likelihood of another rate reduction next month.\nAttention is also on ECB officials who speak this week. The ECB is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged for the foreseeable future, given that inflation is tracking near 2% and the eurozone economy shows signs of resilience. Money markets are only pricing in a 45% likelihood of a rate cut by September 2026. While some ECB officials have emphasised caution, the focus will remain on growth.\nOn the data front, the eurozone Sentix investor confidence index dropped to -7.4 in November, from -5.4 previously. This deterioration in sentiment suggests there may not be an autumn economic upturn. That said, recent PMI data has been encouraging. Business activity last week reached a multi-year high.\nEUR/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nAfter running into resistance at 1.1920 in mid-September, EUR/USD rebounded lower. It trades within a falling channel. The price ran into support at 1.1470 and has recovered higher to 1.1570 at the time of writing.\nShould the recovery continue, buyers will look to rise above the 50 SMA at 1.1670 and 1.17 to create a higher high.\nHowever, failure to rise out of the falling channel could see the price extend its downtrend. A break below 1.1470 creates a lower low, bringing 1.14 into focus.\nFTSE 100 rises on hopes of an end to the US government shutdown\nIf it's a long with its European pairs are heading higher amid hopes of an end to the US government shutdown, which is boosting risk sentiment at the start of the week. While the FTSE is approaching record highs, it is rising at a slower pace than its European peers owing to the lack of tech stocks.\nDiageo is topping the leaderboard, up 7% after naming former Tesco chief Dave Lewis as its new CEO. Investors are seeing this as an opportunity for a cultural reset amid a tricky time for the firm.\nFresnillo was also surging, tracking Gold prices higher. The precious metal has rallied by almost 2% in early trade as investors turned their attention back to Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations following weak Challenger job-cut data last week.\nMiners are also performing well after Chinese data over the weekend showed that inflation ticked higher to 0.2% YoY in October, up from -0.3% in September.\nAmid the risk of mood defensive stocks were underperforming, with names such as BT, National Grid, and BT falling.\nThe UK economic calendar is quiet today.

                "body": "GBP/USD forecast: Currency Pair of the Week | November 10, 2025\nThe GBP/USD edged higher Monday morning, and was on course to post a fourth day of gains with US dollar down across the board on the back of a positive session for risk assets. At the time of writing, US index futures were higher by more than 1% by mid-morning London session, with European markets also up sharply and Bitcoin rising to $106K after its brief dip below $100K handle last week. Risk sentiment took a boost from optimism the US Senate was getting close to ending the US government shutdown. If this happens, we will have plenty of US economic data that have been delayed and that could provide further clarity for the Fed and investors alike. Last week, though, the available US data we had from the private sector pointed to an overall weaker economy. That helped to give a lift to foreign currencies, except the safe haven Japanese yen. With key UK data to come this week, the GBP/USD forecast will be in focus, although the budget at the end of the month is a bigger risk event for UK assets.\nDollar remains under mild pressure\nLast week saw the US dollar index briefly poke its head above the 100.00 level, where it struggled and turned lower from. There are several factors that prevent the US dollar from rising further, with the prolonged US government shutdown being one. On top of this, the latest signs of a cooling US labour market added to the unease, prompting a shift towards foreign currencies. Last week\u2019s Challenger report showed more than 153,000 job cuts in the US, primarily in the tech and warehousing sectors. With official federal data still unavailable, investors are relying heavily on private reports \u2014 leading to heightened volatility. Although the ADP payrolls data briefly lifted sentiment, money markets are now pricing in a greater probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December, keeping the dollar largely undermined.\nBut at the weekend, the US Senate took a major step towards re-opening the government. A group of moderate Democrats voted to support a deal to end shutdown, resulting in a 60-40 Senate vote on a procedural measure to advance the bill. The Senate will meet again today, and we could see a vinal bot on the bills, before it goes to the House. Once approved there, then President Donald Trump will need to sign it as part of the formalities.\nGBP/USD 100 forecast: UK wage and GDP in focus\nThis week\u2019s global macro calendar is quite quiet, but for the UK we will have a couple of important indicators scheduled for release. Average earnings will be released on Tuesday and Q3 GDP among a few other macro pointers will be released on Thursday.\nThe Bank of England was more dovish when holding rates last week, as 4 instead of the 3 expected MPC members voted to cut interest rates. The Bank said rates are likely on gradual downward path and that risk to inflation is now more balanced. Earnings feed into inflation so any weakness here could cement expectations for a December cut. Meanwhile, the UK economy has been expanding at a faster pace than expected in the last three quarters. Most recently, GDP increased by 0.3% in Q2. As well as monthly and quarterly GDP estimates, we will also have construction and manufacturing output, industrial production and a few other UK macro indicators released at the same time on Thursday, potentially making a pivotal day for the GBP/USD forecast.\nTechnical GBP/USD forecast and key levels to watch\nFrom a technical standpoint, the GBP/USD forecast looks somewhat positive after rates refused to hold below prior support in the 1.3100-1.3140 range. The fact that this area has now been reclaimed is a positive sign. Yet the bearish trend still looms around 1.3250 where the 200-day average will also need to be addressed. So, it is not out of the woods just yet and level to level remains the name of the game, especially with those economic pointers to come from the UK and then later this month the budget.

                "body": "Pound Sterling Faces Pressure from US Dollar Strength\nMarket observers remain attentive to insights from figures like the BoE\u2019s official speech or trading advice such as FXStreet newsletters. They continue to monitor global economic indicators, including ECB tones and the impact of the US shutdown on investment markets.\nFinancial markets are cautioned to conduct thorough research prior to investments due to inherent risks. Neither the holiday periods nor previous market experiences should induce a false sense of stability or safety in investments or currency volatility.\nCurrent Economic Outlook for Pound Sterling\nGiven the current date of November 10, 2025, we are seeing the Pound Sterling consolidating near 1.3150 against the US Dollar. This stability appears fragile as the market increasingly expects the Bank of England (BoE) to cut interest rates at its upcoming December policy meeting. The primary driver for this sentiment is the weakening UK economic outlook.\nWe can see the data supports this cautious stance on the Pound. UK inflation has fallen considerably from the 7.9% we saw back in mid-2023, with the latest figures showing headline CPI at just 2.3%, much closer to the BoE\u2019s target. This slowdown, combined with stagnant Q3 GDP growth of only 0.1%, gives the BoE justification to pivot towards a more dovish policy to stimulate the economy.\nIn contrast, the US economy is showing more resilience, with recent data indicating stronger growth and more persistent core inflation than in the UK. This divergence reinforces the view that the Federal Reserve may hold interest rates higher for longer than the Bank of England. This policy gap makes holding the US Dollar more attractive and adds further downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests positioning for potential Sterling weakness in the coming weeks. We are observing a notable increase in demand for put options on GBP/USD with expiration dates set for late December, just after the BoE\u2019s meeting. This indicates that traders are buying protection or speculating on a drop below the current 1.3150 support level.\nLooking back, we remember the significant currency volatility following major policy shifts, such as the period after the 2022 mini-budget announcement. While the current situation is different, it serves as a reminder of how quickly the Pound can move when market sentiment aligns with central bank action. The elevated expectations for a rate cut mean that any surprise from the BoE could lead to a pronounced move in the currency."

The return to risk saw the Aussie rise across the board, with traders refocusing on a less-dovish RBA stance ahead of Thursday\u2019s employment report.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - source: LSEG\nView related analysis:\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: RBA Hold Puts Focus on AU Jobs, US CPI\n- EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD Outlook: Euro Dominates Commodity Currencies\n- 153 Remains Pivotal For USD/JPY, AUD/USD Stabilises with Wall Street Bounce\n- ASX 200 Morning Outlook: Bulls Regain Control With Broad Sector Rebound\nAUD/USD, EUR/AUD, and GBP/AUD Technical Setups\nIn yesterday\u2019s weekly AUD/USD outlook, I outlined a bias for the Aussie to rise toward the monthly pivot point at 0.6537 before reversing lower.

Australia\u2019s inflation increased to 1.3% in the third quarter, a rise from the previous quarter\u2019s 0.7%, indicating ongoing price pressure.\nThe AUD/USD pair appreciated by 0.40% to roughly 0.6520. China\u2019s economic signals, including a 0.2% CPI rise and moderated PPI decline, have bolstered the Australian Dollar, alongside China\u2019s move to suspend its export ban on specific strategic metals.\nThe United States Dollar Stability\nThe US Dollar remains stable following the Senate\u2019s approval of a temporary funding bill that prevents a government shutdown until January. Despite a volatile period, the US Dollar Index shows steadiness around 99.60, reflecting monetary policy discussions and upcoming rate implications.\nOn the financial markets, analysts are considering the potential actions of the Federal Reserve, with a 63% probability estimated for a December rate cut. Various Fed officials have acknowledged the strength of the US economy but stress the need to remain vigilant on inflation.\nThe currency exchange percentages reveal the Australian Dollar as the strongest against the Japanese Yen, showcasing the day\u2019s trading dynamics. Major currencies and their fluctuations are presented in a heat map, detailing percentage changes.\nWe are seeing a clear signal from the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose recent hawkish comments are supported by data showing quarterly inflation has accelerated to 1.3%. This keeps the annual inflation rate well above the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target band, making further policy tightening, or at least a delay in any cuts, highly probable. The RBA\u2019s current cash rate of 4.35% may need to remain restrictive for an extended period.\nMonetary Policy Divergence\nIn contrast, the market is signaling a different path for the US Federal Reserve, with current pricing showing a 63% probability of a rate cut in December. This growing monetary policy divergence, with Australia on a hawkish hold and the US tilting dovish, is a classic setup for Aussie dollar strength. This makes going long the AUD against the USD an attractive proposition.\nAdding to this momentum, we see positive signs from China, with consumer prices ticking up and producer price deflation easing. The temporary lifting of export bans on key metals also reduces geopolitical risk, which typically benefits risk-sensitive currencies like the AUD. This backdrop of improving Chinese demand and lower trade tensions provides a solid foundation for the Aussie.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests positioning for further AUD/USD upside in the coming weeks. One strategy would be to buy AUD/USD call options with expirations in late December or January to capture a potential rally driven by central bank actions. This approach defines your risk while providing exposure to any upward movement in the currency pair.\nWe have seen a similar dynamic before, for instance in the 2009-2011 period when the RBA hiked rates while the Fed kept policy at zero. That divergence ultimately drove the AUD/USD exchange rate above parity. While we aren\u2019t forecasting such a dramatic move, it serves as a historical reminder of how powerful this theme can be for currency markets.\nGiven that one-month implied volatility for the AUD/USD pair has recently increased to around 9.5%, options are pricing in more movement. Traders should watch the 0.6550 level as a key technical resistance. A sustained break above this point could signal a broader move higher, making it a critical level to monitor for entry and exit points."

The pair remains supported by the persistent weakness of the Japanese Yen (JPY), pressured by uncertainty over the Bank of Japan (BoJ)\u2019s policy outlook.\nMarkets doubt the likelihood of an imminent BoJ rate increase after the cautious comments from board member Junko Nakagawa, who said the central bank would act carefully given ongoing global trade uncertainties. This prudence, combined with the prospect of a $65 billion economic stimulus plan promoted by new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, fuels expectations that monetary policy will remain accommodative.\nThe Japanese Yen is also weighed down by weaker-than-expected domestic data. Household spending rose just 1.8% YoY in September, below the 2.5% forecast, while private consumption shows signs of cooling.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar (USD) is modestly rebounding after several days of decline, supported by progress in the US Senate toward passing a bill extending federal funding through January, which helps ease fears of another government shutdown. The US Dollar Index (DXY) consolidates around 99.60, helped by the prospect of reopening federal agencies and resuming the release of key economic data, including the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, markets now assign a 63% chance to another rate cut at the December meeting of the Federal Reserve (Fed). Cautious remarks from Fed officials such as Alberto Musalem (St. Louis Fed) and Mary Daly (San Francisco Fed) suggest that the central bank remains open to further easing while acknowledging the resilience of the US economy.\nThus, while USD/JPY remains upward-biased in the short term, its appreciation potential appears limited by the BoJ\u2019s cautious stance and expectations of prolonged monetary easing in the United States.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

In Monday\u2019s Asian session, the pair traded near 153.90\u2013154.10, supported by improved fiscal sentiment and rising Treasury yields, while Japan\u2019s policy ambiguity kept the yen under pressure.\nPolitical Relief in the U.S. Bolsters Dollar Strength\nThe tone in Washington continues to drive the short-term direction of USD/JPY. Reports confirming that the U.S. Senate voted 60\u201340 in favor of advancing a bipartisan spending bill to reopen the federal government have strengthened the dollar, calming risk sentiment after weeks of fiscal paralysis. The proposed funding measure would maintain operations through January 31, 2026, ensuring continued financing for key programs such as SNAP and Veterans Affairs. The development follows comments from President Donald Trump, who expressed confidence that the impasse was \u201cvery close to ending.\u201d This easing of fiscal risk has revived Treasury buying interest, but the 2-year yield remains anchored near 4.68%, showing that traders still anticipate Fed policy easing in December.\nFederal Reserve Outlook: The Key Variable for USD/JPY\nWith the government reopening likely to allow the release of delayed economic data, investors now turn to the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting. FedWatch data show that the probability of a rate cut rose from 63.0% on October 31 to 66.9% on November 7, reflecting a softening macro tone. While officials like Mary Daly and Alberto Musalem highlighted resilient economic conditions, both hinted that inflation, now hovering close to 3.0%, could justify a cautious approach. This divergence between market expectations for rate cuts and the Fed\u2019s measured stance leaves USD/JPY oscillating within a narrow band as traders price competing forces of monetary easing and U.S. growth strength.\nBank of Japan\u2019s Mixed Messaging and Policy Paralysis\nAcross the Pacific, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) continues to send conflicting signals. Board member Junko Nakagawa emphasized that policy decisions must remain deliberate given global trade uncertainty, particularly around tariff policies. The BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions revealed internal divisions: of thirteen policymakers, only five favored a hawkish bias, with the remainder arguing for patience to gauge the impact of corporate wage increases and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s new economic agenda. The central bank reaffirmed its view that inflation could stabilize near 2% by late 2026, but wage-driven demand must first prove sustainable.\nThis cautious stance has prolonged the yen\u2019s weakness. Policymakers\u2019 reluctance to signal tightening keeps real yields in Japan deeply negative. The 10-year JGB yield remains near 0.96%, while the U.S.\u2013Japan spread sits above 370 basis points, maintaining strong upward pressure on USD/JPY.\nVerbal Intervention Risk and Market Sensitivity\nJapanese officials are again voicing concern over yen depreciation. Finance Minister Katayama reiterated that authorities are \u201cwatching FX moves with a high sense of urgency,\u201d especially as the pair trades consistently above 154.00. Historically, verbal interventions intensify once USD/JPY crosses 154.20\u2013154.50, with actual action often triggered if speculative momentum accelerates beyond 155.00. Traders recall that in 2024, coordinated action by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) caused a 1.8-yen intraday reversal, underscoring the government"

                "body": "Japanese Yen bears turn cautious as intervention fears offset BoJ uncertainty\n- The Japanese Yen attracts follow-through selling amid uncertainty over the BoJ's rate hike.\n- Hopes for the end of the US government shutdown undermine the JPY\u2019s safe-haven status.\n- Fed rate cut bets keep the USD bulls on the defensive and cap gains for the USD/JPY pair.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) moves further away from a fresh multi-month low touched against its American counterpart during the Asian session on Tuesday, though any meaningful appreciation seems elusive. The JPY bears turn cautious amid expectations that Japanese authorities might intervene to stem further weakness in the domestic currency. This, along with subdued US Dollar (USD) price action, keeps the USD/JPY pair capped near the 154.45-154.50 supply zone. However, the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the next interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could act as a headwind for the JPY.\nIn fact, the BoJ's Summary of Opinions, released on Monday, indicated divided views on rate hikes. Adding to this, BoJ\u2019s Junko Nakagawa said the central bank will proceed cautiously with policy decisions. This, in turn, reinforced market expectations that the BoJ could delay raising interest rates amid bets on a large-scale stimulus package under Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's administration, and might continue to undermine the JPY. Moreover, the possibility of an end to the US government shutdown might further contribute to keeping a lid on any meaningful appreciation for the safe-haven JPY.\nJapanese Yen draws some support from intervention fears; not out of the woods yet amid BoJ uncertainty\n- A summary of Bank of Japan policymakers' opinions at their October meeting, released on Monday, reflected a view that the time for another interest-rate hike is approaching. However, there was some uncertainty over the effect of new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s policies on the economy and prices.\n- Furthermore, several board members suggested the fallout from higher US tariffs and Japanese companies' wage momentum as key factors in deciding the timing of the next rate hike. Adding to this, BoJ's Junko Nakagawa warned of soft consumption and concern over the US economic outlook.\n- In fact, data released last Friday indicated that existing economic conditions might be influencing household expenditure and fueling speculations that weaker private consumption could cool demand-driven inflation. This adds to the BoJ uncertainty and continues to weigh on the Japanese Yen.\n- Japan\u2019s Economy Minister Minoru Kiuchi said on Tuesday that the government is increasingly aware that elevated inflation is eroding household purchasing power and will implement measures to cushion the impact of higher prices. He added that a weak JPY continues to push up import costs and consumer prices.\n- The Senate cleared a key hurdle late Sunday for a formal debate on a motion to resume funding to federal agencies and end the longest government shutdown in American history. The development provides an additional boost to investors' sentiment and further undermines the safe-haven JPY.\n- Meanwhile, the optimism pushes the US Treasury bond yields higher and assists the US Dollar (USD) to attract some buyers for the second straight day, further lending support to the USD/JPY pair. However, bets for another Federal Reserve rate cut in December could cap gains for the Greenback.\nUSD/JPY once again fails near the 154.45-154.50 pivotal hurdle; bullish potential seems intact\nA sustained strength beyond the 154.45-154.50 horizontal barrier will be seen as a fresh trigger for the USD/JPY bulls. Given that oscillators on the daily chart are holding comfortably in positive territory and are still away from being in the overbought zone, spot prices might then aim to conquer the 155.00 psychological mark. The momentum could extend further towards the 155.60-155.65 intermediate hurdle before the currency pair eventually climbs to "

The pair rises as the US Dollar (USD) gains support amid progress in the US Senate toward passing a deal to reopen the government.\nUS President Donald Trump, on Monday, backed a bipartisan deal to end the US government shutdown, signaling a likely reopening within days. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he expects Trump to sign the bill once Congress passes it. The US Senate advanced a government funding bill to end the shutdown, moving it closer toward passage by voting 60-40 in the first approval on extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\nOn US monetary policy, Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Stephen Miran told CNBC on Monday that inflation is easing and reaffirmed that staying on course with rate cuts is appropriate, suggesting a 50-basis-pointbps reduction in December, or at least 25 bps. Meanwhile, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem noted that inflation remains closer to 3% than the 2% target, adding that policymakers now have sufficient information to guide their decisions.\nHowever, the Canadian Dollar (CAD) may regain its ground against its peers as upbeat domestic labor market data have bolstered expectations that the Bank of Canada (BoC) may pause its easing cycle. Canada\u2019s Unemployment Rate fell to 6.9% in October, from 7.1% prior, coming in below expectations. The Net Change in Employment increased by 66.6K individuals, against 60.4K prior, while the Participation Rate improved to 65.3%.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic"

                "body": "The Canadian Dollar is recovering against the US Dollar following a recent setback, regaining ground after hitting 30-week lows. Trade discussions between Canada and the US remain stalled, creating uncertainty in the currency market.\nPrime Minister Mark Carney mentioned that no recent trade discussions have occurred since the US President halted them. The Canadian Dollar\u2019s future may depend on whether the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve continue or halt rate cuts.\nThe Bank Of Canada Strategic Influence\nThe Bank of Canada influences the CAD through interest rate settings aiming to keep inflation between 1-3%. A rise in Canadian inflation to 2.4% may impact these decisions. The health of Canada\u2019s economy and external factors like oil prices, its largest export, also affect the currency\u2019s value.\nMacroeconomic indicators including GDP, employment figures, and trade balance play a role in determining the value of the Canadian Dollar. Strong economic data tends to be supportive while weak data may lead to depreciation.\nThe current position of USD/CAD shows an upward trend, with room for short-term pullbacks. Technical indicators reveal waning buying pressure in the short term, pointing towards potential consolidation within a broader bullish trend.\nAs we see it today, November 11, 2025, the Canadian dollar is showing some fight after hitting a 30-week low against the greenback. With the USD/CAD rate pulling back towards the 1.4000 mark, the immediate play is to watch if this level holds as support. The broader trend still favors a stronger US dollar, so this could be a temporary retracement rather than a full reversal.\nThe US Federal Reserve And Market Expectations\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s position is a key factor, especially with inflation recently hitting 2.4%, which is above their target range. Combined with Canada\u2019s latest jobs report for October 2025, which showed unexpected strength by adding 45,000 new jobs, the central bank has little reason to consider cutting rates. This fundamental strength suggests traders could consider selling out-of-the-money call options on USD/CAD, betting that the pair will struggle to climb back to its recent highs above 1.4140 in the coming weeks.\nOn the other side of the border, the Federal Reserve is facing pressure to ease policy, with markets fully pricing in a rate cut by January 2026. The latest US retail sales figures from October showed a 0.5% contraction, fueling concerns about a consumer slowdown and adding weight to the argument for a Fed cut. This expectation is a headwind for the US dollar and supports the current bounce in the loonie.\nWe must also watch oil prices, as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has slipped below $82 a barrel this week amid concerns over slowing global demand. While this price is still historically supportive for Canada\u2019s economy, any further decline could cap the Canadian dollar\u2019s recovery. Traders who are long the Canadian dollar should consider hedging their positions against a potential drop in oil.\nGiven the stalled trade talks between Canada and the US, a significant rally in the Canadian dollar seems unlikely for now. This uncertainty creates a scenario where the USD/CAD pair could become range-bound between the 1.3900 and 1.4150 levels. This environment may be ideal for options strategies that profit from low volatility, such as selling straddles or strangles.\nWe remember the central bank divergence back in 2022 and 2023, which drove powerful currency trends for many months. While the current situation is less dramatic, the differing paths of the Bank of Canada and the Fed will be the primary driver of this pair into the new year. For now, the short-term momentum favors the Canadian dollar, but the longer-term bullish trend for USD/CAD remains intact."

About 11 basis points of easing is priced into the market by June next year.\n\u201cCombined with today\u2019s risk-on tone stemming from the prospect of the U.S. government re-opening, it is a little curious to us that the loonie has not made greater gains, though we think it will do over the coming days,\u201d Rees said.\nWall Street\u2019s main indexes rose following signs of progress in Washington to end a record government shutdown that has stalled economic data releases and intensified concerns over the state of the economy.\nCanadian government bond yields were mixed across the curve.

                "body": "GBP/JPY consolidates near two-week high, above 203.00 ahead of UK jobs data\n- GBP/JPY stalls a one-week-old uptrend as bulls turn cautious ahead of UK jobs data.\n- The BoJ rate hike uncertainty continues to undermine the JPY and supports the cross.\n- Dovish BoE expectations and the UK\u2019s fiscal concerns act as a headwind for spot prices.\nThe GBP/JPY cross enters a bullish consolidation phase and holds steady above the 203.00 round figure, near a two-week peak, touched during the Asian session on Tuesday. Traders now seem reluctant and opt to wait for the release of the UK employment details before positioning for an extension of the recent bounce from the 199.00 neighborhood, or a one-month low touched last week.\nThe crucial UK jobs report could make it easier to justify a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut next month as the Unemployment Rate in the three months to September is expected to creep higher to 4.9%, which would be the highest level since 2021. Any further signs of a slack in the UK labour market would back the case for more easing by the BoE on the back of softer inflation. This, along with concerns about the UK's fiscal situation, holds back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the British Pound (GBP) and caps the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, continues with its relative underperformance amid the Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike uncertainty. In fact, a summary of BoJ policymakers' opinions at their October meeting released on Monday reflected that there was some uncertainty over the effect of new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s policies on the economy and prices. Moreover, board members suggested the fallout from higher US tariffs and Japanese companies' wage momentum as key factors in deciding the timing of the next interest rate hike.\nAdding to this, BoJ\u2019s Junko Nakagawa said on Monday that the central bank will proceed cautiously with policy decisions. This, along with the upbeat market mood, is seen undermining the JPY's safe-haven status and offering some support to the GBP/JPY cross. However, expectations that Japanese authorities might intervene to stem further weakness in the domestic currency act as a headwind for the currency pair ahead of the UK macro data. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before positioning for any further gains.\nEconomic Indicator\nILO Unemployment Rate (3M)\nThe ILO Unemployment Rate released by the UK Office for National Statistics is the number of unemployed workers divided by the total civilian labor force. It is a leading indicator for the UK Economy. If the rate goes up, it indicates a lack of expansion within the UK labor market. As a result, a rise leads to a weakening of the UK economy. Generally, a decrease of the figure is seen as bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while an increase is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Tue Nov 11, 2025 07:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 4.9%\nPrevious: 4.8%\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nThe Unemployment Rate is the broadest indicator of Britain\u2019s labor market. The figure is highlighted by the broad media, beyond the financial sector, giving the publication a more significant impact despite its late publication. It is released around six weeks after the month ends. While the Bank of England is tasked with maintaining price stability, there is a substantial inverse correlation between unemployment and inflation. A higher than expected figure tends to be GBP-bearish.\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

Its highest valuation of the day so far was US$$106,491, while its lowest was US$102,061.\nBitcoin price performance, November 10, 2025.\nChart via TradingView\nAfter a weekend that saw Bitcoin briefly dip below US$100,000 and retest a US$99k support zone, the market staged a modest rebound on Monday (November 10) with BTC trading around the mid-$100k range, signaling short-term resilience after October\u2019s steep correction.\nAt the same time, demand through spot Bitcoin ETFs has been uneven. The week into Friday saw multi-day outflows and a recent climb in redemptions that reversing a brief stretch of inflows. Those ETF redemptions act mechanically to create sell pressure at the margin and were a key amplifier of October\u2019s deleveraging.\nMeanwhile, macro conditions continues to matter. The US government shutdown has delayed key economic data, including the jobs report, though independent estimates peg the monthly unemployment rate at around 4.4 percent. With limited official data and a still-tight labor market, traders remain focused on how these factors could influence liquidity and interest rates.\nAdding to the week\u2019s early developments, market commentator Axel Adler Jr. took note President Trump's announcement on Truth Social of a US$2,000 direct-payment program for most Americans, funded by tariff revenues and estimated to cost between US$300 billion and US$500 billion.\nAdler suggested that if some recipients channel these funds into crypto, retail demand for Bitcoin could strengthen, echoing the buying patterns seen during prior stimulus rounds and potentially positioning retail investors as the next catalyst for Bitcoin\u2019s recovery.\nEther (ETH) was priced at US$3,592.47, a 4.1 percent increase in 24 hours. Its highest valuation of the day was US$3,647.92, while its lowest was US$3,441.75.\nAltcoin price update\n- Solana (SOL) was priced at US$166.61, up by 5.3 percent over the last 24 hours. Its highest valuation of the day was US$169.36, while its lowest was US$159.11.\n- XRP was trading for US$2.49, up by 11.3 percent over the last 24 hours. Its highest valuation of the day was US$2.56, while its lowest was US$2.27.\nToday's crypto news to know\nCrypto funds face US$1.3 billion in weekly outflows\nDigital asset funds logged another week of heavy redemptions, with over US$1.3 billion flowing out of crypto investment products.\nThe decline marks the second straight week of billion-dollar losses as investors remain cautious after a record 40-day US government shutdown and the absence of key economic data.\nBitcoin products led the retreat with US$932 million in outflows, followed by Ethereum\u2019s US$438 million, signaling widespread risk-off sentiment.

This marked its highest level since late 2021. However, this multi-year peak was short-lived.\nThe latest figures indicate that TVL has since fallen to around $136.26 billion in November, erasing more than $36 billion in value.\nMajor DeFi protocols endured significant losses over the past month. Aave, Lido, EigenLayer, and Ethena reported TVL declines ranging from 8% to 40%, highlighting the sector\u2019s widespread slowdown.\nOne of the key drivers behind this dip is Ethereum\u2019s price correction. Following October's market crash, ETH has continued to face challenges, with the price dropping close to $3,000 in early November.\nNevertheless, the weakness runs deeper. The ETH-denominated TVL has been steadily declining since April. This occurred even as ETH prices were climbing. This divergence suggested that ETH\u2019s rally was driven by sources other than DeFi growth.\nNotably, two major factors drove ETH demand: digital asset treasury funds (DATs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In 2025, major institutional players increased their exposure to ETH, while ETFs recorded strong inflows.\nYet, this accumulation has also slowed. According to figures from the Strategic ETH Reserve, combined DAT and ETF holdings have fallen from 12.95 million ETH in October to 12.75 million ETH in November.\nFurthermore, BeInCrypto reported last week that, after six consecutive days of outflows, ETH ETFs saw $12.1 million in inflows on November 6. Nonetheless, this trend reversed the following day. SoSoValue data highlighted $46.6 million in outflows on November 7.\nWeakening demand across both retail and institutional fronts could likely leave Ethereum vulnerable to further downside pressure. Despite this, recent macroeconomic catalysts have led to a modest recovery for ETH. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,609, representing a 6.6% increase over the past day.\nAnalyst Ted Pillows has pointed to $3,700 as a key level for Ethereum.\n\"ETH is approaching a key resistance level now. If Ethereum closes a daily candle above the $3,700 level, it could rally towards the $4,000 level,\" Pillows posted.\nThe analyst noted that if Ethereum fails to break above this level, it could retrace toward the $3,400 support area.\nRead original story Over $36 Billion in DeFi Value Wiped Out \u2014 What Does It Mean for Ethereum? by Kamina Bashir at beincrypto.com"

The report highlights significant financial and operational metrics, reflecting the company's performance and strategic direction in the volatile cryptocurrency market.\nFinancial Highlights\n- Net Investment Loss: $(251) thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to the Sponsor Fee and lack of investment income.\n- Net Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss): $187,870 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2025, driven by an increase in the fair value of ether.\n- Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations: $187,619 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2025, mainly due to the appreciation in the price of ether.\n- Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations: $99,567 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to a net decrease of $(69,387) thousand for the period from July 22, 2024, to September 30, 2024, due to fluctuations in ether prices.\n- Principal Market NAV Per-Share: $29.82 as of September 30, 2025, reflecting a 24.46% increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nBusiness Highlights\n- Trust Overview: The Bitwise Ethereum ETF is a Delaware statutory trust that commenced operations on July 22, 2024. It issues common shares representing units of undivided beneficial ownership, listed on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol 'ETHW'. The Trust's objective is to provide exposure to the value of ether, less operational expenses.\n- Investment Objective: The Trust aims to reflect the actual ether market value, using the CME CF Ether \u2013 Dollar Reference Rate \u2013 New York Variant (ETHUSD_NY) to establish its net asset value (NAV).\n- Sponsor Fee: The Trust pays a unitary Sponsor Fee of 0.20% per annum of its ether holdings. Initially, the Sponsor waived this fee on the first $500 million of assets through January 22, 2025. Post-waiver, the fee accrues at 0.20% annually.\n- Net Realized and Unrealized Gains: For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Trust experienced a net realized and unrealized gain on ether investments, primarily due to an increase in ether's fair value.\n- Ether Holdings: As of September 30, 2025, the Trust held 120,095.5620 ether, with a market value of approximately $499.79 million, based on the principal market price from Crypto.com.\n- Market Performance: The Trust's shares traded at an average premium of 0.003% from July 23, 2024, to September 30, 2025, with the highest premium at 1.87% and the highest discount at 1.91%.\n- Liquidity and Capital Resources: The Trust does not hold cash except for creation and redemption of shares or to pay expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. It relies on ether sales to cover any non-assumed expenses.\n- Operational Risks: The Trust's assets are concentrated in ether, exposing it to price volatility risks. Factors such as global ether supply and demand, market conditions, and trading activity on crypto exchanges can impact the Trust's value.\n- Future Outlook: The Trust does not anticipate significant changes in liquidity needs despite potential market volatility. It remains focused on maintaining its operational strategy and managing risks associated with ether price fluctuations.\nSEC Filing: Bitwise Ethereum ETF [ ETHW ] - 10-Q - Nov. 10, 2025"

Industry watchers say this could be one of the best crypto investments to buy now before the next bull run fully ignites. Are they right?\nEthereum continues to strengthen its bullish case as ETF inflows and Layer-2 expansion drive new liquidity into the ecosystem. Analysts on X are calling this the \"quiet before the parabolic storm,\" with many highlighting ETH's historical trend of doubling its market value in the months following Bitcoin's surge.\nThe Ethereum price prediction model by Glassnode shows strong buying support at $3,400 and a potential breakout zone at $4,200, a move that could trigger momentum toward $6K by year-end.\nWith crypto funds noting that Ethereum remains the core asset for institutions seeking exposure to decentralized finance, ETH is serving as the backbone of countless ERC-20 coins and upcoming upgrades designed to reduce gas fees\nIn short, Ethereum continues to attract both long-term holders and early-stage investors hunting the next crypto.\nWhile Ethereum dominates DeFi, Remittix is emerging as a new powerhouse bridging crypto with global payments. As an undervalued crypto project, it enables users to send funds directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, instantly, securely, and with minimal fees.

                "body": "Overview of Top Solana Bridges\nWhat Are Blockchain Bridges?\nBlockchain bridges address a core limitation in crypto: different blockchains cannot directly interact with one another. Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain each function as separate networks with distinct architectures and native assets. Bridges act as intermediaries that facilitate asset transfers between these otherwise incompatible systems, allowing users to move assets across chains while maintaining security and decentralization\nHow Bridges Work\nBridges use several mechanisms to transfer assets between chains. Traditional bridges employ a lock-and-mint model where tokens are locked on the source chain while wrapped versions are minted on the destination chain. To illustrate this, when you bridge ETH to Solana on a traditional bridge, that ETH would be locked on Ethereum and a corresponding amount of \u201cwETH\u201d will be minted on Solana. While this solution works, it has known security vulnerabilities, the locked ETH becomes a target for smart contract exploits. If the locked assets of these traditional bridges are drained, wETH will depeg and essentially become worthless. This scenario was seen during the Multichain exploit.\nTo counteract this vulnerability, modern native bridging solutions rely on building crosschain native token standards and employing a burn-and-mint model. LayerZero\u2019s OFT, Wormhole\u2019s NTT and Circle\u2019s CCTP are examples of this model where tokens are natively burnt on one side and minted on the other in this bridging method. This solution enables tokens to exist natively across multiple chains without wrapping, maintaining a unified supply. In this solution, there are no locked assets that attackers can exploit and drain.\nAnother popular bridging solution is intent-based bridges, which use competitive solver networks to fulfill cross-chain transfers. Instead of locking assets or requiring native token standards, users simply express their desired outcome (an \"intent\") \u2014 for example, \"I want SOL on Solana.\" Professional market makers called solvers compete to fulfill this request by providing tokens on the destination chain immediately, then claiming the user's source tokens afterward.\nThis approach eliminates the need for wrapped tokens entirely and often provides faster execution (1-5 minutes) with better pricing due to solver competition. Examples include Mayan Finance and deBridge's DLN (deBridge Liquidity Network). The key advantage is flexibility \u2014 intent-based bridges can work with any token without requiring special standards or creating wrapped versions.\nWhat Makes a Bridge Trustworthy?\nSeveral factors determine a bridge's reliability and security:\n-\nDecentralization of validators/custodians: More independent validators means no single point of failure.\n-\nTotal value locked (TVL): The amount of assets secured by the bridge demonstrates user confidence and raises the stakes for maintaining security.\n-\nSecurity audits: Professional third-party reviews of the bridge's code, although not fool-proof lends better credibility.\n-\nTrack record: A longer time in operation (ideally 1+ years) without major hacks or exploits is preferred.\n-\nInsurance or security funds: Protocols that maintain reserves to compensate users in case of exploits.\n-\nFinancial backing: Bridges built or backed by reputable financial institutions or large VC funding suggests greater resources for security audits, bug bounties, and rapid incident response.\nNow let's examine the top five bridges serving the Solana ecosystem.\n1. Wormhole\nType of bridge: Lock-and-mint with a decentralized validator network (Guardian network)\nWormhole stands as the most established and widely-used bridge connecting Solana to other blockchains. Launched in October 2021, Wormhole has evolved into a comprehensive cross-chain messaging protocol that supports not just asset transfers but also cross-chain data and application communication across more than 30 blockchain networks.

                "body": "By the end of 2025,\nSolana\n(SOL) has established itself as a standout story in the cryptocurrency sector, fueled by a mix of infrastructure enhancements, growing institutional interest, and robust on-chain indicators. As the digital asset ecosystem evolves, Solana\u2019s targeted approach to scalability and practical use cases has made it a vital link between decentralized finance (DeFi) and conventional financial systems. This review explores the main factors behind Solana\u2019s price rally and explains why it continues to be a top choice for growth-focused investors.\nInfrastructure Upgrades: Surpassing 1 Million TPS\nSolana\u2019s upgrades in Q3 2025, especially the Firedancer validator client, mark a significant advancement in blockchain capabilities. Created by Jump Crypto, Firedancer is a C++ client that aims to boost transaction throughput to over 1 million transactions per second (TPS)\u2014a 15-fold increase from Solana\u2019s previous 65,000 TPS, as reported by a\nBitget report\n. By cutting validator hardware expenses by 50\u201380% and reducing reliance on a single client, Firedancer strengthens the network\u2019s stability and lowers systemic risk, according to a\nAntier Solutions guide\n.\nThe combined deployment of Firedancer with Solana\u2019s existing Agave client (Frankendancer) has already shown measurable improvements. For example, ZK Compression v2, launched in Q3 2025, uses zero-knowledge proofs to slash transaction fees by 5,200 times, making large-scale airdrops and NFT launches feasible without sacrificing performance, as highlighted in a\nBitget report\n. These advancements\nnot\nonly enhance the user experience but also draw in developers and businesses looking for a high-speed blockchain.\nLooking forward, the Alpenglow upgrade (planned for Q1 2026) is set to further transform Solana\u2019s consensus mechanism. By adding the Votor and Rotor subsystems, Alpenglow targets finality times under a second (100\u2013150 milliseconds), making Solana suitable for real-time applications such as high-frequency trading and gaming, as detailed in a\nBitget report\n. These innovations reinforce Solana\u2019s ambition to serve as a robust infrastructure for the global financial system.\nInstitutional Adoption: Bridging Web3 and Traditional Finance\nInstitutional involvement with Solana in late 2025 has been game-changing. By Q3 2025, institutional ownership of\nSOL\ntokens soared by\n841%, reaching 16 million tokens, and ETF inflows topped $111 million in just three days, according to a\nCoinotag report\n. This uptick signals increasing trust in Solana as a treasury asset, especially among publicly traded firms. As of Q3 2025, 19 public companies collectively held 15.4 million SOL\u2014worth about $3 billion\u2014demonstrating its value as a strategic reserve, as mentioned in a\nScalingX article\n.\nMajor partnerships with established financial institutions have further validated Solana\u2019s standing. In 2025, Visa added Solana to its stablecoin settlement platform, enabling instant settlements for\nUSDC\nand EURC, as referenced in a\nScalingX article\n. At the same time,\nR3 Labs introduced an interoperability solution that transferred $17 billion in real-world assets (RWA) from the Corda network to Solana, allowing round-the-clock trading of bonds and funds without custodians, as noted in a\nScalingX article\n. These milestones establish Solana as a foundational layer for cross-chain and international financial operations.\nValidator performance also highlights the network\u2019s institutional-grade dependability. Leading operators such as Luganodes and Figment have delivered impressive results. Luganodes achieved a 6.9% delegator APY with 99.92% uptime, while Figment utilized MEV infrastructure to secure 7% of all staking rewards in Q3 2025, according to a\nLuganodes report\n. This level of efficiency appeals to institutional stakers seeking reliable returns in a low-inflation environment.\nOn-Chain Metrics: A Rapidly Evolving Network\nSolana\u2019s on-chain statistics for Q3 2025 reveal a network operating at full thrott"

Over the past two years, tradfi has come in and taken over via stablecoins, acting as institutional buyers of majors. As a result, privacy as a tenet of crypto has been sacrificed.\"\n\"Zenrock brought ZEC over to Solana via zenZEC to combine Solana's speed and access with zCash's privacy,\" he told CoinDesk.\nzenZEC, backed 1:1 by native ZEC, is Zcash wrapped via Zenrock\u2019s decentralized multi-party computation (MPC) network. This network generates multiple independent secret shares from the private key, which are then distributed across a network of nodes mostly operated by independent third parties.\nIn other words, the private key never exists in full anywhere; instead, it is mathematically split, and these distributed nodes collectively sign transactions or generate public keys without exposing the complete key to any single party.\nThis eliminates single points of failure and significantly enhances overall security. Because it operates off-chain and independently of any specific blockchain, Zenrock\u2019s MPC network is highly compatible with cross-chain (omnichain) applications.\nzenZEC is therefore built to integrate seamlessly with Solana\u2019s decentralized exchanges and yield protocols, providing Zcash holders with real on-chain DeFi exposure for the first time in over seven years.\nOn-chain incentives are already at work on Orca, one of Solana\u2019s leading decentralized exchanges, driving liquidity and adoption. Dave has stated that zenZEC users will soon be able to deploy the token as collateral across decentralized finance protocols on Solana.\nZEC has been on a tear since September, notching a 16-fold rally to $659, according to data source CoinDesk.\nMore For You\nInside Zcash: Encrypted Money at Planetary Scale\nA deep dive into Zcash's zero-knowledge architecture, shielded transaction growth, and its path to becoming encrypted Bitcoin at scale.\nWhat to know:\nIn 2025, Zcash evolved from niche privacy tech into a functioning encrypted-money network:\n- Shielded adoption surged, with 20\u201325% of circulating ZEC now held in encrypted addresses and 30% of transactions involving the shielded pool.\n- The Zashi wallet made shielded transfers the default, pushing privacy from optional to standard practice.\n- Project Tachyon, led by Sean Bowe, aims to boost throughput to thousands of private transactions per second.\n- Zcash surpassed Monero in market share, becoming the largest privacy-focused cryptocurrency by capitalization.\nMore For You\nDOGE Tests $0.18 Floor After Intraday Breakout Sparks Profit-Taking\nThe move created a lower high formation that signals a potential short-term shift in momentum.\nWhat to know:\n- Dogecoin surged above key resistance levels before a late-session reversal erased most gains.\n- Trad"

                "body": "The FTSE 100, the UK's benchmark stock index, achieved a new record high on Monday, November 10, 2025, driven by a powerful global stock surge and burgeoning optimism surrounding a potential resolution to the protracted US government shutdown. This significant milestone reflects a renewed wave of investor confidence, buoyed by both an improving global economic outlook and the anticipated return to stability in US political processes. For 40 days, the prolonged US government shutdown had cast a long shadow over international markets, creating widespread uncertainty and disrupting the flow of crucial economic data, thus hindering informed decision-making by investors and central banks alike.\nThe breakthrough in the US Senate, which saw the advancement of a bipartisan bill aimed at reopening the federal government, acted as the primary catalyst for this widespread market rally. Investors, visibly relieved by the prospect of an imminent end to the fiscal impasse, swiftly re-entered the market, pushing indices worldwide to unprecedented levels. This synchronized global movement unequivocally underscores the intricate interconnectedness of financial markets and the profound, far-reaching impact of US political developments on international investor sentiment and economic stability.\nDetailed Coverage of a Global Rally\nOn Monday, November 10, 2025, the UK's benchmark FTSE 100 index soared to an intraday peak of 9,800.35 points, ultimately closing at a new record high of 9,787.15 points. This remarkable ascent represented an approximate 1.08% gain for the day, decisively surpassing previous records set in late October. The index is firmly on track for an impressive 20% gain for the year 2025, demonstrating robust and sustained performance over the past twelve months.\nThis surge in London was far from an isolated event; it was a pivotal component of a larger, sweeping global rally. Markets across Asia, Europe, and the United States displayed significant upward momentum. US futures, including the Nasdaq and S&P 500, showed strong gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed. European indices, such as the pan-European Stoxx 600, mirrored London's performance, with key markets in Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid, and Milan all registering notable increases. Asian markets, including Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng, also responded positively to the news of a potential US political resolution.\nThe immediate trigger for this widespread market exuberance was the hopeful development in the US Senate on Sunday, November 9, 2025. A bipartisan bill was advanced, signaling a potential end to the 40-day US government shutdown\u2014the longest in American history. This protracted shutdown had created substantial economic and market anxieties, severely disrupting the US economy, freezing government data, and eroding consumer confidence. Economists had warned that a continued impasse could push the fourth-quarter GDP into negative territory, while the absence of crucial inflation and labor market data left the Federal Reserve and investors \"flying blind\" regarding monetary policy decisions.\nThe Senate's move provided a much-anticipated \"relief rally,\" promising the resumption of federal services and employee pay, thereby injecting much-needed clarity into the economic outlook. The rally was broad-based, with technology and cyclical sectors leading gains. In the UK, specific companies like the precious metals miner Fresnillo (LSE: FRES) jumped significantly, and luxury goods firm Burberry (LSE: BRBY) also saw a boost. Drinks giant Diageo (LSE: DGE) also surged following the announcement of a new CEO, further contributing to the positive market sentiment.\nCompanies Poised to Win or Face Stability\nThe FTSE 100's diverse composition, with over four-fifths of its companies' sales originating outside the UK, makes it particularly sensitive to global economic trends and international political stability. The current confluence of a global stock surge"

Germany\u2019s blue\u2011chip DAX rallied at the start of the week as global risk appetite improved on signs the historic U.S. government shutdown could soon end. Shortly after the Xetra open, the DAX added about 1.4% to 23,907, with gains later stretching to ~23,990 (+1.8%) as buyers broadened out across financials, industrials and energy tech. The MDAX and Euro Stoxx 50 also traded firmly higher. [1]\nWhy the DAX is higher today\nRelief across global markets followed U.S. Senate progress on a stopgap funding bill to reopen the federal government after a 40\u2011day shutdown, easing a key macro overhang for investors and reviving hopes for a \u201cyear\u2011end rally.\u201d European indices tracked the upswing, with tech and cyclical shares out front. [2]\nMarket snapshot \u2014 Germany and Europe (mid\u2011session)\n- DAX: ~23,990 (+1.8%) by late morning; earlier +1.4% at 23,907 just after the Xetra open. [3]\n- MDAX: +1.6% around 29,255. [4]\n- Euro Stoxx 50: +1.3\u20131.6% midday. [5]\nNote: Index levels are intraday and subject to change.\nBiggest movers on the DAX\n- Siemens Energy \u2014 +~5% after Jefferies upgraded the stock to Buy and lifted the price target to \u20ac134, citing sustained demand for grid and power solutions tied to data\u2011center load growth. [6]\n- Commerzbank \u2014 +~5\u20136%, buoyed by fresh buy recommendations that helped push the lender to the top of the index. [7]\n- Hannover Re \u2014 +~3\u20134% after the reinsurer raised 2025 net income guidance to ~\u20ac2.6bn on strong nine\u2011month results and a tighter combined ratio. [8]\n- Daimler Truck and Heidelberg Materials \u2014 +3\u20134%, adding cyclical breadth to the rally. [9]\n- Laggards: E.ON and Deutsche Telekom edged lower, leaving utilities and telecoms among the few red spots. [10]\nBeyond the megacaps, Northern Data surged after Rumble agreed to acquire the German AI\u2011cloud company in an all\u2011stock deal valued at roughly $767 million; the stock spiked on the headline and supportive terms disclosed. [11]\nMacro picture: sentiment data mixed, chemicals under pressure\nFresh surveys paint a nuanced backdrop:\n- Eurozone Sentix investor morale fell to \u22127.4 in November (from \u22125.4), below expectations, underscoring a sluggish growth pulse despite today\u2019s risk\u2011on tone. Germany\u2019s sub\u2011index weakened as forward expectations slipped back below zero. [12]\n- Germany\u2019s chemical industry sentiment plunged in October, per ifo, with the order\u2011backlog index dropping to a 30\u2011year low (\u221268.9) and capacity utilisation down to 71%\u2014far below the 85% level analysts view as margin\u2011normalising. Sector bellwethers have trimmed guidance amid cost and competitiveness headwinds. [13]\nThe market rally suggests investors are presently prioritising the policy overhang in Washington and positioning for year\u2011end flows over soft spot indicators in Europe.\nRates & FX: Bund yields tick up, euro steadies\nBenchmark 10\u2011year Bund yields nudged up toward a one\u2011month high near ~2.70%, mirroring moves in U.S. Treasuries as shutdown relief cooled safe\u2011haven demand. The euro hovered just under $1.16 against the dollar. [14]\nEarnings & news driving single stocks\n- Hannover Re (HNR1): lifted FY2025 net\u2011income target to ~\u20ac2.6bn (from \u20ac2.4bn), citing robust nine\u2011month profit growth and improved underwriting. The company also flagged a combined ratio below 87%. Shares gained on the outlook upgrade. [15]\n- Siemens Energy (ENR): broker upgrade to Buy with a sharp PT hike to \u20ac134 added momentum to a stock already benefiting from grid\u2011investment tailwinds tied to AI\u2011driven power demand. [16]\n- Northern Data (NB2): Rumble to acquire the Frankfurt\u2011listed AI cloud group in an all\u2011stock transaction; Northern Data holders to receive 2.0281 Rumble Class A shares per share, with completion eyed for Q2 2026.

Utilities up 13.4%, driven mainly by the power needs by AI,\u201d he said.\nBut while earnings have been impressive, stock performance has not, said Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair Equity Research.\n\u201cThe market\u2019s reaction since the end of October has been a little bit circumspect. So the S&P 500 up until Friday was down about 2.4%,\u201d he said.\nNow, heading into earnings season, stock prices were already pretty high, said Stovall at CFRA.\n\u201cThe real problem I think is valuations, price-to-earnings ratios. Recently the S&P 500 was trading at a more than 40% premium to its average 20-year P/E,\u201d he said.\nKeep in mind, the market kept hitting record highs through the summer and early fall, said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had \u2014 call it a 40% rally since the April lows. Coming into Q3 reporting, the market \u2014 very overbought, pretty high expectations \u2014 maybe we\u2019ll call it \u2018priced for perfection,\u2019\u201d he said.\nAnd \u201cperfection\u201d is hard to beat.\nStill, Turnquist said, company\u2019s forecasts in their earnings calls have been upbeat.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a lot of downside, negative commentary from corporate America. They\u2019re talking about this resilient consumer, more and more spending on AI,\u201d he said.\nSo it looks like America\u2019s biggest companies will have more good news early next year."

For the denominator, we average the growth rates for the past five years along with two years of forward estimates, this in order to achieve a less-volatile earnings-growth rate trend. We then add the current yield to approximate total return. As an example, the current S&P 500 P/E ratio is 21, the current yield is 1.1%, and the historical growth rate is 9%. The formula is 21/(1.2+9.0) = 2.1. Sectors with favorable growth and valuation characteristics, in addition to the three listed above, also include Energy and Materials. Premium-valued sectors with low growth rates include the Consumer groups. Based on our analysis of growth rates and valuations, along with other factors, we have established our over-weight sectors as Information Technology, Financial, Utilities, and Communication Services. Our under-weight sector is Consumer Discretionary. Our Market-Weight sectors include Energy, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Materials, Real Estate, and Industrial.\nTechnical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term\nIs the stock market glass half full or half empty? That depends on what one is looking at to make such a call. For the year, the mega-cap indices have been leading the horse race, especially coming out of the April bottom. The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has popped 20%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 (XLG) is up 18%, the S&P 100 (OEX) is up 17%, and the S&P 500 (SPX) is up 15.5%. Sneaking into the next position is the Russell Micro Cap (IWC +15%), the Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight (QQEW +13%), and the Russell 2000 (IWM +10%). Even the S&P 500 Equal Weight (SPXEW) is up 7%. We are surprised that the majority of index returns are not only somewhat close but also that most have provided good returns so far in 2025. If you dig into SPX sector selections, eight of the 11 have provided year-to-date returns of between 7% and 24.5%. Information Technology leads, followed by Utilities, Industrials, Communication Services, Financial, Healthcare, and Energy. Only Consumer Staples is down, but by a mere 0.6%. The massive dispersion has been in individual stock returns, with a whopping 39 SPX stocks up at least 50% -- and that list runs as high as a 263% gain. On the other end, there are 56 stocks in the index down at lea"

                "body": "Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger has already made history in the Commonwealth, without even taking office, and in a one-on-one interview with WTOP\u2019s Nick Iannelli, she\u2019s laying out what she plans to accomplish during her first days in the governor\u2019s mansion.\nIn defeating Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, Spanberger became the first woman in the state to be elected governor.\nHer victory led a blue wave in Virginia, in which Democrats won in races for lieutenant governor and attorney general, and flipped 13 seats in the House of Delegates, giving them a super majority.\nThat should make it much easier for Spanberger to implement her policies, and WTOP is learning more about what\u2019s at the top of her list.\nThe audio below has been edited for broadcast on WTOP.\nRead the full interview below.\nThe transcript below has been lightly edited for clarity.\n- Nick Iannelli:\nSo let\u2019s talk about day one priorities. When it was day one for Gov. Youngkin, he had a stack of executive orders to fast track his priorities and to reverse some of his predecessor\u2019s policies.\nSo on day one, is your day one going to look like that? Do you have a stack of executive orders and do you plan to do away with any of Youngkin\u2019s policies?\n- Abigail Spanberger:\nWell, I am building out my day one stack. So, at this point in time, I am working on building out the day one priorities that I\u2019ll be pursuing, certainly in concert with the General Assembly. I\u2019ll need my partners in the legislative branch to be pursuing the legislation that I want to sign into law next year.\nAnd then I am also working on developing the executive orders that I will push out. What I can tell you is, I am working on building out a plan to best use the executive authority to ensure that we are delivering results for Virginia families, as it relates to contending with high costs and overall issues of affordability, particularly in housing and health care and in energy.\nThere are some real unique challenges that so many Virginians are facing, certainly at this moment, because of the ongoing impacts of policies out of Washington, but also, of course, because of this ongoing shutdown. So we\u2019re working on building out those executive orders that I will sign on the first day, but they will all be focused on issues of affordability.\n- Nick Iannelli:\nDo you plan on doing away with any of Youngkin\u2019s policies, though? For example, Youngkin has been big on Virginia cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Do you plan on doing away with that, scrapping those priorities?\n- Abigail Spanberger:\nI have been clear on the fact that the executive order, I believe it\u2019s 47, that he put out, mandating cooperation on immigration administrative action is something that I would change, and so that is something that I\u2019ve been very clear on.\nThough, notably as a former law enforcement officer, cooperation between local, state and federal agencies is important when there is a warrant, and certainly when there is any sort of criminal offense. As a former law enforcement officer, I worked on many of those types of joint cases.\nSo ultimately, that executive order that he put out is something that I\u2019ve been quite clear that I would change.\n- Nick Iannelli:\nHow about when it comes to Virginia\u2019s relationship with the Trump administration? That is obviously going to change as Virginia is going to be completely controlled by Democrats now.\nDo you have any ideas in terms of taking legal action against the Trump administration? There was speculation that Virginia might do that if you won.\n- Abigail Spanberger:\nWell, I think certainly, as we have seen attacks on our federal employees, as we have seen the DOGE efforts come through, time and time and time again right now, with the efforts to take SNAP dollars away that were previously funded dollars allocated and legally should be distributed \u2014 the Trump administration\u2019s choice to hold those dollars, that is something that\u2019s been continually met with legal chall"

In brief:\n- JPMorgan Chase cut its year-end forecast for the yen to 156 per dollar from 142, and now sees 152 by March 2026 instead of 139.\n- MUFG Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. made similar downward revisions, signalling broad skepticism that the BOJ will tighten policy anytime soon.\nAt its most recent meeting, the BOJ left interest rates unchanged\n- Governor Kazuo Ueda said the bank needed more time and data before deciding on rate hikes, prompting traders to interpret his stance as cautious.\n- \u201cIt\u2019s not a stage to proactively buy yen,\u201d said Hirofumi Suzuki, chief FX strategist at SMBC, adding that there was \u201cno groundwork\u201d for an early move.\n- Market pricing implies only a 57% chance of a rate hike in December.\n- Analysts note that monetary policy expectations have become less influential than politics and fiscal signals.\nConcerns are growing over Takaichi\u2019s plans for \u201cresponsible and proactive\u201d fiscal spending, with investors wary that a large supplementary budget could further weaken the yen.\nMUFG\u2019s Teppei Ino said the market will likely remain under selling pressure until the scale of the new stimulus is revealed. The government is expected to finalise its extra budget later this month.\nAdding to the uncertainty, new members appointed to the Economic and Fiscal Policy Council come from Japan\u2019s reflationist camp, reinforcing the view that Tokyo may tolerate a weaker currency.\nJPMorgan\u2019s Junya Tanase noted that \u201cthe selling reaction to Takaichi\u2019s policies has been stronger than expected.\u201d\nWhile some strategists, including Citigroup\u2019s Osamu Takashima, expect eventual yen buying as part of profit-taking in Japanese equities, most see limited support in the near term.\nMarkets are now watching an upcoming speech by BOJ policy board member Junko Nakagawa on November 10 for fresh clues on the central bank\u2019s policy path."

Shanghai\u2019s rubber contracts also inched up, mirroring this upward trend. The yen\u2019s softness \u2013 hitting its lowest point against the US dollar since February \u2013 also helped push the Nikkei 0.7% higher, benefiting major Japanese exporters. But rubber prices don\u2019t move in a vacuum: synthetic rubber, made from oil, directly competes with natural rubber, so shifts in crude prices are key. Lately, oil dipped on oversupply concerns, causing traders to closely watch developments in Washington about a potential US government shutdown. Meanwhile, China\u2019s car sales softened in October after an eight-month run, as tax breaks faded and sentiment waned, but exports of Chinese-made cars leapt nearly 28% \u2013 a sign that global demand is playing a bigger role.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency swings put rubber in the spotlight.\nThe yen\u2019s weakness is making Japanese rubber a hot ticket for international buyers, boosting prices and giving the Nikkei a lift alongside other export-heavy sectors. If these currency trends and oil market moves persist, they could shake up commodity prices and ripple across broader markets \u2013 especially those tied closely to raw goods.\nThe bigger picture: Export trends help balance auto slowdowns.\nRubber demand doesn\u2019t just come from local drivers \u2013 big swings in China\u2019s car exports show that global appetite plays a real part. So, even as domestic sales cool off, rising exports could keep the pressure up on rubber suppliers around the world, reshaping the long-term direction for both the commodity and the industries that rely on it.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nQuick Take\nAberdeen Group x Finimize \u2022 about 14 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
