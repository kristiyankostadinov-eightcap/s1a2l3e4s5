                "body": "Gold prices rose to a new record high this week, topping $4,300. Here's why.\nAs economic uncertainty deepens the rush for gold continues, with the price of the precious metal this week topping $4,300 for the first time.\nThe going price for New York spot closed at a record $4,326 per troy ounce on Thursday. Futures also traded as high at more than $4,344 per troy ounce Thursday, before falling below the $4,300 mark Friday morning. Still, gold is up 6.7% over the last week, marking one of its best weeks to date.\nGold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek a \"safe haven\" for their money. For the U.S., the latest gains arrive amid the now weekslong government shutdown and ongoing trade wars abroad \u2014 with President Trump most recently threatening to place much higher tariffs on China, before appearing to walk back those potential new levies as unsustainable.\nStill, his barrage of other import taxes has already strained economies worldwide. Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates is also making gold a more attractive investment.\nGold futures are up nearly 60% since the start of 2025 \u2014 trading at about $4,268 per troy ounce, the standard for measuring precious metals, as of around 11:45 a.m. Friday. That's up from around $2,670 at the beginning of January.\nSilver has seen an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up about 70%, trading at over $50 per troy ounce Friday morning.\nA lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.\nMuch of this year's economic turmoil has spanned from Trump's trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and helping to weaken the job market.\nAs a result, hiring has plunged while inflation has inched back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.\nThe U.S. government shutdown adds to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed \u2014 and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. The Trump administration also moved to use the shutdown to conduct mass firings, although a judge temporarily blocked such action.\nSeparately, analysts have pointed to continued weakness of the U.S. dollar and renewed rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Last month, the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point \u2014 and projected it would do so twice more this year.\nInvestments in gold have also been driven by other factors over time. Over recent years, there's been strong gold demand from central banks around the world \u2014 particularly amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\nAnd on Wall Street this week, several regional banks saw sharp losses amid scrunity over quality of loans, although recovery seemed to be steadying the market on Friday. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be distancing themselves from riskier assets like cryptocurrency \u2014 with bitcoin, for example, down 2.67%.\nGold jewelry sticker shock\nMany jewelry merchants and dealers have increasingly reported surges in customers looking to check the value of gold they own \u2014 sometimes opting to melt or sell family heirlooms to cash in on the precious metal's rising price.\nAt the same time, those in the market for gold jewelry may be feeling \"sticker shock\" if they can't afford certain products anymore \u2014 particularly if it's something impacted by both rising material costs and tariffs.\nLarger retailers like Pandora and Signet have acknowledged these headwinds in recent earnings calls.\nAdvocates of investing in gold call it a safe haven \u2014 arguing that the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road as a hedge against rising inflation."

                "body": "Gold prices dropped by 2% after reaching a record high of $4,379. This decline followed US President Donald Trump\u2019s comments on the unsustainability of high tariffs on China, which improved risk appetite and increased US Treasury yields.\nThe US 10-year Treasury yield climbed nearly three basis points, putting pressure on non-yielding assets like gold. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve remains committed to a 2% inflation target, and market participants await the Consumer Price Index release next week.\nUs Dollar And Gold Prices\nThe US Dollar strengthened slightly, further dragging down gold prices. Despite this, gold has seen immense gains throughout the year, driven by geopolitical tensions and increased buying from central banks. Standard Chartered Bank forecasts gold to average $4,488 in 2026.\nTechnical outlook indicates a bullish trend for gold despite its recent dip. Resistance levels are at $4,300, $4,350, and $4,389, with support at $4,200. Central banks are key buyers of gold, adding substantial reserves to strengthen their currencies. Gold\u2019s price is influenced by geopolitical instability, interest rates, and the US Dollar\u2019s performance.\nYesterday\u2019s 2% drop from a record high is a direct result of easing US-China tensions and rising Treasury yields. This has created a short-term headwind, pushing gold down from its peak near $4,380. For now, the path of least resistance appears to be lower as the US dollar finds some strength.\nGiven the uncertainty ahead of next week\u2019s inflation data, we should consider buying put options to hedge our long-term holdings. A break below the $4,200 support level could trigger a faster move down toward the October 17th low of $4,185. This strategy protects us from a potential spike in yields if the inflation number comes in hotter than expected.\nPrice Stability And Market Trends\nRecent data shows why the market is so focused on this upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The September CPI report, released earlier this month, showed core inflation holding firm at 3.1% year-over-year, well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. This stickiness in prices complicates the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates as aggressively as the market expects.\nDespite this pullback, the fundamental reasons for gold\u2019s 62% surge in 2025 remain firmly in place. The trend of de-dollarization continues, with recent reports showing central banks, led by the People\u2019s Bank of China, added another 250 tonnes to their reserves in the third quarter of 2025. This structural buying provides a strong floor for any significant price declines.\nThis dip should therefore be viewed as a potential buying opportunity for longer-dated call options. We can use the weakness to enter bullish positions at a better price, targeting strikes above $4,300. The underlying geopolitical risks and central bank demand have not disappeared overnight.\nLooking back, we saw a similar pattern in 2023 when gold consolidated for months before breaking out. Even as the Federal Reserve held rates high during that period, persistent underlying demand eventually pushed prices to new records. This historical precedent suggests that patience will likely be rewarded once this current pullback stabilizes."

                "body": "Key Takeaways\n- Gold prices have surged to new all-time highs in 2025.\n- The current gold surge is fueled by inflation, economic risks, and the threat to the Federal Reserve's independence.\n- Buffett calls gold an \"unproductive\u201d asset that doesn\u2019t generate income.\n- Berkshire\u2019s 2020 gold mining stake was tactical, not philosophical.\nGold prices have surged to new all-time highs in 2025, as both investors and central banks increase their holdings in the yellow metal to hedge against inflation, economic risks, and the threat to the Federal Reserve's independence.12 However, legendary investor Warren Buffett has long voiced skepticism about gold as a long-term investment.\nIn this article, we revisit Buffett\u2019s stance, examine his brief pivot into gold mining during the COVID era, and explore when gold might make sense in a long-term portfolio.\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Longstanding Skepticism Toward Gold\nBuffett has consistently criticized gold as an investment. In his 2011 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, he described gold as \u201dneither of much use nor procreative,\u201d emphasizing that it does not produce cash flow or create value over time3\nSimilarly, Buffett remarked in a 2011 interview with CNBC that \u201cgold is a way of going along on fear.\u201d4 What he meant was that the price of gold relies on market sentiment and demand. When people grow more fearful of the economy, demand for gold rises and its price increases. But if people become less fearful, demand falls, and its price decreases. Ultimately, Buffett\u2019s preference is for assets that generate cash flow and compound over time.\nThe 2020 Surprise: Berkshire\u2019s Brief Bet on Gold Mining\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it held a $565 million stake in one of the largest gold mining companies in the world, Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: B).\nThis decision may have been surprising given Buffett\u2019s point of view about gold as an investment. While it may have been the decision of one of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio managers, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, and not Buffet himself, it was still a notable and industry-altering decision at the time.5\nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s position in the gold mining company was relatively short-lived.6 The company sold off its shares of Barrick Gold by the end of Q4 2020.\nRelated Stories\nWhy Gold Is Surging Now\nIn 2025, the price of gold has risen to all-time highs as macroeconomic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and political tensions have made the metal attractive.7\nHowever, today\u2019s economic environment contrasts with the low-inflation, less volatile environment at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, right before Berkshire Hathaway invested in Barrick Gold in the second quarter of 2020. At that time, inflation was hovered around historically-low levels as the pandemic weighed on global economic activity.8 Although down from a historic high of 9% in June 2022, as of July 2025 inflation was rising, hovering at 2.7%.9 In August, it rose at a faster 2.9% annual pace.\nAs inflation remains elevated, some investors might find gold attractive as a safe haven in an increasingly uncertain economy.\nRelated Stories\nWhen Might Gold Make Sense\u2014Even for a Buffett-Inspired Investor?\nWhile Buffett largely avoids gold, some scenarios may justify a modest allocation in your portfolio. For example, investors seeking portfolio diversification, insurance against market volatility, or assets that are not correlated with equities might consider investing in gold.\n\u201cFor investors focused on growth and income, I recommend a 90-10 stocks-bonds split, with up to 2.5 percentage points of the 90% allocated to gold as a hedge against inflation,\u201d certified financial planner and chartered financial consultant Laura DiFiglio of Northwestern Mutual told Investopedia via email.\nHow to Think About Gold in a Long-Term Portfolio\nIt\u2019s crucial to weigh opportunity cost and current market volatility when considering adding gold to your portfolio.

In 2024, consumption was 3M tons, with Turkey being the largest consumer (42% share) and producer (86% share). The region is a net importer, with Turkey also the leading importer (46% share) and exporter (94% share). Crude oil dominates imports (84%), while refined oil leads exports (76%). Key growth markets include Iran and Israel.\nKey Findings\n- Market forecast to grow at 1.1% CAGR in volume and 1.9% in value through 2035\n- Turkey is the dominant consumer, producer, importer, and exporter in the region\n- Middle East is a net importer, relying heavily on crude oil imports which constitute 84% of total imports\n- Iran shows strongest import value growth at 14.2% CAGR while Israel leads in per capita consumption growth\n- Export prices declined to $1,206 per ton in 2024 while import prices rose slightly to $1,248 per ton\nMarket Forecast\nDriven by increasing demand for sunflower-seed and safflower oil in the Middle East, the market is expected to continue an upward consumption trend over the next decade. Market performance is forecast to decelerate, expanding with an anticipated CAGR of +1.1% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market volume to 3.3M tons by the end of 2035.\nIn value terms, the market is forecast to increase with an anticipated CAGR of +1.9% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market value to $3.6B (in nominal wholesale prices) by the end of 2035.\nConsumption\nMiddle East's Consumption of Sunflower-Seed And Safflower Oil\nIn 2024, the amount of sunflower-seed and safflower oil consumed in the Middle East dropped modestly to 3M tons, waning by -2.3% on the previous year. The total consumption indicated a temperate increase from 2013 to 2024: its volume increased at an average annual rate of +4.4% over the last eleven years. The trend pattern, however, indicated some noticeable fluctuations being recorded throughout the analyzed period. Based on 2024 figures, consumption decreased by -5.1% against 2022 indices. As a result, consumption attained the peak volume of 3.1M tons. From 2023 to 2024, the growth of the consumption failed to regain momentum.\nThe size of the sunflower-seed and safflower oil market in the Middle East fell to $2.9B in 2024, shrinking by -9.6% against the previous year. This figure reflects the total revenues of producers and importers (excluding logistics costs, retail marketing costs, and retailers' margins, which will be included in the final consumer price). Overall, consumption continues to indicate a abrupt downturn. Over the period under review, the market reached the peak level at $68.1B in 2019; however, from 2020 to 2024, consumption stood at a somewhat lower figure.\nConsumption By Country\nTurkey (1.2M tons) remains the largest sunflower-seed and safflower oil consuming country in the Middle East, accounting for 42% of total volume. Moreover, sunflower-seed and safflower oil consumption in Turkey exceeded the figures recorded by the second-largest consumer, Iran (580K tons), twofold. The third position in this ranking was held by Iraq (511K tons), with a 17% share.\nFrom 2013 to 2024, the average annual rate of growth in terms of volume in Turkey totaled +1.9%. In the other countries, the average annual rates were as follows: Iran (+9.1% per year) and Iraq (+8.1% per year).\nIn value terms, Tur"

US President Trump declared that China not buying American soybeans was an 'economically hostile act', with last deliveries seen in May, threatening to slap sanctions on imports of Chinese cooking oil, a business worth $1.1 billion in 2024.\nQatar Threatens a European Shutout Again. Qatar's Energy Minister Saad al-Kaabi warned that the Middle Eastern country will not be able to do LNG business with Europe if Brussels doesn't change its current EU corporate sustainability rules, currently supplying 13% of the continent's LNG needs.\nUK Slaps New Sanctions on Russia. The British government targeted Russia's two largest oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil in its latest package of sanctions, along with 44 designated shadow fleet tankers and India's majority Russian-owned Nayara refinery, however failing to elicit any market reaction.\nCitgo Endgame Is Around the Corner. As the auction for 807,000 b/d refiner Citgo Petroleum intensifies, media reports show that Elliott-backer Ambert Energy wants to cut costs and streamline operations whilst the refiner's other top bidder Gold Reserve seeks to maintain the status quo without layoffs.\nIndia Warms Up to US Propane. As Indian officials negotiate a new trade deal with the Trump administration, New Delhi pledged to source around 10% of its LPG needs from the US from 2026, up from 6% currently with the aim of curbing its long-standing dependence on the Middle East.\nIranian Tankers Emerge from the Dark. Most tankers historically used for carrying Iranian oil (111 out of 170) have turned on their transponders in recent days after years of sailing in the dark, coming only days after the UN sanctions snapback on Tehran and potentially signaling a shift in export strategies.\nCopper Is Going to Blow Up Soon. The world's largest copper miner, Chiles's state-owned Codelco, has set the 2026 premium for copper deliveries to Europe at a record high of $325 per tonne, a 40% jump from 2025, citing the impact of Congolese and Indonesian supply disruptions.\nSuriname Scraps Wealth Distribution Plans.

The International Energy Agency signaled global oil inventories are climbing as OPEC+ and American producers lift output, while consumption stays soft. Brent crude is now hovering near the $60 mark, which many investors see as a stress point for the market amid ongoing US\u2013China trade worries. Last week, US inventories surged by 3.5 million barrels\u2014well above expectations\u2014and daily production hit a record 13.64 million barrels. For now, these signals point to excess supply and global uncertainty capping any oil price recovery.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Investors keep a close eye on supply and demand swings.\nOversupply concerns and choppy demand are fueling caution among energy investors, making price swings more likely for big oil stocks.

                "body": "USD: Dollar eases on credit concerns, Fed tone and political uncertainty\nUS dollar bulls will have to wait a little longer. The greenback extended its decline this week, marking four straight sessions in the red. While still modestly positive for the month, the dollar remains locked in a narrow trading range, a continuation of the consolidation phase that began in late May. Meanwhile, both the yen and euro have recovered, capitalizing on the dollar\u2019s softness.\nInvestor sentiment remains fragile, with renewed concerns around US regional banks adding to a growing list of global headwinds. The prospect of a government shutdown and lingering trade tensions are also weighing on the outlook for global growth. In rates markets, the 10-year US Treasury yield dipped below 4% on Thursday, while the 2-year yield fell beneath 3.4%, a level not seen since early April. This move suggests markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility that the Fed may need to cut rates below neutral to cushion the economy.\nThe catalyst for the latest rally in Treasuries appears to be rising unease over hidden credit risks within the US regional banking sector, which is reigniting fears of broader financial instability.\nAlso, released this Wednesday, the latest Beige Book painted a picture of stagnant economic activity, reinforcing the cautious tone from Federal Reserve officials who continue to signal a measured approach to rate cuts. Adding to the bearish sentiment is the rising risk of political gridlock: Polymarket now places the odds of a government shutdown lasting over a month at more than 70%. Against this backdrop of tepid growth, sticky inflation, and mounting political uncertainty, markets are now pricing in two additional rate cuts this year with near certainty, even ahead of next week\u2019s closely watched CPI release. Dollar bulls take notice.\nThe October Beige Book revealed a mixed economic landscape, with overall activity showing little change or slight softening. Three Districts reported modest growth, while four saw slight declines. Consumer spending edged lower, particularly among lower- and middle-income households, who are increasingly price-sensitive and cautious. In contrast, higher-income consumers continued to spend on luxury services. Sectoral performance was broadly muted: agriculture, energy, and transportation all saw declines, while manufacturing struggled under the weight of higher tariffs and weakening demand. Real estate remained mixed, though some improvement in business lending was noted, thanks to lower rates.\nLabor market conditions were similarly tepid. Employment levels held steady, but labor demand softened, with many firms trimming headcounts via layoffs or attrition. A notable trend emerged: increased investment in AI technologies, which some employers cited as a reason for reduced hiring. Labor availability improved, enabling firms to lean on temporary or part-time workers. Despite the slackening demand, wage growth remained modest to moderate, driven in part by rising costs especially, employer-sponsored health insurance, which saw outsized increases. Inflation pressures persisted, with input costs climbing due to higher import prices and rising service expenses, keeping overall inflation above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nIn this environment, the Fed appears poised for another quarter-point rate cut at its October meeting. Governor Christopher Waller, seen as a potential successor to Chair Jerome Powell, has advocated a cautious approach: \u201cGo carefully, do 25, and wait to see what happens,\u201d he said, echoing Powell\u2019s recent messaging. This incremental easing is designed to support growth while keeping inflation risks in check. As expected, Governor Stephen Miran disagreed, as he continues to push for a larger, half-point reduction. Known for his unconventional economic views, Miran argues that US-China trade tensions pose a significant downside risk, which could be exacerbated if monetary policy remains too tight. Still, h"

                "body": "The Euro has retracted to 1.1585 after reaching a high of 1.1730 earlier. Eurostat data shows an unexpected rise in inflation in September. Meanwhile, the US Dollar is under pressure due to trade tensions with China and expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nEUR/USD is trading at 1.1685 ahead of the US session, after pulling back from its peaks. Although the pair is on course for a weekly gain of 0.6% against a weaker US Dollar, the focus is now on the US Industrial Production report and a speech by St. Louis Fed President, Alberto Musalem.\nChallenges For The US Dollar\nThe US Dollar is facing challenges from potential rate cuts and ongoing trade tensions. Fed Governor Christopher Waller supports an October rate cut, while Stephen Miran echoes the need for aggressive measures. Eurozone data indicates a 0.1% monthly inflation growth in September, with yearly inflation rising to 2.2%.\nECB officials suggest the end of the rate-cutting cycle is near. The Euro was the strongest against the US Dollar, with the latter on track for its worst week in months. Trade tensions, Fed rate cut signals, and delayed government funding weigh heavily on the US Dollar.\nEUR/USD\u2019s earlier pullback reached a support level around 1.1690. Confirmation beyond daily highs could pave the way for significant gains, with a possible move towards the October 1 and September 23 highs. The Federal Reserve\u2019s Industrial Production report is awaited, with a consensus of 0.1% growth expected. Alberto G. Musalem, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is scheduled to release a speech soon.\nWe are seeing a clear divergence in central bank policy that favors the Euro over the US Dollar. The European Central Bank is signaling an end to its rate-cutting cycle, giving the Euro a solid foundation. This is happening at the same time the US Federal Reserve appears ready to cut rates again, creating significant headwinds for the Dollar.\nThe data supports this view, with Eurozone inflation for September coming in hotter than expected at a 2.2% annual pace. The core inflation rate was even revised up to 2.4%, its highest reading since April. This provides a strong reason for the ECB to hold off on further easing, reinforcing the Euro\u2019s strength.\nTrading Strategies And Market Outlook\nOn the other side, the US Dollar is weighed down by expectations of more Fed rate cuts and ongoing trade tensions. We saw Fed Governor Waller openly favor another cut this month, while the Fed\u2019s recent Beige Book warned of a slowing economy. Looking back to the economic strength of 2023, where US GDP growth was a robust 4.9% in the third quarter, the current talk of weakening consumer spending marks a significant shift.\nFor derivative traders, this suggests a bullish stance on the EUR/USD pair in the weeks ahead. We should consider buying call options with strike prices above the recent 1.1730 high, targeting levels like 1.1780 or even 1.1820. This strategy allows us to profit from expected upside movement while capping our potential losses to the premium paid.\nHowever, we must be mindful of the short-term pullback, as the pair was overbought on some indicators before retreating. Today\u2019s US Industrial Production report is a key event; a figure below the 0.1% consensus would reinforce the weak Dollar narrative. A surprise to the upside, however, could trigger a deeper correction toward the 1.1665 support level.\nWe will also be listening carefully to the speech from St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem later today. Any comments confirming the dovish outlook will likely send EUR/USD higher. A surprisingly hawkish tone could provide a temporary boost to the Dollar, offering a better entry point for long positions."

                "body": "EUR/USD Weekly Forecast: Fed enters blackout period, US government stalemate continues\n- The United States government shutdown continues, becoming the second-largest in the country\u2019s history.\n- The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the September Consumer Price Index on Friday.\n- EUR/USD lost bullish momentum, but an upcoming bearish leg is still unclear.\nThe EUR/USD pair started the week on the wrong footing, as a dismal market mood benefited the US Dollar (USD). The pair, however, quickly changed course as turmoil came from the United States (US). As a result, EUR/USD peaked at 1.1728 on Friday, closing the week with modest gains below the 1.1700 mark.\nBringing back the trade war\nUS President Donald Trump surprised investors negatively on Friday, October 10, by escalating trade tensions with China. Beijing expanded its control of rare earth minerals, triggering Trump\u2019s rage.\nChina announced foreign companies would now need the government\u2019s approval to export any product that contains whatever amount of rare earths. It\u2019s worth remembering that the Asian giant has a near-monopoly in the processing of such minerals. As a result, US President Trump threatened the country with 100% levies. Beijing quickly responded to the threat by charging new port fees to US vessels.\nConcerns about the escalation of the trade war partially receded throughout the week, but tensions between the US and China remain high and linger like a Damocles\u2019 sword, negatively affecting the USD.\nUnited States government shutdown\nThe US federal government ran out of funding on October 1, and so far, Congress has been unable to solve it. Democratic and Republican senators have continued voting on opposing funding bills, but the stalemate continues as neither has gotten enough support. Not even a temporary funding bill to maintain military operations. It has now become the second-largest government shutdown, yet lawmakers seem in no rush to solve it. With Senators leaving Washington for the weekend, no news on the matter is expected at the beginning of the new week.\nCentral bankers taking centre stage\nIn the absence of relevant macroeconomic figures, with most US data releases suspended amid the shutdown, the focus stood on policymakers\u2019 words.\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde shared her confident perspective, repeating that interest rates are now at appropriate levels to deal with whatever turbulence. She also noted that risks to inflation and economic growth have become more balanced. Additionally, ECB Government Council member and Bank of France Governor Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy gave a televised interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. Villeroy sees more downside than upside inflation risks, noting that the ECB is in a good place yet adding \u201cbut that place isn't fixed.\u201d\nStill, other ECB members seem to be in a less comfortable spot. Policymaker and Chairman of the Board Bank of Lithuania Gediminas \u0160imkus said in Friday\u2019s European session that risks to both inflation and growth have tilted to the downside. Also, Chief Economist Philip Lane noted that, while uncertainty has abated after the US-European Union (EU) trade deal, the ECB will continue to be data-dependent.\nAcross the pond, Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell discussed quantitative tightening at the National Association for Business Economics conference in Philadelphia. On monetary policy, Powell reiterated that policymakers are concerned about the tightening labor market skewing the balance of risks between employment and inflation. Powell maintained the door open for upcoming interest rate cuts, with investors having fully priced in cuts in the two pending 2025 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Most FOMC members were aligned with Powell, with the obvious exception of Stephen Miran. Among other things, Miran noted that the economy is more vulnerable to shocks because monetary policy is restrictive, as he believes the neutral rate has fallen.\nMiran added that th"

                "body": "In the UK, the economy grew by 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics, after a contraction in July. Weak jobs data and slowing wage growth may prompt a rate cut by the Bank of England, with markets pricing in a 44% chance for a rate cut in December.\nPerformance Against Other Currencies\nThe British Pound was the strongest against the Australian Dollar this week. The percentage changes against major currencies showed GBP appreciated against currencies like EUR and JPY, while depreciating against CHF. Markets expect cumulative rate cuts by the Bank of England totaling 53 basis points by the end of 2026.\nWe\u2019ve seen this playbook before, back during the Trump administration, when a single comment on China could swing the US Dollar. Today, with GBP/USD trading near 1.22, the 1.34 level from that era seems like a distant memory, but the underlying drivers of central bank policy and economic weakness remain the same. The key for traders now is the growing difference in tone between the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.\nOn the US side, inflation remains the primary concern, even after the latest CPI report for September 2025 showed a slight cooling to 3.1%. While job growth has slowed, the Fed seems committed to holding rates steady to ensure inflation is fully contained. The market, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, is only pricing in a 25% chance of a rate cut before March 2026, a stark contrast to the aggressive cuts expected in the past.\nAcross the pond, the situation is much weaker, fueling expectations for a Bank of England rate cut sooner rather than later. The UK economy contracted by 0.2% in August 2025, and with wage growth stalling, the pressure is on the BoE to act. We are seeing market probabilities for a BoE rate cut in December 2025 climb above 60%, signaling a clear policy divergence from the Fed.\nStrategies for Traders\nThis policy split suggests traders should be prepared for continued downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair. Options traders might consider buying puts on the pound or establishing bearish put spreads to profit from a potential decline towards the 1.20 support level. This strategy allows for a defined risk while capitalizing on the negative sentiment surrounding the UK economy.\nVolatility is likely to increase as we approach the central bank meetings in November and December. For those looking to hedge or play this volatility directly, a long straddle on GBP/USD could be effective, profiting from a large price move in either direction. Historically, when central banks diverge this sharply, currency pairs do not stay quiet for long.\nFinally, keep an eye on relative strength against other currencies, similar to how the pound performed in the past. While weak against the dollar, the pound\u2019s trajectory against the Euro or Yen will depend on their respective economic data. Derivative trades that pair a weak GBP against a currency with a more stable or hawkish outlook, like the Swiss Franc, could offer alternative opportunities."

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Sterling Steadies at 1.3450, Fiscal Worries Set Tug-of-War\nThe Pound holds near 1.3450 after rebounding from 1.3250, boosted by Fed easing bets but capped by weak UK growth and fiscal worries near 1.35 resistance | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Rebounds to 1.3450 as Fed Dovish Signals Collide With Weak UK Growth Outlook\nThe British Pound has staged a steady comeback this week, with GBP/USD advancing toward 1.3450 after rebounding from Tuesday\u2019s low of 1.3250. The move comes as investors weigh softer U.S. growth signals against the U.K.\u2019s fragile economic backdrop. The pair has now posted three consecutive days of gains, finding technical support from a weaker U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which dropped to 98.10\u2014its lowest in three months\u2014amid dovish remarks from Federal Reserve officials and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.\nFed\u2019s Dovish Turn Amplifies Pressure on the Dollar\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book underscored an economic slowdown in the U.S., pointing to reduced consumer spending and rising layoffs. Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Board member Stephen Miran both hinted at further rate cuts in upcoming meetings, fueling market expectations for at least two 25-basis-point reductions by December. This pivot toward easing monetary policy has sharply weakened the Greenback, which now faces its fourth straight day of declines. The 16-day federal shutdown has only intensified uncertainty, delaying crucial data releases and clouding the Fed\u2019s near-term outlook. Traders are now pricing a nearly 100% probability of another rate cut at the next FOMC meeting.\nSterling\u2019s Recovery Driven by Soft Dollar, but Capped by Domestic Weakness\nWhile Sterling\u2019s rebound has been notable, its momentum is tempered by domestic headwinds. U.K. GDP growth for August came in at a meager 0.1%, while July\u2019s figure was revised down to -0.1%, signaling stagnation in output. Employment data earlier in the week revealed rising joblessness, reinforcing expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will continue its gradual rate-cut path into 2026. Market participants are now split on whether the BoE will trim rates again before the Autumn Budget in November, as fiscal challenges loom large and borrowing costs remain elevated. Despite these pressures, the Pound has held firm thanks to the Dollar\u2019s weakness, trading consistently above the 20- and 50-day moving averages since midweek.\nTechnical Setup: Bulls Eye 1.35 but Resistance Looms\nThe technical outlook for GBP/USD reflects cautious optimism. The pair has reclaimed the 100-period SMA on the four-hour chart and broken above the descending trendline that had capped upside momentum since early September. Oscillators show improving traction, with the RSI near 63\u2014still below overbought territory\u2014indicating room for moderate continuation. A decisive break above 1.3485, the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the recent downtrend, could unlock a move toward 1.3550. Immediate support sits at 1.3400, followed by 1.3350 and 1.3300. Failure to defend these zones could expose the pair to a retest of the 1.3250 trough. Still, short-term momentum remains bullish as long as price action holds above 1.3380.\nMarket Sentiment Anchored by Fiscal and Trade Uncertainty\nBeyond the technical setup, sentiment around the Pound remains fragile. The U.K. faces a challenging fiscal period, with debt-to-GDP levels exceeding 100% and the government preparing its Autumn Budget under pressure to stimulate growth while preserving fiscal discipline. Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade tensions are flaring once again after Washington threatened tariffs on rare earth exports, worsening global risk sentiment. The combination of geopolitical friction and a policy stalemate in Washington has weakened the Dollar broadly, but investors remain cautious about committing to risk assets, limiting the Pound\u2019s upside potential.\nRead More\n-\nJAAA ETF Holds Firm at $50.60 as 5.56% Yield Outshines Bonds in Volatile Market\n17.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNE"

                "body": "AUD/USD Price Forecast: Bears await 200-day SMA breakdown amid trade jitters, RBA rate cut bets\n- AUD/USD remains under bearish pressure amid a combination of negative factors.\n- US-China trade tensions and November RBA rate cut bets undermine the Aussie.\n- Sustained USD selling bias does little to impress bulls or lend support to the major.\nThe AUD/USD pair attracts heavy selling for the second consecutive day on Friday and drops back closer to its lowest level since early August, around the 0.6445-0.6440 region, touched earlier this week. Renewed signs of strain in US-China trade relations, along with rising bets for more interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), continue to weigh on the Australian Dollar (AUD) and the currency pair.\nUS-China trade tensions reignited in recent weeks after US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 100% in retaliation for the latter's enhanced restrictions on the export of rare earths. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer accused China of trying to control the world\u2019s technology supply chains and added that China's actions will determine whether the tariffs take effect. Furthermore, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned, \"if China wants to be an unreliable partner to the world, then the world will have to decouple.\" Adding to this, both countries announced the tit-for-tat port fees on vessels, fueling concerns about an all-out trade war between the world's two largest economies.\nMeanwhile, traders ramped up bets for an RBA rate cut in November following Thursday\u2019s disappointing release of monthly jobs data from Australia. In fact, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the Unemployment Rate shot to a near four-year high of 4.5% in September. Moreover, the number of employed people also fell short of consensus estimates and rose 14.9K from -5.4K in August. This overshadows the RBA's hawkish tilt and hopes for additional policy support from China, and fails to lend any support to the Aussie. Even the prevalent selling bias surrounding the US Dollar (USD) fails to impress bullish traders or lend support to the AUD/USD pair, which, in turn, backs the case for a further near-term depreciting move.\nIn fact, the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, touches a one-and-a-half-week low amid bets for two more interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) this year. Apart from this, economic risks stemming from a prolonged US government shutdown exert additional pressure on the Greenback. The vote on the Republican-backed stopgap funding bill to reopen the government fell short of the votes needed for passage in the Senate for the tenth time on Thursday, underscoring a deadlock in Congress. This, in turn, drags the USD lower for the fourth straight day. The AUD/USD pair, however, struggles to attract any buyers, suggesting that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the downside.\nAUD/USD daily chart\nTechnical Outlook\nSpot prices faced rejection near the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) earlier this week, and the subsequent decline favors bearish traders. Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart have been gaining negative traction and back the case for a further depreciating move. Some follow-through selling below the very important 200-day SMA, currently near the 0.6430-0.6425 area, will reaffirm the outlook and drag the AUD/USD pair below the 0.6400 mark, towards the July swing low, around the 0.6375-0.6370 region. The downward trajectory could extend further towards the 0.6350 intermediate support before spot prices eventually drop to the 0.6300 round figure.\nOn the flip side, any attempted recovery might now confront an immediate hurdle near the 0.6475-0.6480 region ahead of the 0.6500 psychological mark and the 0.6535 region (100-day SMA pivotal resistance). A sustained strength beyond the latter should allow the AUD/USD pair to reclaim the 0.6600 mark and climb further to"

                "body": "The Australian Dollar (AUD) fell due to increased US-China trade tensions and expectations of a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rate cut in November. September\u2019s employment data increased the probability of a rate cut from 50% to 85%. Amid these tensions, the AUD/USD pair has continued to decrease, partly influenced by the strong trade links between Australia and China.\nChina\u2019s plan to control rare earth exports could prompt alterations in the global supply chain. The US criticised these plans but left negotiation options open. Simultaneously, the US Dollar dropped due to the government shutdown and potential interest rate cuts, with the US dollar losing for four straight sessions and the US government shutdown continuing as the Senate remains deadlocked.\nFed Rate Cut Perspectives\nThe Fed\u2019s Governor, Christopher Waller, supports another interest rate cut, while the new Fed Governor, Stephen Miran, is advocating an aggressive rate-cut approach for 2025. Currently, there is a 97% chance of a Fed rate cut in October, with an 83% chance of another cut in December. China\u2019s September CPI fell by 0.3% YoY, with monthly inflation weaker than expected. The PPI fell 2.3% YoY, meeting expectations.\nThe Australian dollar is facing significant headwinds, creating opportunities for bearish positions. Escalating US-China tensions over rare earth minerals and weak Chinese economic data are weighing heavily on the Aussie. Domestically, the overwhelming expectation for a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rate cut in November provides a clear catalyst for further weakness.\nWe see this view reinforced by fresh data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which showed this week that retail sales growth slowed to just 0.2% month-on-month in September, missing forecasts. This confirms the soft consumer momentum the RBA has been worried about. This weak domestic picture solidifies the case for a rate cut at the next meeting.\nWith markets pricing in an 85% probability of the RBA cutting its cash rate to 3.40% in November, traders should consider buying AUD/USD put options. Options expiring in late November with a strike price around 0.6400 could be an effective way to position for a drop following the central bank\u2019s decision. The heightened uncertainty also suggests that implied volatility may increase, making now a good time to enter such positions.\nPotential Strategies for Traders\nThis situation feels similar to what we saw back in 2019, when weakening employment and growth data preceded a series of RBA rate cuts. In that period, the AUD/USD pair steadily declined over several months as monetary policy eased. History suggests that when the RBA enters an easing cycle, the path of least resistance for the currency is lower.\nThe external environment offers little support, as China\u2019s economy continues to show signs of deflation. Moreover, iron ore futures have slipped below $110 per tonne this month on concerns over Chinese steel demand, directly eroding a key pillar of Australia\u2019s export revenue. As long as this trend continues, the fundamental value of the Aussie dollar will remain under pressure.\nWhile the US dollar is also facing its own headwinds from the ongoing government shutdown and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts, the negative sentiment surrounding the Aussie appears more potent. The combination of domestic weakness and external risks creates a stronger bearish case for the AUD. Therefore, we should focus on the Aussie\u2019s specific vulnerabilities.\nConsidering these factors, shorting the Australian dollar against a haven currency like the Swiss franc could be a prudent strategy. The AUD/CHF cross often declines sharply during periods of global uncertainty. Selling AUD/CHF futures or buying puts on the pair offers a way to hedge against the combined risks of an RBA rate cut and deteriorating US-China relations."

The AUD/USD pair loses ground as the AUD could struggle due to escalating United States (US)-China trade tensions. It\u2019s important to note that any shift in China\u2019s economy can influence the Aussie Dollar, given the close trade relationship between China and Australia.\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized China\u2019s plans to restrict rare earth exports, calling them \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d and \u201ca global supply chain power grab.\u201d Bessent warned, \u201cIf China wants to be an unreliable partner to the world, then the world will have to decouple.\u201d However, both officials left room for negotiation, expressing uncertainty over whether China would actually follow through with the export controls announced last week, per BBC.\nThe AUD faced challenges as September\u2019s jobs data quickly boosted the chance of a November cut in the 3.65% cash rate to 85%, from 50% earlier in the week. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported on Thursday that the Employment Change came in at 14.9K in September, against the market expectations of 17K. The previous reading was -11.8K (revised from -5.4K). Meanwhile, the Unemployment Rate rose to 4.5%, jumping to a near four-year high.

The Greenback declines due to the ongoing US government shutdown and increased likelihood of US interest rate cuts.\n- The US federal government shutdown will continue into next week after the Senate once again failed to pass a Republican bill to extend funding and end the stalemate, marking the tenth unsuccessful attempt on Thursday, the 16th day of the impasse.\n- US Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller stated on Thursday that he supports another interest rate cut at this month\u2019s upcoming policy meeting. Meanwhile, the Fed\u2019s newest governor, Stephen Miran, reiterated his call for a more aggressive rate-cut trajectory for 2025 than that favored by his colleagues.\n- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated on Tuesday that the central bank is on track to deliver another quarter-point interest-rate reduction later this month, even as a government shutdown significantly reduces its read on the economy. Powell highlighted the low pace of hiring and noted that it may weaken further.\n- The CME FedWatch Tool indicates that markets are now pricing in nearly a 97% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and an 83% possibility of another reduction in December.\n- China\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined 0.3% year-over-year (YoY) in September. The market consensus was for a 0.1% decline in the reported period, following a fall of 0.4% in August. Meanwhile, the monthly inflation rose to 0.1%, weaker than the expected 0.2%. China\u2019s Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 2.3% YoY, following a 2.9% fall prior, as expected.\n- RBA Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) Christopher Kent spoke at the CFA Society Australia Investment Conference 2025 late Wednesday that financial conditions are less restrictive after recent rate cuts. Kent also added that the cash rate is now within a wide, uncertain neutral range, with the central bank reassessing its outlook with incoming data and risks.\n- "

                "body": "The USD/JPY experienced a continuous decline, influenced primarily by falling US Treasury yields, and was last seen at 149.71 levels. Current risks are oriented downwards.\nIn Japan, attention is on the potential coalition between the LDP and JIP, which could secure 231 seats, just short of the 233 needed for a majority. Such a coalition could advance LDP\u2019s Takaichi towards the Prime Minister role, while opposition parties consider forming their own coalition to contend.\nPolitical Maneuvering In Japan\nPolitical manoeuvring is expected to increase before the parliament convenes on 21 October to vote for a new Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the BOJ Governor Ueda stated that the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy stance remains unchanged, with potential adjustments dependent on economic outlook improvements.\nFactors influencing USD/JPY include Japan\u2019s policy decisions, US-China tensions, and risk sentiments. On the technical front, bullish momentum has decreased, and RSI has dropped. Key support levels are at 149.67 and 148.50, with resistance around 150.35, 151, and 151.90. The FXStreet Insights Team comprises journalists curating market observations and insights from experts.\nThe USD/JPY has extended its decline, tracking lower US yields to sit around 149.71. We see the risks as skewed to the downside in the near term. The focus is now squarely on the upcoming parliamentary vote for Prime Minister on October 21st.\nPolitical jostling ahead of the vote is creating significant uncertainty, especially with the LDP and JIP coalition talks that could bring Takaichi closer to the PM role. This type of event-driven risk is a classic trigger for higher implied volatility. Traders should consider buying options, like puts or straddles, to position for a potential sharp move after the October 21st decision.\nMarket Reactions And Strategies\nRecent data supports this cautious view, with the national CPI for September 2025 coming in at 2.9%, slightly above consensus and keeping pressure on the BOJ. We\u2019ve seen the Cboe FX Yen Volatility Index (JYVIX) tick up to its highest level in three months, reflecting market nervousness. This is reminiscent of the heightened intervention alerts we experienced back in 2022 and 2023 when the pair traded in similar territory.\nGovernor Ueda\u2019s remarks suggest the Bank of Japan is in a holding pattern for now, waiting for more confidence in their outlook. However, a new government could alter the path of policy normalization, especially concerning Japan\u2019s debt and deficit. This underlying policy uncertainty supports strategies that benefit from a stronger yen, such as buying USD/JPY put options with expirations in late November to capture any post-vote policy shifts.\nThe technical picture reinforces this bearish bias, as daily momentum has faded. With the next support seen at 149.67 and then 148.50, traders could look at put options with strike prices around these levels. Conversely, the resistance at 150.35 offers an opportunity to sell call options or structure bear call spreads, betting that the pair will fail to rally past that point in the coming weeks."

The US Dollar (USD) remains under pressure, hit by the ongoing US government shutdown and persistent trade frictions between the United States (US) and China.\nThe US Senate failed for the tenth time on Thursday to advance the Republican funding bill that would reopen the government. According to the White House, at least 10,000 federal employees could be furloughed, increasing concerns about the economic consequences of the prolonged shutdown.\nAt the same time, several members of the Federal Reserve (Fed) have recently expressed support for further interest rate cuts. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he is in favor of another reduction at the upcoming policy meeting later this month, while Stephen Miran argued for a more aggressive easing stance. Markets are now pricing in nearly a 100% chance of a 25-basis-point interest rate cut in October, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool.\nOn the international front, trade relations between the United States and China deteriorated further on Thursday after US President Donald Trump stated that the two nations were already engaged in a trade war. Later, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent intensified the dispute by referring to China\u2019s top trade negotiator as an \u201cunhinged\u201d wolf warrior \u2013 a term used for tough-talking Chinese diplomats \u2013 fueling tensions rather than easing them. This uncertain environment is heightening risk aversion and weighing on the US Dollar.\nHowever, the drop in Crude Oil prices, which have hit their lowest level since May on Friday, could limit the downside for the pair. As Canada is the largest Oil exporter to the United States, falling Oil prices typically weigh on the Loonie\u2019s value.\nMeanwhile, Canada\u2019s latest employment figures showed a surprise gain in September, reducing expectations for another interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) in October.\nCanadian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Canadian Dollar (CAD) against listed major currencies today.

Lower Oil prices add to the constraints on the Canadian Dollar\u2019s strength, helping limit significant depreciation of the USD/CAD pair.\nOn Thursday, the US Senate failed for the tenth time to progress on the Republican funding bill, risking the furlough of at least 10,000 federal employees as per the White House. Meanwhile, several Federal Reserve members support further interest rate cuts, with markets anticipating a 25-basis-point reduction in October.\nTrade Tensions and Economic Uncertainties\nTrade relations continue to deteriorate, as US President claims engagement in a trade war with China, and US Treasury Secretary escalates tensions further. Such developments contribute to heightened risk aversion, affecting the US Dollar negatively.\nCrude Oil price drops could potentially curb the downside for USD/CAD given Canada\u2019s status as a major Oil exporter to the US. Recent Canadian employment figures showed unexpected growth in September, possibly influencing the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate decisions.\nA heat map displays percentage changes of major currencies, showing the Canadian Dollar\u2019s performance against others. Markets move quickly, and insights are rapidly distributed through updates for traders and financial enthusiasts.\nGiven the sideways consolidation of USD/CAD around 1.4040, we are seeing a tug-of-war between major economic forces. The US Dollar is being weighed down by domestic political chaos and the near-certainty of a Fed rate cut. This creates a challenging environment where clear directional bets are risky in the immediate term.\nThe ongoing US government shutdown is a significant source of this uncertainty, and we should not underestimate its potential length. We saw back in the 2018-2019 shutdown that it lasted for 35 days, costing the economy an estimated $11 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office. This historical precedent suggests the current deadlock could persist, further dampening sentiment for the US Dollar as we head towards the end of the month.\nOil Prices and Canadian Dollar Dynamics\nOn the other hand, the drop in WTI Crude oil prices to below $70 a barrel for the first time since May is a major headwind for the Canadian dollar. Weakening global manufacturing data, especially recent PMI figures from China dipping below 50, signals contracting demand that could keep oil prices suppressed. This acts as a strong support for the USD/CAD pair, preventing it from falling further despite the weak US Dollar.\nWith these opposing factors, we believe strategies that profit from low volatility could be effective in the next one to two weeks. Selling volatility through options, such as setting up an iron condor with strikes well outside the recent 1.4000-1.4100 range, could allow traders to collect premium as the pair remains range-bound. This strategy benefits from the time decay that will occur while Washington and oil markets find their footing.\nHowever, we must also prepare for an eventual breakout, as this consolidation will not last forever. A resolution in Washington or a sharp reversal in oil prices could trigger a significant move. Therefore, placing orders for a long straddle, buying both a call and a put option, could be a prudent way to capture a large price swing in either direction once the current stalemate breaks."

But the boost looks shaky: weaker wholesale and manufacturing sales hint at slower economic momentum at home, keeping the currency under pressure.

Still, many expect the Bank of Canada to cut rates soon\u2014either at its late October meeting or by year-end\u2014especially with bond yields slipping to their lowest since spring. The growing prospect of a rate cut is weighing on the loonie, leaving investors bracing for continued swings.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Oil offers a shallow anchor.\nThe loonie\u2019s fate is closely tied to oil, so even small moves in crude prices can ripple through Canada\u2019s markets. While steadier oil gave the currency a short-lived bump, the prospect of lower rates and falling bond yields has dampened investor optimism. Even as Wall Street\u2019s upbeat mood nudged risk-taking higher, the loonie\u2019s four-week losing streak highlights ongoing investor caution in Canadian assets.\nThe bigger picture: Canada navigates global headwinds.\nBeyond oil and rates, Canada\u2019s outlook is tangled up in global uncertainty, sluggish domestic growth, and tricky trade situations with China over canola and electric vehicles.

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair is trading lower, hovering around 201.60, attributed to the Japanese Yen\u2019s strength amidst monetary policy uncertainties. Bank of Japan Governor Ueda requires more data before deciding on a potential interest rate hike, as revealed in a recent news conference.\nUK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has affirmed the introduction of tax hikes in the upcoming November Autumn Budget. Despite these fiscal strategies, the Pound Sterling shows mixed performance against other currencies, with economic conditions influencing market responses.\nPound Sterling And The Bank Of England\nThe value of the Pound Sterling depends on decisions made by the Bank of England (BoE), with interest rate adjustments being a key tool. A strong economy can lead to interest rate hikes, strengthening the currency as foreign investment increases.\nConversely, weak economic data often results in a declining Pound Sterling. The Trade Balance also impacts the currency\u2019s value by measuring the difference between export earnings and import expenditure over a specific period, where a positive balance typically strengthens a currency.\nThe GBP/JPY pair is showing clear weakness around the 201.60 level, and we see this trend continuing in the near term. The Japanese Yen\u2019s outperformance is the primary driver, coupled with concerns over upcoming UK tax hikes in the November Autumn Budget. This creates a challenging environment for those holding long positions.\nMarket Reactions To Economic Policies\nBank of Japan Governor Ueda\u2019s cautious tone is being overshadowed by hard data, which we believe the market is focusing on. Japan\u2019s national core CPI for September came in at 2.9%, remaining well above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for over a year. Consequently, traders are positioning for a potential hawkish surprise from the BoJ\u2019s meeting later this month, even if it is just a change in forward guidance.\nOn the Sterling side, the outlook is clouded by fiscal policy, despite hawkish signals from some at the Bank of England. The UK\u2019s latest GDP figures showed a minor contraction, and with government debt hovering just under 100% of GDP, the confirmed tax hikes will likely further dampen economic activity. This fundamental weakness in the UK economy puts a ceiling on any potential rallies for the pound.\nGiven the dual uncertainties of the BoJ meeting and the UK budget, we are seeing a notable increase in market nervousness. Implied volatility on one-month GBP/JPY options has jumped to 12.5%, suggesting traders are pricing in a significant move. This makes strategies like buying puts to protect against further downside, or even straddles to play a breakout in either direction, look attractive.\nWe only have to look back to late 2024 to see how quickly this pair can move on shifts in BoJ policy expectations. During that period, a similar build-up of speculation led to a rapid JPY rally that pushed the pair down significantly in a matter of weeks. Traders should remain nimble, as a repeat of that volatility is a distinct possibility."

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves confirmed that the Autumn Budget, due in November, will include new tax increases to preserve fiscal stability. These announcements weigh on the GBP rebound potential, even as the UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by a modest 0.1% MoM in August.\nInvestors are also focused on upcoming speeche by Bank of England (BoE) Deputy Governor for Financial Stability Sarah Breeden later in the day. Catherine Mann, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), recently warned that it would be premature to cut interest rates further, noting that the labor market is only \u201cmodestly loosening.\u201d\nAgainst this backdrop, the widening policy divergence between a more hawkish BoJ and a cautious BoE continues to weigh on GBP/JPY, which could extend its decline if Japanese Yen strength persists.\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) saw $275.2 million exit in a single trading session, making it the fund\u2019s largest daily outflow since August. The drop was steep enough to catch the attention of analysts, who see this as a warning sign for institutional confidence in crypto ETFs.\nARKB has long been one of the more active Bitcoin funds on the market. But this latest pullback shows that even the more established names are not immune when sentiment turns negative.\nTotal Daily Outflows Top Half a Billion\nARKB\u2019s staggering outflow was only part of the bigger picture. Across all Bitcoin ETFs, the total net outflow for the day reached $530.9 million. That is one of the largest single-day drops the space has seen since late summer.\nThe selloff wasn\u2019t limited to one or two funds either. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, for example, also lost about $132 million. That kind of coordinated movement suggests investors are not just repositioning within the sector but pulling back altogether.\nBig Liquidations and Fed Jitters May Be to Blame\nSo what caused the sudden flight of capital? There are a few possible culprits. A massive $19 billion liquidation across crypto markets happened just a few days earlier. Events like that tend to shake investor confidence and trigger a chain reaction, especially among more cautious institutional players.\nAnother factor could be the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Any hint of interest rate changes or new monetary policy could spook markets, and Bitcoin often reacts more violently than traditional assets. When uncertainty creeps in, some investors prefer to step aside rather than ride out the volatility.\nDISCOVER: 9+ Best High-Risk, High-Reward Crypto to Buy in October2025\nARKB\u2019s Volatile Nature Isn\u2019t New\nARKB has a reputation for being more reactive than its peers. That has to do with the kind of investors it attracts, many of whom are quicker to buy in and sell out based on short-term movements.\nSean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive, pointed out that ARKB usually holds around 40,000 to 50,000 BTC. With that much under management, any major redemptions can have ripple effects across the broader market. The way the ETF is structured means authorized participants can create and redeem shares on demand, which puts pressure on how the underlying bitcoin is managed behind the scenes.\nWhy This Matters for Bitcoin\u2019s Price\nWhen ETFs experience major outflows, it often leads to pressure on the spot market. That\u2019s because those managing the funds may need to adjust their positions by selling real bitcoin to match redemptions. It doesn\u2019t always happen instantly, but it adds to the downward momentum.\nThis also calls into question how institutions are treating Bitcoin right now. Is it a long-term hedge, or is it still viewed as something to trade when things get choppy? If it\u2019s the latter, more volatility could lie ahead.\nDISCOVER: Next 1000X Crypto: 10+ Crypto Tokens That Can Hit 1000x in 2025\nEyes on the Fed and Next Steps\nWhat happens next could hinge on what the Fed does and says at its upcoming meeting. If the rate policy stays stable, we might see ETF flows return. But if things remain uncertain, more investors may continue trimming their crypto exposure.\nETF issuers will be watching closely. Share discounts to net asset value may need to be tightened, and liquidity management will become even more critical.\nIf ARKB and its peers can stop the bleeding and rebuild inflows, they might restore trust. If not, this moment could mark a shift in how institutional players think about Bitcoin, not as a steady piece of a portfolio, but as a fast-moving asset that needs to be handled with caution.\nDISCOVER: 20+ Next Crypto to Explode in 2025\nJoin The 99Bitcoins News Discord Here For The Latest Market Updates\nKey Takeaways\n- ARKB recorded $275.2 million in outflows, the fund\u2019s largest one-day loss since August 2025.\n- Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined $530.9 million in net outflows, pointing to wider institutional pullba"

                "body": "Binance Coin (BNB) recently slipped after hitting an all-time high above $1,370, leaving traders uncertain about its ability to reclaim the $1,500 level. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) has stabilized above $3,000, buoyed by BitMine's 202K ETH treasury expansion, which reflects growing institutional interest despite strong resistance between $4,400 and $4,500.\nBoth coins remain relevant, yet face structural headwinds, from scalability and compliance hurdles to ecosystem fatigue. BlockDAG (BDAG), in contrast, enters with tangible execution, offering a $0.0015 using the TGE code, audited tokenomics, 20+ confirmed exchange listings, and live EVM-compatible testnet activity, positioning it as the best crypto to invest in now.\nAfter crossing the $1,370 ATH, Binance Coin experienced a modest pullback, reflecting both macro-driven caution and exchange-linked uncertainty. Analysts remain divided; some view this as a healthy consolidation, while others highlight weakening on-chain activity.\nBinance's regulatory settlements in key markets have bolstered confidence, yet the BNB price prediction remains clouded by dependence on ecosystem demand and trading volume recovery.\nWith daily active addresses slowing and whale accumulation flattening, the challenge lies in re-establishing sustainable liquidity. To reclaim $1,500, BNB needs more than momentum; it requires renewed exchange engagement and diversified on-chain use cases that justify valuation strength beyond speculative cycles.\nDespite maintaining one of the largest DeFi footprints by volume, Binance Coin's network has shown limited developer onboarding over recent quarters. The consolidation phase is as much psychological as technical, with many traders rotating to higher-growth ecosystems like Solana or TON.\nWhile BNB still dominates exchange token utility, its reliance on trading fees, staking yields, and exchange programs underscores centralization risk. Analysts caution that as regulatory frameworks tighten, Binance must sustain transparency and compliance-driven growth to protect market sentiment. Without organic expansion beyond Binance's ecosystem, BNB's long-term price prediction remains reactive rather than directional, leaving room for better execution-focused alternatives.\nEthereum's stability above $3,000 offers a surface-level reassurance, yet its structural hurdles persist. The ETH price forecast reflects both optimism and caution, while BitMine's 202K ETH acquisition signals renewed institutional appetite, gas fees remain unpredictable, and Layer-2 reliance adds user complexity.\nEthereum's role as a backbone for DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts is undisputed, but scalability continues to dilute user experience. For ETH to break the $4,400-$4,500 ceiling, it must sustain transaction throughput and fee efficiency without alienating smaller investors. Institutional buying supports valuation, but retail disengagement suggests fatigue, particularly when newer Layer-1 networks deliver similar utility with lower operational costs.\nRegulatory clarity for Ethereum remains uncertain. With the SEC's shifting stance and global compliance regimes tightening, ETH's decentralized label is frequently scrutinized. Unlike Binance Coin, Ethereum's challenge is less about centralization and more about systemic inefficiency, gas spikes, validator concentration, and interoperability barriers.\nDevelopers continue to anchor on Layer-2 scaling solutions, but this patchwork approach risks fragmenting liquidity. Still, Ethereum's longevity provides investor trust, allowing it to retain dominance in DeFi and token issuance.\nThe ETH price forecast into 2025 remains bullish long-term, though short-term volatility and fee friction may slow the next growth phase, making emerging infrastructure plays like BlockDAG more attractive to retail investors seeking speed and transparency.\nWhere BNB and ETH defend their market positions, BlockDAG builds from the ground up.

                "body": "Rather than waiting for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to decide on its other applications, VanEck has filed for a Lido Staked Ethereum ETF.\nNotably, the asset management firm is the first to pursue this type of Lido Staked Ethereum offering.\nVanEck to List First Lido Staked Ethereum ETF\nSpot crypto ETF issuer VanEck has submitted an S-1 registration application for a Lido Staked Ethereum ETF.\nIn the filing lodged with the US SEC, which was dated October 16, the asset manager noted that the fund will track spot Lido Staked ETH (stETH) prices based on MarketVector\u2019s LDO Staked Ethereum Benchmark Rate index.\nInvestors who plunge their funds into the ETF will receive regulated exposure to both Ethereum and staking rewards earned through the Lido liquid staking protocol.\nThe $133 billion AuM issuer hinted at this move last week when it filed a statutory trust registration for the Lido Staked Ethereum ETF in Delaware. CSC Delaware Trust Company was the registered agent.\nMeanwhile, VanEck\u2019s first attempt to introduce a liquid-staking token within a regulated ETF came about two months ago. It proposed the integration of JitoSOL, a liquid staking token on the Solana blockchain.\nThe Lido staking protocol is known for allowing users to stake their ETH without running validator nodes. It issues the stETH liquid staking token, which becomes a representation of the deposited ETH and staking yield.\nDeFiLlama data revealed that there are 8.49 million ETH worth over $33.37 billion staked on Lido. This is a huge bag as it represents 59.88% of the entire market.\nSEC Updates the Generic Listing Standards for Crypto ETFs\nSeeing that the Generic Listing Standards took effect earlier, the SEC will decide on the first Lido Staked Ethereum ETF under this grade.\nAmong the many perks of this new listing rule, VanEck stands to benefit from the reduced crypto ETF approval timeline from 240 days to 75 days under the Securities Act of 1933.\nHashdex Crypto Index ETF is one of those funds that have benefited from the updated generic listing rules, enabling crypto ETFs to bypass lengthy reviews.\nFollowing the announcement of VanEck\u2019s Lido Staked Ethereum ETF filing, stETH has recorded a significant price dip. The digital asset has lost up to 5.73% within the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $3,775.13.\nAlthough its 24-hour trading volume is 17.24% higher, and is now at $84.46 million.\nRead original story VanEck Files for Lido-Staked Ethereum ETF With US SEC by Godfrey Benjamin at Coinspeaker.com"

Our editorial content is created independently of our marketing partnerships, and our ratings are based solely on our established evaluation criteria. Read More\nSolana (SOL) holders have watched their token rebound 10.59% in the past day, yet doubts linger over its sustainability above $200. Spot trading volume on Binance plunged 62% earlier, though it climbed 10.2% recently amid the rally.\nSuch volatility has prompted investors to seek more stable alternatives in the DeFi crypto space. Now, many pivot toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at $0.035 in its ongoing presale, drawn by promises of explosive gains through innovative lending tools. This shift reflects broader crypto prices today, where caution tempers hope. For readers weighing what crypto to invest in, that backdrop explains the renewed focus on early-stage DeFi.\nOn-chain metrics for Solana show accumulation since mid-July, but exchange balances dwindle unevenly. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $17,600,000 since presale inception, boasting 17,300 holders who eye 420% returns post-launch at $0.06. Phase 6, 70% filled, underscores urgency in this DeFi crypto pursuit. At this stage, some investors rank MUTM among the best crypto to buy now as they position for the next cycle.\nAnalysts have highlighted embers of recovery in Solana\u2019s chart, yet a red flag persists. Bulls tested $200 earlier, but the $200-$215 resistance looms large, blocking a true uptrend. Short-term holder NUPL dipped to June lows per Glassnode data, echoing past corrections without confirming bottoms.\nTransaction counts fell since August but ticked upward lately. Exchange SOL balances have declined steadily, hinting at accumulation. Still, broader sentiment ties to Bitcoin\u2019s push toward $117k resistance.\nA break above $120k might aid Solana, yet crypto predictions warn of delays. Why is crypto down today? Liquidation cascades explain much, eroding confidence.\nSolana holders, sensing fragility in these crypto prices, now explore DeFi crypto options for resilience. This unease fuels migrations, as investing in crypto demands vigilance amid such swings.\nMutuum Finance Presale Accelerates\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) has opened phase 6 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens selling at $0.035 each. Investors snapped up spots rapidly; this stage reached 70% capacity already. Early participants paid $0.01 in phase 1, securing 250% appreciation so far, or a 3.5x lift.\nPhase 6 sells out fast, closing doors on this entry soon. Phase 7 follows, hiking prices 14.3% to $0.04. Launch targets $0.06, positioning current buyers for 420% gains thereafter. The team finalized its CertiK audit successfully, earning a 90/100 token score that bolsters trust. Holders total 17,300, up from initial waves, as crypto investment flows in steadily.\nMoreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard tracking the top 50 holders. Its 24-hour leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC. The top user claims a $500 MUTM bonus, conditional on one transaction in that window. Past 24 hours crowned buyers at $1,704.60, $1,291.53, $1,000.00, $734.87, and $685.05.\nSuch features engage communities, mirroring why crypto is going up in select DeFi crypto niches.\nMutuum Finance Builds Robust Lending Core\nDevelopers at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced its lending and borrowing protocol expansion. Version 1 deploys to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Core elements include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots.

                "body": "Solana Meme Economy: The Culture That Drives Billions In Volume \u2013 Here\u2019s How\nSolana meme economy has evolved into one of the most explosive forces in crypto, and the community is now moving billions in daily trading volume. The culture surrounding SOL\u2019s meme coins has become a foundational driver of its network activity, liquidity, and overall market dominance in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading.\nHow Meme Liquidity Fuels Solana\u2019s Growth\nCrypto analyst known as BagCalls on X has pointed out that the memecoin menia and Degen energy culture of Solana is what defines the project. This is where the project SolsticeFi steps in, and it\u2019s building a native stablecoin and yield infrastructure designed to anchor the ecosystem. By offering institutional-grade yields through delta-neutral strategies and its YieldVault, the project is positioning itself as a cornerstone of maturity in SOL\u2019s DeFi landscape.\nBagCalls noted that this kind of innovation transcends the customary hype cycle. It also generates a lasting and underpinning aspect in the SOL decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which marks an impressive move toward the maturation of the on-chain financial environment of the network.\nThe Founder of BITMEN, BitmanTW, has also offered a compelling vision for Solana\u2019s trajectory, that the SOL network is turning the internet\u2019s capital market. SOL has already decisively scaled transactions, proving its capacity for high throughput and low-cost operations, while scaling its yield.\nAt the center of this evolution is SolsticeFi, the project that\u2019s building a baseline yield layer for SOL\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, which Bitman calls the missing piece. Powered by USX and YieldVault, SolsticeFi delivers institutional-grade performance with a native-first design.\nThe core of this new infrastructure is USX, a Solana-native synthetic stablecoin, which has seen explosive adoption, surpassing $210 million in Total Value Locked (TVL). By attracting over 18,000 holders, USX has become the 5th largest stablecoin on SOL in just four days.\nMeanwhile, YieldVault provides access to tokenized delta-neutral strategies, currently delivering around 8% APY and boasting 100% positive months over the past three years. With eUSX, users can earn a baseline yield while remaining fully flexible to move liquidity into any DeFi opportunity.\nSolana\u2019s Continued Functionality As A Core Strength\nAccording to the first Korean certified Elliott wave analyst, XForceGlobal, Solana remains one of the few assets that still works correctly within its broader market structure, even after posting an impressive 150% bounce from recent lows.\nRelated Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Risks Drop Below $200 After Losing Key Support, Analyst Warns\nXForceGlobal emphasized that SOL appears to be nearing the conclusion of its B wave, a phase in Elliott Wave theory often characterized by retracement and correction before the next impulsive move. The analyst suggests this B wave has either already completed near the 88.6% Fibonacci retracement level, or could still be working toward a final all-time high (ATH) fake-out into an expanded B pocket."

                "body": "The stock market's regional bank scare highlights credit risks that could come back to bite\nA pair of regional banks spooked markets this week.\nThe event raises questions about credit risk lurking under the surface of an otherwise robust market.\nMarket experts on Friday said they didn't see a wider crisis brewing.\nA new banking crisis or a flash in the pan?\nThat's the question traders were asking themselves on Thursday as a pair of regional banks sent stocks plunging after giving updates on their lending businesses.\nIt proved to be the latter, for now, as stocks erased some losses to rise into positive territory on Friday. The two offending banks, Zions and Western Alliance, saw their shares recover slightly following Thursday's drop.\nYet, this week's spasm of bank volatility should serve as a clear reminder to investors that sometimes the risk to the market isn't where most people are looking \u2014 in this case, rather than a sudden unwinding of AI bets, it was a shock in the credit ecosystem that caused the brief panic.\nTo recap: Zions Bancorp disclosed a $50 million charge-off on a loan underwritten by San Diego-based California Bank & Trust, one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Western Alliance, meanwhile, revealed a lawsuit against a borrower it alleged had committed fraud. Zions fell 13% and Western Alliance lost 11%.\nBy Friday though, both stocks were back in the green, with Zions up 4% and Western Alliance up 2% around 11 a.m. ET. The wider market also looked poised to recover from Thursday's swoon. The momentum can be attributed to positive earnings reports from Truist Financial, Regions Financial, and Fifth Third Bancorp, which soothed fears of widespread credit issues on Friday morning.\nThat said, credit risk is still in the air, and some high-profile bankruptcies and Jamie Dimon's latest comments highlight that.\nWhere are all the cockroaches?\n\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more\u2026 Everyone should be forewarned on this,\" said JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, warning investors to brace for more credit-market upheaval.\nDimon was referring to the recent bankruptcies of subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings and auto parts supplier First Brands, both of which have become poster children for the risks lurking in the booming private credit market.\nThe term private credit refers to the sprawling world of non-bank lenders, a patchwork of private equity firms, hedge funds, and specialty lenders that extend loans to companies that might have a harder time getting in the door at a major bank.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, banks are major sources of financing to private lenders, which can help explain why worries about credit broadly have spilled over into the banking sector.\n\"The top US banks continued to play an outsize role in driving loans to nondepository financial institutions in the second quarter,\" S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a report last month. \"The country's nine largest banks posted an $86.09 billion increase in nondepository financial institution (NDFI) loan growth, or 75.1% of the industry's $114.67 billion aggregate growth in the category.\"\nMarket pros say the concerns around private credit are mainly that it is less transparent. The soaring competition in the space in recent years may have eroded underwriting standards as lenders compete for business.\n\"This is a reflection on the fog involved with private credit and equities,\" Marcus Sturdivant Sr, a managing principal at advisory firm The ABC Squared, told Business Insider. \"Main Street is concerned, Wall Street is on watch, and the total economy is feeling the pinch.\"\nFrank Scarso, CEO of Avanza Capital Holdings, echoed that. \"When banks are forced to stretch for yield in uncertain economic cycles, it exposes the cracks in conventional risk models and market participants see it immediately.\"\nOther experts aren't as concerned, despite Dimon's ominous warning.\n\"Loan losses in that market reduce the rates of return on diversified portfolios of such loans"

                "body": "FTSE 100 drops sharply as banking fears ripple through London markets\nLondon's blue-chip index suffered its steepest one-day fall since April as US regional banking concerns triggered widespread selling across European financial stocks.\nBanking stocks lead FTSE 100 decline\nThe FTSE 100 tumbled as much as 1.6% in its sharpest single-day drop since April, with banking stocks bearing the brunt of the selloff. Barclays shares slid more than 5% while Standard Chartered declined over 4% as credit concerns from across the Atlantic sent shockwaves through European financial markets.\nThe rout came after US regional lenders Zions and Western Alliance revealed significant loan losses linked to fraudulent lending and commercial credit stress. These disclosures revived painful memories of the 2023 banking turmoil that saw Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and First Republic Bank collapse.\nInvestors fled risky assets as fears mounted that underlying weakness in regional US banks could spread to other parts of the global financial system. The speed and severity of the selloff caught many traders off guard, with trading platforms reporting elevated volumes throughout the session.\nMajor European lenders including Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas also suffered heavy losses, underscoring the interconnected nature of global banking markets. The broad-based nature of the decline suggested genuine concern rather than isolated profit-taking.\nFlight to safety drives bond rally\nAs equities tumbled, investors sought refuge in government bonds, pushing gilt yields to their lowest levels since July. The UK 10-year gilt yield extended its winning streak to six consecutive days as safe-haven demand intensified throughout the trading session.\nThe bond rally reflected a marked shift in market sentiment, with traders rapidly adjusting their expectations for Bank of England (BoE) policy. Money markets now price in earlier rate cuts, potentially as soon as early 2026, as growth concerns outweigh lingering inflation worries.\nGold surged to another record high as the precious metal benefited from its traditional safe-haven status. The yellow metal's rally came alongside strength in the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, both of which advanced as investors rotated into lower-risk currencies.\nThe divergence between falling equities and rising bonds highlighted genuine anxiety rather than routine market volatility. Options markets showed elevated demand for downside protection, suggesting traders expect continued turbulence ahead.\nChancellor Reeves seeks market reassurance\nReports emerged that Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to use her next budget to reassure bond investors about the government's fiscal discipline. Sources indicated she aims to leave more headroom against her debt rules, signalling a commitment to prudent public finances.\nReeves also hinted at potential measures to ease energy costs for households and businesses. These moves come as the government balances the need to support growth while maintaining credibility with financial markets after recent bond market volatility.\nThe Chancellor ruled out higher taxes on banks, indicating her desire to maintain London's competitiveness as a global financial centre. This stance comes despite pressure from some quarters to raise levies on lenders enjoying higher profits from elevated interest rates.\nHer comments suggest a delicate balancing act between supporting economic growth and maintaining fiscal credibility. Market reaction to her upcoming budget will prove crucial for gilt yields and the pound in coming months.\nCorporate earnings provide bright spots\nDespite the broader market turmoil, education publisher Pearson bucked the trend with shares rising 3.6%. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and highlighted encouraging progress in AI-driven growth initiatives across its digital learning platforms.\nSmiths Group gained ground after announcing the sale of its Interconnect unit for \u00a31.3 billion.

                "body": "European markets were lower across the board in a risk off trade this morning. The risk off tone gathered momentum following yesterday\u2019s reversal on Wall Street. European indices and US futures fell a further 0.5 to 1.5 percent while safe haven gold got to within $20 from reaching $4,400, before easing back a little to still hold around 8% weekly gains at the time of writing. Cryptos also fell alongside risk assets with Bitcoin plunging below $105K after taking out a key support around $110K yesterday. As well as ongoing trade war uncertainty between the US and China, sluggish global growth and stretched valuations, credit risk in US regional banks has added to the list of growing worries. But all it would take is a social media post by Trump to flip trigger a bullish reversal in risk appetite. For that reason, I am a bit sceptical whether this will turn into a sharp correction. Dip-buying has been a key theme in stock markets throughout 2025 and I expect that to continue. The DAX forecast remains bullish for now.\nDAX forecast remains positive despite the drop\nThere are reasons to be cheerful for European stock market investors, even if economic conditions are grim in Germany at the moment. A French political breakthrough, weaker oil prices, and firming expectations that the Fed will deliver two rate cuts before year-end should all mean downside is limited for stocks. But more to the point, Germany\u2019s major fiscal stimulus worth \u20ac500 billion in infrastructure spending alone plus around another \u20ac500 for spending and defence projects should help the Eurozone\u2019s economy grow, and provide a positive backdrop for stock markets.\nThe real drag on the DAX in the last couple of days has all been to do with the wider risk sentiment but data, too, has been weak for the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, from weaker industrial output to fading consumer sentiment. The data has been soft enough to keep the ECB\u2019s dovish camp in control who would be eyeing potentially one more cut next year.\nGerman stimulus: a slow-burn catalyst\nBerlin\u2019s multi-year spending plan \u2014 which breaks the country\u2019s self-imposed debt ceiling \u2014 could mark a structural turning point for Europe. Nearly \u20ac1 trillion in planned investment for defence, infrastructure, and green projects may not hit the economy immediately, but the shift in fiscal stance is already reshaping sentiment.\nGermany\u2019s deficit is expected to swell from \u20ac41 billion to \u20ac143 billion this year \u2014 a meaningful expansion after years of restraint. While the real economic impact will likely unfold from 2026 onward, the broader narrative is positive for the DAX forecast. It signals a more growth-oriented Europe. In the near term, though, traders remain cautious until they see spending translate into tangible growth data, while keeping a close eye on the US-China trade talks.\nAcross the broader, France added a welcome dose of calm yesterday. Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu surviving a second no-confidence vote has helped steady investor nerves and restore confidence in French assets. For the euro, it\u2019s another reason to stay bid, but so far we haven\u2019t seen that translate into a rebounding stock markets. Could that change, though, as the DAX tests a key support area near 23,700?\nTechnical DAX forecast and key levels to watch\nI didn\u2019t expect the DAX to pullback this deep after breaking to a new high just last week following a lengthy consolidation. But pull deep it has done, making us a little more concerned about the strength of the market. Still, we are giving the bulls the benefit of the doubt with the DAX now testing a key infliction point near 23700-23750 area as highlighted in blue on the chart. This area was the breakout zone a couple of weeks ago. Can we see another rally away from here? Below this zone, the purple area around 23280-23480 is the next major support zone. Resistance meanwhile is seen around 23950, then 24300. But if these levels break then a new wave of selling could commence towards the 25K handl"

                "body": "Tech Weekly: Broadcom and OpenAI Sign Deal, AMD and Oracle Announce Partnership\nCheck out this week\u2019s top tech news, tech stocks driving the market and tech ETF performance, plus must-know market catalysts to watch next week.\nThis week was marked by strong, event-driven volatility across the tech sector.\nMarket moves were shaped by artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure announcements, semiconductor earnings, signals of macroeconomic stress and escalating tensions between the US and China.\nEffects of the US government shutdown, coupled with renewed trade tensions between the world\u2019s largest tech markets, weighed on global equities. Quarterly results from regional banks eased earlier concerns about credit risks after Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) and Western Alliance (NYSE:WAL) disclosed loan issues related to apparent fraud.\nWall Street ultimately saw weekly gains, despite a midweek selloff that impacted high-value, high-risk sectors.\nHardware and infrastructure were the core positive contributors in the tech sector, reflecting the ongoing AI supercycle investment theme fueled by chip production and data center buildouts.\nSemiconductor stocks were the standout performers, boosted by record earnings reports from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) (NYSE:TSM) on Tuesday (October 14) and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) on Wednesday (October 15). Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also rose alongside TSMC, contributing to PHLX Semiconductor Sector's (INDEXNASDAQ:SOX) 1.2 percent rebound on Thursday (October 16).\nAdvanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) deal with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to deploy 50,000 GPUs, which was announced the same day as TSMC\u2019s earnings, added a competitive dynamic that sparked selective volatility among chipmakers; at the same time, it underscored strong AI-driven hardware demand across the sector.\nIn consumer hardware, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) product launch was notable, but not the primary market mover.\nData centers also had a big impact, highlighted by Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) US$14 billion Texas AI data center partnership with Nscale, and Brookfield Asset Management\u2019s (TSX:BAM,NYSE:BAM) US$5 billion investment in Bloom Energy's (NYSE:BE) fuel cell technology for powering AI-focused data centers. Oracle is forecasting acceleration in its AI data center business, indicating expanding hardware-backed infrastructure demand\nSoftware and cloud-native company movements were more mixed, with gains from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), but declines from others like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR).\n3 tech stocks that moved markets this week\n1. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nBroadcom shares surged nearly 10 percent on Monday (October 13) after OpenAI announced a multi-year agreement to co-develop custom AI GPUs. The collaboration will focus on deploying 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators designed by OpenAI and built by Broadcom, with deployment set to start in H2 2026 and continue through 2029.\nLater, multiple reports emerged citing individuals claiming that OpenAI is also partnering with Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) to produce custom CPUs to work alongside its Broadcom co-designed chip.\nShares of Arm also advanced by over 11 percent.\n2. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\nOracle and AMD also announced a major partnership this week, where Oracle will deploy 50,000 AMD-powered MI450 GPUs in its cloud infrastructure starting in the third quarter of 2026, with plans for ongoing expansion.\nAMD\u2019s share price rose by over 9 percent on the news, with the deal creating competitive pressure for rival chipmakers like NVIDIA. Meanwhile, Oracle shares declined by almost 7 percent on Friday (October 17) after the firm's CEO, Clay Magouryk, provided an upbeat projection to analysts, indicating that the deployment of 50,000 AMD-powered MI450 GPUs will significantly accelerate Oracle\u2019s AI business growth.\nHowever, analysts highlighted the potential for a significantly high CAPEX, possibly leading "

There\u2019s no hard shell to wrench open, no buckles to crank down or straps to Velcro tightly around the ankles. Instead, the rider effortlessly slips their feet into soft boots, then \u201cdials in\u201d the perfect fit by turning upper and lower knobs that cinch a zig-zagging cable routed within the boot shell.\nThis cable-and-dial lacing apparatus was developed in 2001, but it\u2019s taken more than two decades\u2014and 18,000-plus hours of development\u2014to integrate the Boa Fit System into alpine ski boots, which withstand far greater forces than their snowboard-bound cousins. (The name refers to the way the cable lacing wraps around the boot, like a boa constrictor.)"

I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in,\u201d Trump said in an interview broadcast Friday on Fox Business Network.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 items- list 1 of 3Fact-checking Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Israeli parliament\n- list 2 of 3Israel\u2019s Doha attack is a test for Trump\u2019s ties with the Gulf\n- list 3 of 3Have Trump and Netanyahu really agreed on a Gaza peace plan? Key takeaways\nThe US president called the pact a \u201cmiracle\u201d and \u201camazing\u201d and hailed the United Arab Emirates\u2019s signing of it.\nThe \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d secured agreements between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll help bring long-lasting peace to the Middle East,\u201d Trump claimed with his signature bombast.\nBut there are several factors at play since the original iteration of the accords, signed with fanfare at the White House during Trump\u2019s first term as president in 2020.\nIsrael has carried out a two-year genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza, escalated its harsh assault on the occupied West Bank, and beyond Palestine, bombed six countries in the region this year, including key Gulf Arab mediator Qatar, the huge diplomatic fallout from which effectively helped Trump force Israel into a ceasefire in Gaza.\nAn emergency summit of Arab and Muslim countries held in Doha in September, in the wake of the attack, staunchly declared its solidarity with Qatar and condemned Israel\u2019s bombing of the Qatari capital.\nThe extraordinary joint session between the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) gathered nearly 60 member states. Leaders said the meeting marked a critical moment to deliver a united message following what they described as an unprecedented escalation by Israel.\nIsrael\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s vision of a \u201cGreater Israel\u201d, has also been roundly condemned by Arab and Muslim countries, and involves hegemonic designs on Lebanese and Syrian territory, among others. Syrian President al-Sharaa, while welcoming Washington\u2019s moves to end its international isolation, has not been warm to the idea of signing up to the Abraham Accords.\nHezbollah\u2019s Secretary-General Naim Qassem appealed to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks to mend relations with the Lebanese armed group, aligned with Iran, and build a common front against Israel.\nAn August survey from the Washington Institute, a pro-Israel think tank in the US, found that 81 percent of Saudi respondents viewed the prospect of normalising relations with Israel negatively.\nA Foreign Affairs and Arab Barometer poll from June came to similar findings: in Morocco, one of the Abraham Accords signatories, support for the deal fell from 31 percent in 2022 to 13 percent in the months after Israel\u2019s war on Gaza began in October 2023.\nSaudi Arabia has also repeatedly asserted its commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative, which conditions recognition of Israel on resolving the plight of Palestinians and establishing a Palestinian state."

The consortium\u2019s agenda suggests yen and dollar liquidity could be natively available inside Japan\u2019s banking perimeter, rather than solely via foreign issuers.\nThe plan will begin with the Mitsubishi Corporation pilot as the first application, forming a potential distribution base spanning the banks\u2019 300,000+ enterprise relationships.\nStablecoins are digital tokens designed to track a reference asset, typically the U.S. dollar or another fiat, used for payments, market settlement, and collateral. They seek to combine programmability and instant finality with traditional-style reserves and disclosures, a structure now being codified in multiple jurisdictions.\nIntroducing stablecoins would mark a step-change in Japan\u2019s corporate payments stack and follows the country\u2019s gradual opening to fiat-backed tokens. Authorities are preparing approvals for domestic yen stablecoins, while other large institutions explore deposit tokens and tokenized cash channels. Japan Post Bank has announced plans to roll out DCJPY \u2014 a tokenized yen deposit \u2014 by fiscal 2026, signaling broad interest among incumbents in onchain settlement.\nMoreover, Japan\u2019s market is drawing fresh entrants as the rules are clarified. Ripple and SBI have targeted an early-2026 rollout of RLUSD in Japan.\nStablecoins have become crypto\u2019s dominant payments primitive, with total circulating value recently surpassing $300 billion for the first time, according to The Block\u2019s data.\nPolicymakers across Asia are also racing to define their roles. South Korea is preparing a stablecoin bill, while Hong Kong is launching a licensing regime for stablecoins.\nIn the U.S., the GENIUS Act has established the first federal framework for issuers, a template that global regulators are likely studying. Officials, such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, also expect the market to surge above $2 trillion in circulation by 2028 as regulations kick in and market share diversifies among service providers.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
