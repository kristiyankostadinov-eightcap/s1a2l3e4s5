* **Price Action:** The index is at risk of a **5-10% pullback**, with a smaller but non-trivial risk of a deeper **10-20% correction** in the event of sharper earnings disappointment, with key correction levels near **22,300**.
* **Technical Outlook:** The weekly chart suggests an **ABC-style correction** may already be underway, with the **38.2% Fibonacci retracement** level sitting just below the **10% drawdown zone**, making the **~22,300** area a plausible near-term target for bears or a zone where bulls may look to buy dips.
