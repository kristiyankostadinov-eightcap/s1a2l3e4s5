### AI Market Summary
### GER40 Market Briefing

* **Technical Outlook:** Immediate support is near **23,087**, with resistance at **24,884**. A decisive close above **23,740** would open the path toward **24,200** and possibly **24,884**, while rejection at this level risks a retest of **23,087** and, if broken, a deeper move toward **22,400** or even **20,414**.
