---
**Overall Sentiment:** Neutral ↔️  

**Recent Catalysts:**  
- Thursday's selloff: 3.2% plunge tied to AI-driven market volatility, margin calls, and CTA-driven selling.  
- Silver fell 11%, amplifying risk-off tone in metals.  
- Friday's rebound: 1.1% gain to $4,977.44 as dip-buyers stepped in.  

**Fed Policy Impact:**  
- Strong US jobs data earlier this week reduced rate-cut odds for mid-2026.  
- Markets still pricing ~2 rate cuts in 2026; CPI data Friday could shift timeline.  

**Volatility Notes:**  
- $5,000 level triggered stop-loss clusters and options hedging activity.  
- Metals remain choppy post-historic rout earlier in month.  

**Technical Levels:**

- Psychological resistance: $5,000  
- Next key data: US CPI (8:30 a.m. ET Friday)  

**Outlook:**  
Gold's direction hinges on CPI outcome. Hotter inflation could delay Fed cuts, pressuring prices. Dip-buying suggests underlying support, but sentiment remains fragile amid rate uncertainty.

**OPEC+ Production Update**
- **OPEC+ crude oil production fell by 439,000 bpd in January 2026**, averaging 42.45 million bpd.
- **Kazakhstan's output dropped by 249,000 bpd** due to a temporary shutdown at the Tengiz field after a power facility fire.

**Geopolitical Risks**

**China's Exposure**
- **China relies heavily on Iranian oil** due to sanctions limiting Iran's other buyers.
- Loss of Iranian and Venezuelan oil supplies could **devastate China's seaborne imports**.
- **Iran's Kharg Oil Terminal** is critical, handling 90% of its exports, making it a strategic vulnerability.

**Market Implications**
- Unplanned outages and lower production could **ease oversupply fears** weighing on oil prices.
- **Geopolitical risks** remain a wildcard for supply stability and price volatility.

**Overall Sentiment:** Cautious 📉

**Thailand's Regulatory Push:** The Cabinet approved digital assets as underlying assets for derivatives, with the SEC amending the Derivatives Trading Act. This move, described as a "watershed moment" by Binance Thailand's CEO, aims to position Thailand as a crypto hub in Southeast Asia, expanding beyond spot ETFs to futures and options.

**U.S. Legislative Landscape:** SEC Chair Paul Atkins emphasized that durable crypto policy requires congressional legislation, warning that agency rules alone are not "future-proof." Senator Mark Warner remains engaged in bipartisan talks on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, with DeFi regulation and illicit finance prevention as key concerns.

**ETF Inflows vs. Price Weakness:** Despite a 30.85% three-month decline, Valkyrie's Bitcoin ETF (BRRR) attracted **$4.99 million** in inflows on February 10, lifting AUM to **$432.3 million**. This suggests some investors are accumulating during the drawdown, though technical indicators signal further downside risk.
