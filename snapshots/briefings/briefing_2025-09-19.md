## Gold (EIGHTCAP:XAUUSD)

### Market Snapshot
*   **Yesterday's Close:** 3,644.530

*   **Open:** 3,658.470
*   **High:** 3,672.970
*   **Low:** 3,627.990

### AI Market Summary
Gold prices are declining despite the Federal Reserve's recent 25 basis point rate cut, as the move was perceived as less dovish than some investors had hoped. The strength of the U.S. Dollar and profit-taking activity after gold reached record highs are applying additional downward pressure. However, these losses are tempered by ongoing geopolitical tensions which continue to provide underlying safe-haven support for the precious metal.

## EUR/USD (EIGHTCAP:EURUSD)

### Market Snapshot
*   **Yesterday's Close:** 1.1785
*   **Day's Range:** 0.0098
*   **Open:** 1.1810
*   **High:** 1.1848
*   **Low:** 1.1750

### AI Market Summary
The EUR/USD is consolidating within a range, retreating from highs near 1.1878 after the Federal Reserve's expected 25bps rate cut. The Fed's less dovish-than-anticipated stance, with Chair Powell highlighting persistent inflation risks, has bolstered the US Dollar and capped the pair's upside. While the Euro finds some underlying support from expectations the ECB may be done cutting rates, it remains pressured by a stronger Dollar and upcoming data releases.
SENTIMENT: Negative

## GBP/USD (EIGHTCAP:GBPUSD)

### Market Snapshot
*   **Yesterday's Close:** 1.3551
*   **Day's Range:** 0.0126
*   **Open:** 1.3623
*   **High:** 1.3660
*   **Low:** 1.3534

### AI Market Summary
The GBP/USD is consolidating below 1.3645 after the Bank of England held interest rates steady and slowed its quantitative tightening program, while the US Federal Reserve began its easing cycle. This policy divergence led to a firmer US Dollar, causing the pair to retreat from recent highs and test support near the 1.3550 level. The pair's broader uptrend from early September remains intact as long as it holds above the key 1.3500 support area.

## AUD/USD (EIGHTCAP:AUDUSD)

### Market Snapshot
*   **Yesterday's Close:** 0.6611
*   **Day's Range:** 0.0053
*   **Open:** 0.6639
*   **High:** 0.6659
*   **Low:** 0.6606

### AI Market Summary
The Australian Dollar is weakening against the US Dollar, retreating from recent highs due to a surprisingly soft domestic jobs report that showed a loss of employment. While this data reinforces expectations for a future RBA rate cut, likely in November, immediate policy action is seen as unlikely. The USD is finding strength from a less dovish-than-anticipated Fed and solid US jobless claims data, adding downward pressure on the AUD/USD pair.
SENTIMENT: Negative

## USD/JPY (EIGHTCAP:USDJPY)

### Market Snapshot
*   **Yesterday's Close:** 147.9710
*   **Day's Range:** 1.4980
*   **Open:** 146.9270
*   **High:** 148.2630
*   **Low:** 146.7650

### AI Market Summary
The USD/JPY pair is trading near multi-month highs, buoyed by a less dovish-than-expected Federal Reserve rate cut and a cautious Bank of Japan that is widely anticipated to hold rates steady. The Fed's signal for only two more cuts this year, coupled with the BOJ's lack of immediate tightening signals, has maintained the interest rate differential that supports the US dollar. This dynamic has kept the pair entrenched within a key technical range between 145.00 and 150.00, with current momentum pointing to a test of the range's upper bounds.

## USD/CAD (EIGHTCAP:USDCAD)

### Market Snapshot
*   **Yesterday's Close:** 1.3793
*   **Day's Range:** 0.0048
*   **Open:** 1.3773
*   **High:** 1.3809
*   **Low:** 1.3761

### AI Market Summary
USD/CAD has rallied from key support near 1.3750 following the Fed and BoC rate cuts. The Fed's less dovish-than-expected stance, projecting fewer cuts for next year, has fueled broad USD strength. This has overshadowed the BoC's cut and signals for further easing, setting up a near-term bullish structure for the pair as it approaches resistance at 1.3900.
SENTIMENT: Positive

*   **Open:** 200.1060
*   **High:** 201.2560
*   **Low:** 200.0320

### AI Market Summary
The GBP/JPY is retreating sharply from a yearly high above 201.00 following a hawkish hold from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which featured dissents calling for a rate hike and fueled JPY strength. This movement is exacerbated by a dovish outlook from the Bank of England (BoE), creating a policy divergence that weighs on the pair. Traders are now focused on upcoming comments from BoJ Governor Ueda for further direction, while the pair consolidates near key technical support.
SENTIMENT: Negative
