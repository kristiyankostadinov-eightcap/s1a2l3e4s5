* **Day's Range:** 0.0039
* **Open:** 1.1742
* **High:** 1.1759
* **Low:** 1.1720

### AI Market Summary
### EUR/USD Market Briefing
* **Key Drivers:** The **ECB-Fed policy divergence** is driving the EUR/USD pair, with the European Central Bank maintaining steady rates and the US Federal Reserve expected to cut rates in **2026**. The **US Dollar** is weakening due to expectations of two additional Federal Reserve rate cuts, while the Euro is finding support as the ECB is likely to keep interest rates on hold.
* **Price Action:** The EUR/USD pair is trading around **1.1760**, having bounced back from previous losses, with **1.1750** acting as a key support level. The pair has shown significant **bullish momentum** in recent months, gaining around **180-200 pips** in a single month and roughly **13%** over the past year.
* **Technical Outlook:** Immediate resistance sits at **1.1800**, with the next cap around **1.1840**. A decisive push through **1.1800** would confirm that the EUR/USD pair has built a short-term floor and could drive the pair towards the high **1.17s**, with scope to test the **1.16** handle if the move extends. On the other side, a clean break under **1.1700** would reopen a path for the pair to attack and eventually surpass the **1.1800-1.1840** resistance zone. The **RSI** is around **60**, pointing to moderate positive momentum, but not an overbought regime.
