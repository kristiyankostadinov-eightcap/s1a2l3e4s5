*   **High:** 1.1754

### AI Market Summary

*   **High:** 0.6603
*   **Low:** 0.6525

### AI Market Summary

## USD/JPY (EIGHTCAP:USDJPY)

### Market Snapshot
*   **Yesterday's Close:** 149.7730
*   **Day's Range:** 1.3680
*   **Open:** 148.8110
*   **High:** 149.9210
*   **Low:** 148.5530

### AI Market Summary
The USD/JPY is trading near 150.00, a key psychological level, driven by a resurgent US Dollar. Strong US economic data, including upwardly revised GDP and falling jobless claims, has reduced expectations for imminent Fed rate cuts and widened the interest rate differential with Japan. Meanwhile, a cooling in Tokyo's core-core inflation has dampened speculation of a near-term hawkish shift from the Bank of Japan, further pressuring the Yen.

*   **Day's Range:** 0.0064
*   **Open:** 1.3890
*   **High:** 1.3949
*   **Low:** 1.3885

### AI Market Summary
The USD/CAD is trading near multi-month highs due to a combination of factors pressuring the Canadian dollar and supporting the US dollar.

*   **Low:** 199.5870

### AI Market Summary
The GBP/JPY pair is trading below the key 200.00 psychological level, facing downward pressure from multiple fronts. The Yen is finding support from firming market bets on an imminent Bank of Japan rate hike and a softer global risk tone. Concurrently, the Pound is being weighed down by growing concerns over the UK's fiscal outlook, evidenced by weaker demand at a government debt auction, and dovish commentary from the Bank of England.
