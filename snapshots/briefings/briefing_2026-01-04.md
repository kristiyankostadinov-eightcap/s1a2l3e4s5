* **Day's Range:** 1.335
* **Open:** 57.979

### AI Market Summary
### Spot WTI Crude Oil Market Briefing
* **Key Drivers:** The overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro in oil-rich Venezuela is unlikely to shock energy markets in the near term, as the global oil market is currently **oversupplied** and demand is relatively **weak**.

* **Technical Outlook:** Immediate support for Spot WTI Crude Oil is near the **50-day moving average** at around **$57**, with resistance at **$60**. The **bullish momentum** is limited due to the current **oversupply** in the global oil market.
