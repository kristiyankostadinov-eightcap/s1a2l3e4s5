### AI Market Summary
### EUR/USD Market Briefing
* **Key Drivers:** The **EUR/USD** pair is experiencing a bullish shift after the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates, with the pair rebounding from support and testing **uptrend resistance**.

* **Technical Outlook:** Immediate support is near **1.1679**, with near-term bullish invalidation raised to **1.1634/41**. A daily close below this threshold would suggest a more significant high is in place, and a larger trend reversal is underway toward **1.1590-1.16**.
