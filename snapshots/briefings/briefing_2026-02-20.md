**Overall Sentiment:** Neutral ⬇️

**Context:** Walmart's strong Q4 results (6% same-store sales, record revenues) were overshadowed by conservative full-year guidance (3.5-4.5% sales growth). Amazon's $717B sales dethroned Walmart's 13-year #1 retail position. Geopolitical tensions and credit market concerns added pressure.
