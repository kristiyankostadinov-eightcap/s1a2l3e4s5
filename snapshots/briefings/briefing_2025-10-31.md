### AI Market Summary
### Gold (XAU/USD) Market Briefing

* **Key Drivers:** The **Federal Reserve's** decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to a range of **3.75% to 4%** has led to a rebound in gold prices, currently trading near **$4,000**. The ongoing **US government shutdown** and delayed economic data releases are contributing to market uncertainty.
* **Price Action:** Gold prices have shown **bullish momentum**, reaching **$4,031.10** per ounce, despite the **US Dollar's** broad strength across the FX board. The **XAU/USD** pair is currently trading at **$4,002.60**.

* **Day's Range:** 0.0090
* **Open:** 1.1599

### AI Market Summary
### EUR/USD Market Briefing

* **Key Drivers:** The **hawkish** tone from the Federal Reserve, particularly Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments, has strengthened the US dollar, putting pressure on the **EUR/USD** pair. The European Central Bank's (ECB) cautious stance and weak Eurozone data, including flat German GDP and easing inflation, have further contributed to the euro's vulnerability.
* **Price Action:** The **EUR/USD** pair has defended the **1.1550-40** support level but lacks **bullish** conviction, currently trading around the **1.1575** region. A break below the **1.1550-1.1540** support could trigger fresh **bearish** momentum, while a recovery above **1.1659** might lead to short covering toward **1.1700-1.1770**.
* **Technical Outlook:** Immediate support is near the **1.1540** level, with resistance at **1.1640**, aligning with the 200-period EMA at **1.1642**. The 50-period EMA at **1.1620** serves as intraday resistance, and the RSI at **45** reflects fading buying momentum.
