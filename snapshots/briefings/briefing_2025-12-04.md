### Market Snapshot
* **Yesterday's Close:** 151.3990
* **Day's Range:** 1.4950
* **Open:** 151.3560
* **High:** 152.4200
* **Low:** 150.9250

### AI Market Summary
### USD/JPY Market Briefing

* **Key Drivers:** The USD/JPY pair is experiencing a decline due to **renewed pressure on the US dollar** and **market expectations for a deeper Federal Reserve easing cycle**. The **Bank of Japan's (BoJ) potential interest rate hike** at its December meeting is also driving the decline.
* **Price Action:** The pair fell to **155.67** on Wednesday, recovering part of the previous session’s sharp losses, and is currently trading around **¥155.7**, down from recent highs near **¥158**.
* **Technical Outlook:** The pair is trading below the key resistance level of **156.76**, forming a potential reversal structure near the lower Bollinger Band. A decisive break below the **154.66** support level would signal a deeper correction, targeting the area of previous local lows. Conversely, a sustained recovery and close above **156.76** would provide the first technical signal of a potential recovery, opening a path for the pair to retest the **157.90–158.00** resistance zone.
