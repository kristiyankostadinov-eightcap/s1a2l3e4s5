### AI Market Summary
### Spot WTI Crude Oil Market Briefing

* **Key Drivers:** Rising global inventories, shifting supply-demand expectations from **OPEC** and the **IEA**, and a broader sense that supply continues to outpace demand, are exerting **bearish** pressure on prices. However, geopolitical tensions, such as the Ukrainian attack on Russia's Black Sea port of **Novorossiysk**, temporarily suspending oil exports equivalent to **2%** of global supply, are introducing **bullish** catalysts.
* **Price Action:** **WTI** futures fell sharply midweek before stabilizing at **$58.12**, a level that may act as psychological support in the short term. The price has been influenced by a massive **6.4 million barrel** build in domestic crude inventories, far exceeding analyst expectations.
* **Technical Outlook:** Immediate support is near the recent lows, with resistance at higher price levels. The **bearish** tone from **OPEC**'s revised supply-demand forecast for **2026**, projecting a surplus, and the **IEA**'s raised global oil supply growth forecasts, are expected to continue pressuring prices.
