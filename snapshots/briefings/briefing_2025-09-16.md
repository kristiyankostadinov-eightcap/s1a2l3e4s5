### AI Market Summary
Gold is trading at record highs, driven by a weakening US Dollar and heightened market expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The rally is further supported by structural factors including persistent inflation, high US government debt, and significant central bank buying, particularly from emerging markets. However, technical indicators suggest the metal is overbought, and a potential policy disappointment from the Fed could trigger a significant corrective sell-off.
