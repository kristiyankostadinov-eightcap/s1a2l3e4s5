- **FTSE 250 Divergence:** The more UK-focused FTSE 250 edged up, suggesting steadier domestic sentiment compared to commodity-heavy blue chips.  

**Market Implications:**  
- **Global Proxy Nature:** FTSE 100's performance is heavily influenced by global factors like oil, metals, and US drug approvals, often diverging from the FTSE 250's domestic focus.  
- **Central Bank Watch:** The Bank of England's rate decision is expected to be a hold, with cooling inflation providing some clarity, though global market moves remain a key driver.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Monitor oil price trends and FDA decisions on key pharma stocks.  
- Watch for Bank of England's rate decision and its impact on domestic sentiment.  
- Track FTSE 250 for a clearer read on UK economic sentiment.
