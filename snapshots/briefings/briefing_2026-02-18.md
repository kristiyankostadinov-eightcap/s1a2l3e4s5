* **Day's Range:** 0.0022
* **Open:** 0.7080
* **High:** 0.7087
* **Low:** 0.7065

### AI Market Summary
### AUD/USD Market Briefing  
* **Key Drivers:** RBA hawkish stance, wage inflation data, US economic releases.  
* **Price Action:** Consolidating near **0.7080**, above rising EMAs.  
* **Technical Outlook:** Support at **0.7000**, resistance at **0.7100/0.7147**.  
---
**Overall Sentiment:** Neutral → Bullish 📈  

**Policy Divergence & RBA Hawkishness**  
Goldman Sachs raised AUD/USD forecasts to **0.72** (3m), **0.73** (6m), **0.74** (12m), citing the RBA's hawkish stance and relative policy divergence. The bank expects one more rate hike in May, with the Q4 Wage Price Index and January employment data as key catalysts.  

**Technical Structure**  
AUD/USD trades above rising 50-day and 200-day EMAs, confirming bullish momentum. Stochastic shows bearish divergence but remains overbought, suggesting consolidation. Immediate support at **0.7000**, resistance at **0.7100/0.7147**.  

**Data Calendar & Risks**  
- **Australia:** Q4 Wage Price Index (Wed), January employment (Thu).  
- **US:** FOMC minutes (Wed), Q4 GDP & core PCE (Fri).  
Risks include metals price volatility, weaker US data, and global risk-off sentiment.  

**Market Positioning**  
AUD remains undervalued per Goldman’s GSBEER model (~2% below fair value). Policy divergence and commodity-linked resilience support a firmer AUD/USD trajectory if RBA maintains tightening bias.
