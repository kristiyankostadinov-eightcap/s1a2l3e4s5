* **Key Drivers:** The primary drivers are the actions of the European Central Bank (ECB), which has slashed interest rates to 2%, and the interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, making the equities market more attractive than bonds. Additionally, the general correlation with other global indices and increased government spending in Germany have contributed to the rally.
* **Price Action:** The GER40 index has held steady near its all-time high, trading at €24,378, up by over 32% from its lowest level in April, with top gainers including Rheinmetall, Siemens Energy, and Commerzbank, while top laggards include Symrise, Beiersdorf, Adidas, Zalando, and Merck.
* **Technical Outlook:** The index has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and formed an ascending triangle pattern, indicating a potential strong bullish breakout over time, with the next important resistance level at 25,000, and support at 24,000.

**Overall Market Sentiment:** Positive
