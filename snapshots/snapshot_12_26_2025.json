With additional Fed rate cuts, U.S. dollar weakness, and intensifying geopolitical risks anticipated, gold could rise 5%\u201315% in 2026.\nIn extreme cases \u2014 such as a global economic slowdown and aggressive Fed easing \u2014 gold could potentially climb 15% to 30% in the coming year.\nMajor investment banks remain broadly bullish on gold, with price targets clustering between USD 4,500 and USD 5,000 per ounce.\nGoldman Sachs expects gold to reach USD 4,900/oz by the end of 2026, supported by continued growth in central bank demand and ETF inflows.\nBank of America holds that expanding U.S. fiscal deficits and rising debt will provide persistent support for gold. It forecasts a USD 5,000/oz price in 2026.\n2. Bitcoin (BTC/USD)\nIn 2025, Bitcoin prices hit a historical high before retreating, ending the year nearly flat.\nLooking ahead, Standard Chartered revised its Bitcoin price target downward from USD 200,000 to USD 150,000, citing expectations that the crypto treasury firm (Digital Asset Treasury, DAT) will cease bitcoin purchases, though ETF inflows should remain a strong boost.\nBernstein also projects Bitcoin to reach USD 150,000 in 2026 and USD 200,000 in 2027.\nBernstein argues that Bitcoin has broken its four-year cyclical pattern and is now in an elongated bull cycle. Morgan Stanley believes the opposite, warning that the Bitcoin four-year cycle still remains and the bull market is nearing its end.\n3.

This investment cycle is expected to support key Nasdaq 100 constituents such as NVIDIA, AMD, and Broadcom.\nJPMorgan has outlined upside scenarios for the S&P 500 in which the index could approach the 7,500 level in 2026, while Deutsche Bank has presented more optimistic scenarios pointing toward levels around 8,000 by end-2026, contingent on robust earnings growth and continued AI-driven investment.\nBased on S&P 500 targets, the Nasdaq 100 could surpass 27,000 points in 2026, according to analysts.\n4. Silver (XAG/USD)\nDriven by supply shortages and a sharp compression in the gold\u2013silver ratio, silver prices posted outsized gains in 2025, far outpacing gold.\nThe Silver Institute warns of a persistent structural supply deficit in the global silver market, driven by strong industrial demand, a recovery in investment demand, and slowing supply growth. It expects this supply-demand imbalance to persist \u2014 and potentially widen \u2014 in 2026, which would continue to provide supportive fundamentals for silver prices.\nUBS raised its 2026 silver target to USD 58\u20136"

                "body": "Oil prices are limping into the final weeks of 2025 with Brent crude hovering just above $60 a barrel and traders fixated on one word: oversupply. As of Friday, December 12, Brent settled at about $61.12 per barrel and WTI at $57.44, both benchmarks down more than 4% for the week and sitting near their lowest levels in several years. [1]\nAt the same time, big agencies and Wall Street banks are rolling out fresh forecasts that increasingly point to sub\u2011$60 oil in 2026, even as OPEC insists the market will be roughly balanced next year. [2]\nThis article pulls together the latest December 2025 data, forecasts and analysis to sketch out a near\u2011term oil price forecast for December 2025, and what it might mean for 2026.\nWhere oil prices stand in mid\u2011December 2025\n- Spot prices:\n- Year\u2011to\u2011date performance:\nBrent has fallen roughly 18% in 2025 so far, while WTI is down close to 20%, as the market has steadily priced out the war\u2011driven risk premium of the early 2020s and refocused on swelling supply. [5] - Price levels vs recent history:\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that North Sea Dated crude (a physical benchmark related to Brent) averaged about $63.63 per barrel in November, its fifth monthly decline in a row and the longest losing streak in over a decade \u2014 effectively putting prices near four\u2011year lows. [6]\nIn short, December 2025 oil prices are weak, but not collapsing: Brent is holding around the low $60s, yet sentiment is sharply bearish because of what\u2019s happening in supply, demand and inventories.\nWhy the market has turned bearish going into December\n1. A supply surge colliding with only modest demand growth\nThe IEA\u2019s December 2025 Oil Market Report paints a clear picture:\n- Global oil demand is expected to rise by about 830,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and 860,000 bpd in 2026. [7]\n- But global oil supply is set to grow much faster \u2013 roughly 3 million bpd in 2025 and another 2.4 million bpd in 2026, driven heavily by non\u2011OPEC+ producers like the U.S., Brazil and Guyana. [8]\nThat imbalance is now showing up in stockpiles:\n- Observed global oil inventories hit around 8.03 billion barrels in October, the highest in four years, with stock builds averaging 1.2 million bpd in the first ten months of 2025. [9]\n- The IEA estimates the implied surplus at nearly 3.7 million bpd on average from Q4 2025 through 2026 \u2013 an unusually large overhang for this stage of the cycle. [10]\nThat\u2019s why recent IEA forecasts of a glut have become one of the main downward forces on prices this month.\n2. \u201cOil on water\u201d and the emerging \u201csuper glut\u201d narrative\nA big part of the story is where the barrels are sitting. The IEA highlights a surge in oil on water \u2014 crude in transit or temporarily floating \u2014 as sanctioned barrels struggle to find buyers and long\u2011haul shipments from the Americas to Asia jump. [11]\nPrivate\u2011sector and media analysis has picked this up and sharpened it:\n- A widely discussed Financial Times piece cites Trafigura\u2019s chief economist warning of a coming \u201csuper glut\u201d in 2026 as new supply projects ramp up while demand growth softens. He points to new output from Brazil and Guyana, cooling Chinese demand (partly due to EV adoption), and resilient U.S. supply. [12]\n- A detailed WRAL/FinancialContent analysis similarly describes a \u201csuper glut\u201d in crude, with non\u2011OPEC+ supply from the U.S., Brazil, Canada and Guyana consistently outpacing demand, while EV adoption and industrial slowdowns cap consumption. [13]\nTaken together, the narrative going into December is clear: there is simply too much oil around, and it\u2019s increasingly visible in both inventories and shipping data.\n3. Agencies now see lower average prices ahead\nThe latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Short\u2011Term Energy Outlook, released on December 9, 2025, explicitly bakes falling prices into its forecast: [14]\n- The EIA expects global oil inventories to keep rising through 2026, putting continuing downward pressure on prices.\n- It projects Brent cru"

Every year, the global holiday economy depends on a short, unforgiving surge in distillate consumption that powers trucks, ports, warehouses, refrigeration, and backup generation, all under winter operating conditions. That commercially driven holiday cheer strains logistics and exposes how thin the margin has become in some already-tight diesel markets, particularly in Europe.\nAfter crude, diesel is the most economically important fuel in the system, and Christmas is when that reality asserts itself. In the U.S., distillate demand typically rises into December not primarily because of heating, but because freight intensity peaks at the same time inventories are already being seasonally drawn.\nRecent weekly data show U.S. distillate supply running close to 4.0 million barrels per day, near the upper end of the post-pandemic range, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration weekly petroleum status report. Commercial distillate stocks have hovered roughly in the 110- to 115-million-barrel range heading into late December, well below historical averages for early winter, based on EIA inventory data. That leaves little margin for error when logistics volumes increase in the final weeks of the year.\nEurope's position is even tighter.\nSince the loss of Russian diesel flows, the region has become structurally dependent on long-haul imports from the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Middle East, and India. Northwest European gasoil inventories have struggled to rebuild to comfortable levels, a pattern tracked by Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp inventory reporting, and December freight demand reliably erodes whatever buffer exists.\nOn paper, supply appears to be enough, but in reality, the system is sensitive to disruption because replacement barrels travel farther, arrive later, and compete with the same shipping capacity needed to move goods.\nChristmas matters because diesel demand during this period is not responding to price. Parcel delivery, food distribution, cold-chain logistics, and retail restocking all scale simultaneously.\nUnlike gasoline, where weak consumer sentiment can soften demand, diesel consumption in late December is tied to physical throughput. Packages still move even if margins are thin. Missed deliveries turn quickly into lost sales, spoiled inventory, contractual penalties, and reputational damage. The demand is locked in by calendar and contracts, not price.\nThat shows up in crack behavior. In a normal year, diesel cracks widen in the winter as logistics and heating demand overlap.\nIn 2025, the signal has been much noisier. European diesel cracks softened in November amid mild weather and weak industrial activity, a trend flagged in ICE gasoil and ULSD crack spread tracking, yet physical premiums for prompt barrels have remained firm in several regional markets, according to European distillate market assessments. The divergence between paper cracks and physical pricing is exactly the kind of distortion Christmas amplifies, because immediate logistical needs trump macro drivers.\nRefinery behavior also paints a similar picture.\nEvery December, operators would love to have operational flexibility, but holiday logistics force high utilization rates, particularly at distillate-heavy configurations. U.S. Gulf Coast refiners have often run above 90% utilization through late Q4, based on EIA refinery utilization data, prioritizing diesel yields even as gasoline margins slump. That optimization reduces slack in the system. When something goes wrong, weather, equipment failure, or pipeline constraints, there is less room to adjust or draw on inventories.\nExports add even more risk.\nThe U.S. has become Europe's marginal diesel supplier, with distillate exports frequently running around 1.1 to 1.3 million barrels per day, according to EIA export flow data. Those barrels do not stop for Christmas. Any disruption along the export chain during this window, whether it's fog in the Houston Ship Channel to At"

                "source": "ts2.tech",

                "body": "Oil prices are limping into the final weeks of 2025 with Brent crude hovering just above $60 a barrel and traders fixated on one word: oversupply. As of Friday, December 12, Brent settled at about $61.12 per barrel and WTI at $57.44, both benchmarks down more than 4% for the week and sitting near their lowest levels in several years. [1]\nAt the same time, big agencies and Wall Street banks are rolling out fresh forecasts that increasingly point to sub\u2011$60 oil in 2026, even as OPEC insists the market will be roughly balanced next year. [2]\nThis article pulls together the latest December 2025 data, forecasts and analysis to sketch out a near\u2011term oil price forecast for December 2025, and what it might mean for 2026.\nWhere oil prices stand in mid\u2011December 2025\n- Spot prices:\n- Year\u2011to\u2011date performance:\nBrent has fallen roughly 18% in 2025 so far, while WTI is down close to 20%, as the market has steadily priced out the war\u2011driven risk premium of the early 2020s and refocused on swelling supply. [5] - Price levels vs recent history:\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that North Sea Dated crude (a physical benchmark related to Brent) averaged about $63.63 per barrel in November, its fifth monthly decline in a row and the longest losing streak in over a decade \u2014 effectively putting prices near four\u2011year lows. [6]\nIn short, December 2025 oil prices are weak, but not collapsing: Brent is holding around the low $60s, yet sentiment is sharply bearish because of what\u2019s happening in supply, demand and inventories.\nWhy the market has turned bearish going into December\n1. A supply surge colliding with only modest demand growth\nThe IEA\u2019s December 2025 Oil Market Report paints a clear picture:\n- Global oil demand is expected to rise by about 830,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and 860,000 bpd in 2026. [7]\n- But global oil supply is set to grow much faster \u2013 roughly 3 million bpd in 2025 and another 2.4 million bpd in 2026, driven heavily by non\u2011OPEC+ producers like the U.S., Brazil and Guyana. [8]\nThat imbalance is now showing up in stockpiles:\n- Observed global oil inventories hit around 8.03 billion barrels in October, the highest in four years, with stock builds averaging 1.2 million bpd in the first ten months of 2025. [9]\n- The IEA estimates the implied surplus at nearly 3.7 million bpd on average from Q4 2025 through 2026 \u2013 an unusually large overhang for this stage of the cycle. [10]\nThat\u2019s why recent IEA forecasts of a glut have become one of the main downward forces on prices this month.\n2. \u201cOil on water\u201d and the emerging \u201csuper glut\u201d narrative\nA big part of the story is where the barrels are sitting. The IEA highlights a surge in oil on water \u2014 crude in transit or temporarily floating \u2014 as sanctioned barrels struggle to find buyers and long\u2011haul shipments from the Americas to Asia jump. [11]\nPrivate\u2011sector and media analysis has picked this up and sharpened it:\n- A widely discussed Financial Times piece cites Trafigura\u2019s chief economist warning of a coming \u201csuper glut\u201d in 2026 as new supply projects ramp up while demand growth softens. He points to new output from Brazil and Guyana, cooling Chinese demand (partly due to EV adoption), and resilient U.S. supply. [12]\n- A detailed WRAL/FinancialContent analysis similarly describes a \u201csuper glut\u201d in crude, with non\u2011OPEC+ supply from the U.S., Brazil, Canada and Guyana consistently outpacing demand, while EV adoption and industrial slowdowns cap consumption. [13]\nTaken together, the narrative going into December is clear: there is simply too much oil around, and it\u2019s increasingly visible in both inventories and shipping data.\n3. Agencies now see lower average prices ahead\nThe latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Short\u2011Term Energy Outlook, released on December 9, 2025, explicitly bakes falling prices into its forecast: [14]\n- The EIA expects global oil inventories to keep rising through 2026, putting continuing downward pressure on prices.\n- It projects Brent cru"

This was below the forecast increase of 2.5%.\nThe USD/CAD traded near five-month lows, influenced by policy divergence between Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve. Gold retreated from its record highs and traded below $4,500 as profit-taking emerged.\nForex and Cryptocurrency Highlights\nThe EUR/USD struggled to find direction, moving sideways below 1.1800. Meanwhile, GBP/USD remained around 1.3500 amid subdued holiday trading activities.\nBitcoin dropped below $87,000 with intensified ETF outflows, marking a decline in whale participation. Economic forecasts for 2026 suggest potential solid performance in advanced countries.\nAvalanche traded near $12 following a filing by Grayscale to convert its Avalanche Trust into an ETF. Various articles discuss the best brokers for 2025, recommending options for different trading needs and regions.\nInformation on the FXStreet platform aims to be informational and not a recommendation for buying or selling assets. Risks associated with trading must be considered, and FXStreet emphasises that decisions should be made through independent research.\nWith the Tokyo CPI for December coming in below expectations at 2.3%, we see the Bank of Japan\u2019s path to raising interest rates as less certain. This renewed sign of disinflation may delay any policy tightening, suggesting renewed weakness for the Japanese Yen. We should consider using options to position for a higher USD/JPY exchange rate going into the first quarter of 2026.\nEconomic Outlook and Trading Strategies\nThe consistent theme remains the expectation of the Federal Reserve easing its policy, which is weighing on the US Dollar and supporting gold prices. Gold\u2019s recent dip below $4,500 from its all-time highs looks like temporary profit-taking in a thin holiday market. Given that futures markets are pricing in over a 75% chance of a Fed rate cut by March 2026, we view this pullback as an opportunity to buy call options on gold.\nThis dovish Fed outlook, combined with a resilient economy, supports a positive view on US equities for the coming year. The latest economic data from the third quarter of 2025 showed solid GDP growth of 2.1%, reinforcing the \u201csoft landing\u201d narrative that allows for rate cuts. We should look at buying S&P 500 call options expiring in early 2026 to capitalize on this expected market strength.\nFinally, we must acknowledge the extremely low volatility typical of the holiday period. The VIX index is currently trading near its 52-week low, a pattern we also observed in late 2023 and 2024 before activity resumed in January. This presents a cheap opportunity to buy VIX call options or other long-volatility instruments in anticipation of markets returning to full force next month."

Gold (XAU/USD)\nIn 2025, gold prices rose 60% \u2014 the largest annual increase since 1979 \u2014 benefiting from multiple tailwinds: the Fed\u2019s rate cuts, sustained central bank buying, and recurring geopolitical tensions.\nLooking ahead to 2026, the World Gold Council indicates that gold prices are likely to deliver further surprises.

It forecasts a USD 5,000/oz price in 2026.\n2. Bitcoin (BTC/USD)\nIn 2025, Bitcoin prices hit a historical high before retreating, ending the year nearly flat.\nLooking ahead, Standard Chartered revised its Bitcoin price target downward from USD 200,000 to USD 150,000, citing expectations that the crypto treasury firm (Digital Asset Treasury, DAT) will cease bitcoin purchases, though ETF inflows should remain a strong boost.\nBernstein also projects Bitcoin to reach USD 150,000 in 2026 and USD 200,000 in 2027.\nBernstein argues that Bitcoin has broken its four-year cyclical pattern and is now in an elongated bull cycle. Morgan Stanley believes the opposite, warning that the Bitcoin four-year cycle still remains and the bull market is nearing its end.\n3. Nasdaq 100 (NAS100)\nIn 2025, the Nasdaq 100 Index gained 22%, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 18% gain and marking its third consecutive year of growth.\nMost institutions anticipate continued strong U.S. equity performance in 2026, underpinned by persistent AI investment.\nJPMorgan highlights that hyperscale data centre operators \u2014 including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta \u2014 are expected to maintain elevated capital expenditure levels over the coming years, with cumulative spending potentially reaching several hundred billion dollars by 2026. This investment cycle is expected to support key Nasdaq 100 constituents such as NVIDIA, AMD, and Broadcom.\nJPMorgan has outlined upside scenarios for the S&P 500 in which the index could approach the 7,500 level in 2026, while Deutsche Bank has presented more optimistic scenarios pointing toward levels around 8,000 by end-2026, contingent on robust earnings growth and continued AI-driven investment.\nBased on S&P 500 targets, the Nasdaq 100 could surpass 27,000 points in 2026, according to analysts.\n4. Silver (XAG/USD)\nDriven by supply shortages and a sharp compression in the gold\u2013silver ratio, silver prices posted outsized gains in 2025, far outpacing gold.\nThe Silver Institute warns of a persistent structural supply deficit in the global silver market, driven by strong industrial demand, a recovery in investment demand, and slowing supply growth. It expects this supply-demand imbalance to persist \u2014 and potentially widen \u2014 in 2026, which would continue to provide supportive fundamentals for silver prices.\nUBS raised its 2026 silver target to USD 58\u20136"

                "body": "The British Pound (GBP) experienced a decline against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday as reduced market liquidity during the holiday season lent slight support to the Greenback. This movement comes amidst a backdrop of a shortened trading session in the United States, where market activity typically dwindles due to the holiday period. According to analysts at multiple financial institutions, the limited trading volume has contributed to subtle currency fluctuations, impacting the GBP/USD pair.\nThe foreign exchange market saw the British currency retreat slightly as investors grapple with the ongoing implications of economic data releases and monetary policy signals. The US Dollar\u2019s mild appreciation can be attributed to several factors, including a general tendency for the currency to strengthen in lower liquidity environments. Financial experts from prominent banks have noted that in thin markets, currencies such as the USD often gain traction, as participants seek refuge in perceived safer assets.\nThroughout the holiday season, market participants are focusing on macroeconomic indicators and central bank announcements that could influence future currency movements. Recently, the Federal Reserve\u2019s stance on interest rates and economic projections has been a focal point for traders, as they evaluate the potential impact on the USD. Federal Reserve officials have indicated in recent statements that monetary policy will remain data-dependent, maintaining a watchful eye on inflation and employment statistics.\nIn contrast, the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy direction remains under scrutiny, as the UK economy grapples with the aftermath of various economic challenges, including post-Brexit adjustments and inflationary pressures. The divergence in central bank strategies between the UK and the US has added complexity to the outlook for the GBP/USD exchange rate. Analysts suggest that any shifts in interest rate expectations or economic forecasts from the Bank of England could influence the Pound\u2019s trajectory against the Dollar.\nAmid these dynamics, the forex market also contends with geopolitical developments and their potential repercussions on currency valuations. The interplay of global economic factors and central bank policies will likely continue to shape the trading environment in the coming weeks, with the GBP/USD pair remaining sensitive to external influences.\nThe subdued trading conditions characteristic of the holiday period are expected to persist in the short term, with market participants anticipating a return to normalcy as the new year approaches. In the meantime, forex traders may exercise caution, opting for strategic positioning as they await further economic data releases and policy updates.\nLooking ahead, the British Pound\u2019s performance will be closely watched in the context of upcoming economic reports and any central bank communications. As the holiday season concludes, market activity is anticipated to gain momentum, potentially leading to more pronounced currency movements. Analysts will be closely monitoring developments in the UK and US economies, as well as any shifts in monetary policy stances that could influence the forex market landscape.\nIn conclusion, the GBP/USD exchange rate\u2019s recent fluctuations underscore the complexities of trading in a low liquidity environment, with both currencies reacting to prevailing economic conditions and central bank actions. As such, forex market participants will remain vigilant, monitoring key indicators that could signal shifts in the currency pair\u2019s direction. The situation remains fluid, and market dynamics could evolve rapidly as economic and geopolitical factors come into sharper focus.\nGet the latest Crypto & Blockchain News in your inbox."

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast: Sterling Defends $1.35 as Dollar Index Loses Momentum\nGBP/USD hovers near $1.3501 with DXY at 97.95, Fed 2026 cuts priced in, 4.3% US growth and UK inflation near 3.2% guiding the next move toward $1.3580 | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Price Forecast: Sterling Holds Above $1.35 While Dollar Index Stalls Near 97.95\nGBP/USD and DXY: Diverging Channels Define the Current Price Landscape\nGBP/USD is trading around $1.3501, holding Wednesday\u2019s close into the December 25 holiday and preserving a clean ascending channel that has guided the uptrend since late November. At the same time, the US Dollar Index near 97.95 remains trapped in a descending channel that has capped every bounce since mid-November. DXY is trading below both the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, with former support near 98.10 now acting as resistance and repeatedly attracting sellers on pushes back into that zone. This split structure\u2014bullish GBP/USD, bearish DXY\u2014tilts the balance in favour of further sterling strength as long as the pair stays above $1.3470\u2013$1.3480 and comfortably above the rising 200-EMA near $1.3330.\nGBP/USD Intraday Trend: Shallow Pullbacks Inside an Ascending Channel\nOn the 2-hour chart, the latest pullback from the $1.3535\u2013$1.3540 area has been shallow, with small-bodied candles and limited downside follow-through that signal consolidation rather than distribution. GBP/USD continues to trade above the 50-EMA, while the 200-EMA trends higher below $1.3330, confirming a persistent bullish bias. The prior resistance band at $1.3470\u2013$1.3480 has flipped into short-term support, and RSI has eased from overbought readings near 70 toward roughly 55, indicating cooling momentum but no bearish reversal. That combination favours dip-buying around $1.3475 with upside scope toward $1.3580 initially, provided the dollar remains capped.\nGBP/USD Recovery Path: From Low $1.30s to the Mid-$1.35 Zone\nOn a broader horizon, GBP/USD has staged a controlled recovery from the low-$1.30s seen in the autumn. Monthly averages near 1.3149 in November and spot levels around 1.3344 heading into Christmas have now given way to prints around $1.3501 on the short-term charts. This stepwise climb reflects a re-pricing of both UK and US monetary policy rather than a one-off squeeze. Earlier in the quarter, the pair was closer to $1.24 as traders discounted the UK\u2019s growth outlook and worried about entrenched inflation. The shift into the mid-$1.30s shows that sterling has been re-rated upward against a dollar now priced for easing rather than further aggressive tightening.\nUSD Backdrop: DXY at 97.95 as Fed Easing in 2026 Caps Dollar Upside\nThe US Dollar Index hovering near 97.95 is constrained by expectations for roughly two Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026. This is happening even after yields rebounded, with the 2-year Treasury around 3.53% and the 10-year near 4.16%. Markets are effectively signalling that while US growth is resilient, the tightening cycle is mature and the next major step is lower, not higher, for policy rates. That outlook caps sustained strength in USD and supports higher-beta crosses like GBP/USD, where investors are more willing to rotate out of dollar cash into currencies offering better carry and mean-reversion potential after deep underperformance.\nUSD Data vs USD Price: 4.3% GDP and 2.9% Core PCE Without a Fresh Dollar Squeeze\nRecent US macro data remain strong but no longer deliver the same upside shock for the USD. Preliminary Q3 GDP printed at 4.3% annualized, while core PCE rose 2.9% quarter-on-quarter, roughly matching expectations and staying above but not breaking away from the Fed\u2019s target. Non-farm payrolls have continued to show solid job creation. This combination justifies a cautious Fed but does not revive the inflation panic that underpinned the prior dollar bull run. For GBP/USD, that means the dollar can stay supported, yet the impulse for a renewed broad USD surge is absent, leaving room for sterling to extend gains i"

                "body": "Cooling Japanese inflation indicators sent USD/JPY higher on Friday, December 26, countering Japanese government efforts to strengthen the yen through intervention warnings.\nHeadline inflation dropped to the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target, supporting a lower neutral interest rate and fewer rate hikes to achieve policy normalization. The softer inflation numbers come after Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama warned of yen interventions earlier this week. A more dovish BoJ on cooling inflation will increase the threat of a yen intervention, capping USD/JPY gains.\nCooling Japanese inflation and fading bets on a March Fed rate cut challenged the bearish medium- to longer-term outlook for USD/JPY. Nevertheless, monetary policy divergence continues to favor the yen, given the prospect of an incoming Fed Chair favoring lower rates.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nTokyo\u2019s annual inflation rate fell from 2.7% in November to 2.0% in December, while the so-called core-core inflation rate eased to 2.6% (November: 2.8%). Despite headline inflation dropping to the BoJ\u2019s 2% target, the more influential core-core inflation rate remained above the target, supporting further rate hikes.\nHowever, the lower inflation rate suggested fewer rate hikes to achieve price stability, aligning with last week\u2019s dovish rate hike. USD/JPY reacted to the inflation numbers, rising from 155.751 to a post-data high of 156.271.\nDecember\u2019s inflation data was the key USD/JPY driver in early trading on Friday. Meanwhile, consumer spending cooled in November, supporting a softer national inflation outlook. Retail sales increased 1% year-on-year in November, down from 1.7% in October.\nCrucially, a pullback in spending will also dampen economic momentum, given that private consumption contributes roughly 55% to Japan\u2019s GDP.\nWhile inflation and retail sales data weakened demand for the yen, labor market data limited the pullback. Japan\u2019s unemployment rate remained steady at 2.6% in November, supporting higher wages. An upswing in wages could boost consumer spending and fuel demand-driven inflation.\nHowever, policymakers would need to see higher wages translate into consumption to raise rates further. While a more dovish BoJ rate path would weaken the yen and send USD/JPY higher, government yen intervention threats would continue to push the pair lower, supporting the cautiously bearish short- to medium-term USD/JPY price outlook.\nFor the short-term, USD/JPY trends will hinge on the Japanese government\u2019s pain threshold for yen weakness, currently at 158, given the recent communication. With USD/JPY sitting around the 156 level, the pair would likely return to 157 before another pullback to 155 levels, given recent price trends. On this basis, the short-term outlook remains cautiously bearish.\nWhile USD/JPY advanced on softer retail sales and inflation data, Fed chatter will influence US dollar demand later on Friday.\nThis week\u2019s US GDP and deflator price data tempered bets on a March Fed rate cut, strengthening the US dollar. However, a cooling labor market and November\u2019s CPI report continue to support further Fed rate cuts, signaling a bearish short- to medium-term USD/JPY price outlook.\nDovish Fed rhetoric would revive expectations of a March rate cut, weighing on the US dollar.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a March Fed rate cut fell from 58.3% on December 19 to 47.0% on December 26. The sharp drop reflected the influence of the Q3 US GDP report on sentiment.\nWith markets monitoring technical indicators and fundamentals, they will provide crucial insights into potential USD/JPY price trends.\nLooking at the daily chart, USD/JPY traded above its 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), indicating a bullish bias. While technicals remained bullish, fundamentals are increasingly outweighing the technical structure, suggesting a bearish outlook.\nA"

                "body": "(Dec 26): The bearish chorus on the yen is growing louder after the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BOJ) latest interest rate hike failed to deliver a sustained lift to the currency, reinforcing views that there\u2019s no quick fix for its structural weakness.\nStrategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co, BNP Paribas SA and other firms see the yen weakening to 160 per dollar or beyond by the end of 2026, driven by still-wide US-Japan yield gaps, negative real rates and persistent capital outflows. The trend will likely persist as long as the BOJ tightens only gradually and fiscal-driven inflation risks linger, they say.\nThis year the yen eked out a small gain of less than 1% against the greenback after four straight years of declines, as a hoped-for turnaround on the back of BOJ rate hikes and Federal Reserve cuts proved underwhelming. The currency briefly strengthened past 140 per dollar in April before losing momentum amid uncertainty over US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies and rising fiscal risks tied to political shifts in Japan. It\u2019s now trading around 155.70, not far from this year\u2019s low of 158.87 \u2014 around where it began the year in January.\n\u201cThe yen\u2019s fundamentals are quite weak, and that should not be changing much going into next year,\u201d said Junya Tanase, chief Japan FX strategist at JPMorgan, who holds the most bearish end-2026 dollar-yen forecast on Wall Street at 164. He said cyclical forces could turn more yen-negative next year, limiting the impact of BOJ tightening as markets price in higher rates elsewhere.\nOvernight index swaps show the next BOJ rate hike isn\u2019t fully priced in until September, while inflation remains above the central bank\u2019s 2% target, adding pressure on Japanese government bonds.\nCarry trades have also re-emerged as a headwind. The popular strategy of borrowing the low-yielding yen to invest in high-yielders such as the Brazilian real or Turkish lira has made it harder for the Japanese currency to rebound. Leveraged funds were the most bearish on the yen since July 2024 in the week through Dec 9, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, and largely maintained those positions in the following week.\nGlobal macro conditions next year should be \u201crelatively supportive for risk sentiment, and typically in that environment that we think would benefit carry strategies,\u201d said Parisha Saimbi, EM Asia FX and rates strategist at BNP Paribas, who expects the dollar-yen to rise to 160 by the end of 2026. Resilient carry demand, a cautious BOJ and a potentially more hawkish-than-expected Fed could keep the pair elevated, she added.\nJapan\u2019s outbound investment flows remain another source of pressure. Retail investors\u2019 net purchases of overseas stocks via investment trusts have hovered near last year\u2019s decade-high of \u00a59.4 trillion (US$60 billion or RM240 billion), underscoring households\u2019 continued preference for foreign assets \u2014 a trend analysts say could persist into 2026 and weigh on the yen.\nCorporate outflows may be an even more durable driver. Japan\u2019s outward foreign direct investment has continued at a steady pace in recent years, largely unaffected by cyclical factors or rate differentials, BofA Securities chief Japan FX and rates strategist Shusuke Yamada wrote in a note earlier this month. In particular, outward M&A volumes by Japanese firms have hit multi-year highs this year, he wrote.\n\u201cThe weak yen situation hasn\u2019t changed at all. The key point is that the BOJ isn\u2019t hiking rates aggressively, and real interest rates remain deeply negative,\u201d said Tohru Sasaki, chief strategist at Fukuoka Financial Group Inc, who sees the dollar-yen pair reaching 165 by end-2026. \u201cI think the Fed is pretty much done with rate cuts. If the market starts pricing that in, it would become another factor pushing up dollar-yen.\u201d\nStill, some yen watchers remain convinced that the currency will appreciate over the longer term as the BOJ continues to normalise its policy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc sees the yen eventually strengthen"

Tokyo\u2019s headline inflation rate fell to the BoJ\u2019s 2% target, indicating a lower Bank of Japan neutral interest rate. The yen weakened on the day, sending USD/JPY higher, fueling yen carry trades into US dollar assets.\nUS stock futures were steady in morning trading, with a less hawkish BoJ policy stance supporting a bullish price outlook.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the key technical levels traders should watch.\nTokyo\u2019s annual inflation rate fell from 2.8% in November to 2.0% in December, dropping to the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. However, the more influential and so-called core-core inflation rate eased to 2.6%, holding well above the 2% target. Nevertheless, softer core-core inflation and the sharp drop in headline inflation eased BoJ rate hike bets, weighing on the yen.\n10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields fell in the morning session, sending USD/JPY up 0.22% to 156.231. A weaker yen boosts yen carry trades into risk assets. The Nikkei 225 rallied 1.01%, lifting sentiment. A less hawkish BoJ rate path supports a bullish short- to medium-term outlook for US equity futures.\nUS futures saw mixed performances during the Asian morning session on Friday, December 26. The Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini gained 18 points and 1 point, respectively, while the Dow Jones E-mini slipped 18 points.\nLater on Friday, Fed speakers will fuel speculation about a March Fed rate cut amid renewed demand for AI-linked stocks.\nGrowing calls for a March Fed rate cut to bolster the US labor market after softer US inflation would raise bets on a March rate cut. A more dovish policy outlook would signal lower borrowing costs and rising profits, boosting demand for high-capex company stocks.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a March Fed rate cut dropped from 48.7% on December 24 to 47.8% on December 26. However, hopes for a new Fed Chair favoring lower interest rates support a more dovish rate path.\nThe current market dynamics have fueled demand for US stock futures, eyeing a six-day winning streaks, on December 26. Notably, the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini climbed to new all-time highs in morning trading, underscoring the bullish sentiment.\nThe five-day winning streak through to Wednesday, December 24, left the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini trading above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs signaled a positive short- to medium-term bias, aligning with the constructive outlook.\nNear-term trends will hinge on US data, Fed rhetoric, and Bank of Japan forward guidance. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term outlook remains bullish given the alignment of fundamentals and technical indicators. Meanwhile, expectations of an incoming Fed Chair supporting loose monetary policy reinforce the positive medium-term outlook.\nThis week, US President Trump posted on the Truth Social platform:\n\u201cI want my new Fed Chairman to lower interest rates if the market is doing well, not destroy the market for no reason whatsoever. [\u2026] The United States should be rewarded for SUCCESS, not brought down by it. Anybody that disagrees with me will never be the Fed Chairman!\u201d\nNevertheless, several scenarios would likely unravel the positive medium-term outlook, including:\nIn summary, a strong US economy, expectations of further rate cuts, the AI race, and a less hawkish BoJ reinforce the bullish short- to medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nMeanwhile, traders should closely monitor USD/JPY trends, yen intervention warnings, and the Nikkei 225. Intervention threats and hawkish BoJ rhetoric could drive JGB yields higher and USD/JPY lower, challenging the constructive bias.\nThis week, Japan\u2019s Fin"

                "body": "Bitcoin drives record spike in SEC filings in 2025 as regulatory clarity pulls institutions onchain\nQuick Take\n- The filing surge coincided with meaningful legislative progress that provided clearer operational frameworks for market participants.\n- The following is excerpted from The Block\u2019s Data and Insights newsletter.\nThe volume of blockchain-related mentions in SEC filings surged throughout 2025, reaching approximately 8,000 mentions by August and maintaining elevated levels through November.\nBitcoin-related mentions have dominated the increase, accounting for the largest share of filing activity. This concentration reflects the proliferation of spot Bitcoin ETF filings and amendments following the successful launch of multiple products in early 2024, as traditional asset managers continued to expand their cryptocurrency offerings throughout 2025.\nThe sustained elevation in Bitcoin mentions contrasts with more cyclical patterns seen in categories like ICOs and general cryptocurrency references, suggesting institutional focus has coalesced around Bitcoin as the primary regulatory pathway for traditional finance entry.\nThe filing surge coincided with meaningful legislative progress that provided clearer operational frameworks for market participants.\nThe GENIUS Act was a key piece of legislation in the U.S. that established comprehensive stablecoin regulation in early 2025. The Act detailed 100% reserve backing requirements, strict AML compliance, monthly disclosures, and dual regulatory pathways through federal oversight for larger issuers and state options for those under $10 billion.\nFollowing this, the House passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act in July, building on the FIT21 framework from 2024 to establish broader market structure guidelines. These legislative developments have created more predictable compliance pathways, encouraging firms to formalize their operations through proper registration.\nThis is an excerpt from The Block's Data & Insights newsletter.

                "body": "The crypto world is buzzing with the news of Nasdaq's proposed Bitcoin Index Options. This could be a game changer for businesses looking to adopt a crypto business payout system. With the SEC's decision just around the corner, we might soon see better regulatory clarity and increased investor confidence. Let's take a look at how this could impact crypto-friendly businesses and the potential hurdles they might face in this rapidly evolving landscape.\nNasdaq's Venture into Crypto\nAs cryptocurrencies continue to reshape the financial landscape, Nasdaq has chosen to dip its toes into this water. Their proposed Bitcoin Index Options signal a growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems. This could mean a lot for those considering crypto payroll.\nBitcoin's Market Resilience\nBitcoin continues to be the king of cryptocurrencies, having shown remarkable growth since its inception. As more players recognize its potential, the demand for Bitcoin-related financial products has skyrocketed. Nasdaq's Bitcoin Index Options aim to cater to this demand, providing a structured way to trade Bitcoin derivatives. If approved by the SEC, this could invigorate market activity and further entrench Bitcoin in the financial ecosystem.\nBitcoin Index Options: What They Are\nSo what are these Bitcoin Index Options? They're financial derivatives that let investors speculate on Bitcoin's future price. By tracking the BTC price, these options allow for hedging against market swings. If the SEC gives the green light, it could pave the way for more Bitcoin options and potentially stimulate market innovation. This clarity would be vital for businesses thinking about crypto payroll, as it would set the compliance standards they need to follow.\nCompliance in Crypto Payroll\nIntegrating cryptocurrency payments into payroll systems isn't without its challenges. Crypto payroll compliance is no joke; it\u2019s a labyrinth of taxes, anti-money laundering (AML) rules, and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Companies must walk a fine line, adhering to local laws while trying to capitalize on the advantages of digital payments. Nasdaq's Bitcoin Index Options approval could provide a clearer compliance framework, making it easier for businesses to adopt crypto payroll systems.\nSolutions for Crypto-Friendly SMEs\nFor crypto-friendly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), there are ways to tackle the regulatory challenges that Nasdaq's Index Options bring. Here are a few potential approaches:\n- Approved ETPs and Options: Consider offering clients exposure to Bitcoin via exchange-traded products (ETPs) that don't require direct custody.\n- Adopting In-Kind Mechanisms: Partner with ETP issuers to utilize in-kind processes, which could lower costs and enhance liquidity.\n- Generic Standards: Develop hybrid products under streamlined rules to meet regulatory requirements while driving innovation.\n- Compliance Tech: Use blockchain analytics for AML/KYC compliance to stay aligned with regulations.\nThese strategies could help SMEs minimize their regulatory exposure while still being in line with SEC-approved channels.\nOpportunities and Challenges Ahead\nThe rise of crypto payroll systems opens up opportunities for global crypto business banking. As businesses aim to integrate cryptocurrency into their operations, the demand for crypto-friendly banks and payment platforms is surging. Yet, navigating the diverse regulatory environments across jurisdictions poses a challenge. Staying informed about local regulations will be crucial for success in this dynamic market.\nSummary: A Bright Yet Complex Future\nThe SEC's decision on Nasdaq's Bitcoin Index Options could significantly shape the future of cryptocurrency in business, especially concerning payroll systems. This move might provide the regulatory clarity and investor confidence needed for broader adoption of digital assets in financial transactions. As businesses tackle the complexities of c"

                "body": "Is Bitcoin a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2026?\nKey Points\nBitcoin's four-year halving cycle no longer drives prices the way it used to, because institutional buyers and ETFs have changed the game.\nStrategy, Tesla, and 10 other companies have each converted at least $1 billion into Bitcoin on their balance sheets.\nA 5% to 10% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin may be reasonable for long-term investors who can stomach the volatility.\nIf technical analysis were an exact science, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) would be soaring right now. However, the charts forgot to check the news. More importantly, they forgot that the structure of the whole crypto market fundamentally changed in 2024 and 2025.\nThe four-year cycle isn't broken. It's either retired or on vacation.\nVanEck and 21Shares analysts recently published fresh overviews of the broader crypto market and the specific Bitcoin situation.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\nBoth firms are basically saying the same thing: The four-year Bitcoin halving cycle still matters symbolically, but it's no longer the engine that drives crypto prices higher over time.\nA few themes stood out in their reports:\nBitcoin's annual issuance is now below 1% -- less than gold's inflation rate. That's a nice, symbolic milestone, but also a sign that the upcoming halvings will carry less power. Each halving cuts the mining rewards by less, because there's less left to cut. That's just mathematics.\nThe buyers have changed. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate treasuries, and sovereign governments absorbed more than the total number of mined Bitcoins in 2025. This is patient, sticky capital setting up shop -- not retail FOMO-chasers looking at charting indicators.\nBitcoin's volatility is compressing. The recent drawdowns stopped at 30%, compared to 60% wipeouts (and more) in the first three cycles. Bitcoin is launching fewer moonshots, but fewer face-melting crashes too. In other words, it's starting to behave like a mature financial asset, earning its \"digital gold\" moniker.\nBitcoin's bull case\nCrypto isn't just for enthusiasts anymore. Deep-pocketed investors are building large Bitcoin positions, led by Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) and its 671,268 coins. At today's prices, that's a $58.9 billion Bitcoin portfolio.\nEleven other companies have converted at least $1 billion of cash into Bitcoin on their balance sheets, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. The list includes Bitcoin miners like MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms, but also Elon Musk's Tesla and the Trump Media & Technology Group.\nTraditional banks and financial services are still nowhere to be found among the 100 largest Bitcoin holders, but 2026 could change that. With easy access to spot Bitcoin ETFs, cash managers can add Bitcoin exposure to their balance sheets through ordinary stock-trading channels.\nAccording to 21Shares, about 7% of the Bitcoins in circulation already sit in ETF portfolios. That ratio should increase in the coming years, as massive investment services like Morgan Stanley are allowed to recommend Bitcoin funds.\nAnd let's not forget about Bitcoin's potential as a hedge against macroeconomic jitters. As of Dec. 23, gold prices are up by 71% year to date, far outpacing a 16% gain for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index. Investors are starving for safe havens. If Bitcoin can connect to just a small slice of that gigantic market, it would chip away at the glittery metal's $31 trillion of total market value.\nThe charts from earlier halving periods couldn't predict any of this, because the market dynamics have changed with ETFs and institutional investors at the table. Things really are different this time.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nBitcoin's bear case\nIt's not all moonshots and rainbows, of course.\nThe institutional investor activity also brings some drawbacks.

                "body": "BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR) is heading into the post\u2011Christmas trading session with one dominating narrative: it\u2019s being priced and traded as a high\u2011beta public\u2011market proxy for Ethereum\u2014and the company\u2019s latest disclosures show it has now crossed 4 million ETH in holdings.\nU.S. markets were closed on Thursday, Dec. 25 (Christmas Day), and the last session before the holiday was Wednesday, Dec. 24, which ended early at 1:00 p.m. ET. BMNR closed that session at $29.35. [1]\nBelow is what matters most for investors watching BMNR ahead of the Friday, Dec. 26, 2025 open (9:30 a.m. ET / 14:30 UTC).\n1) BMNR\u2019s \u201cbig number\u201d update: ETH holdings now exceed 4.06 million tokens\nIn a company update dated Dec. 22, 2025, BitMine said that as of Dec. 21 at 3:00 p.m. ET, it held:\n- 4,066,062 ETH, valued using a quoted ETH price of $2,991\n- 193 BTC\n- $1.0 billion in cash\n- A $32 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS), described as \u201cmoonshots\u201d\nBitMine framed the combined total of \u201ccrypto + total cash + moonshots\u201d as $13.2 billion. [2]\nThe company also said this ETH position represents 3.37% of Ethereum\u2019s supply (citing 120.7 million ETH supply) and reiterated its longer\u2011term goal of reaching 5% (\u201cAlchemy of 5%\u201d). [3]\nWhy this matters for Friday\u2019s open: BMNR\u2019s perceived \u201ctreasury NAV\u201d changes with ETH\u2019s price, and the stock can react sharply even when there\u2019s no traditional operating news\u2014especially after a holiday closure when crypto trades 24/7.\n(For reference, ETH was around $3,036.77 at the time of the latest available pricing in this dataset.)\n2) Week\u2011over\u2011week: the company highlighted aggressive ETH accumulation\nJust one week earlier, in a Dec. 15, 2025 SEC\u2011filed release, BitMine reported:\n- 3,967,210 ETH as of Dec. 14 at 6:00 p.m. ET, citing ETH at $3,074\n- The same 193 BTC\n- $1.0 billion in cash\n- A $38 million Eightco stake at that time\nBitMine said it had added 102,259 ETH in the past week (as of that release). [4]\nBetween those two company updates, BitMine is presenting a strategy of repeated capital deployment into ETH, with holdings updates effectively acting as recurring catalysts.\n3) The next major catalyst is not crypto\u2014it\u2019s governance (and potential dilution)\nAnnual meeting: Jan. 15, 2026 (Las Vegas)\nBitMine has set its annual stockholders meeting for Jan. 15, 2026 at the Wynn Las Vegas, and it\u2019s not a routine meeting. The agenda includes votes on:\n- Electing eight directors\n- A charter amendment to increase authorized common shares\n- A 2025 Omnibus Incentive Plan\n- A non\u2011binding advisory vote on a special performance\u2011based compensation arrangement for Executive Chairman Thomas J. Lee [5]\nThe headline issue: authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion\nIn its proxy statement, BitMine disclosed the board approved a charter amendment to raise authorized common stock from 500,000,000 shares to 50,000,000,000 shares. [6]\nBitMine also spelled out what that means in plain English:\n- If approved, the board would be able to issue additional shares in its discretion without further stockholder approval (unless required by law/exchange rules).\n- The company cited flexibility for strategic transactions and equity capital raises, and noted it has an at\u2011the\u2011market (ATM) offering program in place.\n- It explicitly warned that issuing additional shares may be dilutive and could pressure the stock price; it also acknowledged the authorization could make hostile takeovers more difficult (even if not intended as an anti\u2011takeover device). [7]\nWhy this matters before the bell: in a treasury\u2011style model, dilution isn\u2019t hypothetical. Share issuance is often the mechanism used to buy more crypto. Traders may treat any new proxy chatter, voting sentiment, or issuance signals as near\u2011term price drivers.\n4) Tom Lee\u2019s proposed Executive Chairman package is unusually large\u2014and highly structured\nBitMine is asking shareholders to approve a \u201cspecial, multi\u2011year, performance\u2011based compensation arrangement\u201d tied to Tho"

Solana (SOL), a blockchain platform known for its lightning-fast transactions and scalable infrastructure, is quietly positioning itself as a top contender for explosive growth. As of December 26, 2025, Solana is trading at $120.81, down slightly by 1.35% in the last 24 hours, but this dip could be the perfect entry point for savvy investors. With the broader crypto market showing signs of extreme fear\u2014evidenced by the Fear & Greed Index at a chilling 20\u2014the stage is set for contrarian plays that could yield massive returns. Why does this matter to you? Whether you're a seasoned trader or a curious newcomer, understanding Solana\u2019s potential now could mean the difference between missing out and securing a transformative investment by 2025.\nThe cryptocurrency market is a rollercoaster right now, and Solana is riding the waves with a unique blend of resilience and promise. As of late December 2025, the total crypto market cap stands at an impressive $3.03 trillion, with Bitcoin and Ethereum holding dominant shares at 57.60% and 11.64%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. Solana, ranked #7 among cryptocurrencies, has managed to maintain a competitive edge despite a minor 24-hour price drop to $120.81. This slight decline contrasts with steeper falls in peers like Cardano (-3.28%) and Polkadot (-3.17%), hinting at Solana\u2019s relative stability.\nWhat\u2019s driving this dynamic? Recent network activity shows Solana\u2019s ecosystem buzzing with new decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects, reinforcing its appeal. Moreover, whispers of upcoming network upgrades are fueling speculation of a price rebound. For investors, this moment\u2014marked by market fear\u2014could be a rare chance to buy low before the next bull run.\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase: Solana\u2019s current price point and market conditions scream opportunity. When the Fear & Greed Index hits a low of 20, as it does now per Alternative.me, history suggests we\u2019re nearing a bottom\u2014a prime time for contrarian investors to strike. Solana\u2019s fundamentals, from its high-speed transactions to low fees, make it a standout in a crowded field. If you\u2019re looking to diversify your portfolio or dip your toes into crypto, now might be the time to act with a platform that supports strategic trades\u2014consider exploring options to start trading with a trusted provider.\nBut it\u2019s not just about timing. Solana offers a long-term value proposition. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of Ethereum\u2019s cost positions it as a go-to for developers and institutions alike. For retail investors, this could translate into significant gains if adoption continues to surge.\nTo truly grasp Solana\u2019s potential, we need to rewind a bit. Launched in 2020, Solana emerged as a solution to the scalability issues plaguing older blockchains like Ethereum. Its unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism allows for timestamped transactions, enabling unparalleled speed\u2014up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) compared to Ethereum\u2019s 15-30 TPS before upgrades, as per CoinGecko data. This technological edge has attracted a flood of developers building everything from NFT marketplaces to DeFi protocols on Solana\u2019s network.\nFast forward to December 2025, and the broader market tells a story of caution. Global economic uncertainty, potential regulatory crackdowns, and inflation concerns have pushed crypto sentiment into \u201cextreme fear\u201d territory. Yet, this fear often precedes recovery.

                "body": "Interested in adding Solana (SOL) tokens to your crypto portfolio? With multiple options available, including crypto exchanges and Web3 wallets, choosing the right platform to purchase SOL can be challenging.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll dig deeper into how to buy SOL on centralized and decentralized exchanges. We\u2019ll also walk you through the key factors to consider before purchasing SOL.\nWhere to Buy Solana (SOL) in 2025?\nThe best way to buy Solana is through a reputable centralized exchange such as Coinbase or Kraken, especially for beginners. For seasoned investors who prioritize enhanced privacy, anonymity, and automation, decentralized exchanges like PumpSwap and Raydium are better.\nCentralized Exchanges (CEXs)\nCentralized exchanges are online marketplaces that enable you to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Owned and controlled by a single entity/organization, CEXs act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers.\nMost top-ranked CEXs support major cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL). They also allow you to trade Solana derivatives, stake SOL, and buy/sell Solana-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Additionally, they offer user-friendly interfaces, a wide selection of SOL pairs, competitive fee structures, and robust security measures. Some popular CEXs that you can consider for buying Solana (SOL) are Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, and Kraken.\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEXs)\nIf you\u2019re an advanced trader, you can use a decentralized exchange to buy SOL. They\u2019re P2P platforms that enable you to trade cryptocurrencies by simply connecting a supported wallet.\nThese decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are built on blockchain networks, such as Solana or Ethereum. They\u2019re censorship-resistant, non-custodial, and no-KYC platforms, fostering greater privacy and anonymity. Most importantly, DEXs use smart contracts to automate P2P interactions. They can be broadly classified into automated market makers (AMMs), aggregators, and order books.\nHowever, decentralized exchanges support only crypto-for-crypto conversions. Thus, you may find them unsuitable if you want to purchase Solana using fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Well-known DEXs you can explore for buying Solana are Meteora, Orca, and Manifest.\nHow to Buy Solana on a Centralized Exchange?\nStep 1: Select a Crypto Exchange\nBased on your preferences, shortlist multiple exchanges. Assess each platform by various parameters, especially reputation, products and services, fees, security, and ease of use. After thorough research, choose a secure platform that aligns with your investment objectives and needs.\nStep 2: Sign up and complete KYC verification\nVisit the official website of the chosen exchange or download its mobile application from the App/Google Play Store. Depending on the available sign-up options, create an account using your e-mail, phone number, Google ID, or Apple ID. Fill out basic details like name, location, etc., and set up a secure password. If you have a referral code, input the code in the \u201cInvite code\u201d field to get exclusive perks.\nOnce registered, verify your identity by completing the know-your-customer (KYC) process. To do so, upload a government-authorized identity and address proof, such as a passport or driver\u2019s license. You also need to submit a selfie to complete facial recognition. After the exchange reviews and approves your KYC documents, you\u2019re ready to make your first purchase.\nStep 3: Choose Your Payment Method\nBuy Solana with a Debit Card\n- Click on the \u201cBuy Crypto\u201d tab on the main menu.\n- Specify the fiat currency (e.g., EUR, GBP) and how much SOL you want to purchase in the \u201cSpend\u201d field.\n- Select SOL in the \u201cReceive\u201d field. The exchange\u2019s mobile app or web interface automatically converts your fiat amount into equivalent Solana.\n- Choose the \u201cCard\u201d option in the payment method field. Some platforms may show credit and debit card options separately.\n- Click the \u201cAdd New Card\u201d tab and enter your card details.\n- Once done, execute the Solana p"

American Express has outperformed the S&P 500 every year since 2021. Which is impressive, considering that period of market gains has been driven largely by tech-focused growth companies and artificial intelligence stocks.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nHere's why American Express has what it takes to beat the S&P 500 and the Dow for years to come.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAmerican Express's advantages are on full display\nAmerican Express issues its own credit cards, offers charge cards and personal loans, and collects processing fees. This is a drastically different business model from Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), which are pure-play payment processors. Visa and Mastercard are less risky because they work with banks and financial institutions to issue cards. However, American Express has more growth potential, which was showcased in its latest quarter.\nAmerican Express's revenue net of interest expense rose by 11%, diluted earnings per share by 19%, and it reduced its share count by 2% compared to the third quarter of 2024. American Express raised its full-year 2025 forecast, with revenue growth of 9% to 10% and earnings per share of $15.20 to $15.50 compared to adjusted EPS of $13.35 in 2024. That's earnings growth of about 15% -- which would be a fantastic year for American Express.\nAmerican Express cardholder spending is rising\nPerhaps the most important metric from the third-quarter 2025 report was an 8% foreign exchange-adjusted increase in card member spending. On the earnings call, American Express Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri attributed the uptick in cardmember spending to strong retail engagement and a rebound in travel. He also said that the company's credit performance continued to be excellent -- showcasing its ability to manage risk with low net write-off rates.\nDuring the quarter, American Express launched its refreshed Platinum cards for U.S. consumers and businesses. The cards include higher fees but more perks, which can be a win-win for American Express and its card members. Squeri said the following on the earnings call:\nI'm very pleased to say that the initial customer demand and engagement are exceeding our expectations. In fact, while it's still early, this is the strongest start we've seen for a U.S. Platinum card refresh. Before I get into more details on Platinum, I want to provide some context. We are fortunate to have a global premium customer base that is unmatched in the industry, and our goal is to provide our customers with the best experience in the industry.\nThe solid increase in card member spending, paired with the successful launch of the new Platinum card, showcases American Express's advantages in today's bifurcated economy. Broadly speaking, consumer spending on discretionary goods and services, and even staples, is under pressure from relatively high interest rates and rising living costs.\nBy catering to an affluent consumer base and charging high card fees, American Express's customer base isn't as stressed by the rising cost of living. In fact, the upticks in spending may be partly due to higher asset prices, from stocks to real estate and gold. So, even though high interest rates and home prices hav"

                "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 Dec. 25, 2025 (10:18 a.m. ET) \u2014 The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is effectively on pause today, holding at its latest record close of 48,731.16, because U.S. stock markets are closed for Christmas Day. The Dow last traded during Wednesday\u2019s holiday-shortened Christmas Eve session, when it climbed 288.75 points (+0.6%) to finish at that all-time closing high. [1]\nWith the NYSE and Nasdaq shut and much of global trading running on holiday staffing, today\u2019s Dow \u201cmove\u201d is less about price action and more about positioning, narratives, and what could drive the next leg when cash markets reopen. [2]\nWhy the Dow set a record heading into Christmas\nWednesday\u2019s record finish capped a calm, thinly traded session that still delivered a clear message: investors are ending 2025 with renewed risk appetite, supported by cooling inflation signals, steady labor data, and expectations that the Federal Reserve could keep easing in 2026. [3]\nA few key drivers dominated the tape:\n- Rate-cut expectations are back in focus. Reuters reported that optimism around additional Fed cuts in 2026 helped pull money back into equities, especially after recent inflation and jobs readings kept hopes for easier policy alive. [4]\n- AI and mega-cap leadership returned \u2014 but broadened participation mattered. As tech and AI shares recovered from a November pullback, investors also rotated into more cyclical areas like financials and materials\u2014a backdrop that tends to support \u201cold economy\u201d blue chips that feature heavily in the Dow. [5]\n- Economic resilience remains the base case. The Associated Press noted that unemployment claims fell, reinforcing the view that the labor market is still holding up even as investors debate the pace of cooling. [6]\nBottom line: the Dow\u2019s record close is less about a single headline and more about a year-end alignment of easing-policy hopes + still-OK growth + a market that\u2019s no longer terrified of volatility. [7]\nMarket status today: what \u201cDow Jones at 10:18\u201d actually means on Dec. 25\nIf you\u2019re checking the Dow right now and wondering why it looks \u201cstuck,\u201d it\u2019s because:\n- NYSE cash equities: closed today for Christmas, after an early close on Dec. 24. [8]\n- Nasdaq cash equities: also closed today, with Dec. 24 marked as an early close. [9]\n- Equity index futures: CME\u2019s holiday schedule shows Christmas Day as closed during the day, with trading set to resume later (per CME\u2019s published hours). [10]\nSo at 10:18 a.m. ET, the most accurate framing is: DJIA is holding at Wednesday\u2019s settlement (48,731.16), and the next meaningful read will come when U.S. markets reopen on Friday, Dec. 26 (with typically light post-holiday volume). [11]\nChristmas Day headlines shaping sentiment (even with Wall Street closed)\nEven when U.S. equities are dark, the macro and global backdrop still matters\u2014especially for the Dow, which can react sharply to shifting growth expectations, yields, and global demand.\n1) Asia is mixed in thin holiday trading\nAP reported mixed Asian markets amid widespread Christmas closures, with investors tracking China\u2019s liquidity posture and selective moves across the region. This matters for U.S. blue chips because global growth expectations feed into industrial demand, financial conditions, and multinational earnings. [12]\n2) The economy narrative is turning into the 2026 narrative\nA Washington Post data-driven look at where the U.S. economy is heading highlights several themes investors are carrying into year-end:\n- Inflation around 2.7% as of November (still a political and consumer pressure point)\n- A cooling job market relative to 2024\n- AI investment as a major growth contributor\n- The Fed having cut rates multiple times in 2025 while signaling patience ahead [13]\nFor Dow traders, this translates into one big question: Can earnings and productivity gains keep expanding if growth cools further\u2014without reigniting inflation?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 288.75, or 0.6%, to close at 48,731.16, and the Nasdaq composite added 51.46, or 0.2%, to close at 23,613.31.\nTrading was extremely light as markets closed early for Christmas Eve and will be closed for Christmas on Thursday. Roughly 1.8 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, which is roughly a third of the average trading day.\nMarkets will reopen for a full day of trading on Friday; however volumes are expected to remain light this week with most investors having closed out their positions for the year.\nThe S&P 500 is up more than 17% this year, as investors have embraced the deregulatory policies of the Trump administration and been optimistic about the future of artificial intelligence in helping boost profits for not only technology companies but also for Corporate America. Some of the strongest performers this year include Nvidia and Micron Technologies, both companies that make chips or other components that power the proliferation of data centers across the country.\nMuch of the focus for investors for the next few weeks will be on where the U.S. economy is heading and where the Federal Reserve will move interest rates. Investors are betting the Fed will hold steady on interest rates at its January meeting.\nThe U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly strong 4.3% annual rate in the third quarter, the most rapid expansion in two years, driven by consumers who continue to spend in the face of ongoing inflation. There have also been recent reports showing shaky confidence among consumers worried about high prices. The labor market has been slowing and retail sales have weakened.\nThe number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week and remain at historically healthy levels despite some signs that the labor market is weakening.\nU.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 20 fell by 10,000 to 214,000 from the previous week's 224,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. That's below the 232,000 new applications forecast of analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet.\nDynavax Technologies soared 38.2% after Sanofi said it was acquiring the California-based vaccine maker in a deal worth $2.2 billion. The French drugmaker will add Dynavax's hepatitis B vaccines to its portfolio, as well as a shingles vaccine that is still in development.\nNovo Nordisk's shares rose 1.8% after the weight-loss drug company got approval from U.S. regulators for a pill version of its blockbuster drug Wegovy. However, Novo Nordisk shares are still down almost 40% this year as the company has faced increased competition for weight-loss medications, particularly from Eli Lilly. Shares of Eli Lilly are up 40% this year.\nEuropean markets moved between slight gains and losses. Asian markets were also quiet, with Hong Kong moving up 0.2% while Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.1%.\nGold prices were flat at $4,502 an ounce, and silver rose 0.8% to $71.69. U.S. crude oil was flat at $58.38 a barrel."

                "body": "London \u2014 Thursday, 25 December 2025. The United Kingdom stock market is closed today for Christmas Day, putting a temporary pause on trading after a holiday-shortened run into the break. With the London Stock Exchange (LSE) also shut on Friday for Boxing Day, the next meaningful read on UK risk appetite will come when markets reopen after the long weekend. [1]\nEven with the screens dark, investors are still digesting a busy late-December backdrop: a Bank of England rate cut to 3.75%, a strong year for UK large caps, record-setting moves in industrial metals that boosted miners, and headline corporate deals\u2014most notably BP\u2019s agreement to sell a majority stake in Castrol. [2]\nUK stock market closed today: what\u2019s shut, and when trading resumes\nThe LSE is not trading today (25 December) and remains closed on 26 December. The exchange ran a half-day session on 24 December, with the closing process beginning from 12:30 London time, before the two-day holiday halt. [3]\nThis matters for investors watching UK shares \u201ctoday\u201d because the latest price action is effectively Wednesday\u2019s close (Christmas Eve), and the next catalysts\u2014company updates, commodity swings, global macro and currency moves\u2014will be reflected when London reopens. [4]\nWhat happened in the last UK session: FTSE 100 dips in quiet Christmas Eve trade\nIn the final, shortened session before the holiday, the FTSE 100 fell 0.2% and the FTSE 250 slipped 0.07%, with Reuters describing trading as quiet as investors wound down positions ahead of the break. [5]\nTwo familiar heavyweights were a drag: AstraZeneca and GSK both fell about 0.5%, highlighting how a small move in megacaps can sway headline index performance\u2014especially on thin holiday volumes. [6]\nDespite the subdued finish, the bigger story is the year\u2019s direction of travel. Reuters reported the FTSE 100 is set to close out a fifth straight year of gains and was up 20.7% for 2025, supported by strength in miners, financials and defence shares. [7]\nThe headline corporate story: BP agrees to sell 65% of Castrol for about $6 billion\nThe most eye-catching UK corporate development into the holiday was BP\u2019s agreement to sell a 65% stake in its Castrol lubricants business to Stonepeak for about $6 billion, a deal that Reuters said values Castrol at $10.1 billion. [8]\nBP will retain 35% in a new joint venture and can sell that stake after a two-year lock-in period. The transaction also includes $800 million in accelerated dividend payments and is expected to complete by the end of 2026, with proceeds aimed at reducing debt as BP pursues a broader divestment plan. [9]\nWhy investors care: beyond the obvious \u201cdeal headline,\u201d the Castrol sale feeds directly into the long-running debate over BP\u2019s strategy, capital returns, and portfolio simplification. Reuters also reported that RBC analysts questioned the rationale of selling a \u201chighly cash generative\u201d business, even as the deal provides near-term capital flexibility. [10]\nM&A in the mining complex: SolGold takeover agreed as copper demand narrative builds\nElsewhere in UK-listed stocks, Reuters reported that SolGold agreed to be acquired by its largest shareholder Jiangxi Copper in a deal valuing the miner at \u00a3867 million ($1.17 billion). The 28 pence per share offer represents an almost 43% premium to SolGold\u2019s 19 November close (the day before Jiangxi first approached). [11]\nThe deal gives Jiangxi control of SolGold\u2019s Cascabel project in Ecuador, with Reuters linking the strategic logic to the race for copper supply as demand rises from electric vehicles and AI infrastructure\u2014a theme that has increasingly connected commodity markets to the broader equity narrative. [12]\nCommodities helped write the UK market story in 2025\u2014especially miners\nThe UK market\u2019s heavy exposure to global commodities has been a feature, not a bug, during 2025\u2019s rally. Earlier in the week, Reuters reported copper surged to a record high, crossing $12,000, lifting major London-listed miners including Anglo A"

                "body": "German defence champion Rheinmetall AG has gone from investor darling to DAX problem child in just a few weeks. After hitting record highs above \u20ac2,000 in early October, the stock is now trading around the mid\u2011\u20ac1,400s \u2013 a drop of roughly 28% \u2013 as peace\u2011talk headlines and profit\u2011taking trigger a brutal sell\u2011off across European defence names. [1]\nAt the same time, Rheinmetall\u2019s fundamentals look stronger than ever: record sales, a \u20ac64 billion backlog and aggressive expansion of ammunition and air\u2011defence capacity. [2] Analysts still see substantial upside, but short\u2011term technicals have turned clearly bearish and volatility is high. [3]\nThis article looks at the latest price action, fresh news as of 2 December 2025, current forecasts and the key risks around Rheinmetall AG stock for medium\u2011 and long\u2011term investors.\nRheinmetall share price on 2 December 2025\nAs of Tuesday morning, 2 December 2025, Rheinmetall AG (ISIN DE0007030009, WKN 703000, ticker RHM) is changing hands on German exchanges at roughly \u20ac1,450\u20131,460 per share. Quotes from Xetra and other venues show: [4]\n- Last trade around \u20ac1,452\u20131,461, up slightly versus Monday\u2019s close of \u20ac1,448\n- Day range so far roughly \u20ac1,435\u20131,465\n- 52\u2011week range from about \u20ac593 to just over \u20ac2,000\nThat means the stock is still down almost 28% from its 52\u2011week high, even after a modest intraday rebound. [5]\nA number of German market commentaries talk about the share \u201ccrashing\u201d or \u201cfalling under the wheels\u201d as it slid to around \u20ac1,447.50 at the start of the week, with sentiment dominated by headlines rather than company news. [6]\nWhy Rheinmetall is falling now\n1. Peace\u2011talk headlines and sector\u2011wide sell\u2011off\nRheinmetall is being hit by a macro narrative rather than company\u2011specific bad news. On 24 November, Reuters reported that European defence stocks fell to four\u2011month lows as investors reacted to news of a \u201crefined peace framework\u201d discussed at U.S.\u2013Ukraine talks in Geneva. Rheinmetall dropped about 4% that day, alongside other major European arms makers. [7]\nThe logic in the market is simple (and somewhat simplistic):\nPeace talks \u2192 less war risk \u2192 less urgency for ammunition and weapons \u2192 time to take profits in defence stocks.\nAnalysts at Morningstar, quoted in the same Reuters piece, argue the reaction is \u201coverstated\u201d, stressing that European rearmament is driven by structural budget increases and that defence plans are unlikely to reverse even in the event of a ceasefire. [8]\n2. Profit\u2011taking after a massive multi\u2011year rally\nRheinmetall has been one of Europe\u2019s most explosive post\u20112022 winners. A recent MarketScreener/Citigroup commentary notes that: [9]\n- Rheinmetall shares are still up around 130% since the end of 2024, and\n- roughly 1,600% since the start of 2022,\n- even after falling nearly 30% from all\u2011time highs above \u20ac2,000.\nCitigroup points out that the broader European defence sector has corrected roughly 20\u201340% from October peaks, but views this more as an \u201centry opportunity\u201d than the end of the story for defence stocks. [10]\n3. Short\u2011term technical damage\nTechnical analysts have turned notably cautious:\n- StockInvest.us classifies Rheinmetall as a \u201csell candidate\u201d since 21 November, noting a \u201315.9% drop over the last 10 trading days and expecting, based on its model, a potential further \u201316.9% decline over the next three months, with a 90% probability band between roughly \u20ac1,176\u20131,445. [11]\n- The stock trades in the lower part of a wide falling trend and is oversold on RSI\u201114 (24), which can precede bounces but also signals elevated risk. [12]\n- A German XTB analysis highlights a clearly bearish chart: the share is below major moving averages (SMA 20/50/200), with possible downside targets around \u20ac1,374 or even \u20ac1,236 if it cannot regain its 200\u2011day line. [13]\nIn short: the stock is in a technical downtrend, even if long\u2011term fundamentals remain robust.\nFundamentals: record growth and a \u20ac64 billion backlog\nRheinmetall\u2019s latest official numbers are from its Q3 2025 financial"

                "body": "Quick Read\n- European stock indices such as DAX, CAC 40, and FTSE reached new highs in late 2025.\n- Value investors are targeting companies like DSV A/S, AutoStore Holdings, and Helvetia Baloise Holding AG, trading up to 46% below estimated fair value.\n- Dividend stocks including Zurich Insurance Group and Telekom Austria offer yields above 4%, attracting income-focused investors.\nEuropean stock markets have entered 2025 with a renewed sense of optimism, driven by steady economic growth and a more relaxed approach from central banks. This climate has sparked a rally, with the pan-European STOXX Europe 600 Index climbing 1.60% and major indices in Germany, France, and the UK posting solid gains. According to Armenpress, the German DAX reached 24,340.06 points, the French CAC 40 hit 8,103.58 points, and the British FTSE hovered at 9,870.68 points\u2014reflecting a broad-based upswing across the continent.\nBehind the headline numbers lies a nuanced story. Investors are increasingly focused on identifying stocks that remain undervalued despite the market\u2019s momentum. This approach, often called \u2018value investing,\u2019 seeks out companies trading below their intrinsic worth\u2014potential diamonds in the rough that could shine brighter as conditions improve.\nSpotlight on Discounted Opportunities\nRecent research by Simply Wall St highlights several European companies trading at significant discounts to their estimated fair values. Among the standouts is DSV A/S, a Danish transport and logistics firm with a market cap of DKK376 billion. Despite a recent dip in net income and lowered guidance for 2025, DSV\u2019s robust expansion\u2014such as its strategic growth in Virginia\u2014positions it for annual revenue growth of 10.1%, outpacing the Danish market. Yet, with a discounted cash flow valuation suggesting DSV is undervalued by nearly 38%, investors are weighing the risks of high debt against the lure of future gains.\nAnother notable pick is AutoStore Holdings Ltd., a Norwegian technology company specializing in robotics and automation. Trading at a 46.5% discount to its estimated fair value, AutoStore faces challenges like low return on equity (9.4%) and volatile share prices. However, its projected annual revenue growth of 11.7% exceeds the Norwegian market average, sparking interest among those willing to tolerate short-term fluctuations for long-term potential.\nHelvetia Baloise Holding AG, a Swiss insurance and reinsurance provider, rounds out the list with a 34.9% discount to fair value. Its addition to several S&P indices and a reliable 3.19% dividend yield make it appealing for both growth and income investors. The company forecasts earnings growth of over 21% annually, well above the Swiss market average, though its return on equity is expected to stay modest at 11.6% in the coming years.\nBeyond these, Simply Wall St screened dozens more, revealing a group of European stocks with discounts approaching 50%. Some of the most deeply discounted shares include:\n- Sanoma Oyj (Finland) \u2013 49.9% discount\n- Redelfi (Italy) \u2013 49.8% discount\n- Outokumpu Oyj (Finland) \u2013 49.6% discount\n- LINK Mobility Group (Norway) \u2013 49.9% discount\n- Hemnet Group (Sweden) \u2013 49.3% discount\n- Exail Technologies (France) \u2013 49.8% discount\n- Cyber_Folks (Poland) \u2013 49.3% discount\n- Cyan (Germany) \u2013 49.8% discount\n- Artifex Mundi (Poland) \u2013 49.9% discount\n- Allegro.eu (Poland) \u2013 49.1% discount\nSanoma Oyj, for instance, is leveraging a \u20ac220 million syndicated loan to strengthen its finances and pursue strategic acquisitions in K-12 content\u2014a move aimed at driving future growth. Such bold refinancing efforts reflect a broader trend: European companies are actively restructuring to seize opportunities in a competitive landscape.\nDividend Stocks Offer Stability Amid Uncertainty\nFor investors seeking income rather than just price appreciation, European dividend stocks are also attracting attention. In a market where volatility remains a concern, steady dividends can provide a cushion against sha"

The NASDAQ 100 removal and more cautious earnings expectations mostly affect sentiment and index-driven flows rather than the core thesis, while the key near term swing factor remains how quickly utilization and margins recover versus softer revenue guidance.\nThe extended partnership with FORVIA HELLA, which brings ON Semiconductor\u2019s PowerTrench T10 MOSFETs into advanced automotive platforms, directly supports its core auto and electrification catalyst by deepening content in safety and autonomous systems. Against a backdrop of softer near term estimates, this kind of design win gives investors a concrete example of how ON is trying to grow its higher value automotive footprint even as the cycle remains mixed.\nHowever, beneath these new automotive wins, investors should be aware of the risk that persistent underutilization and slower demand could keep margins under pressure for longer...\nON Semiconductor's narrative projects $7.5 billion revenue and $1.9 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 5.4% yearly revenue growth and roughly a $1.4 billion earnings increase from $465.8 million today.\nSimply Wall St Community members have published 11 fair value estimates for ON Semiconductor, ranging from US$49.59 to US$70, highlighting how far apart individual views can be. You can compare these against the current concerns around weaker earnings expectations and margin pressure to see how different investors weigh ON\u2019s long term automotive and power opportunities versus its more immediate business risks.\nDisagree with existing narratives?

                "body": "Buying shares in the best businesses can build meaningful wealth for you and your family. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. For example, the Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) share price is up a whopping 705% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. And in the last week the share price has popped 7.4%. But this could be related to the buoyant market which is up about 3.1% in a week. It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for Broadcom investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 49% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 52% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\nWhat About Dividends?\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Broadcom the TSR over the last 5 years was 795%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."

In June, he fired all 17 members of an influential panel on immunization policy, then handpicked their replacements. In August, he fired the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after they clashed over vaccines.\nBut even Kennedy\u2019s authority has limits.\nMaking a unilateral decision to scrap the US pediatric immunization schedule and replace it with recommendations from Denmark, as Kennedy was reportedly ready to do last week, requires far more than a press conference, legal experts told CIDRAP News.\nKennedy and other agency heads must obey the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a law passed by Congress that requires federal officials to follow an open, deliberative process when issuing rules and regulations, said Lawrence Gostin, JD, founding director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.\n\u201cAs a matter of law, Secretary Kennedy has final authority to make federal policy,\u201d Gostin said. \u201cBut he must follow a reasoned process.\u201d\nA drive to reduce the number of vaccinations\nKennedy\u2019s announcement was canceled at the last minute. Although the HHS office of public affairs blamed a scheduling conflict, Politico has reported that Kennedy backed off from a plan to overhaul the vaccine schedule\u2014which had been described to the press as an \u201cannouncement regarding children\u2019s health\u201d\u2014 after advisers told him it was legally and politically risky.\nIn an email to media, HHS suggested the press conference would be rescheduled, noting that it was \u201cpostponing our children's health announcement to after the first of the new year.\u201d\nA spokesman for HHS declined to confirm that Kennedy planned to overhaul the vaccine schedule at the press conference. \u201cUnless you hear it from HHS directly, this is pure speculation,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said.\nKennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine activist, has made no secret of his eagerness to revamp the immunization schedule. After President Trump issued a memo earlier this month directing HHS to align the vaccination schedule with that of countries such as Denmark, Kennedy posted on X, \u201cThank you, Mr. President. We\u2019re on it.\u201d\nBut Kennedy needs to proceed cautiously to prevent any policy changes from being dismissed by a judge, said Dorit Reiss, PhD, a law professor at the University of California Law, San Francisco.\nAs a matter of law, Secretary Kennedy has final authority to make federal policy....But he must follow a reasoned process.\nAccording to the APA, courts can \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d\nSimply holding a press conference to announce that the United States will now recommend Denmark\u2019s vaccine schedule would leave the Trump administration \u201cvery, very vulnerable to an arbitrary and capricious claims,\u201d Reiss said. \u201cShort videos simply don't do it.\u201d\nFollowing established procedures\nFor six decades, vaccine recommendations have been formulated by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which normally votes on national recommendations after reviewing medical evidence and soliciting input from experts and the public. The CDC director can accept or reject those recommendations.\nThe CDC\u2019s recommendations are not mandates. Even if Kennedy were to switch the current vaccine recommendations to match those of Denmark, states would not have to follow along. Although CDC recommendations carry great weight, states make individual decisions about school vaccine requirements, Gostin said.\nA court is likely to take a dim view of any federal vaccine policy changes that don\u2019t go through the ACIP, Reiss said.\nIf the administration wants to follow Denmark\u2019s example, \u201cthey need to address the major issues and explain why they are changing from a schedule develope"

It is chaired by U.S. President Donald Trump and vice-chaired by his vice-president, J.D. Vance. Trump appointed Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, to run its day-to-day operations as executive director. The task force\u2019s primary role is to lead and coordinate federal efforts in support of the tournament, notably across safety and security concerns.\nAdvertisement\nThe task force holds regular weekly calls with the 11 American host city committees, which are effectively subsidiaries of FIFA\u2019s U.S. operations. At one recent meeting, the task force invited a pitch from organizers of America\u2019s 250th birthday celebrations, which falls on July 4, 2026, at the start of the World Cup\u2019s round of 16. The \u2018Freedom\u2019 trucks were proposed to the host cities as a way to align the World Cup with America\u2019s Semiquincentennial, marking 250 years since the Declaration of Independence was signed.\nMajor FIFA Fan Fests have already been announced by several host cities across the United States, such as Liberty State Park in Jersey City, and a 25,000-person capacity Fan Fest at the National WW1 Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. Others, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, are considering a reduced slate of Fan Fests amid the major financial burden FIFA has transferred onto cities.\nSince his January inauguration, Trump has taken several steps to ramp up celebrations for \u2018America 250.\u2019 This included the establishment of the White House Task Force 250, which is also chaired by President Trump and includes representation from cabinet members. This month, Trump launched Freedom 250. He further announced that between June 25 and July 10, the U.S. will hold a Great American State Fair on the National Mall, \u201ccelebrating America\u2019s exceptional history and culture.\u201d\nHe also announced a national prayer event, \u201cto rededicate (America) as one nation under God\u201d, as well as a UFC event at the White House and the inaugural Patriot Games \u2014 a four-day athletic event involving one male and one female high school athlete from each U.S. state and territory. The Freedom 250 organization is described on its website as \u201cthe national, non-partisan organization leading the celebration of America\u2019s 250th birthday\u201d \u2014 it says it is the official public-private partnership to amplify presidential moments of the anniversary year.\nAdvertisement\nPreviously, another organization, named America250, was created by Congress in 2016, charged with organizing the national commemoration, and this has bipartisan representation from Congress, as well as honorary presidency positions for former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and First Ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. However, the New York Times has reported that the organization has taken on a \u201cdifferent direction\u201d since Trump returned to the White House. The Atlantic reported that America250 had launched a partnership with Moms For Liberty, a conservative group, while also securing sponsorships with companies such as Palantir, UFC, Coinbase and Oracle, whose executives have financially supported Trump.\nOn the call with host city executives, it was explained that the large trailer trucks will be touring the United States in 2026, adorned with U.S. flags and the word Freedom. According to four people with knowledge of the call, all of whom wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, these were described as mobile museum freedom trucks and airstream trailers, which would tell the story of America\u2019s history and independence. Two people said they expected the trucks to be 18-wheelers, but the size was not confirmed by the task"

I wish you the best on your Christmas Eve dinner.

While many overseas desks are still operating on reduced staffing after Christmas, Tokyo will get a concentrated burst of high-impact data just minutes before the cash session begins \u2014 at a time when the yen, bond yields and Bank of Japan expectations are already the central story for Japanese assets.\nBelow is what investors should know before the Tokyo Stock Exchange opens on Friday, December 26, 2025.\n1) Where Japanese stocks left off: Nikkei near record territory, but trading has been thin\nJapan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 closed Thursday (Dec. 25) at 50,407.79, extending a year that has already delivered outsized gains and kept the index hovering near record levels. [1]\nThe broader TOPIX ended at 3,417.98. [2]\nThursday\u2019s session took place during thin holiday trading, with many global markets closed for Christmas \u2014 a backdrop that can dampen volume but also amplify price swings when a real catalyst hits. [3]\n2) Early directional cue: Nikkei futures slightly above the cash close\nThe cleanest pre-open temperature check is often the offshore futures market. As of this morning, SGX Nikkei 225 futures were indicated around 50,475, a touch above Thursday\u2019s cash close. [4]\nThat modest premium suggests a cautiously positive bias \u2014 but with a big caveat: Japan\u2019s inflation and activity data hit right before the open, meaning the \u201cfutures mood\u201d can flip quickly in the final minutes.\n3) Yen watch: the currency is still the market\u2019s steering wheel\nFor Japanese equities, the yen remains the single most important macro variable because it can reshape earnings expectations quickly \u2014 especially for exporters.\nOvernight pricing showed USD/JPY around 155.9. [5]\nA separate snapshot of recent moves shows the dollar-to-yen rate hovering around 155.8, with the past week\u2019s range roughly spanning the mid\u2011155s to the high\u2011157s. [6]\nWhy the yen is so sensitive right now\nIn the last several days, Japanese officials have repeatedly warned they are prepared to respond to \u201cexcessive\u201d FX moves \u2014 language markets often interpret as raising the risk of yen-supporting intervention if moves become too abrupt or one-sided. [7]\nFor Tokyo stocks, the \u201cyen narrative\u201d matters in two opposing ways:\n- A weaker yen typically supports exporters (autos, machinery, some tech hardware) via translation gains and improved overseas competitiveness.\n- A stronger yen can pressure exporters\u2019 near-term earnings sentiment \u2014 but may help domestic demand and reduce imported inflation stress for households.\nGiven the government\u2019s sharper FX rhetoric, traders are likely to stay alert for sudden yen jolts that can rapidly reprice equity leadership.\n4) The big pre-open catalyst: Tokyo CPI and a cluster of Japan data minutes before trading starts\nThe most important \u201ctoday\u201d story isn\u2019t overseas \u2014 it\u2019s the Japan data calendar, with releases packed into the final half-hour before the open.\n08:30 JST \u2014 Tokyo CPI (December)\nMarket attention is locked on Tokyo inflation because it\u2019s one of the timeliest reads on Japan\u2019s price trend \u2014 and it feeds directly into expectations for what the Bank of Japan does next.\nConsensus estimates before the release pointed to:\n- Tokyo CPI (headline) around +2.4% y/y\n- Tokyo CPI ex-fresh food (core) around +2.5% y/y\n- Tokyo CPI ex-fresh food & energy (core-core) around +2.9% y/y [8]\n08:30 JST \u2014 Unemployment rate (November)\nAt the same time, investors will see the latest labor-market signal, with the unemployment rate expected to remain stable at 2.6% \u2014 consistent with a still-tight jobs backdrop. [9]\n08:50 JST \u2014 Retail sales + industrial production (both for November)\nJust 10 minutes before the cash open, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) publishes:\n- Retail sales (Current Survey of Commerce) [10]\n- Industrial production (Indices of Industrial Production, shipments, inventories) [11]\nMar"
