                "body": "Billionaire investor David Einhorn explains why gold will keep rising \u2014 and it's got nothing to do with inflation\n\"Gold is not about inflation,\" David Einhorn told CNBC.\nThe billionaire investor says gold is rising on deficit fears.\nHis fund crushed the S&P 500 last quarter thanks to a big bet on gold.\nDavid Einhorn's Greenlight Capital crushed last quarter by betting big on gold, and the hedge fund boss said the metal's big rally isn't done yet.\nEinhorn said that he sees gold continuing to rise even after a record-setting run so far in 2025, but he also said he'd be concerned if the price rose significantly higher.\n\"I'd be really happy if it went to $3,500 or $3,800; I'd be really unhappy if it went to $30,000 or $50,000,\" the billionaire investor told CNBC on the sidelines of the Sohn Investment Conference in New York.\nBullion briefly peaked at $3,500 per ounce in April, a move many have tied to tariff-linked inflation concerns. Gold is historically considered the premier hedge against runaway price growth, which could justify the metal's 22% surge so far this year.\nBut even as prices have eased to a one-month low amid softer inflation data, Einhorn sees gold continuing to rally for other reasons.\n\"Gold is not about inflation. Gold is about the confidence in the fiscal policy and the monetary policy,\" he said, suggesting that the government has become aggressive on both fronts, altogether contributing to a deficit policymakers are largely ignoring.\nIn his view, gold's appreciation reflects disappointment in the efforts to slim the $1.9 trillion federal budget deficit.\nAdvertisement\nEinhorn pointed to the Department of Government Efficiency, an agency that initially promised to slash $2 trillion in federal spending.\n\"A few months have gone by \u2014 It's like $150 billion, maybe,\" Einhorn said. \"That's enough to cover next year's defense funding spending increase; that's going to get eaten up really, really fast.\"\nThe same goes for tariffs, which the administration touted as a massive boost to government revenue. But Einhorn said the new duties appear set to bring in around $100 billion.\nFiscal concerns will also continue to grow with the new tax policy, with Trump expected to extend his 2017 tax cuts. The bill unveiled by Congress this week is expected to add trillions to the deficit over 10 years.\n\"We're not really concerned about the deficit. There's a bipartisan agreement to do nothing about the deficit until we actually get to the crisis,\" Einhorn summarized.\nIf this continues to propel gold higher, that should continue to boost Greenlight's portfolio. The hedge fund beat the S&P 500 with an 8.2% gain in the first quarter, previously noting that gold's 19% advance made it the fund's \"biggest winner.\"\nHowever, doubt has risen as to whether the precious metal can keep climbing this year. ING expects gold to average $3,128 per ounce through 2025, citing that some tailwinds are losing momentum.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

                "body": "Gold soars past $4,200 as investor hopes of December interest-rate cut\nGold prices climbed to a three-week high Thursday, topping $4,200 an ounce as investors hoped the Fed would cut interest rates in December after the government releases delayed economic data.\nSpot gold hit $4,215.49 per ounce, its highest level since Oct. 21, before settling at $4,187.49. The precious metal has surged 60% this year, reaching a record $4,381.21 on Oct. 20.\nThe rally came after the US government began to reopen following a record 43-day shutdown \u2014 meaning that delayed economic data will be coming out soon.\n\u201cMarkets bet that once data flows restart, a softer U.S. economic picture could justify additional rate cuts, which support the non-yielding metal,\u201d Soojin Kim from MUFG told The Wall Street Journal.\nA Reuters poll showed 80% of economists expect a 25 basis-point cut at the next meeting.\nPrivate surveys had already indicated job market weakness during the shutdown.\nLower interest rates typically boost gold, which offers no yield but is prized as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty.\nThe Fed cut rates last month, though Chair Jerome Powell cautioned against expecting further easing this year due to a lack of data.\nBut investors are increasingly turning to gold for reasons beyond rate cuts.\nStandard Chartered said in a note that gold\u2019s correlation with traditional drivers like the dollar and real yields has weakened over the past two weeks, reflecting a shift toward structural concerns like currency debasement and US debt.\nStart your day with all you need to know\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nThanks for signing up!\nThe metal\u2019s surge has been fueled by rising ETF inflows and geopolitical concerns, according to analysts. Central banks have also been buying gold at record levels, part of a broader de-dollarization trend.\nGold has historically served as a hedge against inflation and economic turmoil. The current rally suggests investors are growing more anxious about the US fiscal outlook and the potential for currency devaluation.\nExplore Top Gold IRAs\nAmerican Hartford Gold\nAmerican Hartford Gold is a top-rated precious metals dealer specializing in gold and silver for physical delivery or within retirement accounts. Known for its transparency, white-glove customer service, and easy-to-navigate onboarding process, the company helps investors hedge against inflation and economic volatility.

Its team of experts guides clients through the entire rollover process, offering transparency, competitive pricing, and long-term support.\nThe precious metal has outpaced equities this year, prompting some analysts to warn of bubble concerns.\nMorgan Stanley noted in October that investors may be buying gold as a hedge against the risk of a speculative AI bubble in stocks.\nSilver briefly rallied Thursday, hitting its highest level since Oct. 17 before edging down 0.1% to $53.06 per ounce.\nTai Wong, an independent metals trader, warned that if silver doesn\u2019t break higher decisively, another round of profit-taking could follow.\nPlatinum fell 0.8% to $1,617.90 and palladium dropped 1% to $1,492.00.\nGold\u2019s 60% gain this year far exceeds typical annual returns for the metal, which has averaged around 10% over the past decade.\nThe surge has raised questions about whether prices can sustain these levels or if a correction is looming.\nFor now, investors s"

                "body": "The EUR/USD rose to 1.1656 but met resistance at 1.1661 as the US Dollar weakened despite fewer expectations of a Fed rate cut. Market sentiment declined after the reopening of the US government, with a 50% chance of no rate cut in December. Eurozone industrial production increased by 0.2%, yet this was lower than forecasts.\nThe Euro experienced a rise against the US Dollar, reaching a two-week high of 1.1656, despite not surpassing the key resistance of the 50-day Moving Average. This occurred amid high US Treasury yields and despite reduced Fed rate cut projections. The US Dollar Index dropped by 0.34% to 99.14.\nMarket Reactions\nWall Street experienced losses as risk appetite diminished following the US government\u2019s reopening. Doubts over another Fed rate cut abounded, with officials having adopted a cautious stance despite noting labor market weaknesses. Eurozone industrial production saw a slight increase, missing the anticipated 0.7% rise.\nThe Euro remains a major currency, with its Eurozone governance managed by the European Central Bank, tasked with maintaining price stability. Strong economic data can bolster the Euro, while ECB interest rate adjustments respond to inflation levels. The currency pair EUR/USD is the most traded worldwide, with the Euro being crucial to global trade balances and economic indicators.\nWe are seeing EUR/USD push against the critical 50-day moving average at 1.1661, a key technical barrier. This strength in the Euro comes despite the market pricing only a 50/50 chance of a US Federal Reserve rate cut next month. This uncertainty is supported by the latest US CPI data from October 2025, which showed inflation remaining sticky at 3.4%, giving hawkish Fed officials reason to pause.\nOn the other side of the pair, the Euro\u2019s fundamentals appear mixed, creating a complicated picture for traders. The recent miss in Eurozone industrial production aligns with the latest S&P Global Eurozone Manufacturing PMI, which registered a contractionary 45.8 for October 2025. Still, with Eurozone HICP inflation stubbornly above target at 2.8%, the European Central Bank has little room to become overly dovish.\nTrading Strategies\nThis clash between persistent inflation and slowing growth in both economies suggests volatility is likely to increase in the coming weeks. We saw similar choppy price action in late 2023 when markets struggled to interpret central bank intentions after a long hiking cycle. For derivative traders, this environment could make strategies like buying straddles attractive, as they profit from a large price move in either direction without betting on which way it will go.\nFor those anticipating a bullish breakout, a sustained move above 1.1661 is the signal to watch. We could use this trigger to buy call options with a strike price near 1.1700 to capitalize on a potential rally. Conversely, if the resistance holds and the pair falls below 1.1600, purchasing put options with a strike around 1.1550 would be a viable strategy to position for a slide towards the 1.1500 support level.\nOver the next few weeks, we must monitor the upcoming preliminary inflation numbers from the Eurozone and the crucial US employment report for November 2025. These data points will heavily influence central bank decisions and likely provide the catalyst for EUR/USD\u2019s next major move. The market\u2019s reaction to this data will determine whether the pair breaks higher or reverses its recent gains."

                "body": "EUR/USD flat lines below mid-1.1600s; bulls await move beyond 50-day SMA amid weaker USD\n- EUR/USD bulls pause for a breather following the recent rise to an over two-week high.\n- The prevalent USD selling bias supports spot prices and backs the case for further gains.\n- The divergent Fed-ECB expectations validate the near-term positive outlook for the pair.\nThe EUR/USD pair is seen oscillating in a narrow range during the Asian session on Friday and consolidating its recent strong gains to an over two-week high, touched the previous day. Spot prices currently trade around the 1.1635 area, nearly unchanged for the day and below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) pivotal barrier.\nThe US Dollar (USD) struggles attract any meaningful buyers and languishes near a two-week low touched on Thursday amid concerns about the potential economic fallout from a prolonged US government shutdown. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor acting as a tailwind for the EUR/USD pair. Apart from this, the divergent Federal Reserve (Fed)\u2013European Central Bank (ECB) policy expectations offer support to the currency pair and back the case for an extension of a two-week-old uptrend.\nA growing number of Federal Reserve policymakers signaled caution on further easing amid the lack of economic data. Traders, however, are still pricing in a 50% possibility that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in December. In contrast, a majority of economists expect that the ECB will hold its deposit rate this year and see no change by the end of next year. This validates the positive outlook for the EUR/USD pair, though bulls need to wait for a break through the 50-day SMA.\nMeanwhile, a senior White House official said that key economic reports for October \u2013 employment details and inflation data \u2013 may not be released at all. Hence, traders will continue to scrutinize comments from influential FOMC members for cues about the Fed's rate-cut path, which, in turn, will drive the USD demand. Apart from this, the release of the flash Eurozone Q3 GDP print could provide some impetus to the Euro (EUR) and produce trading opportunities around the EUR/USD pair.\nUS Dollar Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies this week. US Dollar was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

                "body": "GBP/USD Forecast: What\u2019s Next for the Pound After the GDP Data Release?\nOver the past four trading sessions, GBP/USD has shown a consistently neutral bias, with average fluctuations of around 0.4%, lacking a clear directional move. The recent UK GDP data release has begun to influence the Bank of England\u2019s outlook ahead of its final decision of the year, while expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve are also shifting. As a result, the pair continues to show persistent indecision, and this neutral tone is likely to remain in the coming sessions as both central banks digest the latest economic data.\nAre Rate Cuts Coming for the Bank of England?\nIn recent trading hours, the UK\u2019s quarterly GDP data was published, showing 0.1% growth, below the expected 0.2%. More importantly, GDP data throughout the year reveals a steady slowdown in economic activity, a trend that could continue into year-end. The first quarter of 2025 recorded growth of 0.7%, but the latest figure of 0.1% highlights that the UK economy is losing momentum, which could influence the Bank of England\u2019s short-term monetary policy outlook.\nSource: Gov.Uk\nDuring its last meeting on November 6, the Bank of England decided to keep its benchmark rate at 4.00% with a neutral stance. However, five members voted to maintain the rate, while four favored a rate cut. The latest GDP figures could shift this neutral stance, as the UK economy appears to be under sustained pressure. This might encourage more committee members to support a rate cut at the next meeting to stimulate economic recovery. While a cut is not guaranteed, the likelihood has increased given the recent data.\nIn this scenario, a more accommodative policy stance could reduce the appeal of pound-denominated fixed-income assets, creating selling pressure on the pound and potentially maintaining a bearish bias for GBP/USD in the medium term.\nWhat About the Federal Reserve?\nCurrently, both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve maintain the same benchmark rate at 4.00%, meaning that the interest rate differential is not a major driver of the pair\u2019s movements in the short term. However, unlike the dovish tilt potentially emerging from the Bank of England, the U.S. outlook appears to be shifting toward caution. The Fed is taking a more neutral stance, as inflation and employment data have not been updated since early October due to the government shutdown, leading markets to anticipate a steady policy decision at the December 10 meeting.\nAccording to the CME Group, the probability of a rate cut to 3.75% currently stands at 53.64%, while the likelihood of holding rates steady has risen to 46.4%. A month ago, the probability of a rate cut exceeded 90%, marking a significant shift in market expectations as the decision date approaches.\nSource: CMEGroup\nIf the Federal Reserve decides to keep rates at 4.00%, while the Bank of England opts to cut rates, this would create a monetary policy divergence that could make U.S. dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Such a scenario would boost demand for the dollar over the pound, potentially generating downward pressure on GBP/USD toward year-end if the trend persists.\nGBP/USD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Downtrend remains intact: Since June 30, GBP/USD has been in a predominantly bearish trend, forming a downward-sloping trendline that continues to define price direction. The 50-period moving average shows a clear downward slope and is steadily approaching the 200-period moving average. If a bearish crossover occurs between these two averages, it could signal stronger selling momentum in the coming weeks, reinforcing the dominant downtrend structure into year-end. Recent bullish corrections have not been strong enough to reverse the overall trend, so the prevailing bias remains bearish as long as the price stays below the key moving averages.\n- RSI: The RSI line maintains a slightly upward slope, but it is approaching the neutral 50 level, suggesting "

However, late-day flows turned sour after reports broke that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is poised to cancel a batch of planned tax increases intended to help bolster the UK\u2019s questionable financial position.\nWith the US government set to reopen, at least temporarily, markets are now looking ahead to the resumption of critical economic dataset releases. US White House officials toyed with the idea of declaring entire batches of inflation and growth data as \u201clost\u201d during the government closure, specifically the October inflation and employment figures, which could never be released. A critical gap in key inflation and labor information is a prospect that is likely sitting poorly with investors who are eager to try and draw a bead on the chances of a third straight interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) on December 10.

The AUD/USD pair gains ground following the release of China\u2019s Industrial Production and Retail Sales data for October. Any change in the Chinese economy could impact the AUD as China is a major trading partner for Australia.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Friday that China\u2019s Retail Sales climbed 2.9% year-over-year (YoY) in October, against the 3.0% in September but exceeding the 2.7% expected. Meanwhile, Industrial Production increased 4.9% YoY in the same period, compared to the 5.5% forecast and 6.5% seen previously. The Fixed Asset Investment came in at -1.7% year-to-date (YTD) YoY in October, missing the expected -0.8% figure. The September reading was -0.5%.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics outlined its economic outlook at Friday\u2019s press conference, saying it will continue to foster new productive forces. It noted that better supply-demand dynamics, along with rising prices for services and industrial goods, pushed October CPI back into positive territory. The bureau added that ongoing economic stabilization provides a solid foundation for China to meet its full-year growth target.\nThe AUD received support as Australia\u2019s improved employment data reinforced the cautious sentiment surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy outlook. RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser said on Wednesday, \u201cOur best estimate is that monetary policy remains restrictive, though the committee continues to debate this.\u201d Hauser added that if the policy is no longer mildly restrictive, it would have significant implications for future decisions.\nUS Dollar moves little after ending government shutdown\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is extending its losses and trading around 99.20 at the time of writing.

The CME FedWatch Tool shows markets pricing in nearly a 50% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in December, down from 69% a week ago.\n- Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President Alberto Musalem said Thursday that rates are now closer to neutral than restrictive and the US economy remains resilient.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a notable increase in employment figures, with the unemployment rate decreasing from a previous 4.5%.\nReserve Bank of Australia\u2019s Interest Rate Decisions\nThis robust Australian labour market has led to speculation regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s potential interest rate decisions. So far in 2023, the RBA has reduced its Official Cash Rate by 75 basis points, bringing it to 3.6%.\nSimultaneously, the US Dollar is experiencing downward pressure with expectations of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year. The US Dollar Index dropped to near 99.30, its lowest in nearly two weeks, influenced by a 67% probability of a December rate cut according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nThe US Dollar is the leading globally traded currency, affected primarily by the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy. Interest rate changes by the Fed significantly impact its value, with rate cuts typically resulting in a weaker Dollar.\nCentral Bank Policy Divergence\nGiven today\u2019s strong Australian jobs report, we see a clear divergence in central bank policy that should be exploited. The Reserve Bank of Australia now has little reason to cut its 3.6% cash rate, especially with unemployment falling to 4.3%. This contrasts sharply with the US Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut rates again next month.\nThis divergence has been building, strengthening the case for a higher AUD/USD. Looking back, we saw similar resilience in the Australian labor market in late 2023, showing a pattern of underlying economic strength. Recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirms this trend, with annual wage growth also recently ticking up to 4.1%, adding to the RBA\u2019s hawkish lean.\nOn the other side of the pair, the US Dollar is weakening for good reason. Recent US inflation data showed the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge, easing to 2.8% year-over-year. This gives the Fed a green light to continue its cutting cycle to support a slowing economy.\nFor derivative traders, this environment makes buying AUD/USD call options an attractive strategy. This allows us to capture the potential upside movement while strictly limiting our maximum loss to the premium paid for the option. It is a defined-risk way to bet on the continuation of this clear fundamental trend.\nWe should consider call options with expiration dates in January or February 2026, which gives the trade enough time to work out past the December Fed meeting. A strike price around 0.6600 or slightly higher would provide a good balance of risk and potential reward. This capitalizes on the expected follow-through from the current momentum.\nHowever, we must watch for any unexpectedly hawkish comments from Fed officials or a surprise jump in next month\u2019s US jobs report. To manage this risk, we could use a bull call spread to lower the initial cost of the trade. This involves buying a call option and simultaneously selling another call at a higher strike price."

This surprise surge helped ease jitters after September\u2019s weaker numbers, while also dimming any hopes for a near-term Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rate cut, especially with inflation staying stubbornly high. Markets took this as a signal of strength, with the australian dollar climbing against the us dollar right after the report. Even so, Commerzbank cautioned that the upbeat headline masks underlying economic cooling and sticky inflation, both of which could keep a lid on further aussie dollar gains as 2025 draws closer.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Confidence returns, but headwinds persist.\nThe australian dollar\u2019s jump shows revived optimism, but investors know the hurdles aren\u2019t going away just yet. With inflation running hot and the broader economy showing signs of fatigue, the potential for more aussie dollar gains looks limited. Unless the RBA changes its tune or global demand rebounds, the currency\u2019s path forward could stay bumpy and rangebound for a while.\nThe bigger picture: Strong jobs aren\u2019t the whole story.\nA solid jobs report is reassuring, but it doesn\u2019t solve every problem.

                "body": "Japanese Yen edges higher against bearish USD; upside potential seems limited\n- The Japanese Yen edges higher against a weaker USD, though it lacks bullish conviction.\n- The BoJ rate hike uncertainty is seen as a key factor behind the JPY\u2019s underperformance.\n- Economic concerns keep the USD depressed and exert pressure on the USD/JPY pair.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) remains on the front foot against a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD) through the Asian session on Friday, though it remains close to a nine-month low, touched the previous day. Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Wednesday expressed her administration's preference for interest rates to stay low and asked for close coordination on policy with the Bank of Japan (BoJ). This further cooled market expectations that an interest-rate hike is coming soon and has been a key factor behind the JPY's relative underperformance.\nTraders, however, still see a 24% chance of a BoJ rate hike move in December and around 46% odds for an increase by January. Furthermore, the recent decline in the JPY prompted Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama and Economy Minister Minoru Kiuchi to issue a warning on currency movements, fueling intervention fears. This, along with the risk-off impulse, seems to lend some support to the JPY. The USD, on the other hand, languishes near a two-week low amid economic concerns and exerts some downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair.\nJapanese Yen remains vulnerable amid Takaichi preference for lower interest rates\n- Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said this Friday that the government is not in a position to set a new numerical target for the nationwide minimum wage. Takaichi argued that the government's role is to create conditions that allow companies to lift pay faster than inflation.\n- Earlier this week, Takaichi said that appropriate monetary policy management should be conducted to achieve both strong economic growth and stable price increases. The remarks were seen as a signal of Takaichi's preference for interest rates to stay low and undermined the Japanese Yen.\n- Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama issued a verbal warning on Wednesday, saying that she will be watching FX moves with a sense of urgency. Moreover, Japan's Economy Minister Minoru Kiuchi said on Friday that a weak JPY can push up CPI through import costs.\n- BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda pointed to resilient consumption driven by stronger household incomes and improving labour-market conditions, also noting that underlying inflation is gradually moving toward the BoJ\u2019s 2% goal. This leaves doors open for an imminent rate hike.\n- US President Donald Trump signed a bill to unlock funding and end the longest government shutdown late on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a senior White House official said that key economic reports for October \u2013 employment details and inflation data \u2013 may not be released at all.\n- A growing number of Federal Reserve policymakers signaled caution on further easing amid the lack of economic data. In fact, financial market-based odds of a rate reduction in December have now fallen to 50%. This, however, does little to provide any respite to the US Dollar.\n- In fact, the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, dived to a fresh two-week trough on Thursday amid economic concerns on the back of a prolonged US government shutdown. This could act as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair.\nUSD/JPY fall towards 154.00 could be seen as buying opportunity and remain limited\nThis week's breakout through the 154.45-154.50 horizontal barrier was seen as a key trigger for the USD/JPY bulls. Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart are holding comfortably in positive territory and are still away from being in the overbought zone. However, repeated failures to find acceptance above the 155.00 psychological mark warrant some caution before positioning for any further appreciating move. Spot prices might then climb to the 155.60-155.65 intermediate hurdle a"

                "body": "Markets remain on edge as USD/JPY hit the yen intervention zone of 155-160 on Wednesday, November 12, rising to a nine-month high of 155.044. An uncertain Bank of Japan policy outlook and the US government reopening collided, extending USD/JPY\u2019s winning streak to four sessions.\nDespite a pullback on Thursday, November 13, the USD/JPY pair has gained 1.2% since the BoJ\u2019s October rate decision and its softer inflation forecast for H1 2026. The central bank\u2019s Summary of Opinions added to the uncertainty over the timeline for a rate hike. Policymakers were divided on tariffs, yen weakness, wages, and, crucially, monetary policy.\nGiven the BoJ\u2019s expectation of cooling inflation, leading inflation indicators failed to increase the chances of a rate hike.\nOn Wednesday, November 13, Japanese producer prices faced scrutiny, rising 2.7% year-on-year (YoY) in October, down from 2.8% in September. Economists expected producer prices to increase 2.5% YoY.\nLower producer prices suggested cooling demand and potentially softer consumer prices. Producers typically pass cost changes on to consumers.\nNotably, producer prices slipped YoY despite USD/JPY surging 4.2% in October. A weaker yen typically raises producer prices through higher import prices, another key focal point for the BoJ. However, the BoJ is likely to place more weight on November\u2019s data, as producer prices typically lag movements in import prices.\nFurthermore, given the competing forces between yen weakness and import prices, October\u2019s data is unlikely to incentivize cautious policymakers to turn hawkish. USD/JPY briefly dropped to 154.690 before climbing to a session high of 155.017 after the release of the data. The weaker yen reflected market reaction to the data and sentiment toward the BoJ rate path.\nOngoing uncertainty surrounding BoJ policy could add further pressure on the yen, with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s expansionary fiscal and ultra-loose policy views reinforcing the headwinds.\nPrime Minister Takaichi reportedly called for regular reports from the BoJ on November 12. She also stated:\n\u201cIt is important that appropriate monetary policy management be conducted to achieve both strong economic growth and stable price increases going forward. The government and the Bank of Japan will continue to work together to develop the national economy.\u201d\nThe USD/JPY outlook is bullish, given Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus plans and monetary policy stance. However, intervention threats could limit the upside, with 155-160 the Japanese government\u2019s likely yen intervention zone.\nUSD/JPY has gained 5% since Prime Minister Takaichi won the Liberal Democratic Party election in October. However, two intervention threats have kept USD/JPY back from stronger gains.\nThis mix of economic resilience and policy divergence has traders questioning whether intervention looms before year-end.\nWhile markets speculate about yen interventions and the BoJ\u2019s rate path, US data and Fed speakers could influence US dollar demand later on Friday.\nUS producer prices and retail sales figures are set for release. Barring further delays to report releases, the two data sets will give key insights into inflation and consumption.\nAn uptick in producer prices could further temper bets on a December Fed rate cut, boosting demand for the US dollar. Meanwhile, weaker retail sales, likely because of the shutdown, combined with rising producer prices, could fuel stagflation fears.\nWith the Fed placing greater emphasis on inflation, higher producer prices would point to a less dovish stance, supporting a potential USD/JPY return to 155. Markets have cut expectations of a December rate cut in recent sessions, contributing to the USD/JPY return to 155.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a Fed rate cut in December has tumbled from 69.6% on November 6 to 50.7% on November 13.\nDespite near-term strength, the broader outlook remains bearish because narrowing rate differentials could shift mom"

                "body": "The Japanese Yen (JPY) gains strength against the US Dollar (USD), interrupting the USD/JPY four-day upward trend as the Greenback continues its decline. Trading near 154.35, the pair remains just below the recent nine-month high of 155.05.\nThe Dollar has not been buoyed by news of the US government shutdown resolution and anticipation grows around upcoming US economic data. This data will be vital in shaping Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut prospects in December.\nFed Rate Cut Prospects\nKevin Hassett indicated that the September nonfarm payrolls would likely emerge next week, and warned the shutdown could dent Q4 GDP by 1.5%. Meanwhile, Fed officials express restraint about potential rate cuts as inflation concerns persist despite a cooling labour market.\nJapan\u2019s fiscal policy and the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) careful approach to policy adjustments restrain the Yen\u2019s recovery. Intervention is considered as USD/JPY nears key levels.\nPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi and BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda met, stressing collaboration on economic goals. The Yen\u2019s performance is affected by BoJ policy, bond yield differentials, and global risk sentiment.\nRisk-averse investors often turn to the Yen in times of market volatility, which can boost its value. The BoJ\u2019s historical monetary policy easing has impacted Yen depreciation, while recent policy shifts offer support.\nInterest Rate Differentials\nAs we look at the market on November 14, 2025, the dynamics in USD/JPY have clearly shifted from the conditions seen a couple of years ago. The pair is now trading around 142.50, well below the highs above 155 we remember from late 2023. This change is largely because the policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan has started to narrow significantly.\nOn the US side, the Federal Reserve has since executed several rate cuts throughout 2024 and early 2025, bringing the Fed Funds rate down to a target of 3.75%. However, recent data, like the October 2025 CPI which came in at a stubborn 2.8%, has the Fed now signaling a pause, creating uncertainty about the next move. This contrasts with the caution we saw back in late 2023 when officials were still primarily concerned about high inflation and hesitant to even consider easing.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Japan has moved on from its ultra-loose monetary policy framework mentioned in past analysis. Earlier this year, we saw the BoJ finally end its negative interest rate policy and abandon yield curve control, with its policy rate now standing at 0.10%. Japanese inflation has remained consistently above target, with the latest core CPI for October 2025 at 2.2%, giving the central bank reason to maintain its cautiously hawkish stance.\nThis has dramatically changed the landscape for interest rate differentials, a key driver for the yen. The spread between the US 10-year Treasury yield, now at 4.1%, and the 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield, at 1.2%, has tightened considerably from its widest points. This compression of yields is what has provided the underlying support for the Yen over the last year.\nFor derivative traders, this means the environment of a one-way upward trend in USD/JPY is over, and we should be prepared for more two-sided action and periods of range-bound trading. Options strategies that benefit from volatility, such as straddles, could be effective around major data releases from either the US or Japan. In calmer periods, selling volatility through strategies like iron condors might be more appropriate, as the major policy shifts have likely already been priced in."

Crude prices rose after a Ukrainian drone strike damaged an Oil depot at Russia\u2019s Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. The Krasnodar region\u2019s operational headquarters said on Telegram that drone debris hit three apartments, an Oil facility at a trans-shipment complex, and several coastal structures, per Reuters.\nThe USD/CAD pair also draws downward pressure as the US Dollar (USD) struggles, with economic caution in the United States (US) overshadowing improved sentiment after the shutdown\u2019s end. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cautioned that some October data may \u201cnever materialize,\u201d as several agencies were unable to gather information during the shutdown. US President Donald Trump signed the government funding bill on Thursday to end the record 43-day government shutdown in US history.\nHowever, the Greenback may regain ground amid cautious Fedspeak, which has decreased the odds of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in December. The CME FedWatch Tool shows markets pricing in nearly a 50% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in December, down from 69% a week ago.\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President Alberto Musalem highlighted the need for caution on Thursday, noting there is limited room to ease without risking overly accommodative policy. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari added that inflation remains too high at 3%. Initial private-sector reports for October suggest a cooling labor market and wavering consumer confidence, with persistent concerns about inflation.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhi"

                "body": "At the moment, the Canadian Dollar (CAD) is in a surprisingly quiet phase as USD/CAD holds near the 1.4000 mark\u2014a major psychological and technical level. The end of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history has introduced both opportunities and challenges for the Canadian dollar. The U.S. dollar has weakened on improved risk appetite, but uncertainty surrounding the wave of delayed U.S. economic data and the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on tariffs has kept the loonie locked in a narrow range. Markets remain hesitant as they wait for clarity from both economic releases and political developments south of the border.\nWhat\u2019s Happening Right Now\nRisk-On Mood Softens the U.S. Dollar\nWith the longest U.S. government shutdown in history finally over, investors are stepping back into riskier assets. That shift has weakened the U.S. dollar, which usually benefits when markets are nervous. The softer USD has helped keep USD/CAD from pushing higher.\nDelayed U.S. Data Creates Market Uncertainty\nBecause of the shutdown, a backlog of U.S. economic releases is now pending\u2014creating an unusual information gap. Some inflation figures that were due today may not be released at all, according to the White House. At the same time, odds of a December Federal Reserve rate cut have slipped to roughly 50/50 from 63% earlier in the week, adding pressure on the USD.\nTechnical Gravity at 1.4000\nThe CAD is finding support from the 1.4000 level, which continues to act as a magnet for traders. This round number\u2014combined with support from the 35-day moving average\u2014has capped any meaningful move and kept the pair locked in place.\nCanadian Fundamentals Provide a Modest Boost\nStronger Canadian labour data has eased the pressure on the Bank of Canada to cut rates in the near term. That stability offers a slight tailwind for the CAD, although it hasn\u2019t been enough to break USD/CAD lower.\nWhy It Matters\nThe 1.4000 level holds outsized importance. It\u2019s psychological, technical, and symbolic\u2014a dividing line between momentum-driven USD strength and a potential shift toward CAD recovery. With global markets trading cautiously and currencies mostly quiet, even small catalysts could move the loonie.\nCAD remains tightly linked to global risk appetite and commodity trends, especially oil. When investors are willing to take on more risk and energy markets stay firm, CAD tends to find support. But if market sentiment reverses or oil weakens, the loonie can quickly fall out of favour.\nWhat to Watch Over the Coming Weeks\nDelayed U.S. Data Releases\nA full schedule of re-released or newly published U.S. economic data is expected soon. This information backlog could jolt USD/CAD in either direction once released.\nSupreme Court Ruling on U.S. Tariffs\nA decision on tariff legality is pending, and depending on the ruling, it could reshape market sentiment and influence the trade outlook\u2014impacting both USD and CAD.\nBoC and Fed Divergence\nMarkets will be watching for any signals on rate paths. If the Bank of Canada leans more hawkish or if the Federal Reserve signals caution on cuts, USD/CAD could shift.\nOil and Risk Sentiment\nAs always, global risk appetite and oil prices remain key drivers for the CAD. Any swings here will directly affect the currency.\nBottom Line\nThe Canadian dollar is in a holding pattern. Support at 1.4000 is firm for now, but risks are building.

Meanwhile, US stock markets fell\u2014especially AI-focused companies\u2014as mixed signals from central bankers and sticky inflation prompted investors to reconsider the odds of monetary easing. Canadian government bond yields climbed with US Treasurys, pushing the 10-year yield up to 3.18%. Even though oil prices, crucial for Canada\u2019s economy, inched up 0.3% to $58.69 a barrel, the loonie\u2019s close ties to global growth mean it\u2019s still stuck in a tough spot.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Commodity currencies face fresh headwinds.\nThe loonie\u2019s slide shows how currency markets are reacting to shaky confidence in commodity-heavy economies, with investors wary of slowing growth and uncertain monetary policy.

It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The quarterly GDP grew at a 0.1% pace, down from 0.3% in the previous quarter and also below the 0.2% anticipated by market analysts. Year-on-year, the economy expanded 1.3%, also below expectations of a steady 1.4% growth.\nApart from that, Manufacturing production contracted at a 1.7% pace, well beyond the market expectations of a 0.3% drop, and following a downwardly revised 0.6% increase in August. Likewise, Industrial Production dropped 2.0% from the previous month, against expectations of a 0.2% decline and following a 0.3% increase in the previous month.\nThese figures add to evidence of a significant economic slowdown in the UK, which is likely to force the Bank of England to cut interest rates further in December. The Pound, however, has remained fairly steady against its main peers following the release.\nThe Yen is failing to capitalise on UK data, weighed down by weaknesses of its own. News reporting pressures from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to the Bank of Japan to keep interest rates at low levels have curbed hopes of a rate cut in December, adding pressure on an already weak Japanese Yen.\nEconomic Indicator\nGross Domestic Product (QoQ)\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP), released by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly and quarterly basis, is a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced in the UK during a given period. The GDP is considered as the main measure of UK economic activity. The QoQ reading compares economic activity in the reference quarter to the previous quarter. Generally, a rise in this indicator is bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Last release: Thu Nov 13, 2025 07:00 (Prel)\nFrequency: Quarterly\nActual: 0.1%\nConsensus: 0.2%\nPrevious: 0.3%\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nEconomic Indicator\nManufacturing Production (MoM)\nThe Manufacturing Production released by the National Statistics measures the manufacturing output.

                "body": "Tracking Forex pairs: what GBP/JPY can tell us about the global economy\nImage: Supplied\nEven in South Africa, GBP/JPY is a common choice among active traders, largely because of its strong price movements and liquidity. Yes, there are other, perhaps safer options like gold and USD/ZAR, but GBP/JPY stands out for those looking for faster-paced opportunities.\nNot only this, but GBP/JPY can actually inform trading strategies across multiple markets, mainly because of what it tells us about the global economy. So what does it tell us, and how can you use that information to your advantage?\nWhat GBP/JPY Can Tell Us About the Global Economy\nPut simply, GBP/JPY tells us exactly how global investors are feeling about risk at any given moment. Looking at the GBPJPY live price on Exness right now, for instance, you can see whether traders are leaning towards risk-on or risk-off sentiment.\nIf the pair is climbing steadily, it indicates growing confidence in riskier assets \u2013 often reflecting optimism about the UK economy or broader global growth \u2013 and if there\u2019s a sharp decline, that indicates investors are moving into safer havens like the Japanese yen \u2013 often reflecting uncertainty or caution in global markets.\nThe reason this is the case is because of the unique economic roles and investors\u2019 perceptions attached to both currencies in the pair. The British pound is widely considered a risk-sensitive currency: it tends to appreciate when investors feel confident about economic growth or higher interest rates.\nThe Japanese yen, on the other hand, has earned a reputation as a safe-haven currency: it tends to remain stable or even strengthen during periods of global uncertainty or market stress.\nEssentially, when investors are optimistic, they move capital into riskier assets, including the pound, seeking higher returns, which ultimately push GBP/JPY higher. On the other hand, during periods of global uncertainty, investors flock to safety, buying yen and selling pounds, which drives the pair down.\nIn this way, upward movements reflect risk-on sentiment and global confidence, while downward movements signal risk-off and a flight to safety.\nHow to Use This Information Across Markets\nAs we mentioned before, tracking GBP/JPY isn\u2019t just useful for forex traders \u2013 it can provide meaningful insight for your entire portfolio across multiple asset classes.\nThe reason for this is simple: the currency pair acts as a real-time benchmark of global investor sentiment and economic health, and sentiment is a primary driver of asset prices worldwide. By knowing whether investors are risk-on or risk-off, then, you can make your decisions far more informed across equities, commodities, bonds, or any other currencies.\nLet\u2019s say, for instance, you\u2019re applying a 5 minute scalping strategy in crude oil on a platform such as Exness. Even though oil isn\u2019t a currency, its price is going to react strongly to shifts in global risk sentiment. If GBP/JPY is climbing steadily \u2013 signalling a risk-on environment \u2013 it\u2019s going to be easier to anticipate short-term bullish momentum in crude oil as traders move into riskier assets.\nConversely, if GBP/JPY suddenly drops sharply, it could indicate an imminent risk-off move, meaning crude oil prices might experience a rapid decline. By monitoring the forex pair alongside your scalping charts, you effectively gain an early warning system.\nBecause the pair reacts almost instantly to changes in global sentiment \u2013 often before other markets fully price in these shifts \u2013 you can adjust your entries and exits quickly, confirming the strength of trends and avoiding false signals without having to rely solely on price action in the commodity itself.\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s the only indicator. On the contrary, if you\u2019re only relying on GBP/JPY sentiment to make your scalping decisions, you risk being caught off guard by short-term noise or reversals. But if you use it alongside solid technical analysis and the best indicators \u2013 such as mo"

The sharp reversal was a snapshot of how closely these products track the mood of the broader rates market.\nThe flows reflect seasoned traders\u2019 biggest fear: that rising long-term Treasury yields, driven by heavy supply and an uncertain CPI print, could tighten financial conditions and weigh on risk assets.\u201d\nAfter dipping toward $103,000 early in the week, the market lost support and fell toward $100,000 as traders paused ahead of the long-bond auction and today\u2019s CPI release. The pullback was brief and shallow, but echoed the same hesitation seen among ETF desks.\nThe price has remained in a tight range since the October peak near $126,000. This week\u2019s moves stayed within that band: strong when real yields eased, weaker when supply fears returned.\nTuesday\u2019s surge in ETF inflows didn\u2019t appear out of thin air. Treasury officials signaled that debt auctions would be adjusted gradually rather than expanded aggressively.\nThat was enough to lower the temperature in rates markets, with long-dated yields slipping and risk assets lifting. Bitcoin benefited from the reprieve.\nSpot liquidity improved, ETF creations picked up, and the spread between ETF market prices and underlying NAV compressed. When borrowing costs stabilize, Bitcoin often trades as if a weight was lifted, and ETF flows tend to follow.\nThis changed Wednesday, as the market faced a crucial 30-year auction. Long-bond supply is a pressure point into 2025, influencing equity valuations and the dollar\u2019s strength. Any dip in demand can quickly push yields higher.\nETF desks hesitated before the auction, leading to the $278 million outflow. Notable, but still within these funds\u2019 normal activity.\nThese flows matter less as day-to-day portfolio signals and more as a guide to who is providing the marginal support for Bitcoin when volatility picks up. The spot ETF complex has become the dominant gateway for institutional buyers.\nWhen creations swell, the market\u2019s depth thickens, selloffs feel gentler, and prices can stabilize in places that would previously have cracked. When flows soften, even briefly, Bitcoin trades with less cushion.\nThis week\u2019s discrepancy between inflows and outflows is a good example: Tuesday\u2019s rush helped Bitcoin absorb early selling, while Wednesday\u2019s pullback made the afternoon drift lower feel heavier.\nCPI (Consumer Price Index, a key inflation measure) added another layer of anticipation. Inflation data now acts as a pivot for positioning across all major risk assets.\nIf today\u2019s print comes in cooler than forecast, real yields (inflation-adjusted interest rates) typically decline, and ETF flows often improve as allocators shift back into risk-on mode. A hotter print usually pulls flows the other way.\nFor the average holder, it determines whether Bitcoin feels supported by large institutional hands or left to trade on thinner liquidity.\nThese shifts don\u2019t imply a directional verdict for Bitcoin, and the price action this week made that clear.\nEven with Wednesday\u2019s ETF outflows, Bitcoin stayed just north of $100,000, a level that has become a kind of psychological midpoint for traders. Spot markets continued to show steady buying interest from Asia and the U.S., and derivatives markets remained orderly.\nWhat changed wasn\u2019t sentiment in a broad sense, but the willingness of large allocators to press bets ahead of data that could nudge yields in either direction.\nThis is why it\u2019s important to track ETF flo"

From DeFi Summer to DeFi Stability\nAccording to Buterin, the leap in security standards since 2019 has been \u201cnight and day.\u201d Protocol audits, on-chain insurance systems, and formal verification tools have drastically reduced exploit risk. He admitted that high-profile breaches, such as the Balancer hack, still occur, but emphasized that the overall infrastructure is far more resilient.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a night and day difference in the kind of security that you can expect in 2025 versus 2020 or 2019,\u201d Buterin said.\nBREAKING: Vitalik Buterin has arrived to the \u20bfappers \u20bfrunch, Sponsored by Core\u2122 30. pic.twitter.com/FPQUvSTblT\n\u2014 Justin Bechler (@1914ad) November 12, 2025\nBlockchain analytics firm Elliptic estimates that 2025\u2019s total value lost to hacks is higher than last year\u2019s, but largely due to a single catastrophic exploit of Bybit in February.

Put together, it supports Buterin\u2019s argument that DeFi is growing.\nEthereum DeFi and the Fight Against Centralization: What\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\nAlongside his remarks, the Ethereum Foundation released The Trustless Manifesto, a document warning against creeping centralization. It criticizes trends such as hosted RPC nodes, centralized L2 sequencers, and cross-chain custodians. According to Buterin, these features threaten the decentralized ethos of the ecosystem.\n\u201cEvery system starts with good intentions,\u201d the manifesto states. \u201cOver time, gateways become platforms.

This strategic consolidation aims to address liquidity fragmentation and establish a central liquidity hub within the Ethereum ecosystem. With a combined total value locked (TVL) of $530 million\u2014$475 million from Aerodrome and $55 million from Velodrome\u2014the merger is poised to reshape the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.\nAero is set to launch in Q2 2026, with plans to expand its operations to the Ethereum mainnet and Circle\u2019s permissioned Arc blockchain. By consolidating assets across Base, Optimism, and Ethereum, Aero aims to capture 10\u201315% of Layer 2 DEX trading volume, positioning itself as a major player in the competitive Ethereum DEX market.\nExpansion to Ethereum Mainnet and Circle\u2019s Arc Blockchain\nAero\u2019s roadmap includes a significant milestone: its expansion to the Ethereum mainnet and Circle\u2019s Arc blockchain. This move is designed to enhance cross-chain functionality and attract both retail and institutional users.\nCircle\u2019s Arc blockchain, known for its compliance and institutional focus, offers Aero a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi. By integrating with Ethereum-compatible networks and Circle\u2019s Arc blockchain, Aero aims to provide seamless interoperability within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. This cross-chain capability is expected to streamline trading and improve user experience, making Aero a compelling choice for a diverse range of users.\nIntroducing METADEX03: A Game-Changing Operating System\nAero will operate on Dromos Labs\u2019 upgraded operating system, METADEX03, which introduces several innovative features designed to enhance efficiency and user experience:\nSlipstream V3 for MEV Capture: This feature minimizes value leakage by capturing Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), ensuring more value is retained within the ecosystem.\nMetaSwaps for Cross-Chain Trading: MetaSwaps enable seamless cross-chain trading, reducing friction and improving efficiency for users.\nEnhanced Liquidity Provider Returns: METADEX03 internalizes arbitrage revenue, lowers costs, and improves capital efficiency, making it more attractive for liquidity providers.\nThese technical upgrades are expected to set Aero apart from competitors by offering a more efficient and cost-effective trading experience.\nAERO Token Distribution and Governance Structure\nThe merger will introduce a new AERO token, replacing the existing AERO and VELO tokens. The token distribution reflects the revenue contributions of the two platforms, with 94.5% allocated to Aerodrome holders and 5.5% to Velodrome holders. This allocation ensures a fair distribution of value while unifying governance across the platform.\nAero\u2019s governance structure is designed to streamline incentives and foster community participation. By consolidating governance mechanisms, Aero aims to create a more cohesive and efficient decision-making process, further strengthening its position in the DeFi ecosystem.\nAddressing Liquidity Fragmentation Across Layer 2 and Ethereum\nLiquidity fragmentation has long been a challenge in the DeFi space, particularly across Layer 2 solutions and the Ethereum mainnet. Aero\u2019s unified platform seeks to address this issue by consolidating assets and providing a centralized liquidity hub. This approach not only improves trading efficiency but also enhances the overall user experience.\nBy capturing a significant share of Layer 2 DEX trading volume, Aero is positioned to challenge established players like Uniswap. Its focus on unifying liquidity across multiple chains gives it a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.\nComparison with Competitors in the Ethereum DEX Market\nThe Ethereum DEX market is highl"

                "body": "Keyrock + Glassnode: Bitcoin and Ethereum as Competing Store-of-Value\nIn partnership with Keyrock, we examine how Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit store-of-value traits by analysing their supply structure and usage profiles through Glassnode\u2019s on-chain lens.\nBitcoin remains one of the lowest-velocity major assets, with over 61% of supply held dormant for more than a year. Ethereum, by contrast, rotates supply at roughly twice Bitcoin\u2019s rate, reflecting a more active capital base. At the same time, exchange balances for both assets continue to contract, giving way to growing ETF holdings and institutional custody.\nIn our latest collaborative analysis with Keyrock, we unpack these shifts, examining how BTC and ETH are used today \u2014 and what that implies about their roles in the digital asset economy. Grounded in on-chain data, the report assesses where each asset sits on the Store-of-Value to Utility continuum, showing Bitcoin\u2019s dominant savings-asset profile and Ethereum\u2019s hybrid position as both reserve capital and working collateral within DeFi.\nKey highlights from the report:\n- Bitcoin diamond hands remain strong: More than 61% of supply hasn\u2019t moved in over a year, and daily turnover sits at just 0.61%, reinforcing Bitcoin\u2019s role as the market\u2019s dominant store of value.\n- Ethereum shows both utility and store of value behaviour: 1 out of 4 ETH is locked in native staking and ETFs. Yet it turns over at roughly twice BTC\u2019s rate, reflecting the dual nature of ETH as a hoarded, yet productive asset.\n- Dormancy between Bitcoin and Ethereum is diverging: ETH\u2019s long-term holders are mobilising their old coins at a rate that\u2019s 3x faster than BTC\u2019s long-term holders, pointing to utility-driven behaviour.\n- Ethereum powers the DeFi ecosystem: Around 16% of ETH supply is now deployed within liquid staking, and collateralised structures, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s dual role as a reserve asset and working collateral underpinning DeFi.\n- Exchange balances are falling as institutional wrappers expand: Exchange-held BTC has declined by ~1.5% and ETH nearly 18%, as assets move into ETFs and DATs.\nContext: Behavioural Framework & Definitions\nTraditional economics defines Store-of-Value (SoV) as an asset that maintains purchasing power over time and can be saved and retrieved without significant depreciation. To evaluate BTC and ETH through a \u201cstore-of-value to utility\u201d lens, we apply a behavioural framework using core Glassnode metrics and on-chain data:\n- Dormancy \u2013 how long coins are held, assessed through Average Coin Dormancy and HODL waves.\n- Turnover \u2013 how frequently coins move, or percentage of circulating or free float that changes addresses per day.\n- Exchange-held supply \u2013 share of circulating supply held in centralised-exchange addresses, assessed using Glassnode's entity-adjusted exchange balance metrics.\n- Anchored float \u2013 supply held in slow-mobilisation wrappers (staking, institutional custody, ETFs).\n- Productive float \u2013 supply deployed as collateral, in lending protocols, liquidity pools or restaked structures.\nAssets exhibit store-of-value traits when they show: high dormancy, low turnover, low exchange readiness, higher anchored float, and limited productive float.\nDormancy: Bitcoin's and Ethereum's Patterns Diverge\nBitcoin\u2019s supply continues to age, while Ethereum\u2019s supply continues to mobilise. Bitcoin\u2019s \u22651-year supply share is stable near 61%, indicating persistent long-term holding. Average coin dormancy for BTC has doubled over the past five years, despite temporary spikes driven by isolated legacy wallet movements.\nEthereum\u2019s \u22651-year share declined more notably \u2014 from ~56% to ~52% \u2014 and average dormancy increased sharply into late-2025. This shows that older ETH is being re-activated more frequently, consistent with staking rotations, collateral shifts, and arbitrage activity.\nEthereum's Hybrid Utility and SoV Behaviour\nEthereum\u2019s supply dynamics tell a different story. Long-term holders are mobilising older coins at three t"

While the identity of the team behind HumidiFi has so far remained a secret, the protocol plays an outsized role on the blockchain.\nData on how much revenue HumidiFi generates isn\u2019t public, but it handled almost $40 billion of trades over the past month, around a third of all trading on Solana, per DefiLlama data.\nIn addition to confirming HumidiFi was created by Temporal, one source shared screenshots of Telegram conversations in which Lucas Tcheyan, a researcher at Galaxy Digital, also confirmed the connection.\nTcheyan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDL News considered the sources credible due to their positions in the Solana developer community.\nTemporal founder Ben Coverston declined to comment when asked if his firm was behind HumidiFi, but did not deny it.\n\u201cNo comment,\u201d he said.\nDL News asked Coverston if he was denying the allegation.\n\u201cNo comment,\u201d Coverston repeated.\nSelling a token\nThe revelation that Temporal is behind HumidiFi comes as the project plans to sell a token to investors later this month.\nThat token, called WET, will launch on Decentralised Token Formation, a platform developed by Jupiter, a Solana exchange aggregator that works closely with HumidiFi.\nIt\u2019s not clear what function the WET token will serve. Still, investors are excited about the offering given HumidiFi\u2019s recent success.\nIn recent months, multiple other so-called dark automated market makers, or prop AMMs, have revealed their identities.\nMarket maker Wintermute confirmed to DL News in August that it runs Tessera V, a dark AMM that handled $6.6 billion of trades over the past month.\nIn May, Solana DeFi developer Ellipsis Labs publicly claimed credit for developing SolFi, another dark AMM whose creators were previously unknown.\nProminent player\nTemporal is a prominent player in the Solana developer ecosystem.\nThe firm built Nozomi, an execution layer for the Solana blockchain, which processes millions of transactions daily. It also recently spun out a separate firm to launch Harmonic, an open block-building infrastructure for Solana.\nThe firm also invests across the Solana ecosystem, and lists DoubleZero, Backpack, and Sanctum in its portfolio.\nSeveral of Temporal\u2019s team were previously involved with MarginFi, a Solana lending protocol. The project experienced a schism in April last year after co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned.\nCoverston told DL News that only about 30% of Temporal\u2019s team had previously been involved with MarginFi or its associated projects.\nWhat are dark exchanges?\nDark AMMs have risen in prominence over the past year.\nThese protocols operate behind the scenes. They usually don\u2019t have websites or let users provide liquidity to earn swap fees.\nInstead, they typically rely solely on the liquidity provided by their \u2014 often anonymous \u2014 creators, and only accept trades routed to them through exchange aggregators, like Jupiter.\nDark AMMs often outcompete conventional decentralised exchanges because they can actively manage their liquidity. They\u2019re also able to better defend against trading bots looking to profit at their expense.\nThis setup lets them offer users better prices on swaps, so exchange aggregators like Jupiter send more trades their way.\nDark AMMs accounted for around 70% of all trading on Solana over the past month, according to data from Blockworks Research.\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

As a result, capital has been flowing back into the ecosystem.\nThe new regulatory landscape turned XRP $2.30 24h volatility: 6.9% Market cap: $138.10 B Vol. 24h: $7.29 B from a litigation risk asset into a legitimate portfolio component for funds that had previously avoided it.\nThose structural wins sparked increased network activity and accumulation by large holders. XRP Tundra, a dual-chain DeFi project connecting the XRP Ledger and Solana, also gained attention. Its audited yield infrastructure is built on the newly legitimized XRPL base layer.\nThe project\u2019s foundation lies in interoperability. Instead of deploying a single chain and bridging later, the developers built XRP Tundra natively across two blockchains. TUNDRA-X, on the XRP Ledger, governs the system\u2019s reserve functions and voting rights. TUNDRA-S, deployed on Solana, manages staking, liquidity, and rewards.\nThis architecture combines XRPL\u2019s regulatory readiness with Solana\u2019s execution speed. Transactions settle rapidly on Solana while reserves remain transparent on XRPL. This approach aligns with how institutional finance designs custody and yield segregation.\nThe upcoming GlacierChain extension will further expand that framework by adding an XRPL Layer-2 for programmable staking logic and cross-chain verifications. That dual-layer structure answers a key question: can the system scale without fragmenting capital?\nUnlike Proof-of-Stake networks, XRP\u2019s consensus mechanism doesn\u2019t issue validator rewards. Its efficiency is unmatched, but holders have long faced the same limitation. Their assets generate no yield by default. XRP Tundra\u2019s Cryo Vaults change that equation by creating on-chain staking contracts that maintain full ledger visibility.\nVaults are divided into three categories:\nAll tiers require TUNDRA-S and are fully programmable through smart contracts audited prior to launch. These vaults don\u2019t lend XRP to third parties or convert it through centralized intermediaries. Returns are calculated within the ecosystem\u2019s own liquidity design.\nCrypto commentator HotCuppaCrypto analyzed the framework in a recent feature, describing it as \u201cyield architecture, not a promise\u201d. That precision appeals to larger investors who treat staking as an income instrument rather than a form of speculation.\nSecurity transparency has been central to Tundra\u2019s rollout. Before the presale opened, the contracts underwent three separate code reviews from Cyberscope, SolidProof, and FreshCoins. None reported critical or medium-severity issues.\nTo further close the credibility gap that often surrounds presales, the development entity completed Vital Block KYC verification, a step rarely taken by early-stage DeFi teams. The certificate links the founders to registered corporate identities, allowing investors to perform their own background checks.\nInvestors researching security often start with the same query: is XRP Tundra legit? This leads directly to the project\u2019s published audits and KYC verification. Every report is accessible there, allowing anyone to check results without relying on summaries or screenshots.\nThe current Phase 10 of XRP Tundra\u2019s presale offers TUNDRA-S at $0.158 with a 10% bonus, and provides TUNDRA-X at a $0.079 reference value. Listing prices have been confirmed at $2.5 and $1.25, defining transparent valuation parameters months before exchange launch.\nCumulative contributions have surpassed $2 million, with over $32,000 distributed through the Arctic Spinner incentive mechanism. It is a verifiable bonus system rewarding token purchases with additional TUNDRA-S spins based on contribution tiers.\nBecause all transactions are recorded directly on-chain, whale analysts can track inflows without intermediaries.\nLarge XRP holders typically move once a project\u2019s fundamentals are visible.

In this article, we\u2019ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question \u201cHow high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?\u201d and we\u2019ll try to answer that.\nOverview\nSolana price prediction: Technical analysis\nSolana price analysis: SOL falls to $156\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- Solana price analysis shows decline back to $153\n- Resistance for SOL is at $170\n- Support for SOL/USD is at $150\nThe price analysis of Solana for November 12 shows that SOL has declined back to $153 as bears continue to dominate the crypto markets.\nSolana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls back to $153\nSolana observed bearish pressure as SOL fell to the $180 mark before recovering back to the $200 level. However, the price faced resistance at the level and fell back to the $180 mark where it found short-term support. Now, the price has fallen to the $153 mark as higher supports crumble to the rising bearish pressure.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 35.66, which reflects the recent trend, showing bearish pressure across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line falls steadily, suggesting mounting selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show bearish momentum as the indicator trades at -1.09 showing increasing bearish momentum.\nSOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face resistance above $170\nThe 4-hour chart for Solana shows that the price oscillated between the $155 and the $165 levels as either side struggled to gain momentum. However, the recent rise to the $170 mark and the subsequent rejection has caused a decline sending the price to the $153 price level where SOL finds short-term support.\nFrom a technical perspective, the MACD shows falling bearish momentum at -1.08, with the indicator showing falling selling pressure as SOL falls below $155. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) falls to around 38.15, indicating that Solana observes rising bearish momentum at the price level. The current Index level shows room for further downwards movement across the short-term.\nSolana technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat to expect from Solana price analysis?\nThe Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates support around $155 with next support at $146. The chart suggests that further downwards movement is unlikely across the short-term.\nAs the price struggles below $160, SOL can be expected to hold above the $150 level and consolidate before moving significantly. However, if the price fails to hold at the level and establish foothold above $170, SOL may fall below the $145 support continuing the bearish trend.\nIs SOL a good investment?\nSolana i"

                "body": "The UK economy has hit a snag, with weaker-than-expected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the third quarter of 2025 sending ripples of concern through financial markets. This sluggish economic performance, announced on November 13, 2025, has directly contributed to a significant slide in the FTSE 100 index (INDEXUK: UKX), which closed down 1.05% on the day, after having touched record highs earlier in the month. The immediate implications are a weaker Pound Sterling, heightened expectations for an interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE), and a generally subdued investor sentiment that extends beyond British shores into the broader European markets.\nThis economic deceleration suggests a challenging period ahead for the UK, as businesses and consumers grapple with persistent headwinds. The confluence of disappointing growth figures and a retreating benchmark index paints a picture of an economy struggling to find its footing, prompting analysts to reassess their outlook for both the short and long term.\nDetailed Economic Downturn and Market Response\nThe UK's economic expansion in Q3 2025 proved to be a significant disappointment, with GDP growing by a mere 0.1% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), falling short of the market's 0.2% forecast and decelerating from the 0.3% growth seen in Q2. On a monthly basis, September witnessed a contraction of 0.1%, defying expectations for flat growth. Annually, Q3 GDP rose by 1.3%, also below the anticipated 1.4%. This sluggishness was attributed to a multi-faceted slowdown across several key sectors.\nThe services and construction sectors experienced a notable deceleration, while the production sector contracted. A particularly sharp drop in car manufacturing, down 28.6% month-on-month in September, partly due to a cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover (LSE: JLR), significantly impacted the figures. The pharmaceutical industry also saw a decline, and overall business investment fell by 0.3% QoQ. These factors, combined with higher taxes and soft overseas activity, created a challenging environment for the UK economy to gain momentum.\nThe FTSE 100's reaction on November 13, 2025, was swift and negative. The index, which had earlier in November reached an all-time high of 9,930.09 points, retreated to close at 9,807.68. Beyond the GDP figures, the slide was exacerbated by weaker-than-expected corporate earnings from major companies such as Aviva (LSE: AV) and 3i Group (LSE: III), alongside muted oil prices which weighed on energy giants like BP (LSE: BP) and Shell (LSE: SHEL). The Pound Sterling (GBP) also immediately weakened against both the Euro (EUR) and the US Dollar (USD), a reaction compounded by earlier weak employment data showing the unemployment rate rising to 5.0% in September, its highest since February 2021.\nKey players involved in this unfolding economic narrative include the Bank of England, whose monetary policy decisions are now under intense scrutiny; the UK government, particularly Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who faces increased pressure ahead of an anticipated budget later in November; and the various sectors and companies whose performance dictates the broader economic health. Initial market reactions clearly signal a loss of confidence and a recalibration of expectations, with bond yields slipping as investors brace for potential interest rate cuts.\nCompanies Navigating the Economic Headwinds: Winners and Losers\nThe weaker-than-expected UK GDP growth and the subsequent FTSE 100 slide create a divergent landscape for public companies, with some poised to benefit from defensive positions or international exposure, while others face significant headwinds due to their reliance on domestic consumer spending and business investment.\nCompanies operating in defensive sectors are generally better positioned to weather the economic storm. Consumer Staples firms, providing essential goods like food and household products, tend to maintain stable demand. Giants such as Unilever (LSE: UL"

                "body": "Published on: 2025-11-13\nThe London stock market opened lower this morning following the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which revealed a surprising 0.1% contraction in UK GDP for September, falling short of expectations for flat growth.\nThe FTSE 100, which closed last night at a fresh high, dropped roughly 33 points (0.34%) to around 9,877 early in trading, reflecting investor concern about slowing growth and its implications for monetary policy and corporate earnings.\nThe FTSE 100's dip today is modest but telling as markets are factoring in that slower growth may squeeze corporate earnings and reduce risk appetite.\nAccording to Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown:\n\"The FTSE 100 is down at the open, looking weaker than early futures prices had anticipated. Investors are choosing to take a negative view of the double-edged sword that is GDP.\"\nIn other words, markets interpret the data both as a signal of economic weakness and as a catalyst for potential policy adjustments.\nWith GDP shrinking and inflation still elevated in parts of the economy, the Bank of England (BoE) may feel more pressure to cut interest rates in December as markets currently price in over an 80% probability of a quarter-point cut.\nA rate cut would normally boost equities, but in today's environment, the fact that a cut is being priced because of weak growth rather than recovery may dampen enthusiasm, especially for banks and financial-sensitive sectors.\nAutomotive and manufacturing firms are directly impacted, as the steep 28.6% decline in motor vehicle production significantly weighed on overall GDP.\nWhile the services and construction sectors may be insulated, they still face challenges from weak demand and rising costs.\nExporters and international companies could benefit from a weaker pound if the economic slowdown continues, provided global demand remains stable.\nThe ONS monthly estimate shows that real GDP fell by 0.1% in September 2025, following no growth in August (revised down from +0.1%).\nThat drop is significant because economists had forecast flat or minimal growth.\nMore broadly, for the quarter (July-Sept), GDP grew by just 0.1%, down from 0.3% in the April-June quarter.\nProduction output fell sharply by 2.0% in September, largely driven by a 28.6% decline in motor vehicle manufacturing.\nA significant portion of this drop was because of a major cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which forced the company to halt production at its UK plants for several weeks.\nServices output grew, but only by 0.2%. Construction also expanded by 0.2%.\nReal GDP per head showed no growth for the quarter, underscoring weak productivity and population-adjusted output.\nThis weak patch comes at a fragile moment for the UK economy: consumer price pressures, elevated interest rates, and fiscal uncertainty (with the upcoming Budget) all compound risks.\nThe unexpected slump adds fuel to concerns that the economy might be losing momentum.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves's Budget, set for later this month (November 26), will be scrutinised for how much it tightens or loosens policy.\nWith growth subdued, taxpayers may be cautious about tax increases or spending cuts, but markets are likely to respond sensitively to any signs of renewed economic momentum.\nThe September data is an initial estimate as revisions are possible. Meanwhile, look for updates on employment, manufacturing output, and business investment, which could confirm or counter the weak signal from GDP.\nWatch for tone from BoE Governor Andrew Bailey and other policymakers. If they shift toward a \"cut sooner\" narrative, fixed-income markets may rally, and bank stocks may come under pressure.\nGiven weakness in production, sectors such as industrials, autos and manufacturing may underperform.\nConversely, exporters (which benefit from a weaker pound) or defensive sectors may gain favour. Also monitor the pound sterling if it dips following the GDP print.\nIn conclus"

                "body": "FTSE 100 LIVE: London Stocks Slip After UK GDP Data Shows Contraction\nIn the latest trading session, the FTSE 100 index is under pressure as weak economic data from the UK spooks investors. The British economy has shown signs of strain, and this has weighed heavily on market sentiment. The FTSE 100 has slipped as traders await signs of how the slowdown will impact corporate earnings, interest\u2011rate decisions and global investor flows.\nUK Economic Weakness Sparks Investor Concern\nThe UK economy recently reported a very modest or contracting growth rate, raising serious questions about the pace of recovery. According to data, growth has been almost flat or slightly negative, prompting concerns among institutional investors. Investors monitoring the stock market are taking note that this weak growth may pressure companies, especially those in consumer\u2011facing or UK\u2011centric sectors.\nFor the FTSE 100, which includes many large multinational companies, the impact is two\u2011fold: weak domestic demand could hurt UK earnings and a weak economy may limit the ability of the banking & financial sector to expand. Analysts also point to the fact that when economic data disappoints, interest\u2011rate expectations and fiscal policy become murky, which in turn affects stock valuations.\nHow the FTSE 100 is Responding Right Now\nIn reaction to the subdued economic backdrop, the FTSE 100 has shown a drop in performance. According to reporting, the benchmark index is slipping amid growing caution from investors. Key sectors such as retail, leisure, financials and domestic\u2011economy companies are under pressure.\nFor example, one report noted: \u201cThe UK economy grew just 0.1% in August, prompting the FTSE 100 to drift lower as market participants digested the weak data and the policy implications.\u201d With the UK economy not showing signs of strong momentum, the FTSE 100 may face headwinds unless broader global growth or corporate earnings offset the domestic weakness.\nPolicy and Market Implications \u2013 Stock Research Focus\nFrom a stock\u2011research standpoint, weak GDP data is important because it affects expectations for interest rates, fiscal spending and corporate profits. With the UK economy faltering, the Bank of England may be less able to support growth via cuts or stimulative policy, or at least must act more cautiously. This adds risk to the stock market.\nFor investors comparing sectors, including those following AI stocks, technology stocks, or growth themes, the FTSE 100 story reminds us that even large indices are vulnerable to macro risk. The benchmark might offer dividend strength, but its sensitivity to UK economic conditions cannot be ignored. In a broader sense, if global investors start treating UK exposure as higher risk, funds may flow into other markets or into sectors less tied to domestic growth.\nKey Drivers Behind the Drop\nSeveral factors are combining to drag down the FTSE 100:\n- Domestic demand weakness: With slow growth, consumer spending and business investment may lag, hurting companies.\n- Fiscal and interest\u2011rate uncertainty: Sluggish GDP raises the risk of weaker growth and fewer policy tools, making investors wary.\n- Sectoral vulnerabilities: Companies with strong UK exposure, leisure, retail, and banks, are more exposed than global multinationals.\n- Global context: While UK growth is weak, other markets may be performing better. Investors may rotate away from UK equities into growth markets, including those tracking AI stocks or technology\u2011driven firms.\n- Valuation risks: When macro outlooks fade, valuations that looked attractive in benign conditions may become stretched.\nWhat to Watch Next\nFor those doing stock research or following the FTSE 100 closely, here are key indicators to monitor:\n- Upcoming UK GDP and economic releases: Any further weakness could deepen investor concerns.\n- Bank of England signals: What path will interest rates take? If rate cuts are delayed, equities may suffer further.\n- Fiscal announcements / Budget papers:"

The group also unveiled plans to deconsolidate Siemens Healthineers, reducing its stake from about 67% to ~37% via a direct share spin\u2011off to Siemens AG investors, a move pitched as sharpening focus on automation, software and mobility. The earnings miss and \u201cspin\u2011off math\u201d prompted profit\u2011taking across industrials. [5]\nSiemens\u2019 official press release confirmed the intended 30% distribution of Healthineers shares to Siemens AG shareholders, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, with more details expected in early Q2 2026.

The bill was signed by President Donald Trump in the late evening, officially ending the longest US government shutdown in history.\nNow Wall Street is focused on the backlog of government data that was delayed because of the shutdown \u2014 and how it might impact the Federal Reserve\u2019s outlook for the economy.\n\u201cLacking fresh economic data, markets have become increasingly jittery in recent weeks,\u201d Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note. \u201cNow, as the government shutdown ends, each long-awaited data release or policy announcement will have the potential to move markets dramatically.\u201d\nThe Dow, S&P and Nasdaq each had their worst day since October 10, when a flare up in US-China trade tensions sent stocks lower.\nCNN\u2019s Fear and Greed index moved from \u201cfear\u201d into \u201cextreme fear.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 18% as volatility picked up.\n\u201cThe gears of the government should be working again soon, and while that is a relief for markets and the economy, there is still plenty of uncertainty, particularly around the missed inflation and jobs data and how these fronts have been faring,\u201d Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, said in an email.\nTraders on Thursday were pricing in roughly a 52% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That\u2019s down from a 63% chance on Wednesday and a 96% chance one month ago.\n\u201cThe data blackout has made the Federal Reserve\u2019s job difficult, but we still expect them to cut interest rates again in December,\u201d Schleif said. \u201cWe expect markets to grind higher \u2014 though likely with continued volatility.\u201d\nThe sell-off in stocks worsened in the afternoon. The third-quarter earnings season is also winding down, meaning there are fewer fundamental catalysts, and markets are more susceptible to moves based on investor sentiment.\nTech woes continue\nTech stocks have come under pressure in recent weeks as investors have voiced concerns about relatively expensive valuations. There has been rising skepticism about whether AI companies will be able to produce enough profits to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place.\nTesla shares (TSLA) fell 6.6%. Palantir shares (PLTR) fell 6.5%, and Nvidia shares (NVDA) fell 3.6%. Oracle shares (ORCL) fell 4.15%.\n\u201cInvestors are reevaluating the prices they\u2019re paying for big tech and AI stocks,\u201d said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird.\nAfter a strong tech rally in recent months, investors have been taking profits and rotating into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.\nThe Nasdaq has dropped nearly 5% since closing at a record high on October 29. The tech-heavy index has shed almost $2 trillion in market value across that time period.\nSameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he recently trimmed some of his exposure to tech.\n\u201cIt just had such a monstrous run that it just made sense to take the profits and find other opportunities,\u201d Samana said.\nThe Dow\u2019s Thursday decline comes after back-to-back days of record highs. The blue-chip index closed above 48,000 points for the first time ever on Wednesday as investors moved into sectors including financials and health care.\nWalt Disney shares (DIS) fell 7.8% on Thursday after the company reported earnings that did not impress Wall Street.\nElsewhere, bitcoin fell roughly 3.3% on Thursday and traded around $98,250.

                "body": "Despite the positive news of the U.S. federal government ending the 43-day shutdown (temporary work stoppage), the New York stock market fell across the board. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index dropped over 2%, extending its recent decline. Investors appeared influenced by concerns that stock prices of artificial intelligence (AI)-related companies are overvalued, as well as expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged next month.\nConcerns over overvaluation of AI-related stocks\nOn the 13th (local time), all three major New York stock indices declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.65%, the S&P 500 Index dropped 1.66%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 2.29%. This marked the third time in two weeks that the S&P 500 fell over 1%, a sharp contrast to the previous three months, when it had only once declined by more than 1%.\nA broad sell-off in large tech stocks dragged down the Nasdaq. NVIDIA fell 3.58%, Tesla dropped 6.64%, AMD declined 4.22%, Amazon slid 2.71%, Microsoft fell 1.54%, Broadcom dropped 4.29%, and Alphabet slid 2.89%. U.S. financial news outlet CNBC reported, \u201cInvestors continued to sell tech stocks amid concerns over the valuation of AI-related shares.\u201d Tech stocks had surged over 50% from April to late last month. Kevin Gordon, macroeconomic research head at Charles Schwab, told the Financial Times, \u201cOvervalued markets tend to suffer when anxiety sets in,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is part of the market\u2019s digestion process.\u201d\nGrowing calls within the Fed for \u2018rate freeze\u2019\nThe overall market decline was also driven by growing expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), meeting on September 9\u201310, will keep rates unchanged. In September, the Fed signaled through its dot plot that two additional rate cuts\u2014one in October and one in December\u2014were possible. However, with the economy showing stronger-than-expected resilience, speculation has grown that the Fed may shift its stance. Alberto Musalem, president of the St. Louis Fed, who has a vote in the upcoming meeting, said at a public event, \u201cWe need to proceed cautiously and move carefully regarding rate cuts.\u201d Beth Hammack, president of the Cleveland Fed, also stated, \u201cTo maintain a tight monetary policy stance, it is necessary to keep the benchmark rate at its current level.\u201d Though she does not have a vote in this meeting, her remarks carry weight as she will have voting rights next year.\nSimilar comments emerged the previous day. Susan Collins, president of the Boston Fed and a voting member in the rate-setting meeting, said, \u201cIn this highly uncertain environment, it would be appropriate to maintain the policy rate at its current level for some time to balance inflation and employment risks.\u201d Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta Fed, who does not have a vote, also stated, \u201cDespite a slowdown in the labor market, the more immediate and pressing risk to the economy remains price stability,\u201d reflecting the Fed\u2019s growing caution toward rate cuts.\nThis uncertainty was compounded by the federal government shutdown. The 43-day shutdown delayed the release of key economic reports, including the October employment data and inflation figures. Wall Street has referred to this situation as \u201cflying blind,\u201d heightening concerns over uncertainty. Markets have gradually lowered expectations for rate cuts. The CME FedWatch Tool, a U.S. interest rate prediction model, showed that while expectations for a 0.25 percentage point rate cut had exceeded 60% just last week, they fell sharply to 51.9% on the day."
