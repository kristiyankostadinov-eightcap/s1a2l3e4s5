Futures are agreements to buy or sell the asset at a pre-determined date in the future.\nThe US government shutdown, which was triggered by repeated impasses over public spending, is a \"tailwind for gold prices\", said OCBC's Christopher Wong, who is the Singapore-based bank's rates strategist.\nInvestors have turned to safe haven assets like gold during previous US government shutdowns.\nIt rose by nearly 4% during the month-long shutdown in Trump's first term in the White House.\nBut gold prices could fall if the shutdown ends more quickly than some investors are expecting, said Mr Wong.\nGold's \"unprecedented rally\" in the past month has surpassed analysts' expectations, said UOB bank's head of markets strategy Heng Koon How.\nHe added that the rise is also tied to the weakening US dollar and more non-professional buyers, known as retail investors, purchasing gold.\nNot everyone investing in gold buys the physical precious metal.\nSome investors put their money into financial products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are backed by gold.\nA record $64bn has been invested in gold ETFs so far this year, according to the World Gold Council trade association.\nGregor Gregerson, the founder of precious metals dealer and storage provider Silver Bullion, said he has seen customers numbers more than double in the last year.\nRetail investors, banks and wealthy families have increasingly turned to gold, viewing it as a safeguard against global economic uncertainty, he said.\n\"Most of our clients are long-term holders,\" Mr Gregersen added, explaining that the majority of his customers store their gold for more than four years.\n\"Gold will fall at some point, but I believe given the economic environment, it's on an upward trend for at least five years,\" he said.\nAs Mr Gregersen highlighted, gold prices fall as well as rise.\nIts price may dip if there is a hike in interest rates or geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties ease, said OCBC's Mr Wong.\nIn April, for instance, the price of gold fell by around 6% after Trump backed off from firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said.\n\"Gold is often seen as a hedge against uncertainty, but the hedge can be unwound.\"\nAnd in 2022, gold's value plunged from $2,000 to $1,600 an ounce, after the US central bank raised interest rates to curb the inflation which was triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, said UOB's Mr Heng.\nA key risk to gold's current rally is a sudden resurgence in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates, he added.\nThe recent climb in gold prices reflects expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates, making gold more attractive, said Mr Wong.\nMeanwhile, Trump has ramped up pressure on the Fed, publicly criticising Mr Powell for not cutting rates quick enough and attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\nThe president's targeting of the Fed can \"undermine confidence in the [its] ability to act as a credible, inflation-targeting central bank,\" said Mr Wong.\nIn such an envir"

That said, there are some tentative voices calling for a restart of negotiations to tackle the healthcare-related issues. The best-case scenario for an 11-15 day shutdown is gradually fading.\nMeanwhile, developments in Japan are fueling investors\u2019 angst. Following Takaichi\u2019s weekend win, the focus quickly shifted to the upcoming Diet vote to approve her as the new prime minister. However, the market has probably run ahead of itself, as there have been complications in the negotiations between the LDP and Komeito, the junior partner in the current minority government and LDP\u2019s traditional ally. If this deadlock is not overcome quickly, then Takaichi\u2019s future looks bleak, with other solutions, even in the form of a new prime minister, possibly on the cards.\nThis extra round of uncertainty has pushed dollar/yen above the 151.93 level for the first time since February 14, with verbal interventions expected to return with a vengeance to limit the yen\u2019s underperformance. If the LDP-Komeito negotiations prove fruitful and Takaichi is eventually approved by the Diet, there is an avenue for a reversal of the current rally in dollar/yen.\nFrench President Macron Seeks a Way Out of the Current Crisis\nThe political situation in France is even more challenging, as President Macron is still searching for a viable solution. If the last-minute effort by outgoing PM Lecornu to form a new cabinet fails, fresh parliamentary elections could become the baseline scenario. However, another hung parliament could only prolong the current situation. French sovereign bonds remain under pressure, with the 10-year yield trading at the same levels as the Italian equivalent, and around 85bps above the German Bund yield.\nThis continued political unrest is also increasing the chances of snap presidential election. Macron, who cannot be a candidate at the next election scheduled for 2027, might opt to act strategically and save face in an attempt to position himself for a comeback in 2032. But this is probably a scenario that could materialize in 2026.\nBoth Gold and Dollar Rally\nThe main beneficiary of the ongoing uncertainty is gold, with the precious metal climbing above the $4,000 level, reaching a new all-time high of $4,040, with the year-to-date rally reaching 53%. That said, voices of concern multiply, highlighting that when your primary safe haven asset is the best performing one, it is an indication of unhealthy market dynamics.\nUS Dollar bulls do not seem worried though, as the greenback is posting gains across the board this week. This outperformance appears to be a typical risk-off reaction, particularly combined with the weakness seen in the cryptocurrencies.\nEquity Markets Take Notice, but Not in Crisis Mode Yet\nMeanwhile, US equities are reacting calmly to the latest newsflow as the ongoing AI-related investments are easing investors\u2019 concerns. That said, a correction in US indices remains possible, particularly as the US government shutdown persists. Interestingly, a couple of negative trading sessions could prove a powerful catalyst to get the funding bill negotiations back on track.\nBusier Calendar Despite the Absence of US Data\nWith the US shutdown depriving markets of fresh oxygen, the focus today will shift to Fedspeak and the minutes of the mid-September FOMC meeting. At least four Fed members will be on the wires today, mostly hawks, increasing the r"

                "body": "EIA expects substantial increase in global oil inventories\nKey Highlights\n- Global oil inventories are expected to rise through 2026, putting downward pressure on prices.\n- China\u2019s stockpiling has helped limit price declines, even as global supply increases.\n- US crude oil production hit a record of over 13.6 million b/d in July, with forecasts remaining steady at around 13.5 million b/d through 2026.\n- Uncertainties remain regarding China\u2019s future oil demand and the ability of OPEC+ members to meet production targets, influencing the global supply outlook.\nThe US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects global oil inventories to rise through 2026, leading to significant downward pressure on oil prices in the coming months. EIA, in its October Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), forecasts Brent crude oil prices will drop to an average of$62/bbl in fourth-quarter 2025 and $52/bbl in 2026.\nBrent crude oil spot prices averaged $68/bbl in September, unchanged from August average. Several factors have likely offset strong growth in supply to keep oil prices relatively stable in recent months, EIA noted.\n\"One likely factor is China\u2019s additions to its oil stockpiles. China does not report data on its oil inventories,\" EIA said, but \"based on imports, exports, refining data, and oil inventory data from third-party and official sources, we [EIA] assess that China has accumulated significant oil inventories this year.\nBecause China\u2019s inventory builds have been strategic in nature,\" EIA continued, \"they have potentially acted as a source of demand, limiting downward price pressures more than our estimated balances would otherwise suggest.\"\n\u201cIt is also possible that global oil demand was higher over the summer than we currently estimate. The lag in actual oil demand data, particularly outside of the OECD, means that our estimates for global demand for second-quarter 2025 and third-quarter 2025 are still a mix of model results and initial data observations for much of the world,\" EIA said.\nInventory builds are significant even with expectation that OPEC+ will produce below its targets in the coming months, according to EIA forecasts. Along with strong production growth among non-OPEC countries, the forecast increase in global oil inventories is based on the OPEC+ announcements to increase the group\u2019s oil production.\n\u201cOPEC+ began increasing production in April 2025, and for much of this year, the group\u2019s production has been close to its targets. Last month, the group increased production targets through October 2025, but there is uncertainty regarding some members\u2019 ability to reach the targets given near term limits on spare capacity,\u201d EIA said.\nAccording to EIA, global production growth is led by countries outside of OPEC+, where production is expected to rise by 2.0 million b/d in 2025 and by 0.7 million b/d in 2026. OPEC+ is expected to increase total liquids production by 0.6 million b/d in both 2025 and 2026, as the group unwinds crude oil production cuts. However, according to EIA, OPEC+ production will remain below announced targets, preventing inventory builds from accelerating too quickly and limiting the decrease in oil prices.\nGlobal liquid fuels consumption by non-OECD countries is expected to grow by 1.2 million b/d in 2025 and 1.0 million b/d in 2026, while OECD consumption is forecast to fall by 0.1 million b/d in 2025 before increasing by 0.1 million b/d in 2026, according to EIA. Most non-OECD growth is concentrated in Asia, with liquid fuels consumption in India and China adding more than 0.4 million b/d of consumption by 2026 compared with 2024.\nIn EIA\u2019s forecast, global oil inventories will increase by an average of 2.1 million b/d in 2026, compared with an average annual increase of 1.9 million b/d in 2025. The pace at which China continues to purchase oil to fill inventory and any major supply disruptions are key forecast uncertainties.\nUS crude production\nIn July, US crude oil production averaged more than 13.6 m"

What's next for the oil and gas market in 2025?\nThe oil market struggled in Q3 as prices continued to soften under mounting supply pressure.\nFollowing moderate gains in H1, prices contracted to end the third quarter lower than their July 1 start positions.\nBrent crude began the period at US$67.10 per barrel and finished at US$65.90, a 1.7 percent decline. Similarly, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) entered the 90 day session at US$65.55 per barrel, slipping to US$62.33 by September 30.\nIn its recently released energy, oil and gas report for the third quarter, Deloitte attributes the summer price slump to rising global oil inventories, as well as OPEC+ easing production cuts sooner than expected.\n\u201cOPEC+ recently announced a 137 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d) production quota increase for October, beginning the reversal of 1.65 MMbbl/d of voluntary cuts that were originally set to stay in place through 2026,\u201d it reads.\nSupply exceeded demand in the US by 1.6 MMbbl/d between May and August, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), fueling projections of further stock builds for the remainder of the year.\n\u201cWe expect inventory builds will average 2.1 MMbbl/d in the second half of 2025 and will remain elevated through 2026, putting significant downward pressure on oil prices,\u201d the EIA notes in its September short-term energy forecast.\nWTI price performance, December 31, 2024, to October 6, 2025.\nChart via the Investing News Network.\nOil prices under pressure amid rising inventories, sluggish demand\nIn an interview with the Investing News Network (INN), Josef Schachter of the Schachter Energy Report explained that as US oil inventories climb, price pressure builds. He noted that the latest EIA report shows a 7.2 million barrel build in total stocks, with commercial crude up 1.8 million barrels and gasoline inventories 4.1 million barrels higher.\nSuch gains are unusual for the shoulder season, when demand typically dips to around 103 to 104 MMbbl/d, compared to 106 MMbbl/d in the summer and winter, Schachter pointed out.\nOn the flip side, global oil demand in the third quarter remained subdued, with growth projections of approximately 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) for both 2025 and 2026, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nThis marks a significant slowdown compared to the 2.8 percent growth observed in 2024.\nThe IEA attributes this deceleration to factors such as high interest rates, economic uncertainties and structural shifts in energy consumption patterns. Looking ahead, the organization projects a modest rebound in global oil demand, with an anticipated increase of 700,000 bpd in 2026. However, this growth is contingent upon factors such as economic stabilization, energy policy developments and potential shifts in global trade dynamics.\n\u201cDemand is weaker. Inventories are high, OPEC is raising production, and so we have all of that, and we think that we're going to see WTI below US$60,\u201d said Schachter, adding that he expects WTI values to sink to the US$56 to US$59 range in the fourth quarter.\nGeopolitical tensions drive oil price volatility\nMuch of the oil price volatility exhibited in the third quarter was driven by geopolitical factors, according to Igor Isaev, Doctor of Technical Sciences and head of Mind Money's Analytics Center.\n\u201cCrude oil markets in 2025 have been, indeed, anything but predictable,\" he told INN via email.\n\"Prices have swung sharply, driven by a complex interplay of geopolitical flashpoints, punitive trade policies and structural changes in supply dynamics. From Tehran to Texas, the forces shaping global energy are no longer cyclical \u2014 they\u2019ve become groundbreaking, unveiling symptoms of a broader recalibration of energy security and sovereignty.\u201d\nAs Isaev explained, while these forces aren't new, they have been especially impactful amid"

                "body": "Oil and Gas Price Update: Q3 2025 in Review\nGeopolitics, trade tensions and economic woes infused the energy sector with volatility in Q3. What's next for the oil and gas market in 2025?\nThe oil market struggled in Q3 as prices continued to soften under mounting supply pressure.\nFollowing moderate gains in H1, prices contracted to end the third quarter lower than their July 1 start positions.\nBrent crude began the period at US$67.10 per barrel and finished at US$65.90, a 1.7 percent decline. Similarly, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) entered the 90 day session at US$65.55 per barrel, slipping to US$62.33 by September 30.\nIn its recently released energy, oil and gas report for the third quarter, Deloitte attributes the summer price slump to rising global oil inventories, as well as OPEC+ easing production cuts sooner than expected.\n\u201cOPEC+ recently announced a 137 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d) production quota increase for October, beginning the reversal of 1.65 MMbbl/d of voluntary cuts that were originally set to stay in place through 2026,\u201d it reads.\nSupply exceeded demand in the US by 1.6 MMbbl/d between May and August, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), fueling projections of further stock builds for the remainder of the year.\n\u201cWe expect inventory builds will average 2.1 MMbbl/d in the second half of 2025 and will remain elevated through 2026, putting significant downward pressure on oil prices,\u201d the EIA notes in its September short-term energy forecast.\nWTI price performance, December 31, 2024, to October 6, 2025.\nChart via the Investing News Network.\nOil prices under pressure amid rising inventories, sluggish demand\nIn an interview with the Investing News Network (INN), Josef Schachter of the Schachter Energy Report explained that as US oil inventories climb, price pressure builds. He noted that the latest EIA report shows a 7.2 million barrel build in total stocks, with commercial crude up 1.8 million barrels and gasoline inventories 4.1 million barrels higher.\nSuch gains are unusual for the shoulder season, when demand typically dips to around 103 to 104 MMbbl/d, compared to 106 MMbbl/d in the summer and winter, Schachter pointed out.\nOn the flip side, global oil demand in the third quarter remained subdued, with growth projections of approximately 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) for both 2025 and 2026, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nThis marks a significant slowdown compared to the 2.8 percent growth observed in 2024.\nThe IEA attributes this deceleration to factors such as high interest rates, economic uncertainties and structural shifts in energy consumption patterns. Looking ahead, the organization projects a modest rebound in global oil demand, with an anticipated increase of 700,000 bpd in 2026. However, this growth is contingent upon factors such as economic stabilization, energy policy developments and potential shifts in global trade dynamics.\n\u201cDemand is weaker. Inventories are high, OPEC is raising production, and so we have all of that, and we think that we're going to see WTI below US$60,\u201d said Schachter, adding that he expects WTI values to sink to the US$56 to US$59 range in the fourth quarter.\nGeopolitical tensions drive oil price volatility\nMuch of the oil price volatility exhibited in the third quarter was driven by geopolitical factors, according to Igor Isaev, Doctor of Technical Sciences and head of Mind Money's Analytics Center.\n\u201cCrude oil markets in 2025 have been, indeed, anything but predictable,\" he told INN via email.\n\"Prices have swung sharply, driven by a complex interplay of geopolitical flashpoints, punitive trade policies and structural changes in supply dynamics. From Tehran to Texas, the forces shaping global energy are no longer cyclical \u2014 they\u2019ve become groundbreaking, unveiling symptoms of a broader recalibration of energy security and sovereignty.\u201d\nAs Isaev explained, while these forces aren't new, they have been especially impactful amid"

                "body": "EUR/USD ticks up from lows as France's Lecornu calms investors\n- The Euro depreciates for the third consecutive day, reaching levels near 1.1600.\n- The political impasse in France keeps the Euro under pressure.\n- The lack of progress to restore US government funding is starting to boost the Dollar on risk-averse flows.\nEUR/USD is trimming previous losses and trades near the 1.1630 area at the time of writing, up from session lows at 1.1607. Comments from Frances' former Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu, dismissing the possibility of new elections and assuring that there will be a budget before the end of the year, have soothed markets and eased negative pressure on the Euro.\nThe Common currency had come under increasing pressure earlier on the day as pressure on French President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap election mounted amid growing criticism from his own ranks. Former allies have joined the demands of opposition parties to call elections or resign, and rating agencies have warned of a further downgrade of France's sovereign credit status if the political impasse drags on.\nAcross the Atlantic, the political scenario is not much better. US Senate Democratic and Republican leaders remain unable to find a way to restart funding as the shutdown enters its second week, and hopes of a breakthrough this week have fallen to 23% according to a poll by Polymarket. The lack of progress has started to erode market sentiment, boosting demand for the US Dollar and other traditional safe havens.\nOn Wednesday's economic calendar, the minutes of the last Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting will be the main diversion from the political drama. During the European session, European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, including President Christine Lagarde, will take the stage, and some Fed officials are expected to speak during the US session.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily digest market movers: Political uncertainty hurts the Euro\n- The growing political uncertainty in France keeps bleeding the Euro this week, while investors' concerns about a prolonged shutdown of the US federal government have started to hurt market sentiment and boost demand for the safe-haven USD. In the absence of key macroeconomic data to alter this view, the bearish EUR/USD trend has further room to go.\n- On Wednesday, France's recently resigned Prime Minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, assured that he is going to present a solution to President Macron later today and affirmed that \"the dissolution of the parliament is becoming more remote\". These comments have given some air to an ailing Euro, but the broader trend remains strongly bearish.\n- On Tuesday, ECB President Christine Lagarde reiterated that the disinflationary process in the Eurozone has been completed and that she is hopeful that France will meet its international commitments and produce a budget in time.\n- Eurozone data has failed to improve investors' sentiment. German Factory Orders figures showed a 0.8% decline in August, against market expectations of a 1.4% growth, following a 2.7% contraction in July. Year-on-year, orders have increased at a 1.5% rate, after a 3.3% fall in July.\n- Fed policymakers continue showing their divergences. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari has warned about a burst of inflation if the bank lowers rates too fast, while US President Donald Trump's latest appointment, Fed Governor Stephen Miran, stated that inflation is due to population increases and reiterated that monetary pol"

                "body": "Most Read: OPEC + Delivers Modest Output Hike, Brent Crude Rises 1.7%. What Next for Oil Prices?\nEUR/USD continued its slide this morning as a combination of US Dollar strength and concerns around the French political drama rambled on.\nThe most recent news indicates that President Macron has given the outgoing Prime Minister, Sebastien Lecornu, until Wednesday evening to try and get the divided parliament to agree on a new prime minister.\nIt is unclear what will happen if Lecornu is unsuccessful, but the likely choices would be either appointing someone who is an expert but not a politician (a technocrat) or calling for early elections.\nResurgent US Dollar Keeps EUR/USD on the Back Foot\nThe US Dollar has surprised many by its resilience over the past two weeks. What could be the driving force of the Greenback stubbornness at the moment? Let us take a look.\nOne of the reasons benefitting the US Dollar may be down to the one-week interest rate which is rather expensive. The current rate rests near 4.15%. With a lack of high impact US data, market participants appear to be staying away from the loading up on US Dollar short positions.\nMarket participants may have also changed their outlook due to an IMF report last week. The prevailing theory of late was that Central Banks were the sellers of US Dollars in April and May, however the IMF data showed the dollar\u2019s share in bank reserves remained about 57% in the second quarter of 2025. That suggests something else could be at work and maybe it was the private sector dumping US Dollar during Q2.\nThe US Government shutdown has not had the impact many market participants had hoped it would. I think many expected the US Dollar to slide if the shutdown drags on.\nThe latest predictions show that people are slightly less worried that this shutdown will become the longest ever (which would be more than 35 days); the chance of that happening is now down to 22%.\nNevertheless, markets are scheduled to hear from several officials from the Federal Reserve today, including Bostic, Bowman, and Miran, all speaking between 4:00 PM and 4:30 PM Central European Time (CET).\nHowever, I don't expect their comments to significantly change the market's strong belief that the Fed will cut interest rates two more times before the end of the year.\nAs things stand, markets are still pricing in around 44.5 bps of rate cuts through December 2025.\nSource: LSEG\nTechnical Analysis - EUR/USD\nFrom a technical standpoint, EUR/USD is approaching a key confluence level which could prove key to the pair's next move.\nEUR/USD had broken above a descending trendline from the YTD high, before pushing lower. However, it is approaching the medium term ascending trendline which coincides with a retest of the descending trendline and the 100-day MA around the 1.1626 handle.\nA break of this level could see the start of a deeper pullback toward the trendline touch and swing low on August 1, resting just below the pivot price of 1.1450.\nBefore that, there is support at 1.1584 and 1.1528 which could come into play and provide some short-term relief.\nA move higher from here faces resistance at 1.1700 before the 1.1800 swing high and YTD high at 1.1918 comes into focus.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart, October 7, 2025\nSource: TradingView.com (click to enlarge)\nClient Sentiment Data - EUR/USD\nLooking at OANDA client sentiment data and market participants are short on the EUR/USD Index with 61% of traders net-short. I prefer to take a contrarian view toward crowd sentiment and thus the fact that so many traders are short means EUR/USD could rise in the near-term.\nFollow Zain on Twitter/X for Additional Market News and Insights @zvawda\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or directors.

                "body": "EUR/USD (Euro vs. U.S. Dollar) Struggles Near 1.1650 as Political Turmoil in France and U.S. Dollar Strength Intensify\nThe EUR/USD pair extended its decline on Tuesday, falling toward 1.1650, its lowest level in over a month, as investors fled from European assets amid a deepening political crisis in France and a resilient U.S. dollar supported by hawkish Federal Reserve remarks. The euro, which briefly attempted to recover above 1.1700, failed to sustain momentum, dropping 0.42% intraday. Traders are confronting simultaneous headwinds: political instability in the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy and lingering uncertainty over the U.S. government shutdown that continues to distort global risk sentiment. France\u2019s fiscal and political outlook remains the epicenter of pressure on the euro. Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu\u2019s resignation after only 27 days in office left President Emmanuel Macron facing the most severe domestic challenge of his tenure. Macron\u2019s call for Lecornu to negotiate with coalition leaders has failed to calm markets, as opposition parties push for early elections. The French political vacuum raises doubts about fiscal consolidation, with France\u2019s deficit now near twice the EU\u2019s 3% limit, threatening renewed credit downgrades. Investors fear that another sovereign downgrade could lift French yields by 30\u201340 basis points, tightening financing conditions across the bloc.\nEuropean Central Bank Faces Policy Crossroads as Lagarde and Nagel Signal Divergent Outlooks\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) remains trapped between inflation control and deteriorating regional growth. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated this week that the \u201cdisinflationary process is over,\u201d suggesting the recent decline in price pressures may have plateaued. Yet Vice President Luis de Guindos acknowledged risks of recession, while Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel defended the need to \u201cpreserve credibility through restraint.\u201d Markets now price a 46% probability of another 25-basis-point cut by December, as bond spreads between Italy and Germany widen to 184 basis points, the highest since March. Lagarde and Nagel\u2019s upcoming speeches are expected to clarify the central bank\u2019s position on whether to prioritize inflation stability or economic growth. German data added to the pessimism, with factory orders falling 0.8% in August, far below expectations for a 1.4% increase, extending July\u2019s 2.7% contraction. This series of weak data solidifies the view that Europe\u2019s manufacturing base remains under heavy pressure.\nU.S. Dollar Strengthens Despite Fed Rate-Cut Bets as Safe-Haven Demand Lifts the Greenback\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) continues to defy expectations, trading near 98.33, its second consecutive daily gain, after comments from Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who emphasized that inflation \u201cremains too high.\u201d Despite a 94% probability of a Fed rate cut in October and 84% odds in December (per CME FedWatch data), the dollar\u2019s resilience underscores the market\u2019s preference for safety during global political strain. The U.S. government shutdown, now in its seventh day, has failed to weaken the greenback as traders hedge against potential European instability. Fed officials Raphael Bostic, Neel Kashkari, Michelle Bowman, and Stephen Miran are scheduled to speak later today, and any hawkish signals could amplify the dollar\u2019s advantage. The prolonged shutdown is delaying critical data such as Nonfarm Payrolls, CPI, and Retail Sales, adding opacity to Fed decision-making. However, the Fed\u2019s confidence in its \u201cwell-calibrated\u201d policy has prevented broader panic, supporting Treasury yields at 4.12% on the 10-year note.\nTechnical View: EUR/USD Bears Target 1.1610 as Momentum Weakens\nTechnically, the EUR/USD structure remains distinctly bearish. The pair has been unable to reclaim its descending trendline from mid-September, with the 50-day EMA at 1.1726 and 200-day EMA at 1.1715 flattening, confirming a lack of upward momentum. Immediat"

A raft of Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers will be making public appearances, as well as a speech from Bank of England (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Huw Pill.\nWednesday\u2019s key event will be the release of the Fed\u2019s latest Meeting Minutes, due at 18:00 GMT. The Fed broke the seal on interest rate cuts at its latest rate call, and investors will be looking for signs that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is tilting toward more rate cuts through the remainder of the year.\nAs the US government shutdown rolls on, the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be grappling with a lack of key official datasets as it makes interest rate decisions heading into the tail end of the calendar year. Barring any significant shocks in the data that remains available to the Fed, rate markets have locked in expectations of two follow-up interest rate cuts on October 29 and December 10.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom.

Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance."

The Pound Sterling (GBP) edges lower against the Greenback amid rising expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates one more time in the remainder of the year.\nThe dovish expectation of the BoE grows due to growing United Kingdom (UK) labor market concerns, which undermine the Cable against the USD. Reuters reported that the businesses in the UK in the three months to September expected to keep employment steady over the next 12 months, the first time since January that they have been observed reluctant to increase staffing.\nConcerns about persistent inflation, sluggish economic growth and a loosening labor market are likely to influence the BoE's decisions. Until now, the UK central bank has retained a \u201cgradual and careful\u201d monetary easing approach.\nTraders focus on any signs of when the US federal government will reopen. A prolonged US federal government shutdown could drag the USD lower and act as a tailwind for the major pair. The US government shutdown entered its second week as US senators failed to pass spending proposals to reopen the federal government.\nLooking ahead, traders will take more cues from the BoE\u2019s Huw Pill speech later on Wednesday for some hints about the UK interest rate path. Pill was one of seven Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members who voted to keep interest rates on hold at 4.0% in the September policy meeting.

Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance."

The investment bank also noted there is an increasing possibility that the central bank might remain on hold for an extended period.\nDespite recent softening in consumer sentiment and labor market indicators, UBS expects Australia\u2019s unemployment rate to have remained largely stable in September. The third-quarter Consumer Price Index data, scheduled for release on October 29, will be crucial for the RBA\u2019s next policy decision at its November 4 meeting.\nUBS now recommends long positions on the Australian dollar at current levels and suggests selling downside at 0.65 or below. The bank also identified several other currency pairs for potential long-Aussie positions, including AUD/CHF, AUD/CNY, and AUD/NZD.\nThe revised forecast reflects UBS\u2019s assessment that Australia\u2019s monetary policy will remain tighter for longer than previously anticipated, supporting the Australian dollar\u2019s strength against the U.S. dollar through September 2026.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

                "body": "AUD/USD, NZD/USD and AUD/NZD Outlook Ahead of RBNZ Decision\nThe US dollar was the strongest FX major on Tuesday as the government shutdown dragged on. While the lack of incoming data has helped the greenback find support, there will surely come a point where prolonged inaction could turn USD-bearish if it continues. Regardless, the US Dollar Index (DXY) posted its highest close in two months and its best single-day gain in eight.\nUSD/JPY extended its advance to a seven-month high, with the Japanese yen remaining the weakest major amid expectations of a stimulus-driven policy agenda from Japan\u2019s incoming prime minister. EUR/USD fell for a second day and is hovering near key support at 1.1645, while a bearish outside day formed on AUD/USD around the 0.66 handle. Meanwhile, NZD/USD printed a prominent swing high ahead of today\u2019s Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) rate decision.\nView related analysis:\n- USD/JPY Bulls On High Alert For Breakout As Japanese Yen Slumps\n- AUD/USD Q4 Outlook: Bears Target Slower Growth, RBA Cut\n- Gold Outlook: Rising Implied Volatility on Path to $4000\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nAUD/USD, NZD/USD, AUD/NZD IN Focus Ahead of RBNZ Interest Rate Decision\nThe RBNZ is widely expected to cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 2.75%, though a 50bp cut cannot be ruled out given weak business sentiment. At the very least, a dovish 25bp cut could pave the way for further New Zealand dollar losses. While my near-term bias remains bearish on NZD/USD and AUD/NZD, the latter may still find upside room in the short term if the Aussie outperforms the Kiwi following the decision.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe Australian dollar (AUD/USD) has reversed lower after multiple rejections near the 0.6625\u20130.6630 resistance zone, where the July high has regained technical significance. Tuesday\u2019s bearish outside day reinforced downside momentum as the Aussie dollar slipped back below the 20-day SMA, signalling renewed weakness against the US dollar.\nPrice action now favours sellers while trading beneath 0.6630, with bears likely eyeing the 50-day SMA (0.6544) and the 0.6520 support zone as near-term downside targets. A clean break below those levels could expose the 0.6500 handle, while rallies toward 0.66 may attract fresh selling pressure.\nThe broader bias remains bearish as momentum realigns with the decline from the September high, keeping the Aussie on the defensive into mid-October.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/USD\nNZD/USD Technical Analysis: New Zealand Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe New Zealand dollar (NZD/USD) has turned lower after forming a swing high near 0.5847, a zone that aligns with the 200-day SMA and 20-day EMA, reinforcing its role as a key resistance cluster. Monday\u2019s failure to hold above this level triggered renewed bearish momentum, with the Kiwi falling nearly 0.8%, marking its weakest session in over a week.\nMomentum has now realigned with the dominant daily downtrend, keeping sellers in control heading into today\u2019s RBNZ interest rate decision. Bears may look to fade minor rallies within Tuesday\u2019s range, targeting the 0.5755 support, 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, and the 0.5700 handle as potential downside objectives.\nThe near-term bias remains bearish while NZD/USD trades beneath 0.5850, with rallies likely to meet resistance around the May low and September VPOC.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView NZD/USD\nAUD/NZD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs New Zealand Dollar\nWhile both the Australian dollar (AUD) and New Zealand dollar (NZD) remain under pressure against the US dollar, momentum appears more favourable for the Aussie in the cross, keeping AUD/NZD supported in the near term.\nThe pair found demand at the monthly pivot point (1.1297) on Monday, forming a doji candle before edging higher on Tuesday.

The AUD/USD pair weakened amid investment outflows, as the S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.14% to trade below 8,950 at the time of writing, pressured by losses in technology and gold stocks.\nThe AUD also faces challenges after weaker housing data was released on Wednesday. Private house approvals in Australia declined by 2.6% month-over-month (MoM) to 9,027 units in August, as expected, and reversing a 1.3% rise in the previous month. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted Building Permits fell by 6% MoM to 14,744 units, following a 10% decrease previously, marking the second consecutive monthly decline.\nThe downside of the AUD/USD pair could be restrained as the Australian Dollar (AUD) could receive support from the cautious stance surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The Australian central bank is expected to maintain its interest rates after deciding to keep its Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 3.6% in September.

Monetary policy needs to ease to get ahead of the shift down in the neutral rate, Miran added.\n- Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari struck a more reserved tone than some of his Fed counterparts on Tuesday, cautioning that it's still too soon to be able to tell if tariff-led inflation will be \"sticky\" or not. However, Kashkari noted that he's particularly bullish on the labor market and is expecting a return to form for American job creation, which has sputtered recently.\n- Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid delivered hawkish remarks on Monday, saying that the Fed must maintain its inflation credibility and stressed that inflation is too high. Schmid added that monetary policy is appropriately calibrated.\n- The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in nearly a 95% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and an 83% possibility of another reduction in December.\n- United States (US) Senators failed to pass spending proposals to reopen the federal government for a fourth time, extending the ongoing shutdown into a new week. The closure has suspended key federal programs and delayed major economic reports, including September\u2019s jobs data, which was originally due on Friday.\n- The US ADP Employment Change report, released on Wednesday, showed that private sector payrolls declined by 32,000 in September, while annual pay growth was 4.5%. This figure followed the 3,000 decrease (revised from a 54,000 increase) reported in August and came in below the market expectation of 50,000.\n- The latest Job Openings showed the labor market is slowing, yet vacancies rose from 7.21 million to 7.23 million in August.

                "body": "USD/JPY breakout: Why the Dollar is surging over the Yen [Video]\n- USD/JPY reclaims momentum, breaking above the 150 handle as the dollar gains traction amid persistent yield divergence.\n- Japan\u2019s pro-stimulus tone and BOJ\u2019s ultra-loose stance continue to weigh on the yen, offsetting sporadic intervention threats.\n- Technical bias remains bullish, with structure favoring 154.80 and 158.87 as upside draw-on-liquidity targets while the 150.47\u2013151.73 zone acts as critical support.\nDollar strength reasserted against the Yen\nAfter weeks of choppy range-bound action, the U.S. dollar has regained control against the Japanese yen. The pair surged past 151 to trade above 152, driven by monetary policy divergence and investor preference for yield-bearing assets.\nWhile markets have priced in the possibility of future Fed rate cuts, U.S. yields remain significantly higher than Japan\u2019s - keeping the greenback attractive for carry traders. The Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious-dovish tone contrasts sharply with the Bank of Japan\u2019s prolonged ultra-accommodation, widening the policy gap that fuels dollar demand.\nBoJ dovishness and political tailwinds weigh on Yen\nThe yen\u2019s weakness has deepened following Sanae Takaichi\u2019s victory as LDP leader, a development seen by investors as a signal for more fiscal stimulus and continuity of pro-growth, low-rate policies. This narrative reinforced bets that the BOJ won\u2019t rush into aggressive rate hikes, despite rising domestic inflation and mounting external pressure.\nRecent comments from Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki warning against \u201cexcessive volatility\u201d had limited market impact. Traders interpret these remarks as verbal intervention rather than imminent action. Unless the yen collapses beyond control, direct intervention appears unlikely.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. government shutdown uncertainty has ironically supported the dollar, with global investors seeking refuge in U.S. assets as a short-term safe haven - further strengthening USD/JPY momentum.\nTechnical outlook\nUSD/JPY has broken above a two-month consolidation, reclaiming the D1 Fair Value Gap (150.47\u2013151.73) and extending beyond 152. This FVG now serves as critical re-entry support, confirming that institutional order flow remains bullish.\nThe next liquidity zones are positioned at 154.80 and 158.87, representing unmitigated imbalances and prior swing highs that may act as magnets if momentum persists.\nBullish scenario: Reclaim and continuation\nUSD/JPY could retest the 150.47\u2013151.73 Fair Value Gap before continuing its upward trajectory. A clean rejection or bullish response from this zone would confirm re-accumulation and sustain the higher-timeframe bullish delivery.\nTriggers:\n- Strong reaction from 150.5\u2013151.0 zone\n- Daily close above 151.7 confirms continuation\n- Rising yield differential or hawkish U.S. data\nTargets:\n- 154.80 \u2013 Previous liquidity zone\n- 158.87 \u2013 External swing high and draw on liquidity\nInvalidation: Daily close below 150.40\nBearish scenario: Failed FVG hold and re-entry into range\nIf price fails to hold above 150.4, USD/JPY could re-enter the old range, signaling distribution at premium levels. This would open a short-term corrective phase toward discounted liquidity zones near 149.20\u2013147.80.\nTriggers:\n- Rejection from 152.3\u2013152.7 zone\n- Daily close below 150.4\n- Verbal intervention or soft U.S. data\nTargets:\n- 149.20 \u2013 Prior consolidation support\n- 147.80 \u2013 Discounted liquidity\nInvalidation: Break and close above 152.80\nConclusion\nUSD/JPY remains technically and fundamentally bullish. The breakout above 150 reflects not just momentum but conviction - anchored by yield divergence and Japan\u2019s continued policy restraint. Unless the BOJ surprises with tightening or U.S. yields collapse, dollar-yen could maintain its upward bias toward 154.80 and 158.87 in the weeks ahead.\nAuthor\nJasper Osita\nACY Securities\nJasper has been in the markets since 2019 trading currencies, indices and commodities like Gold.

                "body": "It has been a challenging period for the Japanese yen in the short term. The USD/JPY pair has extended its four-day winning streak with an increase of almost 2.7%, reflecting the yen\u2019s continued weakness against the U.S. dollar. For now, bullish pressure remains strong, fueled by uncertainty surrounding the new fiscal policies proposed by Japan\u2019s new political leadership. This uncertainty has caused the yen to consistently lose ground, and as long as this outlook persists, buying pressure on USD/JPY could continue to strengthen in the coming sessions.\nNew Party Leader\nOn October 4, Sanae Takaichi was elected as the new leader of Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Takaichi, a veteran politician with extensive ministerial experience, is on track to become Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, pending confirmation by parliament.\nHowever, what has truly moved the markets are the economic plans expected from her incoming administration. Takaichi is known for advocating aggressive public spending to stimulate growth \u2014 a stance that has raised concerns over Japan\u2019s rising debt levels and fiscal sustainability. In addition, her government could push for lower interest rates to support the economy in the short term, potentially conflicting with the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) inflation-control objectives.\nLooking at Japan\u2019s inflation curve, prices have eased but remain above the 2% target, with the latest reading at 2.7% in August. This suggests that the BoJ should maintain a tighter policy stance to bring inflation back to target. However, the government\u2019s new fiscal direction could undermine that effort, creating a sense of weakened inflation control and possibly reducing confidence in yen demand.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nBefore Takaichi\u2019s victory, markets expected the BoJ to end the year with an interest rate of 0.75%, slightly above the current 0.50%. However, this outlook could change under the new leadership, keeping Japan among the developed economies with the lowest interest rates. Over time, this may make yen-denominated investments less attractive.\nMoreover, the combination of fiscal uncertainty, the risk of economic overstimulation, and weak inflation control could further erode confidence in the yen, leading to a persistent loss of appeal. This environment could reinforce steady buying pressure on the USD/JPY in the near term.\nIs the U.S. Dollar Recovering?\nDespite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, the dollar has shown resilience, rebounding over recent sessions. This strength partly stems from its role as a temporary safe haven amid political uncertainty in the United States.\nThe dollar\u2019s recovery is also reflected in the DXY Index, which measures Greenback\u2019s performance against a basket of major currencies. The index remained above 98 points, maintaining a positive upward slope over recent sessions.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nThis trend indicates that confidence in the U.S. dollar has been steadily improving. As long as the DXY maintains this upward trajectory and market perception of U.S. stability continues to strengthen, the yen\u2019s room for recovery will likely remain limited \u2014 further supporting upward pressure on USD/JPY.\nTechnical Outlook for USD/JPY\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend Back in Play: Since late April, USD/JPY has maintained a solid bullish trend, with consolidation zones acting as structural support. The latest bullish impulse has driven the pair to new highs, confirming that the dominant formation remains upward. If the price manages to break above key resistance levels, buying pressure could continue to dominate in the short term.\n- RSI: The RSI readings show that the average buying momentum remains strong over the past 14 sessions. However, the indicator is approaching the overbought zone (70), suggesting that the market could be entering a short-term imbalance phase. This could open space for minor corrective pullbacks if buying pressure becomes excessive.\n- ADX: The ADX indicator remains below "

                "body": "Japanese economic data tempered expectations of an October Bank of Japan rate hike, sending USD/JPY to 152.377 in the early trading session on Wednesday, October 8.\nAverage cash earnings increased 1.5% year-on-year in August, down sharply from 3.4% in July. Softer wage growth is expected to weaken household spending, potentially cooling demand-driven inflation. Crucially, the softer wage growth figures followed recent comments from BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who raised concerns about tariffs affecting wages, stating:\n\u201cIf uncertainty regarding overseas economies and trade policies remains high, firms may place stronger emphasis on cost-cutting and may weaken their efforts to reflect price increases in wages.\u201d\nSanae Takaichi, the new leader of Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party and potentially Prime Minister, also underscored the need for sustained wage growth for further monetary policy tightening. She stated:\n\u201cDemand-pull inflation \u2014 wage increases driving demand growth, leading to a gradual rising of prices and corporate profits \u2014 is the best outcome. Until such a situation emerges, we must maintain close communication with the Bank of Japan. We must stay in sync.\u201d\nTakaichi\u2019s support for ultra-loose monetary policy and today\u2019s wage growth data sent USD/JPY to its highest level since February 2025.\nAcross the Pacific, market focus remains on the US government shutdown and the Fed\u2019s upcoming interest rate decision. Overnight, lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a stopgap funding bill needed to reopen the government.\nA prolonged shutdown could weigh on the US economy and further delay key economic data releases. The Fed typically adopts a more dovish stance during extended shutdowns, reinforcing expectations for policy easing. With the next Senate vote today, the US dollar could face selling pressure if the vote fails to reach the 60 required to pass the stopgap funding bill.\nMeanwhile, Fed speakers and the FOMC meeting minutes will also require consideration amid rising bets on multiple Q4 rate cuts. FOMC voting members Michael Barr, Alberto Musalem, and alternate member Neil Kashkari are on the calendar to speak. Views on the shutdown, the economic outlook, and inflation could influence USD/JPY trends.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: Political Factors, BoJ Policy, and Dovish Fed Risks\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nAs traders lower bets on an October BoJ policy adjustment, uncertainty lingers over the RBA\u2019s rate path, spotlighting AUD/USD.\nTurning focus to the AUD/USD pair, Aussie inflation and labor market data are clouding the RBA\u2019s rate path. Australian ANZ-Indeed job ads slid 3.3% month-on-month in September, accelerating from a 0.3% drop in August. The job ad slump followed August\u2019s sharp drop in full-time employment, signaling a deteriorating labor market. A softer labor market may curb wage growth, dampening inflation.\nHowever, recent inflation figures have raised doubts about a November RBA rate cut, fueling monetary policy uncertainty. The Aussie Monthly CPI Indicator rose to 3% in August, reaching the top end of the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target range, up from 2.8% in July. While recent labor market data has weighed on the Aussie dollar, AUD/USD remains above August levels, underscoring uncertainty over the timing of an RBA rate cut.\nOn Friday, October 10, RBA Governor Michele Bullock may share views on recent data and the RBA\u2019s policy stance.\nAUD/USD: Key Scenarios to Watch\nSee our full AUD/USD analysis for detailed trends and trade setups.\nWhile Aussie economic data continues to fuel speculation about an RBA rate cut, developments on Capitol Hill and Fed speakers will also influence AUD/USD trends.\nAnother failed Senate vote and growing calls for back-to-back Fed rate cuts in October and December would narrow the US-Aussie rate differential, favoring the Aussie dollar. A narrower rate differential would likely drive AUD/USD toward $0.66. A sustained move above $0.66 could bring $0.665 into play.\nO"

                "body": "USD/CAD continues to gain ground for the second successive session, trading around 1.3960 during the Asian hours on Wednesday. The pair appreciates as the US Dollar (USD) gains ground, as United States (US) Consumer Inflation Expectations for the year ahead rose to 3.4% in September, the highest in five months, compared to 3.2% in August.\nHowever, the US Dollar may face challenges amid prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy stance. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in nearly a 95% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in October and an 83% possibility of another reduction in December.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) Board of Governors member Stephen Miran expressed his belief on Tuesday that inflation itself is simply a cause of \"population increases\". Monetary policy needs to ease to get ahead of the shift down in the neutral rate, Miran added.\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari struck a more reserved tone than some of his Fed counterparts on Tuesday, cautioning that it's still too soon to be able to tell if tariff-led inflation will be \"sticky\" or not. However, Kashkari noted that he's particularly bullish on the labor market and is expecting a return to form for American job creation, which has sputtered recently.\nThe upside of the USD/CAD pair could be limited as the commodity-linked CAD receives support from higher Oil prices. It is worth noting that Canada is the largest crude exporter to the United States.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price continues to gain ground for the fourth successive session, trading around $62.00 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices receive support from a more modest OPEC+ output hike. The Oil group recently decided to limit its production increase, opting for the smallest rise among the options considered.\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have"

These comments pose a veiled threat of a potential intervention and have contributed to providing some footing for the Yen:\nIn the UK, recent data revealed a significant slowdown in the services sector, and a survey by the Bank of England showed that British businesses\u2019 hiring plans fell to their lowest levels since 2020.\nThese figures have raised expectations that the Bank of England might be forced to cut rates again. In that sense, the minutes of the last BoE FPC committee, and BoE\u2019s Chief Economist Huw Pill\u2019s comments will be carefully analysed to confirm those expectations on Wednesday.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and copywriter in diverse Forex-related firms, like FXStreet and Kantox."

It would also be rarefied air. Only 18 U.S.-listed ETFs currently manage more than $100 billion.\nSource: Bloomberg\nDominating The Crypto ETF Market\nIBIT now accounts for roughly half of all assets in the U.S. spot crypto ETF category. Its nearest competitors, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), hold $26.1 billion and $22.2 billion in AUM, respectively.\nBut while IBIT\u2019s momentum continues to build, rival funds have seen far less enthusiasm from investors. IBIT has pulled in $26.4 billion so far in 2025, while FBTC has gathered just $1 billion and GBTC has suffered $2.6 billion of outflows.\nIBIT and its Ethereum counterpart, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), have together attracted nearly $38 billion of inflows this year\u2014virtually the entire total for spot crypto ETFs. The pair have quickly become the default vehicles for investors seeking crypto exposure in an ETF wrapper.\nRiding Bitcoin\u2019s Rally\nIBIT\u2019s asset surge has been fueled not just by inflows but by the relentless rally in Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency recently topped $125,000 for the first time ever and is up roughly 160% since IBIT\u2019s launch. About two-thirds of IBIT\u2019s asset growth has come from inflows, with the rest from price appreciation.\nAs IBIT\u2019s footprint grows, it\u2019s increasingly becoming a driving force in Bitcoin itself, with inflows large enough to influence price moves and market sentiment.\nAt just under $100 billion in AUM, IBIT represents about 4.2% of Bitcoin\u2019s $2.4 trillion market cap. Given how easy and familiar ETFs have made crypto investing, IBIT\u2019s share of the Bitcoin market could keep rising.\nTo put its potential in perspective, if Bitcoin\u2019s market cap reached $3 trillion and IBIT accounted for 10% of it, the fund would be $300 billion in size. A 20% share of a $5 trillion market would imply $1 trillion in AUM.\nThose scenarios are far from guaranteed, but they show just how large IBIT could become if Bitcoin demand keeps expanding."

                "body": "Ethena Labs has announced that it has started working with UR Global to roll out its USDe stablecoin to clients in more than 45 countries. This collaboration indicates the further narrowing of the gap between decentralized finance and conventional banking system. This partnership is also a major move towards the mainstream consumer making DeFi a reality with a single neobank.\nIncreased Utility of USDe in Everyday Finance\nThe collaboration between Ethena labs and UR global is aimed at attaching USDe, a synthetic dollar stablecoin by Ethena, to the blockchain-based neobank infrastructure of UR. Users can earn up to 5% annual percentage yield (APY) on their USDe holdings, which is comparable to standard savings accounts.\nPerhaps most importantly, the platform reduces off-ramp fees for USDe-to-fiat conversion, reducing one of the major barriers to everyday users engaging in digital assets.\nThe service will be accessible via iOS, Android, and web interfaces, providing widespread availability regardless of device preference. Moreover, direct spending capabilities of the USDe will be offered through a Mastercard debit card within several weeks and will turn the stablecoin into a useful payment method to use in the cases of daily shopping.\nBlockchain-Native Banking Infrastructure of UR\nThe ecosystem supports UR Global, as it is the first fully blockchain-based neobank in the world. The platform integrates the functionality of traditional banking (i.e., multi-currency accounts, debit cards) with blockchain-specific functionality.\nUR\u2019s Swiss-backed infrastructure allows users to hold both fiat currency and stablecoins in the same account, allowing for seamless transitions between traditional and decentralized financial systems.\nThis infrastructure is particularly important for the Ethena cooperation since it provides the regulatory compliance and banking rails necessary to enable meaningful USDe usefulness in real-world situations. Now users can use USDe as a dollar savings tool that generates income and at the same time be able to use ordinary payment networks to pay regular expenses.\nStrategic Timing and Market Environment\nEthena-UR partnership is a timely event on the stablecoin market and the general adoption of DeFi. In 2025, Ethena has been prolifically the product range of USDe, especially starting a collaboration with the TON Foundation to deploy USDe into the ecosystem of a billion-plus users of Telegram and the Sui blockchain to deliver native stablecoins.\nAs McKinsey research on stablecoin infrastructure sees it, tokenized cash and stablecoins are becoming important elements in next-generation payment systems, especially in cross-border transactions where the traditional banking infrastructure is sluggish and costly.\nThis could be particularly beneficial to the customers in the emerging markets that have not yet developed banking systems or where access to dollar-denominated deposits is limited. The stability of USDe, along with the accessibility of UR, and elimination of translation costs offer a very attractive value proposition to investors who seek to preserve wealth in dollar-equivalent assets and maintain realistic spending capacity.\nConclusion\nThe agreement between Ethena Labs and UR Global is a significant step towards making DeFi available to mainstream users in 45+ countries. This partnership is the most effective way to close the divide between decentralized finance and traditional banking by incorporating USDe into the blockchain-native neobank platform of UR, which also has competitive interest rates, no off-ramp fees, and the ability to use a Mastercard debit card.\nThe success of the Ethena-UR partnership will eventually be established by its implementation regarding regulatory compliance, peg stability, and user experience. However, it may serve as an outline for how DeFi protocols might achieve widespread adoption while keeping the core elements that make decentralized finance desirable."

                "body": "Key Takeaways\nEthereum (ETH), once the domain of open-source idealists and decentralized app builders, is rapidly maturing into something much bigger: a global financial infrastructure asset.\nAs the network transitions into its post-Merge identity and institutional staking gains traction, ETH has evolved beyond being \u201cgas\u201d for smart contracts.\nIt has now become a cornerstone of on-chain finance and a strategic treasury asset for companies, funds, and governments.\nBut where exactly is all that ETH sitting?\nJust as Bitcoin has its whales, Ethereum\u2019s landscape is shaped by massive smart contracts, exchange wallets, staking vaults, and a few known individuals who got in early.\nFrom the Beacon Chain to Coinbase, Grayscale, and new corporate players, here\u2019s who\u2019s holding the most ETH in 2025\u2014and how much they\u2019re worth.\nEthereum\u2019s journey through 2025 has been anything but flat.\nAfter starting the year around $3,248, ETH slumped to $1,796 in April during a broad market correction that also hit Bitcoin.\nHowever, momentum shifted in Q2, with institutional inflows from spot Ethereum ETFs and a resurgence in DeFi breathing new life into the market.\nThat momentum carried into the summer. In late July, Ethereum was trading near $3,715, brushing up against its yearly high of $3,765.\nJust weeks later, in August, ETH shattered its previous 2021 record of $4,878, climbing to a new all-time high of $4,965.\nEthereum\u2019s market cap now stands at roughly $534 billion, and technical indicators remain strong.\nWeekly charts show bullish continuation patterns, while the relative strength index (RSI) points to sustained buying pressure.\nOn-chain activity reinforces this outlook, with rising transaction volumes and an uptick in smart contract deployment.\nLooking ahead, Ethereum\u2019s trajectory for the rest of 2025 could hinge on key regulatory decisions\u2014particularly the SEC\u2019s stance on staking within ETFs, a factor that could either fuel further upside or cool momentum.\nThe top 10 Ethereum holders control around 83.9 million ETH, accounting for roughly 70% of the current circulating supply, worth over $300 billion at today\u2019s prices.\nIf you widen the lens to include staking contracts and large custodial pools, that number climbs even higher.\nBy some estimates, these expanded holdings represent up to 52% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply, or about $120 billion in value.\nThe 200 largest Ethereum wallets now hold over 62.7 million ETH, underscoring just how top-heavy ETH ownership remains.\nHowever, unlike Bitcoin\u2014where dormant whale wallets like Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s cast a long shadow\u2014Ethereum\u2019s most oversized holders are anything but idle.\nMost actively participate in the ecosystem: staking contracts secure the network, exchange wallets support millions of users, or institutional custodians facilitate everything from ETFs to validator services.\nSo while the top ETH wallets may appear concentrated, they often represent pooled assets, not individual mega-whales.\nIt\u2019s less about hoarding and more about infrastructure, reflecting Ethereum\u2019s unique role in powering DeFi, staking, and the broader Web3 economy.\nA person or company does not populate the ETH holder leaderboard, but rather a smart contract: the Ethereum Beacon Deposit Contract.\nThis is where users lock up ETH to become validators and secure the proof-of-stake network.\nIt holds an astounding over 36 million ETH, 36% of the total supply, worth roughly $299.5 billion.\nFar from idle, these coins are actively staked, powering the Ethereum consensus engine.\nThis makes Ethereum the biggest holder of the Beacon contract and arguably the most critical one for security and decentralization.\nAs the largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase is a household name in the digital asset space.\nIt holds roughly 6.9 million ETH, valued at $23.5 billion, across multiple wallets.\nThese holdings represent a mix of customer funds, institutional custody accounts, and Coinbase\u2019s cbETH staking derivative program.\nWith s"

(NASDAQ: FORD), a treasury company with a strategic focus on the Solana blockchain, announced the activation of its institutional-grade validator node on Solana in collaboration with DoubleZero, a blockchain infrastructure provider specializing in performance optimization. The move marks a significant step in the company\u2019s transition from a capital allocator to a key participant in Solana\u2019s technical ecosystem.\nAccording to the company, the validator node is already operational on DoubleZero\u2019s infrastructure and has been developed in association with Galaxy, leveraging Jump Crypto\u2019s Firedancer client to achieve greater speed and scalability. Designed to meet institutional standards, the validator aims to strengthen Solana\u2019s overall throughput and efficiency while advancing the blockchain\u2019s readiness for large-scale financial applications.\nForward Industries has set the validator\u2019s commission rate at zero percent, allowing holders of Solana\u2019s native token, SOL, to delegate their stake to the company\u2019s node at no additional cost. The firm has also confirmed that all of its own SOL holdings are staked through this validator. Future validators planned by Forward are expected to be deployed exclusively on DoubleZero\u2019s network, reinforcing a unified and high-performance architecture across its operations.\nInstitutional-grade infrastructure for decentralized networks\nThe collaboration between Forward Industries and DoubleZero extends beyond validator deployment. Both organizations are jointly conducting pilot programs aimed at improving network revenue optimization, increasing bandwidth, and minimizing latency. These efforts are expected to further enhance Solana\u2019s reliability and position it as a preferred choice for institutional and enterprise blockchain solutions.\nAt launch, Forward\u2019s validator is projected to rank among the top ten Solana validators globally, underscoring the firm\u2019s growing influence within the blockchain community. The company\u2019s leadership has emphasized that the strength of decentralized networks depends on achieving enterprise-level standards of performance, scalability, and security.

The funding round, led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, included a collective investment exceeding $300 million from these major backers.\nThe company stated that the funds would primarily support the creation of its cryptocurrency treasury operations, emphasizing the accumulation of SOL tokens as a core component of its strategy. Additional capital will be directed toward operational expenses, working capital, and upcoming investment opportunities tied to the Solana network.\nThe PIPE financing also attracted participation from several global investment firms, asset managers, and notable angel investors across the digital asset landscape. This widespread interest has been interpreted as an indicator of growing institutional confidence in both Solana\u2019s long-term viability and Forward Industries\u2019 approach to fostering its ecosystem.\nBy deploying cutting-edge validator technology and securing a substantial capital base, Forward Industries has positioned itself as a central force in driving institutional engagement within the S"

                "body": "While Solana (SOL) continues to creep up towards the $300 mark, the real buzz among sharp investors is about Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The DeFi protocol oriented around utility, available for at $0.035 in presale, has become one of the most quickly developing tokens in Q4 because of its double lending architecture. With over 60% of its Stage 6 presale already sold and whale accounts hoarding increasingly more, Mutuum Finance could offer significantly more upside potential than titanic-cap tokens such as Solana.\nSolana Rally Continues Amidst Uncertainty\nSolana (SOL) threw some recent bullishness aside with its 19% gain and breach of the $230 level, technicals pointing to potential to continue to move higher to $253.4 if it can hold the support zone of $210.3\u2013$217.1.\nBeneath that bullish trend, however, there are warning signs that are increasing. A few of the original investors are selling out, and this is a sign of increasing skepticism that the network is sustainable in the long term. At the same time, falling new address creation is evidence of falling adoption, something that can sap the strength of the existing rally and curtail upside beyond short-term rebounds.\nAnd even as Solana\u2019s price action remains in the minds of traders, there are investors switching to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the upstart DeFi coin, which most experts think might have even more growth potential for it in the years ahead.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6\nTokens are priced at $0.035, 16.17% over the previous phase as Mutuum Finance explodes in presale stage 6. Investor investment is on the high side, with over 16,770 investors putting in over $16.9 million, a sign of confidence in long-term sustainability and prospects of the project in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).\nAs a measure to promote adoption at an early stage, Mutuum Finance is conducting a $100,000 giveaway to reward $10,000 MUTM tokens to 10 winners.\nMutuum Finance is dedicated to security. With CertiK, the platform holds a Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT reward. The program looks to compensate white-hat hackers and security researchers for identifying bugs within the codebase. Bugs are scored in terms of severity as critical, major, minor, and low, and the rewards are paid proportionate for actively securing and maintaining platform integrity.\nDeploying a Next-Generation Lending & Borrowing Protocol\nMutuum Finance has set a roadmap for building a next-gen lending and borrowing protocol with Version 1 (V1) live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. will be the key features. ETH and USDT will be the launchpad support for lending, borrowing, and collaterals, providing a safe, fast, and easy DeFi experience to users.\nCollateral efficiency is offered by accurately calculated Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly in collateral-heavy loans. A buffer reserve is kept within the protocol to mitigate market uncertainty, and excess reserves are wisely reinvested in risk assets to absorb shock without negatively affecting system health as a whole. Such moves deliver a stable, resilient, and sustainable DeFi platform to all.\nMutuum Finance is a High-Potential Alternative to SOL\nAs Solana (SOL) eyes the $300 level, profit-taking by early birds and falling adoption ring bells for large-cap investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.035 with over 60% of Stage 6 presale sold out and 16,770+ investors on board, presents a strong alternative for DeFi exposure. With its dual lending mechanism, next-generation borrowing and lending protocol, dynamic Loan-to-Value ratios, and efficient collateral management, MUTM delivers security and scalable utility.\nSupported by a $50,000 USDT bug bounty fund and community initiatives like a $100,000 giveaway, Mutuum Finance is one of the most powerful under-$1 cryptos to watch out for in Q4 2025, with development-stage growth potential augmented by a nicely developed utility-driven strategy.\nFor more info"

                "body": "Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Live May 30: On-Again, Off-Again Tariffs Are On Again, Dow Index Slumps\nThis article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) closed up 0.3% on Thursday, but is already giving back those gains in pre-market trading -- down 0.3%. Investors seemed happy to hear, yesterday morning, that a U.S. trade court had decided to order President Trump to lift most of the tariffs he announced in April. But by evening the joy had faded, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stepped in to grant a temporary restraining order preventing the tariffs from being lifted.\nSo the on-again, off-again tariffs are right back \"on again\" -- and in fact, could be even more \"on\" than we thought last night.\nThis morning, in a post on Truth Social, the President accused China of having \"TOTALLY VIOLATED\" a trade agreement under which the President had cut China tariffs from 145% to 30% earlier this month. \"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!,\" posted the President, apparently threatening to raise tariffs even higher.\nHow high will tariffs go? No one knows, but investors are already spooked and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is predictably slumping in response.\nEarnings\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) and Costco (Nasdaq: COST) both reported earnings after close of trading last night. Dell's earnings were \"mixed,\" with a Q1 sales beat but an earnings miss. On the plus side, Dell said both sales and earnings in Q2 will be better.\nCostco's report featured top-and-bottom line beats for that company's fiscal Q3.\nAdvertisement\nAnalyst Calls\nRegarding the effect of tariffs, Loop Capital observed that Costco is refraining from passing on higher costs from tariffs to its customers, which is helping the company to grow market share. Loop upped its price target on Costco to $1,115 per share, and maintained a buy rating on the stock.\nIn related trade news, and easily confused with Costco, JPMorgan upgraded Shanghai-based Cosco Shipping to overweight this morning, setting a target price of 19 Hong Kong Dollars ($2.42) on the stock. That's about 40% more than what Cosco stock costs now.\nSo at least JPMorgan seems to remain bullish on international trade. I guess that's good news.\nIf you\u2019re one of the over 4 Million Americans set to retire this year, you may want to pay attention.\nFinding a financial advisor who puts your interest first can be the difference between a rich retirement and barely getting by, and today it\u2019s easier than ever.

                "body": "DAX Forecast: Technical Tuesday | October 10, 2025\n- DAX forecast remains bullish despite short-term consolidation\n- 24,300 and 24,000 serve as key near-term support zones\n- A sustained break above 24,650 could open the path toward 25,000 and possibly 26,000\nWith the US government shutdown dragging on, global markets have entered a period of quiet, particularly across FX. Yet, equity indices remain upbeat \u2014 and the German DAX is no exception. Despite a modest pullback, the DAX forecast still points to strength, as the index consolidates its recent breakout gains in what appears to be a classic pause before another leg higher.\nTechnical setup: a breakout catching its breath\nLast week\u2019s explosive move higher marked a clean breakout from a long consolidation phase, a move that carries real technical weight given how long the market had been coiling. Now, this brief lull makes perfect sense. Momentum indicators are easing off overbought levels, resetting the stage for potential fresh buying later in the week.\nFrom a structural point of view, the DAX looks like it\u2019s gearing up for another run towards new highs. The hesitation around prior resistance may be lulling bears into a false sense of security. A push through that resistance could easily trigger stop orders from short positions, propelling the index even higher.\nThus, a new record high could well be on the cards soon, possibly even today or later this week \u2013 especially if we see resolution around the US political impasse.\nBefore looking at the daily chart, let\u2019s first discuss an interesting intraday level first\u2026\nShort-term support being tested\nOn the hourly chart, the 24,300 level has already shown its importance, providing a clear reaction zone where buyers stepped in yesterday. That makes it a key short-term pivot to watch today.\nDAX forecast: Support levels to watch on the daily chart\nEven if the index dips slightly and breaks the above mentioned 24,300 support level, the daily chart highlights plenty of other support beneath current levels. In particular, the 23,950\u201324,000 region stands out as the main structural floor after last week\u2019s breakout. This zone, which previously acted as both resistance and support, now forms a key area to watch for any potential retest.\nBelow that, 23,750 is the line in the sand \u2013 any move below that would call the breakout into question. Further down, 23,400 represents the longer-term base of the bullish structure, having withstood multiple attempts by sellers to drive the market lower.\nFor now, though, price action suggests the market is trying to build a platform above 24,300 \u2014 a level that could easily act as the springboard for the next advance.\nUpside targets for DAX: 25,000 and beyond\nWith the macro backdrop still supportive \u2013 Germany\u2019s expected fiscal stimulus being a key tailwind \u2013 the path of least resistance remains firmly higher. Equity sentiment across Europe and the US remains buoyant, and the DAX appears well-positioned to join its global peers in exploring new record territory.\nTherefore, a clean breakout above the 24,500\u201324,650 resistance band looks increasingly likely. If this happens, it would potentially open the door to the psychologically significant 25,000 mark next. Beyond that, technical projections derived from the previous consolidation range suggest an extended target between 25,800 and 26,280.\nThat 26,000 region stands as the measured move target \u2014 ambitious but technically justified given the strength of the prior breakout.\nKey takeaway points from this Technical Tuesday edition\nThe DAX\u2019s bullish trend remains intact, with short-term consolidation providing an opportunity for momentum to reset. As long as 23,750 holds, dips look buyable, not threatening. Traders will be watching closely for signs of renewed upside momentum as the week progresses. It looks increasingly likely that a new hit above July\u2019s peak (near 24,650) is on the cards, and if the index clears that area decisively, a run towards 25,000 and beyo"

Market Open.\nThe minutes from the Fed's September meeting due later in the day could offer new clues about the central bank\u2019s internal divisions and the outlook for interest rates as the government shutdown deprives policymakers of key economic data.\nLast week, the September jobs report wasn't released as scheduled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figures would normally give investors a sense of the Fed's next moves, considering the labor market plays a central role in its policy decisions.\nOn Tuesday, all three major averages ended lower after reports of weaker-than-expected cloud margins at Oracle fueled fresh concerns about AI. The declines marked the end of a seven-day long winning streak for both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC).\nGold (GC=F) futures continued to rise after topping $4,000 an ounce mark for the first time on Tuesday, marking a doubling in value in just two years. Prices have pushed higher amid fears over the US economy, accelerated recently by the federal government shutdown.\nThe federal stoppage, now in its seventh day, continues to breed uncertainty.

At the same time, Trump has threatened to withhold back pay for furloughed Federal workers.\nLIVE 4 updates HSBC serves up some reality on Intel\nIntel's (INTC) stock is up a sizzling 90% in the past six months.\nIt's definitely not because of strong performance! The company can now count Nvidia (NVDA) and the US government as major investors. More investment deals are likely, but the Street is beginning to view Intel's stock as too lofty valuation wise even in the face of new high-profile investors.\nHSBC analyst Frank Lee out this morning with a reality check on Intel.\nHe downgraded his rating on Intel to reduce from hold.\nHere's why:\n\"Deal driven re-rating not sustainable as fab execution still key to turnaround: Intel has recently announced three deals, driving a substantial re-rating of the stock: 1) SoftBank investing $2 billion; 2) the US administration investing $11.1 billion for a 9.9% equity stake; and 3) Nvidia investing $5 billion for a 4% stake. While the deals were at a discount to the market price, the stock is up 55% since the first deal announcement in August. We expect further deal announcements that could drive a short-term re-rating. However, we believe that Intel's own fab execution remains key to any sustainable turnaround. Hence, we believe that this re-rating is overdone.\nMore deals to potentially follow but the only deal that matters seems remote: With multiple news reports about Intel seeking investments from Apple (AAPL) and TSMC, we would not be surprised to see more similar deals announced with other major semi players including a passive investment by TSMC itself. However, we believe the only deal that matters that can fundamentally change anything would be one involving technology sharing with TSMC. The foundry segment remains the biggest drag on financials with consistent execution failures. Intel has also raised doubts about the viability of its 14A node amidst a lack of external customers after scrapping 18A for external customers recently. Hence, a technology-sharing agreement with TSMC could revamp Intel's foundry business. However, we do not see it happening as TSMC is investing $100 billion in the US with multiple greenfield fabs and pulling in production and construction in the US.\"\nNvidia to inve"

                "body": "LIVE\nDow Set to Open Up Ahead of Fed Minutes\nS&P 500 and Nasdaq futures are also rising in premarket trading Wednesday.\nLast Updated:\nOct. 8, 2025 at 4:57 AM ET\nKey Events\nPinned Post\nStock futures were edging up after the artificial-intelligence rally came to an abrupt halt in the previous session. Markets are looking for catalysts amid a lack of economic data while the U.S. government shutdown drags on, which means today\u2019s minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting may carry even more weight than usual.\nDow Jones Industrial Index futures were up 70 points in Tuesday\u2019s premarket, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 was rising 0.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was up 0.3%.\nThe S&P 500 fell for the first time in more than a week Tuesday as Wall Street pumped the brakes after a series of record highs in what looked like signs of buyer exhaustion. The Dow and Nasdaq also finished the session lower.\nThe continuing government shutdown means there is a vacuum of economic data on which the Fed usually depends to inform its decisions. That leaves traders looking for any other signs from the central bank about its intentions on interest rates.\nThere were mixed messages yesterday that may have contributed to the market malaise. Fed Gov. Stephen Miran said his expectations for a limited tariff impact on inflation mean the central bank can keep easing monetary policy. While Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari warned that any drastic rate cuts would risk stoking prices.\nHowever, today\u2019s minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee could offer something more concrete. The central bank cut rates by a quarter point at the last meeting with Miran, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Fed board, the lone dissenting voice. Market watchers will look for any indication from other members that they advocate a further loosening of monetary policy.\n\u201cMarket bulls benefited significantly in the past few days amidst a lack of economic figures, however, as multibillion dollar AI deals strengthened sentiment regarding modern technology\u2019s growth potential. While that exuberance has quelled, further upside may emerge from Fed speakers acknowledging that decelerating labor conditions warrant imminent rate cuts across several meetings,\u201d wrote Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\nAmong equities, tech will also remain in focus. The giants of the sector led markets lower Tuesday amid a report that cloud margins from software maker Oracle are below many estimates. Meantime, Tesla stock sank over 4% after the car maker introduced new versions of its top-selling models priced at under $40,000, with critics saying the lower-price models are too expensive to convert buyers to the brand.\nAI continues to be the hot topic but as the earnings season gets going many of the market-moving tech titans don\u2019t report until the end of the month. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines post results tomorrow, which could give an indication of the health of the consumer and Americans\u2019 spending power in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Any indication of the strength of the economy will likely be amplified by markets in the absence of official numbers.\nGold continued to be the big winner amid political uncertainty as the price of the precious metal settled above $4,000 for the first time. The haven asset has jumped more than 50% this year in the face of uncertainties over global trade, the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence, and U.S. fiscal stability. It was rising again early Wednesday, up 1.2% in early trade.\nElsewhere, bonds rose as a $58 billion Treasury sale drew solid demand but the benchmark 10-year was paring back on Wednesday\u2014edging lower by up to 0.4 basis points, according to Tradeweb data."

                "body": "Advertisement|Remove ads.\nU.S. stocks appear on track to shake off Tuesday\u2019s losses, with the major index futures all trading higher late in the day. Uncertainty over the government shutdown persisted, with President Donald Trump considering mass layoffs as a means to rein in spending.\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) deal news flow and investments will likely provide an offsetting impact. A Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, stated that Nvidia would invest $2 billion in Elon Musk-led AI startup xAI as part of the latter\u2019s latest funding round.\nFund manager Louis Navellier shrugged off talks of an AI bubble burst like the one seen in 1999, reasoning that this time around, the players are huge companies with healthy balance sheets and strong cash flow.\nAs of 11 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.14% and 0.19%, respectively, and the Dow futures were up a more modest 0.10%. The Russell 2000 futures climbed 0.25%.\nThe S&P 500 Index snapped a seven-session winning streak on Tuesday as traders, using the ongoing shutdown and data showing rising inflation expectations, booked profits on recent gains. The Russell 2000 Index fell by the most (down 1.12%), dragged down by concerns about the trajectory of interest rates. Some heavily-weighted stocks, including Oracle (ORCL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), fell sharply, denting sentiment toward the tech sector.\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 Index, and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) slipped 0.37% and 0.53%, respectively. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) moved down 0.19%, while the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) slumped 1.07%.\nNavellier conceded that the market breadth and power need to improve overall, but he does not subscribe to the theory of a stock market bubble. The fund manager said traders can confidently invest in stocks as long as earnings estimates continue to move northward and the Fed keeps lowering rates.\nOn the economic front, the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September rate-setting meeting, in which the central bank resumed its cuts, will be released at 2 p.m. ET. Traders will likely sift through the report for cues on the Fed\u2019s future course of action. More Fed speakers will be in action on Wednesday, including St. Louis Fed\u2019s Alberto Musalem (9:20 p.m. ET), Fed Governor Michael Barr (9:30 p.m. ET and 5:45 p.m. ET), Minneapolis Neel Kashkari (3:15 p.m. ET), and Chicago Fed\u2019s Austan Goolsbee (7:15 p.m. ET).\nAZZ, Inc. (AZZ) is scheduled to report its financial results after the market closes.\nCrude oil extended its gains in Wednesday\u2019s Asian session, and gold futures are continuing their record run, with the yellow metal trading past the $4,000 psychological barrier. The U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield ticked up in the Asian session after slipping 3.5 basis points on Tuesday. The dollar has firmed up against most major currencies.\nMajor Asian markets traded mixed, with the Japanese, Indonesian, and New Zealand markets recording gains, while the Hong Kong and Taiwanese markets fell sharply. China and South Korea remained closed for public holidays.\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.\nRead Next: Intel Set To Unveil Panther Lake Mobile Chip Specs In Bid To Halt AMD Market Share Gains: Report"

For that one little letter adds boons of power, pointiness and most importantly, noise.\nIt\u2019s now the fastest and most powerful iteration of the lovely DB12, via a 19bhp boost to the 4.0-litre AMG V8 lurking under that vast bonnet. So where the not-at-all-regular regular car churned out 671bhp, this one\u2019s got 690bhp.\nTorque remains unchanged at 590lb ft, but thanks to powertrain tweaks, launch control and gearshift times have both been cut, meaning 0-62mph now takes just 3.5s vs 3.6s in the non-S DB12. One entire tenth! What will you do with all that time?\nMaybe\u2026 revel in that biturbo V8. Aston\u2019s given the DB12 S a quad-pipe stainless steel exhaust system \u201ctuned to accentuate the engine frequencies throughout the rev range for added depth and potency\u201d. Yes, we\u2019ll always miss the snarling old nat-asp 6.0-litre Aston V12, but this is 2025 \u2013 let\u2019s just celebrate what we can, where we can, m\u2019kay.\nSaid exhaust cuts the DB12\u2019s weight by a considerable 11.7kg and adds 1.5dB of Good Noise, while further tweaks include a more \u201cprogressive\u201d throttle pedal feel (it recycles and cares for the environment, maybe?)\nMeanwhile, new settings for the Bilstein DTX dampers (less roll and pitch), tweaked camber/toe/castor settings, and a stiffer rear anti-roll bar join other screws Aston has tightened in the DB12\u2019s chassis. Like tweaking the steering and e-diff to allow use of the throttle \u201cearlier in the corner for maximum satisfaction from corner entry to exit\u201d. Yup, Aston wants you to get lairy.\nCarbon ceramic brakes arrive as standard fit, and they\u2019re bigger and lighter (they alone save 27kg of unsprung weight versus the DB12\u2019s steel setup). Driver assists have also been sent to finishing school, while the suit\u2019s been tweaked.\nYou\u2019ll spot the new front splitter and bonnet louvres \u2013 functional as well as another \u2018outta my way, puny non-S DB12\u2019 sign \u2013 gloss black sills, lots of S badges, a new rear diffuser, those pipes, and a new rear spoiler.

                "body": "World shares are mixed after US stocks retreat, while gold surges higher\nShares have opened higher in Europe but retreated in Asia after U.S. stocks sank to their first loss in eight days.\nThe price of gold, which topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time on Tuesday, continued to rise, trading up nearly $58 at $4,062.10.\nInvestors have traditionally seen gold as a hedge against high inflation. Its price has soared more than 50% this year because of governments\u2019 huge debt loads, political uncertainties and anticipation that the Fed will cut interest rates.\nIn France, the CAC 40 gained 0.6% to 8,021.50 as departing Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, aiming to calm the political storm triggered by his resignation on Monday less than 24 hours after unveiling his ministers, raced to beat a deadline Wednesday to break a deadlock caused by his decision to quit.\nGermany's DAX rose 0.3% to 24,455.12, while the FTSE 100 also rose 0.3%, to 9,513.67.\nThe futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were 0.2% higher.\nThe U.S. dollar has risen against the euro, thanks to the upheavals in France, and also against the Japanese yen.\nThe yen has fallen sharply on expectations that Sanae Takaichi, the conservative lawmaker likely to become the next prime minister, will push to keep interest rates low.\nThe dollar rose to 152.45 yen from 151.90 yen early Wednesday, while the euro slipped to $1.1625 from $1.1659.\nTokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.5% to 47,734.99. It had jumped to new records earlier this week after the ruling Liberal Democrats chose Takaichi as their leader last weekend. She is expected to increase spending and to advocate for easier credit, possibly slowing efforts by the Bank of Japan to raise its key interest rate. It has remained near zero for years, even as inflation has exceeded its target of about 2%, outpacing wage increases.\nThe government reported Wednesday that inflation-adjusted wages fell in August for the eighth straight month.\n\u201cWhile the economic case for tighter monetary policy remains intact, we suspect that the Bank of Japan will use the pressure by Japan\u2019s incoming government as an opportunity to delay rate hikes until January,\u201d Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary.\nLawmakers in Japan's lower house of parliament are due to elect a successor to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later this month. The Liberal Democrats hold the most seats despite not having an outright majority, so Takaishi is expected to become the country's first female prime minister.\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.5% to 26,829.46 and the S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower to 8,947.60.\nMarkets in mainland China and South Korea were closed for holidays.\nIn Taiwan, the Taiex lost 0.5%. India's Sensex was up 0.1%.\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.4% from its all-time high and the Dow industrials lost 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite gave up 0.7%.\nTesla was the heaviest weight on the market and dropped 4.4% after unveiling cheaper versions of two of its electric car models. The stock gave back most of its leap from the prior day, when speculation and hype built after Tesla hinted at a coming product announcement.\nOracle also helped drag the market lower. It fell 2.5% after a news report suggested it\u2019s making thin profit margins on a key line of business related to artificial-intelligence technology.\nU.S. shares have rushed higher in recent months on hopes that the economy will remain resilient and that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates.\nThe rapid rise of artificial intelligence has helped fan buying enthusiasm, but also is raising worries that share prices may have shot too high.\nMuch is riding on expectations that the AI investment boom will pay off by making the global economy more productive and driving more growth. Without that increased efficiency, inflation could push higher due to upward pressure coming from the mountains of debt that the U.S. and other governments worldwide are b"
