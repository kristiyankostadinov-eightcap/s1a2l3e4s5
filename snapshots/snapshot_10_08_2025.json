Futures are agreements to buy or sell the asset at a pre-determined date in the future.\nThe US government shutdown, which was triggered by repeated impasses over public spending, is a \"tailwind for gold prices\", said OCBC's Christopher Wong, who is the Singapore-based bank's rates strategist.\nInvestors have turned to safe haven assets like gold during previous US government shutdowns.\nIt rose by nearly 4% during the month-long shutdown in Trump's first term in the White House.\nBut gold prices could fall if the shutdown ends more quickly than some investors are expecting, said Mr Wong.\nGold's \"unprecedented rally\" in the past month has surpassed analysts' expectations, said UOB bank's head of markets strategy Heng Koon How.\nHe added that the rise is also tied to the weakening US dollar and more non-professional buyers, known as retail investors, purchasing gold.\nNot everyone investing in gold buys the physical precious metal.\nSome investors put their money into financial products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are backed by gold.\nA record $64bn has been invested in gold ETFs so far this year, according to the World Gold Council trade association.\nGregor Gregerson, the founder of precious metals dealer and storage provider Silver Bullion, said he has seen customers numbers more than double in the last year.\nRetail investors, banks and wealthy families have increasingly turned to gold, viewing it as a safeguard against global economic uncertainty, he said.\n\"Most of our clients are long-term holders,\" Mr Gregersen added, explaining that the majority of his customers store their gold for more than four years.\n\"Gold will fall at some point, but I believe given the economic environment, it's on an upward trend for at least five years,\" he said.\nAs Mr Gregersen highlighted, gold prices fall as well as rise.\nIts price may dip if there is a hike in interest rates or geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties ease, said OCBC's Mr Wong.\nIn April, for instance, the price of gold fell by around 6% after Trump backed off from firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said.\n\"Gold is often seen as a hedge against uncertainty, but the hedge can be unwound.\"\nAnd in 2022, gold's value plunged from $2,000 to $1,600 an ounce, after the US central bank raised interest rates to curb the inflation which was triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, said UOB's Mr Heng.\nA key risk to gold's current rally is a sudden resurgence in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates, he added.\nThe recent climb in gold prices reflects expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates, making gold more attractive, said Mr Wong.\nMeanwhile, Trump has ramped up pressure on the Fed, publicly criticising Mr Powell for not cutting rates quick enough and attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\nThe president's targeting of the Fed can \"undermine confidence in the [its] ability to act as a credible, inflation-targeting central bank,\" said Mr Wong.\nIn such an envir"

Investors will continue to pay close attention to comments from central bank officials in the absence of high-impact data releases. Later in the American session, the Federal Reserve (Fed) will publish the minutes of the September policy meeting.\nUS Dollar Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies this week. US Dollar was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote).\nUS lawmakers failed to resolve their disputes over the funding legislation on Tuesday, and the government shutdown passed the one-week mark. The Senate will vote again on Wednesday, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that the chamber will be voting on the same competing bills over and over. Meanwhile, the White House's Office of Management and Budget reportedly sent a memo, noting that the 750,000 furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay. US stock index futures trade mixed in the European morning on Wednesday after Wall Street's main indexes closed in negative territory on Tuesday.\nGold's record-setting rally continues without losing any steam midweek. XAU/USD was last trading at a new all-time high above $4,030, gaining more than 1% on the day. Gold is already up nearly 5% since the beginning of October.\nIn the early hours of the Asian session, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) announced that it cut the policy rate by 50 basis-points to 2.5% from 3%, against the market expectation for a 25 bps rate cut. In its policy statement, the RBNZ noted that the Committee remains open to further reductions in interest rates as required for inflation to settle sustainably near the 2% target mid-point in the medium term. NZD/USD stays under heavy bearish pressure and trades at its lowest level in six months near 0.5750, losing about 0.9% on a daily basis.\nUSD/JPY extends its weekly uptrend and trades at its highest level since February above 152.00. Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided to postpone the start of an extraordinary Diet session to October 20 or later after talks between new LDP leader Sanae Takaichi and Komeito chief Tetsuo Saito failed on maintaining their long-standing governing partnership.\nOutgoing French Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said on Wednesday that they must get a budget approved by the end of the year and noted that talks so far show a willingness to do that. Lecornu will meet with President Emmanuel Macron later in the day. Nevertheless, EUR/USD struggles to hold its ground and declines toward 1.1600 in the European morning on Wednesday.\nAfter losing about 0.5% on Tuesday, GBP/USD edges lower and trades near 1.3400 to start the European session.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn\u2019t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and "

While China's strategic stockpiling has temporarily limited price declines by acting as a demand buffer, this effect is insufficient to counteract the structural oversupply, with EIA forecasting Brent averages of $$62/bbl$$ in Q4 2025 and $$52/bbl$$ in 2026. Q3 2025 already reflected this trend, showing a 1.7% quarterly decline to $$65.90/bbl$$ amid US inventory builds exceeding 1.6 million b/d and weakening global demand growth projections slowing to 700,000 b/d for 2025-2026.  \nSENTIMENT: Negative\n\n**Overall Market Sentiment:** \" headers.

                "body": "EIA expects substantial increase in global oil inventories\nKey Highlights\n- Global oil inventories are expected to rise through 2026, putting downward pressure on prices.\n- China\u2019s stockpiling has helped limit price declines, even as global supply increases.\n- US crude oil production hit a record of over 13.6 million b/d in July, with forecasts remaining steady at around 13.5 million b/d through 2026.\n- Uncertainties remain regarding China\u2019s future oil demand and the ability of OPEC+ members to meet production targets, influencing the global supply outlook.\nThe US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects global oil inventories to rise through 2026, leading to significant downward pressure on oil prices in the coming months. EIA, in its October Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), forecasts Brent crude oil prices will drop to an average of$62/bbl in fourth-quarter 2025 and $52/bbl in 2026.\nBrent crude oil spot prices averaged $68/bbl in September, unchanged from August average. Several factors have likely offset strong growth in supply to keep oil prices relatively stable in recent months, EIA noted.\n\"One likely factor is China\u2019s additions to its oil stockpiles. China does not report data on its oil inventories,\" EIA said, but \"based on imports, exports, refining data, and oil inventory data from third-party and official sources, we [EIA] assess that China has accumulated significant oil inventories this year.\nBecause China\u2019s inventory builds have been strategic in nature,\" EIA continued, \"they have potentially acted as a source of demand, limiting downward price pressures more than our estimated balances would otherwise suggest.\"\n\u201cIt is also possible that global oil demand was higher over the summer than we currently estimate. The lag in actual oil demand data, particularly outside of the OECD, means that our estimates for global demand for second-quarter 2025 and third-quarter 2025 are still a mix of model results and initial data observations for much of the world,\" EIA said.\nInventory builds are significant even with expectation that OPEC+ will produce below its targets in the coming months, according to EIA forecasts. Along with strong production growth among non-OPEC countries, the forecast increase in global oil inventories is based on the OPEC+ announcements to increase the group\u2019s oil production.\n\u201cOPEC+ began increasing production in April 2025, and for much of this year, the group\u2019s production has been close to its targets. Last month, the group increased production targets through October 2025, but there is uncertainty regarding some members\u2019 ability to reach the targets given near term limits on spare capacity,\u201d EIA said.\nAccording to EIA, global production growth is led by countries outside of OPEC+, where production is expected to rise by 2.0 million b/d in 2025 and by 0.7 million b/d in 2026. OPEC+ is expected to increase total liquids production by 0.6 million b/d in both 2025 and 2026, as the group unwinds crude oil production cuts. However, according to EIA, OPEC+ production will remain below announced targets, preventing inventory builds from accelerating too quickly and limiting the decrease in oil prices.\nGlobal liquid fuels consumption by non-OECD countries is expected to grow by 1.2 million b/d in 2025 and 1.0 million b/d in 2026, while OECD consumption is forecast to fall by 0.1 million b/d in 2025 before increasing by 0.1 million b/d in 2026, according to EIA. Most non-OECD growth is concentrated in Asia, with liquid fuels consumption in India and China adding more than 0.4 million b/d of consumption by 2026 compared with 2024.\nIn EIA\u2019s forecast, global oil inventories will increase by an average of 2.1 million b/d in 2026, compared with an average annual increase of 1.9 million b/d in 2025. The pace at which China continues to purchase oil to fill inventory and any major supply disruptions are key forecast uncertainties.\nUS crude production\nIn July, US crude oil production averaged more than 13.6 m"

What's next for the oil and gas market in 2025?\nThe oil market struggled in Q3 as prices continued to soften under mounting supply pressure.\nFollowing moderate gains in H1, prices contracted to end the third quarter lower than their July 1 start positions.\nBrent crude began the period at US$67.10 per barrel and finished at US$65.90, a 1.7 percent decline. Similarly, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) entered the 90 day session at US$65.55 per barrel, slipping to US$62.33 by September 30.\nIn its recently released energy, oil and gas report for the third quarter, Deloitte attributes the summer price slump to rising global oil inventories, as well as OPEC+ easing production cuts sooner than expected.\n\u201cOPEC+ recently announced a 137 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d) production quota increase for October, beginning the reversal of 1.65 MMbbl/d of voluntary cuts that were originally set to stay in place through 2026,\u201d it reads.\nSupply exceeded demand in the US by 1.6 MMbbl/d between May and August, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), fueling projections of further stock builds for the remainder of the year.\n\u201cWe expect inventory builds will average 2.1 MMbbl/d in the second half of 2025 and will remain elevated through 2026, putting significant downward pressure on oil prices,\u201d the EIA notes in its September short-term energy forecast.\nWTI price performance, December 31, 2024, to October 6, 2025.\nChart via the Investing News Network.\nOil prices under pressure amid rising inventories, sluggish demand\nIn an interview with the Investing News Network (INN), Josef Schachter of the Schachter Energy Report explained that as US oil inventories climb, price pressure builds. He noted that the latest EIA report shows a 7.2 million barrel build in total stocks, with commercial crude up 1.8 million barrels and gasoline inventories 4.1 million barrels higher.\nSuch gains are unusual for the shoulder season, when demand typically dips to around 103 to 104 MMbbl/d, compared to 106 MMbbl/d in the summer and winter, Schachter pointed out.\nOn the flip side, global oil demand in the third quarter remained subdued, with growth projections of approximately 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) for both 2025 and 2026, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nThis marks a significant slowdown compared to the 2.8 percent growth observed in 2024.\nThe IEA attributes this deceleration to factors such as high interest rates, economic uncertainties and structural shifts in energy consumption patterns. Looking ahead, the organization projects a modest rebound in global oil demand, with an anticipated increase of 700,000 bpd in 2026. However, this growth is contingent upon factors such as economic stabilization, energy policy developments and potential shifts in global trade dynamics.\n\u201cDemand is weaker. Inventories are high, OPEC is raising production, and so we have all of that, and we think that we're going to see WTI below US$60,\u201d said Schachter, adding that he expects WTI values to sink to the US$56 to US$59 range in the fourth quarter.\nGeopolitical tensions drive oil price volatility\nMuch of the oil price volatility exhibited in the third quarter was driven by geopolitical factors, according to Igor Isaev, Doctor of Technical Sciences and head of Mind Money's Analytics Center.\n\u201cCrude oil markets in 2025 have been, indeed, anything but predictable,\" he told INN via email.\n\"Prices have swung sharply, driven by a complex interplay of geopolitical flashpoints, punitive trade policies and structural changes in supply dynamics. From Tehran to Texas, the forces shaping global energy are no longer cyclical \u2014 they\u2019ve become groundbreaking, unveiling symptoms of a broader recalibration of energy security and sovereignty.\u201d\nAs Isaev explained, while these forces aren't new, they have been especially impactful amid"

Most non-OECD growth is concentrated in Asia, with liquid fuels consumption in India and China adding more than 0.4 million b/d of consumption by 2026 compared with 2024.\nIn EIA\u2019s forecast, global oil inventories will increase by an average of 2.1 million b/d in 2026, compared with an average annual increase of 1.9 million b/d in 2025. The pace at which China continues to purchase oil to fill inventory and any major supply disruptions are key forecast uncertainties.\nUS crude production\nIn July, US crude oil production averaged more than 13.6 m"

                "body": "Oil and Gas Price Update: Q3 2025 in Review\nGeopolitics, trade tensions and economic woes infused the energy sector with volatility in Q3. What's next for the oil and gas market in 2025?\nThe oil market struggled in Q3 as prices continued to soften under mounting supply pressure.\nFollowing moderate gains in H1, prices contracted to end the third quarter lower than their July 1 start positions.\nBrent crude began the period at US$67.10 per barrel and finished at US$65.90, a 1.7 percent decline. Similarly, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) entered the 90 day session at US$65.55 per barrel, slipping to US$62.33 by September 30.\nIn its recently released energy, oil and gas report for the third quarter, Deloitte attributes the summer price slump to rising global oil inventories, as well as OPEC+ easing production cuts sooner than expected.\n\u201cOPEC+ recently announced a 137 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d) production quota increase for October, beginning the reversal of 1.65 MMbbl/d of voluntary cuts that were originally set to stay in place through 2026,\u201d it reads.\nSupply exceeded demand in the US by 1.6 MMbbl/d between May and August, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), fueling projections of further stock builds for the remainder of the year.\n\u201cWe expect inventory builds will average 2.1 MMbbl/d in the second half of 2025 and will remain elevated through 2026, putting significant downward pressure on oil prices,\u201d the EIA notes in its September short-term energy forecast.\nWTI price performance, December 31, 2024, to October 6, 2025.\nChart via the Investing News Network.\nOil prices under pressure amid rising inventories, sluggish demand\nIn an interview with the Investing News Network (INN), Josef Schachter of the Schachter Energy Report explained that as US oil inventories climb, price pressure builds. He noted that the latest EIA report shows a 7.2 million barrel build in total stocks, with commercial crude up 1.8 million barrels and gasoline inventories 4.1 million barrels higher.\nSuch gains are unusual for the shoulder season, when demand typically dips to around 103 to 104 MMbbl/d, compared to 106 MMbbl/d in the summer and winter, Schachter pointed out.\nOn the flip side, global oil demand in the third quarter remained subdued, with growth projections of approximately 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) for both 2025 and 2026, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nThis marks a significant slowdown compared to the 2.8 percent growth observed in 2024.\nThe IEA attributes this deceleration to factors such as high interest rates, economic uncertainties and structural shifts in energy consumption patterns. Looking ahead, the organization projects a modest rebound in global oil demand, with an anticipated increase of 700,000 bpd in 2026. However, this growth is contingent upon factors such as economic stabilization, energy policy developments and potential shifts in global trade dynamics.\n\u201cDemand is weaker. Inventories are high, OPEC is raising production, and so we have all of that, and we think that we're going to see WTI below US$60,\u201d said Schachter, adding that he expects WTI values to sink to the US$56 to US$59 range in the fourth quarter.\nGeopolitical tensions drive oil price volatility\nMuch of the oil price volatility exhibited in the third quarter was driven by geopolitical factors, according to Igor Isaev, Doctor of Technical Sciences and head of Mind Money's Analytics Center.\n\u201cCrude oil markets in 2025 have been, indeed, anything but predictable,\" he told INN via email.\n\"Prices have swung sharply, driven by a complex interplay of geopolitical flashpoints, punitive trade policies and structural changes in supply dynamics. From Tehran to Texas, the forces shaping global energy are no longer cyclical \u2014 they\u2019ve become groundbreaking, unveiling symptoms of a broader recalibration of energy security and sovereignty.\u201d\nAs Isaev explained, while these forces aren't new, they have been especially impactful amid"

The pair trades at the 1,1615 area at the time of writing, as concerns about France's political and fiscal situation and fears of a protracted shutdown of the US government have crushed investors' appetite for risk.\nIn Europe, pressure on French President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap election mounts amid growing criticism from his own ranks. Former allies have joined the demands of opposition parties to call elections or resign, and rating agencies have warned of a further downgrade of France's sovereign credit status if the political impasse drags on.\nAcross the Atlantic, the political scenario is not much better. US Senate Democratic and Republican leaders remain unable to find a way to restart funding as the shutdown enters its second week, and hopes of a breakthrough this week have fallen to 23% according to a poll by Polymarket. The lack of progress has started to erode market sentiment, boosting demand for the US Dollar and other traditional safe havens.\nOn Wednesday's economic calendar, the minutes of the last Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting will be the main diversion from the political drama. During the European session, European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, including President Christine Lagarde, will take the stage, and some Fed officials are expected to speak during the US session.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily digest market movers: Political uncertainty hurts the Euro\n- The growing political uncertainty in France is bleeding the Euro this week, while investors' concerns about a prolonged shutdown of the US federal government have started to hurt market sentiment and boost demand for the safe-haven USD. In the absence of key macroeconomic data to alter this view, the bearish EUR/USD trend has further room to go.\n- On Tuesday, ECB President Christine Lagarde reiterated that the disinflationary process in the Eurozone has been completed and that she is hopeful that France will meet its international commitments and produce a budget in time.\n- Eurozone data has failed to improve investors' sentiment. German Factory Orders figures showed a 0.8% decline in August, against market expectations of a 1.4% growth, following a 2.7% contraction in July. Year-on-year, orders have increased at a 1.5% rate, after a 3.3% fall in July.\n- Fed policymakers continue showing their divergences. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari has warned about a burst of inflation if the bank lowers rates too fast, while US President Donald Trump's latest appointment, Fed Governor Stephen Miran, stated that inflation is due to population increases and reiterated that monetary policy needs to ease.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD is testing support at the 1.1610 area\nThe EUR/USD technical picture reflects strong bearish pressure. The 4-hour chart Relative Strength Index (RSI) is low but not yet at oversold levels, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains well below the signal line, with red histogram bars increasing, suggesting that further depreciation is likely.\nBears are now testing suppo"

                "body": "Most Read: OPEC + Delivers Modest Output Hike, Brent Crude Rises 1.7%. What Next for Oil Prices?\nEUR/USD continued its slide this morning as a combination of US Dollar strength and concerns around the French political drama rambled on.\nThe most recent news indicates that President Macron has given the outgoing Prime Minister, Sebastien Lecornu, until Wednesday evening to try and get the divided parliament to agree on a new prime minister.\nIt is unclear what will happen if Lecornu is unsuccessful, but the likely choices would be either appointing someone who is an expert but not a politician (a technocrat) or calling for early elections.\nResurgent US Dollar Keeps EUR/USD on the Back Foot\nThe US Dollar has surprised many by its resilience over the past two weeks. What could be the driving force of the Greenback stubbornness at the moment? Let us take a look.\nOne of the reasons benefitting the US Dollar may be down to the one-week interest rate which is rather expensive. The current rate rests near 4.15%. With a lack of high impact US data, market participants appear to be staying away from the loading up on US Dollar short positions.\nMarket participants may have also changed their outlook due to an IMF report last week. The prevailing theory of late was that Central Banks were the sellers of US Dollars in April and May, however the IMF data showed the dollar\u2019s share in bank reserves remained about 57% in the second quarter of 2025. That suggests something else could be at work and maybe it was the private sector dumping US Dollar during Q2.\nThe US Government shutdown has not had the impact many market participants had hoped it would. I think many expected the US Dollar to slide if the shutdown drags on.\nThe latest predictions show that people are slightly less worried that this shutdown will become the longest ever (which would be more than 35 days); the chance of that happening is now down to 22%.\nNevertheless, markets are scheduled to hear from several officials from the Federal Reserve today, including Bostic, Bowman, and Miran, all speaking between 4:00 PM and 4:30 PM Central European Time (CET).\nHowever, I don't expect their comments to significantly change the market's strong belief that the Fed will cut interest rates two more times before the end of the year.\nAs things stand, markets are still pricing in around 44.5 bps of rate cuts through December 2025.\nSource: LSEG\nTechnical Analysis - EUR/USD\nFrom a technical standpoint, EUR/USD is approaching a key confluence level which could prove key to the pair's next move.\nEUR/USD had broken above a descending trendline from the YTD high, before pushing lower. However, it is approaching the medium term ascending trendline which coincides with a retest of the descending trendline and the 100-day MA around the 1.1626 handle.\nA break of this level could see the start of a deeper pullback toward the trendline touch and swing low on August 1, resting just below the pivot price of 1.1450.\nBefore that, there is support at 1.1584 and 1.1528 which could come into play and provide some short-term relief.\nA move higher from here faces resistance at 1.1700 before the 1.1800 swing high and YTD high at 1.1918 comes into focus.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart, October 7, 2025\nSource: TradingView.com (click to enlarge)\nClient Sentiment Data - EUR/USD\nLooking at OANDA client sentiment data and market participants are short on the EUR/USD Index with 61% of traders net-short. I prefer to take a contrarian view toward crowd sentiment and thus the fact that so many traders are short means EUR/USD could rise in the near-term.\nFollow Zain on Twitter/X for Additional Market News and Insights @zvawda\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or directors.

                "body": "EUR/USD (Euro vs. U.S. Dollar) Struggles Near 1.1650 as Political Turmoil in France and U.S. Dollar Strength Intensify\nThe EUR/USD pair extended its decline on Tuesday, falling toward 1.1650, its lowest level in over a month, as investors fled from European assets amid a deepening political crisis in France and a resilient U.S. dollar supported by hawkish Federal Reserve remarks. The euro, which briefly attempted to recover above 1.1700, failed to sustain momentum, dropping 0.42% intraday. Traders are confronting simultaneous headwinds: political instability in the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy and lingering uncertainty over the U.S. government shutdown that continues to distort global risk sentiment. France\u2019s fiscal and political outlook remains the epicenter of pressure on the euro. Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu\u2019s resignation after only 27 days in office left President Emmanuel Macron facing the most severe domestic challenge of his tenure. Macron\u2019s call for Lecornu to negotiate with coalition leaders has failed to calm markets, as opposition parties push for early elections. The French political vacuum raises doubts about fiscal consolidation, with France\u2019s deficit now near twice the EU\u2019s 3% limit, threatening renewed credit downgrades. Investors fear that another sovereign downgrade could lift French yields by 30\u201340 basis points, tightening financing conditions across the bloc.\nEuropean Central Bank Faces Policy Crossroads as Lagarde and Nagel Signal Divergent Outlooks\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) remains trapped between inflation control and deteriorating regional growth. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated this week that the \u201cdisinflationary process is over,\u201d suggesting the recent decline in price pressures may have plateaued. Yet Vice President Luis de Guindos acknowledged risks of recession, while Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel defended the need to \u201cpreserve credibility through restraint.\u201d Markets now price a 46% probability of another 25-basis-point cut by December, as bond spreads between Italy and Germany widen to 184 basis points, the highest since March. Lagarde and Nagel\u2019s upcoming speeches are expected to clarify the central bank\u2019s position on whether to prioritize inflation stability or economic growth. German data added to the pessimism, with factory orders falling 0.8% in August, far below expectations for a 1.4% increase, extending July\u2019s 2.7% contraction. This series of weak data solidifies the view that Europe\u2019s manufacturing base remains under heavy pressure.\nU.S. Dollar Strengthens Despite Fed Rate-Cut Bets as Safe-Haven Demand Lifts the Greenback\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) continues to defy expectations, trading near 98.33, its second consecutive daily gain, after comments from Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who emphasized that inflation \u201cremains too high.\u201d Despite a 94% probability of a Fed rate cut in October and 84% odds in December (per CME FedWatch data), the dollar\u2019s resilience underscores the market\u2019s preference for safety during global political strain. The U.S. government shutdown, now in its seventh day, has failed to weaken the greenback as traders hedge against potential European instability. Fed officials Raphael Bostic, Neel Kashkari, Michelle Bowman, and Stephen Miran are scheduled to speak later today, and any hawkish signals could amplify the dollar\u2019s advantage. The prolonged shutdown is delaying critical data such as Nonfarm Payrolls, CPI, and Retail Sales, adding opacity to Fed decision-making. However, the Fed\u2019s confidence in its \u201cwell-calibrated\u201d policy has prevented broader panic, supporting Treasury yields at 4.12% on the 10-year note.\nTechnical View: EUR/USD Bears Target 1.1610 as Momentum Weakens\nTechnically, the EUR/USD structure remains distinctly bearish. The pair has been unable to reclaim its descending trendline from mid-September, with the 50-day EMA at 1.1726 and 200-day EMA at 1.1715 flattening, confirming a lack of upward momentum. Immediat"

A raft of Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers will be making public appearances, as well as a speech from Bank of England (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Huw Pill.\nWednesday\u2019s key event will be the release of the Fed\u2019s latest Meeting Minutes, due at 18:00 GMT. The Fed broke the seal on interest rate cuts at its latest rate call, and investors will be looking for signs that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is tilting toward more rate cuts through the remainder of the year.\nAs the US government shutdown rolls on, the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be grappling with a lack of key official datasets as it makes interest rate decisions heading into the tail end of the calendar year. Barring any significant shocks in the data that remains available to the Fed, rate markets have locked in expectations of two follow-up interest rate cuts on October 29 and December 10.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance."

                "body": "AUD/USD, NZD/USD and AUD/NZD Outlook Ahead of RBNZ Decision\nThe US dollar was the strongest FX major on Tuesday as the government shutdown dragged on. While the lack of incoming data has helped the greenback find support, there will surely come a point where prolonged inaction could turn USD-bearish if it continues. Regardless, the US Dollar Index (DXY) posted its highest close in two months and its best single-day gain in eight.\nUSD/JPY extended its advance to a seven-month high, with the Japanese yen remaining the weakest major amid expectations of a stimulus-driven policy agenda from Japan\u2019s incoming prime minister. EUR/USD fell for a second day and is hovering near key support at 1.1645, while a bearish outside day formed on AUD/USD around the 0.66 handle. Meanwhile, NZD/USD printed a prominent swing high ahead of today\u2019s Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) rate decision.\nView related analysis:\n- USD/JPY Bulls On High Alert For Breakout As Japanese Yen Slumps\n- AUD/USD Q4 Outlook: Bears Target Slower Growth, RBA Cut\n- Gold Outlook: Rising Implied Volatility on Path to $4000\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nAUD/USD, NZD/USD, AUD/NZD IN Focus Ahead of RBNZ Interest Rate Decision\nThe RBNZ is widely expected to cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 2.75%, though a 50bp cut cannot be ruled out given weak business sentiment. At the very least, a dovish 25bp cut could pave the way for further New Zealand dollar losses. While my near-term bias remains bearish on NZD/USD and AUD/NZD, the latter may still find upside room in the short term if the Aussie outperforms the Kiwi following the decision.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe Australian dollar (AUD/USD) has reversed lower after multiple rejections near the 0.6625\u20130.6630 resistance zone, where the July high has regained technical significance. Tuesday\u2019s bearish outside day reinforced downside momentum as the Aussie dollar slipped back below the 20-day SMA, signalling renewed weakness against the US dollar.\nPrice action now favours sellers while trading beneath 0.6630, with bears likely eyeing the 50-day SMA (0.6544) and the 0.6520 support zone as near-term downside targets. A clean break below those levels could expose the 0.6500 handle, while rallies toward 0.66 may attract fresh selling pressure.\nThe broader bias remains bearish as momentum realigns with the decline from the September high, keeping the Aussie on the defensive into mid-October.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/USD\nNZD/USD Technical Analysis: New Zealand Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe New Zealand dollar (NZD/USD) has turned lower after forming a swing high near 0.5847, a zone that aligns with the 200-day SMA and 20-day EMA, reinforcing its role as a key resistance cluster. Monday\u2019s failure to hold above this level triggered renewed bearish momentum, with the Kiwi falling nearly 0.8%, marking its weakest session in over a week.\nMomentum has now realigned with the dominant daily downtrend, keeping sellers in control heading into today\u2019s RBNZ interest rate decision. Bears may look to fade minor rallies within Tuesday\u2019s range, targeting the 0.5755 support, 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, and the 0.5700 handle as potential downside objectives.\nThe near-term bias remains bearish while NZD/USD trades beneath 0.5850, with rallies likely to meet resistance around the May low and September VPOC.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView NZD/USD\nAUD/NZD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs New Zealand Dollar\nWhile both the Australian dollar (AUD) and New Zealand dollar (NZD) remain under pressure against the US dollar, momentum appears more favourable for the Aussie in the cross, keeping AUD/NZD supported in the near term.\nThe pair found demand at the monthly pivot point (1.1297) on Monday, forming a doji candle before edging higher on Tuesday. The 10-day and 20-day EMAs continue to underpin the uptrend, highlighting stron"

The AUD/USD pair weakened amid investment outflows, as the S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.14% to trade below 8,950 at the time of writing, pressured by losses in technology and gold stocks.\nThe AUD also faces challenges after weaker housing data was released on Wednesday. Private house approvals in Australia declined by 2.6% month-over-month (MoM) to 9,027 units in August, as expected, and reversing a 1.3% rise in the previous month. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted Building Permits fell by 6% MoM to 14,744 units, following a 10% decrease previously, marking the second consecutive monthly decline.\nThe downside of the AUD/USD pair could be restrained as the Australian Dollar (AUD) could receive support from the cautious stance surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The Australian central bank is expected to maintain its interest rates after deciding to keep its Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 3.6% in September. The RBA warned that inflation has proven more persistent than expected, especially in market services, while the labor market remains tight.\nAustralian Dollar declines as US Dollar extends gains despite government shutdown\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is gaining ground for the third successive day and trading around 98.80 at the time of writing. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meeting Minutes will be eyed later in the day.\n- The US Dollar strengthens as safe-haven demand rises amid the ongoing government shutdown, with President Donald Trump threatening mass federal worker layoffs as prospects for a resolution dim.\n- Federal Reserve (Fed) Board of Governors member Stephen Miran expressed his belief on Tuesday that inflation itself is simply a cause of \"population increases\". Monetary policy needs to ease to get ahead of the shift down in the neutral rate, Miran added.\n- Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari struck a more reserved tone than some of his Fed counterparts on Tuesday, cautioning that it's still too soon to be able to tell if tariff-led inflation will be \"sticky\" or not. However, Kashkari noted that he's particularly bullish on the labor market and is expecting a return to form for American job creation, which has sputtered recently.\n- Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid delivered hawkish remarks on Monday, saying that the Fed must maintain its inflation credibility and stressed that inflation is too high. Schmid added that monetary policy is appropriately calibrated.\n- The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in nearly a 95% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and an 83% possibility of another reduction in December.\n- United States (US) Senators failed to pass spending proposals to reopen the federal government for a fourth time, extending the ongoing shutdown into a new week. The closure has suspended key federal programs and delayed major economic reports, including September\u2019s jobs data, which was originally due on Friday.\n- The US ADP Employment Change report, released on Wednesday, showed that private sector payrolls declined by 32,000 in September, while annual pay growth was 4.5%. This figure followed the 3,000 decrease (revised from a 54,000 increase) reported in August and came in below the market expectation of 50,000.\n- The latest Job Openings showed the labor market is slowing, yet vacancies rose from 7.21 million to 7.23 million in August.

Softer wage growth is expected to weaken household spending, potentially cooling demand-driven inflation. Crucially, the softer wage growth figures followed recent comments from BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who raised concerns about tariffs affecting wages, stating:\n\u201cIf uncertainty regarding overseas economies and trade policies remains high, firms may place stronger emphasis on cost-cutting and may weaken their efforts to reflect price increases in wages.\u201d\nSanae Takaichi, the new leader of Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party and potentially Prime Minister, also underscored the need for sustained wage growth for further monetary policy tightening. She stated:\n\u201cDemand-pull inflation \u2014 wage increases driving demand growth, leading to a gradual rising of prices and corporate profits \u2014 is the best outcome. Until such a situation emerges, we must maintain close communication with the Bank of Japan. We must stay in sync.\u201d\nTakaichi\u2019s support for ultra-loose monetary policy and today\u2019s wage growth data sent USD/JPY to its highest level since February 2025.\nAcross the Pacific, market focus remains on the US government shutdown and the Fed\u2019s upcoming interest rate decision. Overnight, lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a stopgap funding bill needed to reopen the government.\nA prolonged shutdown could weigh on the US economy and further delay key economic data releases. The Fed typically adopts a more dovish stance during extended shutdowns, reinforcing expectations for policy easing. With the next Senate vote today, the US dollar could face selling pressure if the vote fails to reach the 60 required to pass the stopgap funding bill.\nMeanwhile, Fed speakers and the FOMC meeting minutes will also require consideration amid rising bets on multiple Q4 rate cuts. FOMC voting members Michael Barr, Alberto Musalem, and alternate member Neil Kashkari are on the calendar to speak. Views on the shutdown, the economic outlook, and inflation could influence USD/JPY trends.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: Political Factors, BoJ Policy, and Dovish Fed Risks\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nAs traders lower bets on an October BoJ policy adjustment, uncertainty lingers over the RBA\u2019s rate path, spotlighting AUD/USD.\nTurning focus to the AUD/USD pair, Aussie inflation and labor market data are clouding the RBA\u2019s rate path. Australian ANZ-Indeed job ads slid 3.3% month-on-month in September, accelerating from a 0.3% drop in August. The job ad slump followed August\u2019s sharp drop in full-time employment, signaling a deteriorating labor market. A softer labor market may curb wage growth, dampening inflation.\nHowever, recent inflation figures have raised doubts about a November RBA rate cut, fueling monetary policy uncertainty. The Aussie Monthly CPI Indicator rose to 3% in August, reaching the top end of the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target range, up from 2.8% in July. While recent labor market data has weighed on the Aussie dollar, AUD/USD remains above August levels, underscoring uncertainty over the timing of an RBA rate cut.\nOn Friday, October 10, RBA Governor Michele Bullock may share views on recent data and the RBA\u2019s policy stance.\nAUD/USD: Key Scenarios to Watch\nSee our full AUD/USD analysis for detailed trends and trade setups.\nWhile Aussie economic data continues to fuel speculation about an RBA rate cut, developments on Capitol Hill and Fed speakers will also influence AUD/USD trends.\nAnother failed Senate vote and growing calls for back-to-back Fed rate cuts in October and December would narrow the US-Aussie rate differential, favoring the Aussie dollar. A narrower rate differential would likely drive AUD/USD toward $0.66. A sustained move above $0.66 could bring $0.665 into play.\nO"

                "body": "USD/JPY breakout: Why the Dollar is surging over the Yen [Video]\n- USD/JPY reclaims momentum, breaking above the 150 handle as the dollar gains traction amid persistent yield divergence.\n- Japan\u2019s pro-stimulus tone and BOJ\u2019s ultra-loose stance continue to weigh on the yen, offsetting sporadic intervention threats.\n- Technical bias remains bullish, with structure favoring 154.80 and 158.87 as upside draw-on-liquidity targets while the 150.47\u2013151.73 zone acts as critical support.\nDollar strength reasserted against the Yen\nAfter weeks of choppy range-bound action, the U.S. dollar has regained control against the Japanese yen. The pair surged past 151 to trade above 152, driven by monetary policy divergence and investor preference for yield-bearing assets.\nWhile markets have priced in the possibility of future Fed rate cuts, U.S. yields remain significantly higher than Japan\u2019s - keeping the greenback attractive for carry traders. The Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious-dovish tone contrasts sharply with the Bank of Japan\u2019s prolonged ultra-accommodation, widening the policy gap that fuels dollar demand.\nBoJ dovishness and political tailwinds weigh on Yen\nThe yen\u2019s weakness has deepened following Sanae Takaichi\u2019s victory as LDP leader, a development seen by investors as a signal for more fiscal stimulus and continuity of pro-growth, low-rate policies. This narrative reinforced bets that the BOJ won\u2019t rush into aggressive rate hikes, despite rising domestic inflation and mounting external pressure.\nRecent comments from Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki warning against \u201cexcessive volatility\u201d had limited market impact. Traders interpret these remarks as verbal intervention rather than imminent action. Unless the yen collapses beyond control, direct intervention appears unlikely.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. government shutdown uncertainty has ironically supported the dollar, with global investors seeking refuge in U.S. assets as a short-term safe haven - further strengthening USD/JPY momentum.\nTechnical outlook\nUSD/JPY has broken above a two-month consolidation, reclaiming the D1 Fair Value Gap (150.47\u2013151.73) and extending beyond 152. This FVG now serves as critical re-entry support, confirming that institutional order flow remains bullish.\nThe next liquidity zones are positioned at 154.80 and 158.87, representing unmitigated imbalances and prior swing highs that may act as magnets if momentum persists.\nBullish scenario: Reclaim and continuation\nUSD/JPY could retest the 150.47\u2013151.73 Fair Value Gap before continuing its upward trajectory. A clean rejection or bullish response from this zone would confirm re-accumulation and sustain the higher-timeframe bullish delivery.\nTriggers:\n- Strong reaction from 150.5\u2013151.0 zone\n- Daily close above 151.7 confirms continuation\n- Rising yield differential or hawkish U.S. data\nTargets:\n- 154.80 \u2013 Previous liquidity zone\n- 158.87 \u2013 External swing high and draw on liquidity\nInvalidation: Daily close below 150.40\nBearish scenario: Failed FVG hold and re-entry into range\nIf price fails to hold above 150.4, USD/JPY could re-enter the old range, signaling distribution at premium levels. This would open a short-term corrective phase toward discounted liquidity zones near 149.20\u2013147.80.\nTriggers:\n- Rejection from 152.3\u2013152.7 zone\n- Daily close below 150.4\n- Verbal intervention or soft U.S. data\nTargets:\n- 149.20 \u2013 Prior consolidation support\n- 147.80 \u2013 Discounted liquidity\nInvalidation: Break and close above 152.80\nConclusion\nUSD/JPY remains technically and fundamentally bullish. The breakout above 150 reflects not just momentum but conviction - anchored by yield divergence and Japan\u2019s continued policy restraint. Unless the BOJ surprises with tightening or U.S. yields collapse, dollar-yen could maintain its upward bias toward 154.80 and 158.87 in the weeks ahead.\nAuthor\nJasper Osita\nACY Securities\nJasper has been in the markets since 2019 trading currencies, indices and commodities like Gold.

                "body": "It has been a challenging period for the Japanese yen in the short term. The USD/JPY pair has extended its four-day winning streak with an increase of almost 2.7%, reflecting the yen\u2019s continued weakness against the U.S. dollar. For now, bullish pressure remains strong, fueled by uncertainty surrounding the new fiscal policies proposed by Japan\u2019s new political leadership. This uncertainty has caused the yen to consistently lose ground, and as long as this outlook persists, buying pressure on USD/JPY could continue to strengthen in the coming sessions.\nNew Party Leader\nOn October 4, Sanae Takaichi was elected as the new leader of Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Takaichi, a veteran politician with extensive ministerial experience, is on track to become Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, pending confirmation by parliament.\nHowever, what has truly moved the markets are the economic plans expected from her incoming administration. Takaichi is known for advocating aggressive public spending to stimulate growth \u2014 a stance that has raised concerns over Japan\u2019s rising debt levels and fiscal sustainability. In addition, her government could push for lower interest rates to support the economy in the short term, potentially conflicting with the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) inflation-control objectives.\nLooking at Japan\u2019s inflation curve, prices have eased but remain above the 2% target, with the latest reading at 2.7% in August. This suggests that the BoJ should maintain a tighter policy stance to bring inflation back to target. However, the government\u2019s new fiscal direction could undermine that effort, creating a sense of weakened inflation control and possibly reducing confidence in yen demand.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nBefore Takaichi\u2019s victory, markets expected the BoJ to end the year with an interest rate of 0.75%, slightly above the current 0.50%. However, this outlook could change under the new leadership, keeping Japan among the developed economies with the lowest interest rates. Over time, this may make yen-denominated investments less attractive.\nMoreover, the combination of fiscal uncertainty, the risk of economic overstimulation, and weak inflation control could further erode confidence in the yen, leading to a persistent loss of appeal. This environment could reinforce steady buying pressure on the USD/JPY in the near term.\nIs the U.S. Dollar Recovering?\nDespite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, the dollar has shown resilience, rebounding over recent sessions. This strength partly stems from its role as a temporary safe haven amid political uncertainty in the United States.\nThe dollar\u2019s recovery is also reflected in the DXY Index, which measures Greenback\u2019s performance against a basket of major currencies. The index remained above 98 points, maintaining a positive upward slope over recent sessions.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nThis trend indicates that confidence in the U.S. dollar has been steadily improving. As long as the DXY maintains this upward trajectory and market perception of U.S. stability continues to strengthen, the yen\u2019s room for recovery will likely remain limited \u2014 further supporting upward pressure on USD/JPY.\nTechnical Outlook for USD/JPY\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend Back in Play: Since late April, USD/JPY has maintained a solid bullish trend, with consolidation zones acting as structural support. The latest bullish impulse has driven the pair to new highs, confirming that the dominant formation remains upward. If the price manages to break above key resistance levels, buying pressure could continue to dominate in the short term.\n- RSI: The RSI readings show that the average buying momentum remains strong over the past 14 sessions. However, the indicator is approaching the overbought zone (70), suggesting that the market could be entering a short-term imbalance phase. This could open space for minor corrective pullbacks if buying pressure becomes excessive.\n- ADX: The ADX indicator remains below "

The Fed typically adopts a more dovish stance during extended shutdowns, reinforcing expectations for policy easing. With the next Senate vote today, the US dollar could face selling pressure if the vote fails to reach the 60 required to pass the stopgap funding bill.\nMeanwhile, Fed speakers and the FOMC meeting minutes will also require consideration amid rising bets on multiple Q4 rate cuts. FOMC voting members Michael Barr, Alberto Musalem, and alternate member Neil Kashkari are on the calendar to speak. Views on the shutdown, the economic outlook, and inflation could influence USD/JPY trends.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: Political Factors, BoJ Policy, and Dovish Fed Risks\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nAs traders lower bets on an October BoJ policy adjustment, uncertainty lingers over the RBA\u2019s rate path, spotlighting AUD/USD.\nTurning focus to the AUD/USD pair, Aussie inflation and labor market data are clouding the RBA\u2019s rate path. Australian ANZ-Indeed job ads slid 3.3% month-on-month in September, accelerating from a 0.3% drop in August. The job ad slump followed August\u2019s sharp drop in full-time employment, signaling a deteriorating labor market. A softer labor market may curb wage growth, dampening inflation.\nHowever, recent inflation figures have raised doubts about a November RBA rate cut, fueling monetary policy uncertainty. The Aussie Monthly CPI Indicator rose to 3% in August, reaching the top end of the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target range, up from 2.8% in July. While recent labor market data has weighed on the Aussie dollar, AUD/USD remains above August levels, underscoring uncertainty over the timing of an RBA rate cut.\nOn Friday, October 10, RBA Governor Michele Bullock may share views on recent data and the RBA\u2019s policy stance.\nAUD/USD: Key Scenarios to Watch\nSee our full AUD/USD analysis for detailed trends and trade setups.\nWhile Aussie economic data continues to fuel speculation about an RBA rate cut, developments on Capitol Hill and Fed speakers will also influence AUD/USD trends.\nAnother failed Senate vote and growing calls for back-to-back Fed rate cuts in October and December would narrow the US-Aussie rate differential, favoring the Aussie dollar. A narrower rate differential would likely drive AUD/USD toward $0.66. A sustained move above $0.66 could bring $0.665 into play.\nO"

                "body": "USD/CAD continues to gain ground for the second successive session, trading around 1.3960 during the Asian hours on Wednesday. The pair appreciates as the US Dollar (USD) gains ground, as United States (US) Consumer Inflation Expectations for the year ahead rose to 3.4% in September, the highest in five months, compared to 3.2% in August.\nHowever, the US Dollar may face challenges amid prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy stance. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in nearly a 95% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in October and an 83% possibility of another reduction in December.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) Board of Governors member Stephen Miran expressed his belief on Tuesday that inflation itself is simply a cause of \"population increases\". Monetary policy needs to ease to get ahead of the shift down in the neutral rate, Miran added.\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari struck a more reserved tone than some of his Fed counterparts on Tuesday, cautioning that it's still too soon to be able to tell if tariff-led inflation will be \"sticky\" or not. However, Kashkari noted that he's particularly bullish on the labor market and is expecting a return to form for American job creation, which has sputtered recently.\nThe upside of the USD/CAD pair could be limited as the commodity-linked CAD receives support from higher Oil prices. It is worth noting that Canada is the largest crude exporter to the United States.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price continues to gain ground for the fourth successive session, trading around $62.00 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices receive support from a more modest OPEC+ output hike. The Oil group recently decided to limit its production increase, opting for the smallest rise among the options considered.\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have"

        "market_summary": "[text]\" then \"SENTIMENT: [one word]\". \n\nFirst, I need to extract key points from both articles. Article 1 says GBP/JPY rejected at 203.00 near 202.50 after Japanese Finance Minister Kato's intervention warning supported JPY. It mentions Yen weakness from Takaichi's election win (pro-stimulus candidate) but also UK's weak services data raising BoE cut expectations. \n\nArticle 2 shows GBP/JPY actually pushed higher to 204.50 despite that, with fading BoJ hawkish bets as analysts now expect no rate hikes until 2026. JPY weakness continues while markets await BoE Pill's speech for rate cut clues. Interesting contradiction - Article 1 says \"rejection at 203\" but Article 2 shows new high at 204.50, likely because events unfolded sequentially (Article 1 dated Tuesday, Article 2 Wednesday).\n\nHmm... core tension here: JPY under pressure from political shift toward fiscal stimulus (Takaichi) reducing BoJ tightening chances, but Kato's intervention threat provides occasional support. Meanwhile GBP is mixed - UK data weak but BoE cut timing uncertain. Overall pair is climbing (202.50 \u2192 204.50) so bullish momentum dominates despite temporary rejections.\n\nFor sentiment: Clear upward trajectory (204.50 high), driven by structural JPY weakness. UK weakness is secondary factor. \"Mixed\" would imply balance but data shows consistent pair strength. \"Positive\" for GBP/JPY bulls makes sense since higher = stronger GBP against JPY. Must choose from: Positive/Neutral/Negative/Mixed. Definitely not Neutral or Negative. Between Positive and Mixed - but articles emphasize sustained upside, so Positive fits better. \n\nWait, should confirm timeline: Article 1's \"Tuesday\" rejection was temporary since Article 2's \"Wednesday\" shows new high. So net directional bias is clearly bullish. Sentiment = Positive.\n\nSummary must be 3-4 sentences: \n1) Pair rebounded past resistance to 204.50 despite Tuesday's rejection \n2) Driven by JPY weakness from Takaichi's election (killing BoJ hike bets) \n3) BoE cut expectations partially offsetting but insufficient to reverse trend \n4) Kato's intervention threat only causing minor pullbacks\n\n*checks word count* That's 4 tight sentences covering all drivers. Sentiment clearly Positive based on price action overwhelming counter-factors.\n</think>\n\nSUMMARY: GBP/JPY initially faced rejection near 203.00 on Tuesday following Japanese Finance Minister Kato's warning of close FX monitoring, temporarily supporting the Yen after its 300-pip plunge post-Takaichi's election victory. However, the pair surged to a fresh yearly high above 204.50 by Wednesday as fading BoJ hawkish expectations intensified Yen weakness, with markets pricing out any 2025 rate hikes and anticipating March 2026 as the earliest hike date. Despite UK data showing a services sector slowdown and reduced hiring plans\u2014fueling BoE cut speculation\u2014the sustained BoJ policy divergence (pro-stimulus Takaichi government favoring fiscal spending over monetary tightening) dominated price action, overwhelming brief intervention threats and domestic UK concerns. The pair's consistent upward trajectory reflects structural JPY vulnerability outweighing temporary GBP headwinds.  \nSENTIMENT: Positive\n\n**Overall Market Sentiment:** [one word]\".",

These comments pose a veiled threat of a potential intervention and have contributed to providing some footing for the Yen:\nIn the UK, recent data revealed a significant slowdown in the services sector, and a survey by the Bank of England showed that British businesses\u2019 hiring plans fell to their lowest levels since 2020.\nThese figures have raised expectations that the Bank of England might be forced to cut rates again. In that sense, the minutes of the last BoE FPC committee, and BoE\u2019s Chief Economist Huw Pill\u2019s comments will be carefully analysed to confirm those expectations on Wednesday.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and copywriter in diverse Forex-related firms, like FXStreet and Kantox."

Absurd,\" Balchunas wrote, pointing to how the Bitcoin ETF has leapfrogged established funds, including the 25-year-old iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF.\n\"IBIT being the most profitable product for the largest issuer of ETFs in the world, clearly shows the size of the demand from institutions and retail, and this milestone should eliminate any doubt on risk appetite for Bitcoin,\u201d Pratik Kala, head of research at Apollo Crypto, told Decrypt.\nAs of Monday, IBIT held $98.47 billion in assets across 1.38 billion shares with a 0.25% fee, on track to hit $100 billion in just 435 days, far faster than Vanguard\u2019s S&P 500 ETF, which took 2,011 days.\nJagdish Pandya, founder of Blockon Ventures, told Decrypt that comparing Bitcoin ETFs with traditional ETFs is \"an injustice to old asset classes.\"\nHe attributed the disparity to Bitcoin's structural advantages, noting that traditional assets have \"higher supply, no scarcity, low returns, no financial disruption\" and therefore \"have no chance to outperform Bitcoin ETFs.\"\nPandya argued that that were Bitcoin's price to eventually top $1 million, \"all ETF comparisons will stop,\" adding that Bitcoin ETFs would \"emerge as a clear leader, more profitable than decades-old funds.\"\nBitcoin is currently trading at around $124,500, trading flat on the day after hitting a new all-time high above $126,000 earlier in the week, per CoinGecko data.\nLast week, IBIT recorded $1.8 billion of the $3.2 billion in total inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in its second-largest week on record, according to Farside Investors data.\nThe performance came as investment products tied to crypto saw huge inflows of $5.95 billion globally last week, according to a CoinShares report.\nAddressing concerns about potential market downturns, Ruchir Gupta, co-founder of Gyld Finance, told Decrypt that while Bitcoin's correlation with risk markets could drive outflows during equity downturns, \"the ETFs have opened up Bitcoin to a much larger investor base, a part of which is longer-term sticky holders.\""

We\u2019re 18 months into the post-2024 halving rally, with no crash in sight and a monthly RSI signaling controlled growth that could persist.\nBreaking the previous all-time high before the halving sets this cycle apart, driven by institutional demand. With weaker halvings, macro influences, and a more mature market, the old cycle may be history. In October 2025, Bitcoin is still going strong, but it\u2019s moving to a new rhythm\u2014driven by big money, not hype.\n\ud83d\udce2 What do you think?\nWill Bitcoin\u2019s cycles keep fading, or is the old pattern coming back?

                "body": "Ethena Labs has announced that it has started working with UR Global to roll out its USDe stablecoin to clients in more than 45 countries. This collaboration indicates the further narrowing of the gap between decentralized finance and conventional banking system. This partnership is also a major move towards the mainstream consumer making DeFi a reality with a single neobank.\nIncreased Utility of USDe in Everyday Finance\nThe collaboration between Ethena labs and UR global is aimed at attaching USDe, a synthetic dollar stablecoin by Ethena, to the blockchain-based neobank infrastructure of UR. Users can earn up to 5% annual percentage yield (APY) on their USDe holdings, which is comparable to standard savings accounts.\nPerhaps most importantly, the platform reduces off-ramp fees for USDe-to-fiat conversion, reducing one of the major barriers to everyday users engaging in digital assets.\nThe service will be accessible via iOS, Android, and web interfaces, providing widespread availability regardless of device preference. Moreover, direct spending capabilities of the USDe will be offered through a Mastercard debit card within several weeks and will turn the stablecoin into a useful payment method to use in the cases of daily shopping.\nBlockchain-Native Banking Infrastructure of UR\nThe ecosystem supports UR Global, as it is the first fully blockchain-based neobank in the world. The platform integrates the functionality of traditional banking (i.e., multi-currency accounts, debit cards) with blockchain-specific functionality.\nUR\u2019s Swiss-backed infrastructure allows users to hold both fiat currency and stablecoins in the same account, allowing for seamless transitions between traditional and decentralized financial systems.\nThis infrastructure is particularly important for the Ethena cooperation since it provides the regulatory compliance and banking rails necessary to enable meaningful USDe usefulness in real-world situations. Now users can use USDe as a dollar savings tool that generates income and at the same time be able to use ordinary payment networks to pay regular expenses.\nStrategic Timing and Market Environment\nEthena-UR partnership is a timely event on the stablecoin market and the general adoption of DeFi. In 2025, Ethena has been prolifically the product range of USDe, especially starting a collaboration with the TON Foundation to deploy USDe into the ecosystem of a billion-plus users of Telegram and the Sui blockchain to deliver native stablecoins.\nAs McKinsey research on stablecoin infrastructure sees it, tokenized cash and stablecoins are becoming important elements in next-generation payment systems, especially in cross-border transactions where the traditional banking infrastructure is sluggish and costly.\nThis could be particularly beneficial to the customers in the emerging markets that have not yet developed banking systems or where access to dollar-denominated deposits is limited. The stability of USDe, along with the accessibility of UR, and elimination of translation costs offer a very attractive value proposition to investors who seek to preserve wealth in dollar-equivalent assets and maintain realistic spending capacity.\nConclusion\nThe agreement between Ethena Labs and UR Global is a significant step towards making DeFi available to mainstream users in 45+ countries. This partnership is the most effective way to close the divide between decentralized finance and traditional banking by incorporating USDe into the blockchain-native neobank platform of UR, which also has competitive interest rates, no off-ramp fees, and the ability to use a Mastercard debit card.\nThe success of the Ethena-UR partnership will eventually be established by its implementation regarding regulatory compliance, peg stability, and user experience. However, it may serve as an outline for how DeFi protocols might achieve widespread adoption while keeping the core elements that make decentralized finance desirable."

                "body": "Key Takeaways\nEthereum (ETH), once the domain of open-source idealists and decentralized app builders, is rapidly maturing into something much bigger: a global financial infrastructure asset.\nAs the network transitions into its post-Merge identity and institutional staking gains traction, ETH has evolved beyond being \u201cgas\u201d for smart contracts.\nIt has now become a cornerstone of on-chain finance and a strategic treasury asset for companies, funds, and governments.\nBut where exactly is all that ETH sitting?\nJust as Bitcoin has its whales, Ethereum\u2019s landscape is shaped by massive smart contracts, exchange wallets, staking vaults, and a few known individuals who got in early.\nFrom the Beacon Chain to Coinbase, Grayscale, and new corporate players, here\u2019s who\u2019s holding the most ETH in 2025\u2014and how much they\u2019re worth.\nEthereum\u2019s journey through 2025 has been anything but flat.\nAfter starting the year around $3,248, ETH slumped to $1,796 in April during a broad market correction that also hit Bitcoin.\nHowever, momentum shifted in Q2, with institutional inflows from spot Ethereum ETFs and a resurgence in DeFi breathing new life into the market.\nThat momentum carried into the summer. In late July, Ethereum was trading near $3,715, brushing up against its yearly high of $3,765.\nJust weeks later, in August, ETH shattered its previous 2021 record of $4,878, climbing to a new all-time high of $4,965.\nEthereum\u2019s market cap now stands at roughly $534 billion, and technical indicators remain strong.\nWeekly charts show bullish continuation patterns, while the relative strength index (RSI) points to sustained buying pressure.\nOn-chain activity reinforces this outlook, with rising transaction volumes and an uptick in smart contract deployment.\nLooking ahead, Ethereum\u2019s trajectory for the rest of 2025 could hinge on key regulatory decisions\u2014particularly the SEC\u2019s stance on staking within ETFs, a factor that could either fuel further upside or cool momentum.\nThe top 10 Ethereum holders control around 83.9 million ETH, accounting for roughly 70% of the current circulating supply, worth over $300 billion at today\u2019s prices.\nIf you widen the lens to include staking contracts and large custodial pools, that number climbs even higher.\nBy some estimates, these expanded holdings represent up to 52% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply, or about $120 billion in value.\nThe 200 largest Ethereum wallets now hold over 62.7 million ETH, underscoring just how top-heavy ETH ownership remains.\nHowever, unlike Bitcoin\u2014where dormant whale wallets like Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s cast a long shadow\u2014Ethereum\u2019s most oversized holders are anything but idle.\nMost actively participate in the ecosystem: staking contracts secure the network, exchange wallets support millions of users, or institutional custodians facilitate everything from ETFs to validator services.\nSo while the top ETH wallets may appear concentrated, they often represent pooled assets, not individual mega-whales.\nIt\u2019s less about hoarding and more about infrastructure, reflecting Ethereum\u2019s unique role in powering DeFi, staking, and the broader Web3 economy.\nA person or company does not populate the ETH holder leaderboard, but rather a smart contract: the Ethereum Beacon Deposit Contract.\nThis is where users lock up ETH to become validators and secure the proof-of-stake network.\nIt holds an astounding over 36 million ETH, 36% of the total supply, worth roughly $299.5 billion.\nFar from idle, these coins are actively staked, powering the Ethereum consensus engine.\nThis makes Ethereum the biggest holder of the Beacon contract and arguably the most critical one for security and decentralization.\nAs the largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase is a household name in the digital asset space.\nIt holds roughly 6.9 million ETH, valued at $23.5 billion, across multiple wallets.\nThese holdings represent a mix of customer funds, institutional custody accounts, and Coinbase\u2019s cbETH staking derivative program.\nWith s"

                "body": "October 7, 2025 \u2013 The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with anticipation as a prominent analyst, Luke Martin (@VentureCoinist), has boldly predicted that spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) for Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) could emerge as some of the biggest ETF launches of 2025. This forecast, made on October 6, 2025, comes amidst a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape and growing institutional appetite for digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nMartin\u2019s optimism is rooted in the impressive performance of previous crypto-related ETF launches, drawing parallels to the success of Rex\u2019s XRPR and DOJE ETFs. He anticipates that the new '33 Act' spot ETFs for these altcoins will attract even greater investment flows, mirroring how Bitcoin spot ETFs garnered more capital than their futures-based counterparts. This development signals a significant leap in the mainstream integration of cryptocurrencies, potentially unlocking substantial institutional capital and ushering in a new era of accessibility for a broader range of digital assets.\nMarket Impact and Price Action\nThe potential approval of spot ETFs for Solana, Dogecoin, and Litecoin in 2025 is expected to trigger profound market shifts, echoing the transformative effects observed with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETF approvals. These approvals are set to enhance accessibility for institutional and retail investors, injecting substantial capital and further legitimizing these cryptocurrencies as investable assets.\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 significantly boosted BTC's price and liquidity, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) [NASDAQ: IBIT] alone seeing net inflows exceeding $37 billion. Similarly, the prospect of spot Ethereum ETFs, approved in May 2024 with trading commencing in July 2024, saw ETH's price surge by 25% prior to launch. Ethereum ETFs have since attracted significant inflows, with some even allowing staking, which is expected to boost demand by offering yield and reducing liquid supply.\nFor Solana (SOL), already a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, an ETF approval is widely anticipated to \"open the floodgates\" for traditional finance (TradFi) investment. Solana has already garnered significant institutional interest throughout 2025, with public companies like VisionSys [NYSE: VSYS] and Forward Industries [NASDAQ: FORD] committing billions to SOL strategies. Solana ETPs have seen record inflows, with total AUM for all Solana ETPs surpassing $5.1 billion. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) [CBOE: SSK] is already operational in the U.S. with over $406.6 million in assets under management. Analysts project SOL price targets of $300-$400, assuming a 30-50% post-approval appreciation, with some bullish long-term predictions suggesting a 3,800% move. As of early October 2025, SOL's price has increased by 5% to $219 due to ETF speculation.\nDogecoin (DOGE), despite its meme coin origins, has seen steadily increasing institutional interest. The REX-Osprey DOJE ETF [CBOE: DOJE] is already live, trading at $24.29 with nearly $25 million in AUM. An approved DOGE ETF could transform its perception from a mere meme coin into a legitimate investment asset, potentially triggering a \"massive 200%+\" rally or a \"5x price surge.\" Projections suggest DOGE could receive an additional $12 billion to $20 billion, potentially doubling or tripling its current market value, with price targets of $0.35 by year-end 2025.

The move highlights a crucial step toward improving onchain security, which has become an increasing concern amid a year marked by numerous DeFi exploits.\nStrengthening Solana\u2019s DeFi Security\nKamino\u2019s bug bounty initiative is divided into two main categories, smart contracts, and websites and applications. Smart contract vulnerabilities will receive the largest rewards, with payouts scaling based on severity ranging from $150,000 to $1.5 million for critical threats. High- and medium-level vulnerabilities are valued at $100,000 and $10,000, respectively, while website and app bugs can earn up to $50,000.\nThis collaboration with ImmuneFi brings Kamino\u2019s security testing under one of the most trusted cybersecurity networks in the Web3 space. ImmuneFi\u2019s record speaks volumes it has safeguarded over $190 billion in user funds and paid more than $120 million to ethical hackers for uncovering overlooked vulnerabilities.\nPrior to this partnership, Kamino had already self-hosted bounty programs for three years, completing over 18 audits and maintaining open-source, verifiable code. The expanded collaboration significantly scales that effort, giving Kamino access to a global network of professional auditors.\nRising DeFi Exploits Underscore the Need\nThe timing of Kamino\u2019s campaign comes amid an uptick in DeFi vulnerabilities across the sector. In 2025 alone, there were roughly 144 reported DeFi exploits. Although total hack losses fell 37% in Q3 to $509 million, September still witnessed a surge in million-dollar attacks, according to CertiK Alert data. This pattern underscores how vital proactive testing has become for decentralized protocols handling vast amounts of liquidity.\nSOL Price Eyes $300 Ahead of ETF Decision\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s native token continues to show bullish momentum.

Investors seemed happy to hear, yesterday morning, that a U.S. trade court had decided to order President Trump to lift most of the tariffs he announced in April. But by evening the joy had faded, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stepped in to grant a temporary restraining order preventing the tariffs from being lifted.\nSo the on-again, off-again tariffs are right back \"on again\" -- and in fact, could be even more \"on\" than we thought last night.\nThis morning, in a post on Truth Social, the President accused China of having \"TOTALLY VIOLATED\" a trade agreement under which the President had cut China tariffs from 145% to 30% earlier this month. \"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!,\" posted the President, apparently threatening to raise tariffs even higher.\nHow high will tariffs go? No one knows, but investors are already spooked and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is predictably slumping in response.\nEarnings\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) and Costco (Nasdaq: COST) both reported earnings after close of trading last night. Dell's earnings were \"mixed,\" with a Q1 sales beat but an earnings miss. On the plus side, Dell said both sales and earnings in Q2 will be better.\nCostco's report featured top-and-bottom line beats for that company's fiscal Q3.\nAdvertisement\nAnalyst Calls\nRegarding the effect of tariffs, Loop Capital observed that Costco is refraining from passing on higher costs from tariffs to its customers, which is helping the company to grow market share. Loop upped its price target on Costco to $1,115 per share, and maintained a buy rating on the stock.\nIn related trade news, and easily confused with Costco, JPMorgan upgraded Shanghai-based Cosco Shipping to overweight this morning, setting a target price of 19 Hong Kong Dollars ($2.42) on the stock. That's about 40% more than what Cosco stock costs now.\nSo at least JPMorgan seems to remain bullish on international trade. I guess that's good news.\nIf you\u2019re one of the over 4 Million Americans set to retire this year, you may want to pay attention.\nFinding a financial advisor who puts your interest first can be the difference between a rich retirement and barely getting by, and today it\u2019s easier than ever.

                "body": "DAX Index analysis: Why German stocks are rising this year\nThe DAX Index has held steady in the past few days and is hovering at near its all-time high of \u20ac24,635. It was trading at \u20ac24,378 today, up by over 32% from its lowest level in April. This article highlights why the blue-chip German index is rising and the top movers this year.\nReasons why the DAX Index is soaring\nThere are three main reasons why the German DAX Index is in a strong rally this year. First, the rally is being supported by the actions of the European Central Bank (ECB), which has slashed interest rates several times and brought them to 2% this year.\nIt is common for the stock market to do well when the central bank is cutting interest rates as this makes the equities market more interesting than bonds.\nThe index has also reacted positively to the interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which cut them by 0.25% in the last meeting in September. Analysts expect that the bank will cut interest rates again later this year.\nThe DAX Index has also jumped because of the general correlation with the other global indices like the Hang Seng, Dow Jones, and the S&P 500. Historically, these global indices have had a close correlation with each other.\nAdditionally, the index benefited from the increased government spending in Germany as officials sought to supercharge the economy.\nThe gains, however, have been limited by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have applied on all goods that Germany sells to the United States, especially its vehicles. Trump has warned that he will add a 25% tariff on trucks, a move that will affect Daimler Trucks, one of the biggest players in the industry.\nPorsche, the maker of luxury vehicles, has been one of the most affected companies by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs as the US is its only growing market. The most recent results showed that the Chinese business has continued to deteriorate, while Europe is not growing. Porsche makes all its vehicles in Germany, meaning that it has to pay more in tariffs than other manufacturers.\nTop gainers and laggards in the German DAX\nThe top gainer in the DAX Index this year is Rheinmetall, the giant company in the defense industry whose shares have jumped by 207% this year amid increased defense spending.\nSiemens Energy share price has soared by 112% this year and 211% in the last 12 months, making a spectacular comeback for a company that received a government bailout a few years ago. Its performance has happened because of the ongoing demand for power globally.\nThe Commerzbank share price has jumped by 100% this year, helped by the ongoing speculation that Unicredit will make a full bid for the company.\nThe other top gainers in the DAX Index this year are Deutsche Bank, Heidelberg Materials, Bayer, E. On, Fresenius, and RWE. On the other hand, the top laggards in the index are Symrise, Beiersdorf, Adidas, Zalando, and Merck.\nDAX Index technical analysis\nDAX chart | Source: TradingView\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the DAX Index has rebounded in the past few days, moving from a low of 23,347 in September to a high of 24,400 today. It is now hovering near the year-to-date high of 24,635.\nThe index has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has also formed an ascending triangle pattern, which often leads to a strong bullish breakout over time.\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is where it jumps in the coming weeks and hits the important resistance level at 25,000. A drop below the support at 24,000 will invalidate the bullish outlook.\nThe post DAX Index analysis: Why German stocks are rising this year appeared first on Invezz\nRead More\nNifty 50 Index analysis: to rebound ahead of earnings season\nDAX Index analysis: Why German stocks are rising this year\nThe DAX Index has held steady in the past few days and is hovering at near its all-time high of \u20ac24,635.

                "body": "LIVE\nDow Set to Open Up Ahead of Fed Minutes\nS&P 500 and Nasdaq futures are also rising in premarket trading Wednesday.\nLast Updated:\nOct. 8, 2025 at 3:59 AM ET\nKey Events\nPinned Post\nStock futures were edging up after the artificial-intelligence rally came to an abrupt halt in the previous session. Markets are looking for catalysts amid a lack of economic data while the U.S. government shutdown drags on, which means today\u2019s minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting may carry even more weight than usual.\nDow Jones Industrial Index futures were up 30 points in Tuesday\u2019s premarket, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were edging up 0.1% and less than 0.1%, respectively.\nThe S&P 500 fell for the first time in more than a week Tuesday as Wall Street pumped the brakes after a series of record highs in what looked like signs of buyer exhaustion. The Dow and Nasdaq also finished the session lower.\nThe continuing government shutdown means there is a vacuum of economic data on which the Fed usually depends to inform its decisions. That leaves traders looking for any other signs from the central bank about its intentions on interest rates.\nThere were mixed messages yesterday that may have contributed to the market malaise. Fed Gov. Stephen Miran said his expectations for a limited tariff impact on inflation mean the central bank can keep easing monetary policy. While Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari warned that any drastic rate cuts would risk stoking prices.\nHowever, today\u2019s minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee could offer something more concrete. The central bank cut rates by a quarter point at the last meeting with Miran, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Fed board, the lone dissenting voice. Market watchers will look for any indication from other members that they advocate a further loosening of monetary policy.\n\u201cMarket bulls benefited significantly in the past few days amidst a lack of economic figures, however, as multibillion dollar AI deals strengthened sentiment regarding modern technology\u2019s growth potential. While that exuberance has quelled, further upside may emerge from Fed speakers acknowledging that decelerating labor conditions warrant imminent rate cuts across several meetings,\u201d wrote Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\nAmong equities, tech will also remain in focus. The giants of the sector led markets lower Tuesday amid a report that cloud margins from software maker Oracle are below many estimates. Meantime, Tesla stock sank over 4% after the car maker introduced new versions of its top-selling models priced at under $40,000, with critics saying the lower-price models are too expensive to convert buyers to the brand.\nAI continues to be the hot topic but as the earnings season gets going many of the market-moving tech titans don\u2019t report until the end of the month. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines post results tomorrow, which could give an indication of the health of the consumer and Americans\u2019 spending power in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Any indication of the strength of the economy will likely be amplified by markets in the absence of official numbers.\nGold continued to be the big winner amid political uncertainty as the price of the precious metal settled above $4,000 for the first time. The haven asset has jumped more than 50% this year in the face of uncertainties over global trade, the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence, and U.S. fiscal stability. It was rising again early Wednesday, up 1.2% in early trade.\nElsewhere, bonds rose as a $58 billion Treasury sale drew solid demand but the benchmark 10-year was paring back on Wednesday\u2014edging lower by up to 0.4 basis points, according to Tradeweb data."

                "body": "Advertisement|Remove ads.\nU.S. stocks appear on track to shake off Tuesday\u2019s losses, with the major index futures all trading higher late in the day. Uncertainty over the government shutdown persisted, with President Donald Trump considering mass layoffs as a means to rein in spending.\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) deal news flow and investments will likely provide an offsetting impact. A Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, stated that Nvidia would invest $2 billion in Elon Musk-led AI startup xAI as part of the latter\u2019s latest funding round.\nFund manager Louis Navellier shrugged off talks of an AI bubble burst like the one seen in 1999, reasoning that this time around, the players are huge companies with healthy balance sheets and strong cash flow.\nAs of 11 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.14% and 0.19%, respectively, and the Dow futures were up a more modest 0.10%. The Russell 2000 futures climbed 0.25%.\nThe S&P 500 Index snapped a seven-session winning streak on Tuesday as traders, using the ongoing shutdown and data showing rising inflation expectations, booked profits on recent gains. The Russell 2000 Index fell by the most (down 1.12%), dragged down by concerns about the trajectory of interest rates. Some heavily-weighted stocks, including Oracle (ORCL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), fell sharply, denting sentiment toward the tech sector.\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 Index, and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) slipped 0.37% and 0.53%, respectively. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) moved down 0.19%, while the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) slumped 1.07%.\nNavellier conceded that the market breadth and power need to improve overall, but he does not subscribe to the theory of a stock market bubble. The fund manager said traders can confidently invest in stocks as long as earnings estimates continue to move northward and the Fed keeps lowering rates.\nOn the economic front, the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September rate-setting meeting, in which the central bank resumed its cuts, will be released at 2 p.m. ET. Traders will likely sift through the report for cues on the Fed\u2019s future course of action. More Fed speakers will be in action on Wednesday, including St. Louis Fed\u2019s Alberto Musalem (9:20 p.m. ET), Fed Governor Michael Barr (9:30 p.m. ET and 5:45 p.m. ET), Minneapolis Neel Kashkari (3:15 p.m. ET), and Chicago Fed\u2019s Austan Goolsbee (7:15 p.m. ET).\nAZZ, Inc. (AZZ) is scheduled to report its financial results after the market closes.\nCrude oil extended its gains in Wednesday\u2019s Asian session, and gold futures are continuing their record run, with the yellow metal trading past the $4,000 psychological barrier. The U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield ticked up in the Asian session after slipping 3.5 basis points on Tuesday. The dollar has firmed up against most major currencies.\nMajor Asian markets traded mixed, with the Japanese, Indonesian, and New Zealand markets recording gains, while the Hong Kong and Taiwanese markets fell sharply. China and South Korea remained closed for public holidays.\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.\nRead Next: Intel Set To Unveil Panther Lake Mobile Chip Specs In Bid To Halt AMD Market Share Gains: Report"

For that one little letter adds boons of power, pointiness and most importantly, noise.\nIt\u2019s now the fastest and most powerful iteration of the lovely DB12, via a 19bhp boost to the 4.0-litre AMG V8 lurking under that vast bonnet. So where the not-at-all-regular regular car churned out 671bhp, this one\u2019s got 690bhp.\nTorque remains unchanged at 590lb ft, but thanks to powertrain tweaks, launch control and gearshift times have both been cut, meaning 0-62mph now takes just 3.5s vs 3.6s in the non-S DB12. One entire tenth! What will you do with all that time?\nMaybe\u2026 revel in that biturbo V8. Aston\u2019s given the DB12 S a quad-pipe stainless steel exhaust system \u201ctuned to accentuate the engine frequencies throughout the rev range for added depth and potency\u201d. Yes, we\u2019ll always miss the snarling old nat-asp 6.0-litre Aston V12, but this is 2025 \u2013 let\u2019s just celebrate what we can, where we can, m\u2019kay.\nSaid exhaust cuts the DB12\u2019s weight by a considerable 11.7kg and adds 1.5dB of Good Noise, while further tweaks include a more \u201cprogressive\u201d throttle pedal feel (it recycles and cares for the environment, maybe?)\nMeanwhile, new settings for the Bilstein DTX dampers (less roll and pitch), tweaked camber/toe/castor settings, and a stiffer rear anti-roll bar join other screws Aston has tightened in the DB12\u2019s chassis. Like tweaking the steering and e-diff to allow use of the throttle \u201cearlier in the corner for maximum satisfaction from corner entry to exit\u201d. Yup, Aston wants you to get lairy.\nCarbon ceramic brakes arrive as standard fit, and they\u2019re bigger and lighter (they alone save 27kg of unsprung weight versus the DB12\u2019s steel setup). Driver assists have also been sent to finishing school, while the suit\u2019s been tweaked.\nYou\u2019ll spot the new front splitter and bonnet louvres \u2013 functional as well as another \u2018outta my way, puny non-S DB12\u2019 sign \u2013 gloss black sills, lots of S badges, a new rear diffuser, those pipes, and a new rear spoiler.

                "body": "On September 22, the US Food and Drug Administration announced it was approving a new use of a drug called leucovorin calcium tablets as a treatment for cerebral folate deficiency, which the administration also presented as a promising treatment for the symptoms of autism. In the days and hours after the announcement, tens of thousands of parents of autistic children joined a Facebook group, first set up in May, to share information about the drug.\nThe Leucovorin for Autism group was flooded with chaos, confusion, and conspiracy theories, according to a WIRED review, with parents, pediatricians, nurses, and affiliate marketers seeking to fill the void of information left by the Trump administration.\nOne angry parent shared an email from their health care provider refusing to prescribe leucovorin, even after the FDA announcement. \u201cGet a different doctor,\u201d a group member responded.\nAnother parent shared a spreadsheet filled with the names of doctors who they claimed would prescribe the drug. Two individuals who claimed to be nurses argued over whether leucovorin should be prescribed at all. Many others shared links to unproven alternatives, including folinic acid supplements that can be ordered online. Some offered advice on what dosage to give, as the FDA has yet to provide such information. Others pushed conspiracy theories, blaming \u201cbig pharma\u201d for covering up the effectiveness of leucovorin for years, or blaming vaccines for causing autism.\nOne person suggested prayer as a way to treat autism: \u201cYou may think this is crazy \u2026 get him in church. Get him listening to Christian music. Even just Christian kid songs. Children like him are so innocent \u2026 they can feel Gods presence and the comfort of the Holy Spirit.\u201d\nMany shared their positive experiences with leucovorin, which has for years shown promise as a potential treatment for certain symptoms for some autistic people. \u201cWe have noticed a huge difference,\u201d one parent wrote this week about their child, who had been taking leucovorin for two and a half weeks. \u201cAnxiety is decreased, calmness, happiness, listening so well, lots of hugs and love to not only us but friends, and her mouth is really moving and making new sounds even like raspberry sounds which we have never heard.\u201d\nBut others shared negative reactions to taking the drug. \u201cDid you notice your kid's behavior improving after starting Leucovorin??\u201d one group member wrote on Monday. \u201cMy daughter becomes aggravated very easily, hits, & screams to the top of her lungs!\u201d\nFor decades, the parents of autistic children have been sold false hope by charlatans claiming their products could cure autism. While the Trump administration is not making this claim, it has created confusion by changing leucovorin\u2019s label without rigorous testing as an autism treatment or providing information about dosages or length of treatment. This information void is now being filled by posters on Facebook.\n\u201cFamilies are understandably worried when they hear a single drug being presented as a possible \u2018answer\u2019 to autism,\u201d says Danielle Hall, director of health equity initiative at the Autism Society of America. \u201cBut autism is not caused by one thing, it\u2019s a complex mix of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Announcing a \u2018cause\u2019 or \u2018cure\u2019 without rigorous science not only fuels stigma but also harms families who are left with more confusion than clarity.\u201d\nLeucovorin works by boosting the body\u2019s folate levels, which is critical for the healthy production of red blood cells. It has typically been used to treat cancer patients, to counteract the impact of chemotherapy on the body\u2019s immune system. For decades, it has been prescribed off-label by some doctors to treat cerebral folate deficiency, which had been linked to autism by now-sidelined research. However, it has never undergone the sort of expansive clinical trials usually required for drugs approved to treat autism.\nThe approval was based not on years of rigorous study and clinic trials,"

                "body": "Asian shares are mostly lower after US stocks retreat, but gold surges higher\nShares were mostly lower in Asia on Wednesday after U.S. stocks sank to their first loss in eight days, losing momentum after the price of gold topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time.\nThe price of gold was up $49 at $4,053.40 an ounce by late afternoon Japan time. U.S. futures were little changed, while oil prices advanced.\nThe Japanese yen fell sharply against the dollar on expectations that Sanae Takaichi, the conservative lawmaker likely to become the next prime minister, will push to keep interest rates low.\nThe dollar rose to 152.39 yen from 151.90 yen, while the euro slipped to $1.1614 from $1.1659.\nTokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.5% to 47,734.99. It had jumped to new records earlier this week after the ruling Liberal Democrats chose Takaichi as their leader last weekend. She is expected to increase spending and to advocate for easier credit, possibly slowing efforts by the Bank of Japan to raise its key interest rate. It has remained near zero for years, even as inflation has exceeded its target of about 2%, outpacing wage increases.\n\u201cWhile the economic case for tighter monetary policy remains intact, we suspect that the Bank of Japan will use the pressure by Japan\u2019s incoming government as an opportunity to delay rate hikes until January,\u201d Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary.\nLawmakers in Japan's lower house of parliament are due to elect a successor to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later this month. The Liberal Democrats hold the most seats despite not having an outright majority, so Takaishi is expected to become the country's first female prime minister.\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1% to 26,880.81 and the S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower to 8,947.60.\nMarkets in mainland China and South Korea were closed for holidays.\nIn Taiwan, the Taiex lost 0.5%.\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.4% from its all-time high, closing at 6,714.59. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% to 46,602.98, and the Nasdaq composite gave up 0.7% to 22,788.36.\nTesla was the heaviest weight on the market and dropped 4.4% after unveiling cheaper versions of two of its electric car models. The stock gave back most of its leap from the prior day, when speculation and hype built after Tesla hinted at a coming product announcement.\nOracle also helped drag the market lower. It fell 2.5% after a news report suggested it\u2019s making thin profit margins on a key line of business related to artificial-intelligence technology.\nU.S. shares have rushed higher in recent months on hopes that the economy will remain resilient and that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates.\nThe rapid rise of artificial intelligence has helped fan buying enthusiasm, but also is raising worries that share prices may have shot too high.\nOn Tuesday, Dell climbed 3.5% after executives talked up the company\u2019s opportunity for growth because of AI at an investment conference. Advanced Micro Devices rallied 3.8% to add to its surge from Monday, when it announced a deal where OpenAI will use its chips to power AI infrastructure. IBM rose 1.5% after announcing a partnership that will integrate Anthropic\u2019s Claude AI chatbot into some of its software products.\nMuch is riding on expectations that the AI investment boom will pay off by making the global economy more productive and driving more growth. Without that increased efficiency, inflation could push higher due to upward pressure coming from the mountains of debt that the U.S. and other governments worldwide are building.\nInvestors have traditionally seen gold as a hedge against high inflation. Its price has soared more than 50% this year because of governments\u2019 huge debt loads, political uncertainties and anticipation that the Fed will cut interest rates.\nAlso early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 66 cents at $62.39 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 63 cents to $6"

                "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Concerns about the fiscal outlook in Japan sent the yen to a more than seven month low against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday and political uncertainty in France dented the euro, with traders also focused on any signs of when the U.S. federal government will reopen.\nThe yen has tumbled since Sanae Takaichi's leadership victory in Japan on Saturday.\nTakaichi, who is expected to become Japan's next prime minister, has pledged to boost the Japanese economy with aggressive spending and has been critical of the Bank of Japan's interest rate hikes.\n\"There's going to be a period of time where [investors] try and figure out how exactly her policies will affect the currency,\" said Lou Brien, strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.\nMoney market traders are now pricing in a 26% chance that the BoJ will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on Oct. 30, down from around 60% before Takaichi's leadership victory.\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar was last up 1% to 151.86 and reached 151.93, the highest since Feb. 19.\nStill, some analysts said that the Bank of Japan is likely to continue hiking interest rates as it battles relatively high inflation.\n\"For this month, the BOJ will perhaps stay on hold just to be on the safe side but in December they'll get a bit more data and I think they'll deliver another hike,\" said Mohamad Al-Saraf, forex research associate at Danske Bank.\n\"Inflation is still too high, rates are still too low, and the case for another BOJ hike this year is still alive.\"\nJapan's finance minister said authorities were watching out for excessive moves in currency markets.\nThe euro remained on a fragile footing following the resignation of France's prime minister on Monday, adding to pressure on President Emmanuel Macron and putting fiscal consolidation in doubt.\nFrance is now likely to miss a deadline to present its 2026 budget bill, meaning lawmakers will need to pass emergency stopgap legislation to authorize spending from Jan. 1 until a full budget is approved.\nThe single currency was last down 0.43% at $1.1659.\nThe dollar index rose 0.46% to 98.57.\nThe U.S. currency has weakened this year on concerns about a deteriorating fiscal outlook, expectations of slowing growth and fears that President Donald Trump's tariff policies will scare investors away from U.S. assets.\nThat move has paused since the end of June with the greenback largely consolidating against most major peers, said DRW's Brien.\nBrien expects dollar weakness to resume, however, on a weakening labor market.\n\"The labor market here is weaker and will continue to be weaker than is generally appreciated. And not only will you get a likely very dovish Fed chair to replace [Jerome] Powell next year, but in between now and then I think Fed policy will probably be a little bit easier than is currently being priced in.\"\nSo far markets have largely shrugged off the government shutdown, however the longer it continues the more likely it will also hurt the greenback \"because you'll get a weaker economic performance,\" Brien said.\nTrump said on Tuesday that his administration plans to eliminate a number of government programs as a result of the ongoing shutdown, adding that he would provide details of job cuts within the next four or five days.\nThe shutdown delayed last Friday's closely watched monthly jobs report for September and is set to postpone other key releases until the government reopens.\nA New York Federal Reserve survey released on Tuesday found that Americans grew more worried about the future of the job market in September, while at the same time bumping up projections for the future path of near-term inflation.\nFed Gov. Stephen Miran on Tuesday said that he is more sanguine about others about the outlook for inflation and said the U.S. bond market's current relative calm supports a swift push to lower interest rates.\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 3.51% to $120,8601 after reaching a record $126,223.18 on Monday."
