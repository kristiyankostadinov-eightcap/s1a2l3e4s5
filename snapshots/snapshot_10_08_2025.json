                "body": "Gold surges past $4,000 an ounce as uncertainty fuels rally\nThe price of gold has hit a record high of more than $4,000 (\u00a32,985) an ounce as investors look for safe places to put their money over concerns about economic and political uncertainty around the world.\nGold has seen its biggest rally since the 1970s, rising by around a third since April when US President Donald Trump announced tariffs which have upset global trade.\nAnalysts say another issue worrying investors is delays to the release of key economic data as the US government shutdown enters its second week.\nGold is seen as a so-called safe haven investment, which is expected to retain or increase its value during times of market turbulence or economic downturns.\nThe price of spot gold - the real-time market value of the precious metal for immediate delivery - rose to more than $4,036 an ounce on Wednesday afternoon in Asia.\nGold futures - which serve as a gauge of market sentiment - reached the same level on 7 October. Futures are agreements to buy or sell the asset at a pre-determined date in the future.\nThe US government shutdown, which was triggered by repeated impasses over public spending, is a \"tailwind for gold prices\", said OCBC's Christopher Wong, who is the Singapore-based bank's rates strategist.\nInvestors have turned to safe haven assets like gold during previous US government shutdowns.\nIt rose by nearly 4% during the month-long shutdown in Trump's first term in the White House.\nBut gold prices could fall if the shutdown ends more quickly than some investors are expecting, said Mr Wong.\nGold's \"unprecedented rally\" in the past month has surpassed analysts' expectations, said UOB bank's head of markets strategy Heng Koon How.\nHe added that the rise is also tied to the weakening US dollar and more non-professional buyers, known as retail investors, purchasing gold.\nAlthough the current surge in gold prices has been triggered by short term uncertainty, the overall strength of gold is largely the result of central banks buying it as a strategic move away from US treasuries and over-reliance on the strength of the dollar.\nCentral banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.\nNot everyone investing in gold buys the physical precious metal.\nSome investors put their money into financial products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are backed by gold.\nA record $64bn has been invested in gold ETFs so far this year, according to the World Gold Council trade association.\nGregor Gregersen, the founder of precious metals dealer and storage provider Silver Bullion, said he has seen customers numbers more than double in the last year.\nRetail investors, banks and wealthy families have increasingly turned to gold, viewing it as a safeguard against global economic uncertainty, he said.\n\"Most of our clients are long-term holders,\" Mr Gregersen added, explaining that the majority of his customers store their gold for more than four years.\n\"Gold will fall at some point, but I believe given the economic environment, it's on an upward trend for at least five years,\" he said.\nAs Mr Gregersen highlighted, gold prices can fall as well as rise.\nGold may fall in value if there is a hike in interest rates or geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties ease, said OCBC's Mr Wong.\nIn April, for instance, the price of gold fell by around 6% after Trump backed off from firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said.\n\"Gold is often seen as a hedge against uncertainty, but the hedge can be unwound.\"\nAnd in 2022, gold's value plunged from $2,000 to $1,600 an ounce, after the US central bank raised interest rates to curb the inflation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, said UOB's Mr Heng.\nA key risk to gold's current rally is a sudden resurgence in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve t"

Fear of missing out and anticipation of the U.S. government shutdown augmenting rate cuts also motivate investors to grow their gold exposure.\nMelek cautioned that the metal appears overbought, adding that any doubts in the speed of Fed easing or increase in market volatility could trigger a sharp near-term pullback, potentially reversing the late-summer rally."

Especially the industries like automotive and transportation, chemical and materials are one those who fully dependent on this crude oil reverse. Further, one significant element influencing oil prices is the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) production of crude oil. By establishing production targets, or caps on the amount of oil that each nation can produce, OPEC aims to actively control oil production among its members. Currently, ongoing concerns about an impending supply glut, OPEC+ announced that it will increase oil production from November by 137,000 barrels per day (bpd), choosing to go with the same relatively modest monthly increase as in October. Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, and a few smaller producers have raised their oil production targets by over 2.7 million barrels per day, or roughly 2.5 per cent of the world's demand.\nGlossary of Crude Oil:\nCrude oil is a natural, unprocessed fossil fuel, consisting of a complex blend of liquid hydrocarbons located in subterranean reserves. The word \"crude\" describes its unrefined condition prior to being processed into valuable items such as gasoline, kerosene, and asphalt. Crude oil is a natural, unprocessed blend of hydrocarbons and other organic matter located in subterranean reservoirs, functioning as a fossil fuel and processed into valuable products such as gasoline and diesel. The precise chemical makeup of crude oil differs significantly based on its geographic origin, resulting in various characteristics. It mainly consists of hydrocarbons but also has trace amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Oil and oil-related content-dependent sectors are following: transportation, petrochemicals & plastics, agriculture and pharmaceuticals, construction and infrastructure, utilities/power generation.\nMarket Statistics:\n- Global crude oil output fell by 0.77 million barrels per day (mb/d), or 1.0%, in 2024, in comparison to 2023. This signified the initial yearly decline, after three successive yearly rises since 2020, achieving an average of 72.58 mb/d. Crude oil output from OPEC member states.\n- Nations and non-OPEC oil-producing nations involved in the Cooperation Agreement (DoC) decreased, year-over-year (y-o-y), by 0.57 mb/d, or 2.1%, and by 0.78 mb/d, or 5.2%, respectively, while crude output from non-DoC nations increased by 0.58 mb/d, or 1.8%.\n- Global oil consumption increased by 1.49 mb/d, year-on-year, or 1.5%, arriving at an average of 103.84 mb/d in 2024.\n- Oil demand increased annually in nearly all areas, with the most significant increases seen in non-OECD Asia.

Euro was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily digest market movers: Political uncertainty hurts the Euro\n- The growing political uncertainty in France keeps bleeding the Euro this week, while investors' concerns about a prolonged shutdown of the US federal government have started to hurt market sentiment and boost demand for the safe-haven USD. In the absence of key macroeconomic data to alter this view, the bearish EUR/USD trend has further room to go.\n- On Wednesday, France's recently resigned Prime Minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, assured that he is going to present a solution to President Macron later today and affirmed that \"the dissolution of the parliament is becoming more remote\". These comments have given some air to an ailing Euro, but the broader trend remains strongly bearish.\n- On Tuesday, ECB President Christine Lagarde reiterated that the disinflationary process in the Eurozone has been completed and that she is hopeful that France will meet its international commitments and produce a budget in time.\n- Eurozone data has failed to improve investors' sentiment. German Factory Orders figures showed a 0.8% decline in August, against market expectations of a 1.4% growth, following a 2.7% contraction in July. Year-on-year, orders have increased at a 1.5% rate, after a 3.3% fall in July.\n- Fed policymakers continue showing their divergences. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari has warned about a burst of inflation if the bank lowers rates too fast, while US President Donald Trump's latest appointment, Fed Governor Stephen Miran, stated that inflation is due to population increases and reiterated that monetary policy needs to ease.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD remains dangerously close to 1.1610 support\nThe EUR/USD technical picture reflects strong bearish pressure.

France\u2019s deepening political and fiscal crisis, coupled with the US dollar\u2019s safe-haven flows, has eroded confidence in the euro and pushed investors to the greenback.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about automated forex trading? Check our detailed guide-\nThe resignation of Prime Minister Lecornu has turned the situation increasingly volatile, pressuring President Macron to call for snap elections or a complete government reset. Rating agencies have warned that the continued political gridlock could result in a potential downgrade of sovereign credit. The risk has dampened investor appetite for euro-denominated risk assets.\nEurozone economic performance is also disappointing as Germany\u2019s factory orders reduced 0.8% in August, while year-on-year orders rose 1.5%. ECB\u2019s Lagarde maintains that disinflation is on track, with the hope that France will meet its budget obligation in time.\nOn the other hand, the US government shutdown has entered its second week, compounding the concerns posed by macroeconomic data. Congressional leaders from both parties remain in a deadlock. According to the Polymarket, only a 23% probability exists of a breakthrough this week. Investor confidence stays shattered, sending flows to a traditional safe-haven dollar.\nAgainst this backdrop, the US dollar gains traction from external weaknesses rather than domestic strength. The repricing has resulted in a rebound in the dollar but lacks follow-through momentum, especially in the absence of key macro releases. Traders are relying on the Fed and ECB commentary for more impetus.\nEUR/USD Key Events Ahead\nThe major focus remains on the FOMC meeting minutes due today. Market participants will be keen for clues about growth risk amid political uncertainty and data delay. Meanwhile, ECB officials, including President Lagarde, are set to speak, and markets will assess their tone on disinflation and fiscal risk.\nEUR/USD Price Technical Analysis: Sellers Aiming for 1.1575\nThe EUR/USD 4-hour chart shows the price has broken the key support at 1.1650, heading towards the next key level at 1.1575. The pair shows a short-term bearish trend as the 200-period MA forms a crossover with the 50-period MA. However, the RSI has been around the oversold zone, suggesting a probability of a mild pullback.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about forex signals?

For now, the immediate hurdle lies at broken support of 1.1650 ahead of 20-period MA near 1.1690.\nLooking to trade forex now?

The bank believes this likely reflected long EUR positioning that is unusually strong by post-2012 standards.\nBofA analysts observe that both the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are currently \"priced to perfection,\" with the bank\u2019s economists leaning hawkishly versus market pricing for the Fed and dovishly for the ECB.\nDespite closing this particular trade, Bank of America maintains its bearish USD bias and forecasts EURUSD at 1.20 by year-end and 1.25 next year. The bank cites several primarily US-based factors for this outlook, including expected US stagflationary risks, lower USD hedge costs amid lower Fed rates, and Fed independence concerns.\nBofA also notes it sees \"a lower bar for positive upside surprises around German fiscal and European defence spending,\" and will be looking for fresh opportunities to re-engage with its bearish dollar view.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Despite a notable lack of firm bullish momentum, selling pressure remains unable to crack the 1.3400 handle, keeping Cable hobbled in a volatile midrange.\nCentral bankers will dominate headline flows on Wednesday. A raft of Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers will be making public appearances, as well as a speech from Bank of England (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Huw Pill.\nWednesday\u2019s key event will be the release of the Fed\u2019s latest Meeting Minutes, due at 18:00 GMT. The Fed broke the seal on interest rate cuts at its latest rate call, and investors will be looking for signs that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is tilting toward more rate cuts through the remainder of the year.\nAs the US government shutdown rolls on, the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be grappling with a lack of key official datasets as it makes interest rate decisions heading into the tail end of the calendar year. Barring any significant shocks in the data that remains available to the Fed, rate markets have locked in expectations of two follow-up interest rate cuts on October 29 and December 10.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance."

                "body": "Australian Dollar holds losses as US Dollar advances on risk aversion\n- The Australian Dollar struggles following the release of weaker housing data on Wednesday.\n- Australia\u2019s Private house approvals fell by 2.6% MoM, while the seasonally adjusted Building Permits fell by 6% MoM in August.\n- The US Dollar extends its gains despite rising Fed rate cut bets and the ongoing government shutdown.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) declines against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, extending its losses for the second successive session. The AUD/USD pair weakened amid investment outflows, as the S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.14% to trade below 8,950 at the time of writing, pressured by losses in technology and gold stocks.\nThe AUD also faces challenges after weaker housing data was released on Wednesday. Private house approvals in Australia declined by 2.6% month-over-month (MoM) to 9,027 units in August, as expected, and reversing a 1.3% rise in the previous month. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted Building Permits fell by 6% MoM to 14,744 units, following a 10% decrease previously, marking the second consecutive monthly decline.\nThe downside of the AUD/USD pair could be restrained as the Australian Dollar (AUD) could receive support from the cautious stance surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The Australian central bank is expected to maintain its interest rates after deciding to keep its Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 3.6% in September. The RBA warned that inflation has proven more persistent than expected, especially in market services, while the labor market remains tight.\nAustralian Dollar declines as US Dollar extends gains despite government shutdown\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is gaining ground for the third successive day and trading around 98.80 at the time of writing. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meeting Minutes will be eyed later in the day.\n- The US Dollar strengthens as safe-haven demand rises amid the ongoing government shutdown, with President Donald Trump threatening mass federal worker layoffs as prospects for a resolution dim.\n- Federal Reserve (Fed) Board of Governors member Stephen Miran expressed his belief on Tuesday that inflation itself is simply a cause of \"population increases\". Monetary policy needs to ease to get ahead of the shift down in the neutral rate, Miran added.\n- Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari struck a more reserved tone than some of his Fed counterparts on Tuesday, cautioning that it's still too soon to be able to tell if tariff-led inflation will be \"sticky\" or not. However, Kashkari noted that he's particularly bullish on the labor market and is expecting a return to form for American job creation, which has sputtered recently.\n- Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid delivered hawkish remarks on Monday, saying that the Fed must maintain its inflation credibility and stressed that inflation is too high. Schmid added that monetary policy is appropriately calibrated.\n- The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in nearly a 95% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and an 83% possibility of another reduction in December.\n- United States (US) Senators failed to pass spending proposals to reopen the federal government for a fourth time, extending the ongoing shutdown into a new week. The closure has suspended key federal programs and delayed major economic reports, including September\u2019s jobs data, which was originally due on Friday.\n- The US ADP Employment Change report, released on Wednesday, showed that private sector payrolls declined by 32,000 in September, while annual pay growth was 4.5%. This figure followed the 3,000 decrease (revised from a 54,000 increase) reported in August and came in below the market expectation of 50,000.\n- The latest Job Openings showed the labor market is slowing, yet vacancies rose from 7.21 million to 7.23 million in August.

                "body": "Japanese economic data tempered expectations of an October Bank of Japan rate hike, sending USD/JPY to 152.377 in the early trading session on Wednesday, October 8.\nAverage cash earnings increased 1.5% year-on-year in August, down sharply from 3.4% in July. Softer wage growth is expected to weaken household spending, potentially cooling demand-driven inflation. Crucially, the softer wage growth figures followed recent comments from BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who raised concerns about tariffs affecting wages, stating:\n\u201cIf uncertainty regarding overseas economies and trade policies remains high, firms may place stronger emphasis on cost-cutting and may weaken their efforts to reflect price increases in wages.\u201d\nSanae Takaichi, the new leader of Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party and potentially Prime Minister, also underscored the need for sustained wage growth for further monetary policy tightening. She stated:\n\u201cDemand-pull inflation \u2014 wage increases driving demand growth, leading to a gradual rising of prices and corporate profits \u2014 is the best outcome. Until such a situation emerges, we must maintain close communication with the Bank of Japan. We must stay in sync.\u201d\nTakaichi\u2019s support for ultra-loose monetary policy and today\u2019s wage growth data sent USD/JPY to its highest level since February 2025.\nAcross the Pacific, market focus remains on the US government shutdown and the Fed\u2019s upcoming interest rate decision. Overnight, lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a stopgap funding bill needed to reopen the government.\nA prolonged shutdown could weigh on the US economy and further delay key economic data releases. The Fed typically adopts a more dovish stance during extended shutdowns, reinforcing expectations for policy easing. With the next Senate vote today, the US dollar could face selling pressure if the vote fails to reach the 60 required to pass the stopgap funding bill.\nMeanwhile, Fed speakers and the FOMC meeting minutes will also require consideration amid rising bets on multiple Q4 rate cuts. FOMC voting members Michael Barr, Alberto Musalem, and alternate member Neil Kashkari are on the calendar to speak. Views on the shutdown, the economic outlook, and inflation could influence USD/JPY trends.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: Political Factors, BoJ Policy, and Dovish Fed Risks\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nAs traders lower bets on an October BoJ policy adjustment, uncertainty lingers over the RBA\u2019s rate path, spotlighting AUD/USD.\nTurning focus to the AUD/USD pair, Aussie inflation and labor market data are clouding the RBA\u2019s rate path. Australian ANZ-Indeed job ads slid 3.3% month-on-month in September, accelerating from a 0.3% drop in August. The job ad slump followed August\u2019s sharp drop in full-time employment, signaling a deteriorating labor market. A softer labor market may curb wage growth, dampening inflation.\nHowever, recent inflation figures have raised doubts about a November RBA rate cut, fueling monetary policy uncertainty. The Aussie Monthly CPI Indicator rose to 3% in August, reaching the top end of the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target range, up from 2.8% in July. While recent labor market data has weighed on the Aussie dollar, AUD/USD remains above August levels, underscoring uncertainty over the timing of an RBA rate cut.\nOn Friday, October 10, RBA Governor Michele Bullock may share views on recent data and the RBA\u2019s policy stance.\nAUD/USD: Key Scenarios to Watch\nSee our full AUD/USD analysis for detailed trends and trade setups.\nWhile Aussie economic data continues to fuel speculation about an RBA rate cut, developments on Capitol Hill and Fed speakers will also influence AUD/USD trends.\nAnother failed Senate vote and growing calls for back-to-back Fed rate cuts in October and December would narrow the US-Aussie rate differential, favoring the Aussie dollar. A narrower rate differential would likely drive AUD/USD toward $0.66. A sustained move above $0.66 could bring $0.665 into play.\nO"

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Hits 150.63 After Japan\u2019s Political Shake-Up\nThe yen weakens sharply after Sanae Takaichi\u2019s pro-stimulus win shifts policy outlook, cutting BoJ hike odds from 68% to 41%. With U.S. 10-year yields near 4.15% and Japan\u2019s at 0.5%, the 365 bps gap fuels carry trades \u2014 driving USD/JPY toward a possible breakout above 151.30 and eyeing 153.00 next | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY (Dollar/Yen) Surges Toward 151.00 as Japan\u2019s Political Shift Sparks Renewed Yen Weakness\nThe USD/JPY pair continues its explosive rally, reaching 150.63 in early European trading, up over 1.9% from last week\u2019s close. The surge follows Sanae Takaichi\u2019s victory in Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party leadership race, setting her on track to become Japan\u2019s first female prime minister. Her pro-stimulus and anti-tightening stance has sharply altered market expectations, sending the yen to its weakest level since early August. Traders who had priced in a 68% chance of a 25-basis-point Bank of Japan rate hike this month have slashed that probability to 41%, immediately triggering a broad selloff across the yen complex. Crosses such as GBP/JPY at 202.52, EUR/JPY at 176.03, and CHF/JPY at 188.85 reached record highs, highlighting the scale of yen liquidation.\nFiscal Activism vs. Monetary Discipline: Takaichi\u2019s Policies Test BoJ Independence\nMarkets are now reassessing the balance between fiscal stimulus and monetary restraint in Japan. Takaichi\u2019s history of calling the BoJ\u2019s rate hikes \u201cstupid\u201d has stoked fears that her administration will pressure Governor Kazuo Ueda to slow or even halt the normalization path. Japan\u2019s inflation remains at 2.7%, still above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target, yet policymakers are divided on whether price growth is truly demand-driven or merely imported through a weaker yen. The BoJ\u2019s cautious tightening had aimed to anchor inflation expectations while gradually reducing its \u00a5550 trillion balance sheet, but renewed government activism may derail those efforts. A government inclined toward heavy public spending could lift short-term GDP growth but worsen fiscal imbalances and undermine investor confidence in Japanese assets.\nUSD/JPY Technical Landscape: Multi-Decade Gap Hints at Breakout Potential\nThe 192-pip gap from Friday\u2019s close to Monday\u2019s open marks the largest single-session move for USD/JPY since May 1990, underscoring the scale of market reaction. Monday\u2019s 1.9% gain was the strongest in nine weeks, carrying the pair to within 23 pips of its August peak at 151.28. Technical momentum indicators confirm strong upside bias: RSI remains near 68, below the overbought threshold, while MACD maintains bullish divergence. Immediate resistance sits at 151.00\u2013151.30, a zone that, if broken, could propel USD/JPY toward 152.00 and 153.84, levels unseen since 2022. Support lies at 149.40, followed by 148.35, where the 100-day SMA provides structural backing. Traders view dips toward 149.00 as fresh entry opportunities, with price action continuing to respect the long-term uptrend channel established since April.\nGlobal Macro Context: Dollar Strength Reinforced by Safe-Haven Flows and High Yield Differentials\nThe yen\u2019s fall coincides with renewed strength in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which rose 0.56% to 98.35, marking a rebound from last week\u2019s lows despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. The DXY\u2019s resilience reflects investors\u2019 preference for the dollar as a short-term haven amid global uncertainty. Meanwhile, yield spreads continue to favor the greenback: the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield holds near 4.15%, compared to Japan\u2019s 0.5% benchmark, maintaining an interest rate differential of over 365 basis points. This massive gap keeps the yen deeply entrenched in carry trade dynamics, with global investors borrowing in low-yielding yen to fund purchases of higher-yield assets.\nPolitical Upheaval and the Return of the \u201cTakaichi Trade\u201d\nJapan\u2019s equity markets have mirrored the currency\u2019s reaction.

The US Dollar (USD) holds firm, with the US Dollar Index (DXY) up 0.3% for the day, supported by the weakness of the Euro (EUR) and Japanese Yen (JPY).\nDespite this strength, the Greenback\u2019s upside may remain capped by growing market expectations of monetary easing from the Federal Reserve (Fed). According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets now assign nearly a 95% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut in October and more than 80% chance of another reduction in December.\nInvestors now await the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes due at 18:00 GMT, and speeches from several Fed officials throughout the day, for further clues about the future policy path.\nIn Washington, US lawmakers failed to resolve their disputes over the funding legislation on Tuesday, and the government shutdown passed the one-week mark. The Senate will vote again on Wednesday, with Majority Leader John Thune noting that the chamber will be voting on the same competing bills repeatedly. The White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget reportedly sent a memo stating that the 750,000 furloughed federal workers are not guaranteed back pay.\nThis new Senate vote will also be closely watched by financial markets, as investors gauge whether prolonged political deadlock could deepen the government shutdown and weigh further on economic confidence, potentially influencing the Fed\u2019s next monetary policy moves.\nOn the Canadian side, stronger West Texas Intermediate (WTI) US Oil prices provide partial support to the Loonie. WTI is up 0.3% for the day, extending its rally for a fourth consecutive day, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) decided earlier to approve a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels per day for November, well below market expectations.\nTrade relations between the United States and Canada took center stage on Tuesday as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met US President Donald Trump at the White House for their second round of bilateral discussions.\nIn remarks to reporters, Canadian cabinet minister in charge of bilateral trade Dominic LeBlanc described the discussions as \u201csuccessful, positive, and substantive,\u201d according to Reuters, though he stopped short of announcing any concrete deal or relief on steel tariffs. LeBlanc confirmed that negotiations would continue, noting that the tone of the meeting was \u201cconstructive and forward-looking.\u201d\nTrump, meanwhile, praised Canada\u2019s efforts in combating the fentanyl crisis, citing improved cross-border cooperation. Despite the upbeat mood, no final agreement was reached on trade or tariffs.\nIn this context, USD/CAD remains range-bound in the short term, supported by the strength of the US Dollar but limited by the rebound in Oil prices, Canada\u2019s key export commodity.\nCanadian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Canadian Dollar (CAD) against listed major currencies today.

The pair appreciates as the US Dollar (USD) gains ground, as United States (US) Consumer Inflation Expectations for the year ahead rose to 3.4% in September, the highest in five months, compared to 3.2% in August.\nHowever, the US Dollar may face challenges amid prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy stance. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in nearly a 95% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in October and an 83% possibility of another reduction in December.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) Board of Governors member Stephen Miran expressed his belief on Tuesday that inflation itself is simply a cause of \"population increases\".

However, Kashkari noted that he's particularly bullish on the labor market and is expecting a return to form for American job creation, which has sputtered recently.\nThe upside of the USD/CAD pair could be limited as the commodity-linked CAD receives support from higher Oil prices. It is worth noting that Canada is the largest crude exporter to the United States.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price continues to gain ground for the fourth successive session, trading around $62.00 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices receive support from a more modest OPEC+ output hike. The Oil group recently decided to limit its production increase, opting for the smallest rise among the options considered.\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have"

                "body": "USD/CAD keeps wavering below 1.3970 ahead of the FOMC minutes\n- The Dollar retreated from 1.3970 again but remains within previous ranges, above 1.3940.\n- Upbeat IVEY PMI figures and higher Oil prices are providing some support to the Canadian Dollar.\n- The main focus today is on the release of the minutes of the last Fed meeting.\nThe US Dollar is drifting lower against the Canadian Dollar on Wednesday after another rejection at the 1.3570 resistance area. pair, however, remains moving back and forth within the last two weeks\u2019 horizontal channel above 1.3940.\nThe Dollar is drawing support from the global risk aversion as the political uncertainty in France and Japan sent the Euro and the Japanese Yen tumbling this week. On the other hand, growing concerns of a prolonged shutdown of the US government are starting to hurt risk appetite and increase speculative demand for safe havens, including the US Dollar.\nThe highlight this week is the release of the minutes of the last Fed meeting, but they are unlikely to show anything new, other than the divergences among the monetary policy committee about the next steps. The market has already priced in a 25 bps rate cut in October, and the FOMC minutes are not expected to alter that view.\nFed policymakers staged their divergences on Tuesday. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned about a burst of high inflation if the bank lowers interest rates too quickly, while Stephen Miran, at the dovish end of the Government Board, reiterated that monetary policy needs to ease.\nIn Canada, September\u2019s IVEY PMI surprised on Wednesday, jumping to its highest reading in the last 15 months, at 59.8 from 50.1 in August, and beating expectations of a softer increase to 51.2.\nThese figures and the rebound in Oil prices, with the US benchmark WTI reaching one-week highs above $62.00 are providing some support to the Canadian Dollar, yet with upside attempts limited for now, as the risk-averse market keeps the US Dollar buoyed.\nFed FAQs\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco"

                "body": "Bitwise predicts record bitcoin ETF inflows in Q4 as \u2018debasement trade\u2019 kicks in\nCrypto asset manager Bitwise predicts that U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds will attract record inflows in the fourth quarter, enough to surpass their 2024 total by year-end.\nAt the start of the year, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan predicted that the bitcoin ETFs would attract more inflows in 2025 than their $36 billion debut year. So far, they've drawn in around $22.5 billion, on pace for about $30 billion by year-end \u2014 falling short of the inaugural annual watermark. However, in a memo to clients late Tuesday, Hougan said he's not worried, expecting a strong fourth quarter to push flows to new all-time highs.\nGold vs. bitcoin: ETF inflows by year. Image: Bitwise.\nThree catalysts for strong Q4 flows\nThe Bitwise CIO pointed toward three catalysts for a strong quarter: wealth manager approvals, bitcoin's recent price surge, and the \"debasement trade\" narrative.\nMorgan Stanley recently introduced formal crypto allocation limits within multiasset portfolios, recommending 0% exposure for conservative investors and modest allocations of 2% to 4% for those with higher risk tolerance. The move mirrors a broader industry shift, with Wells Fargo also now allowing advisors to allocate client funds to bitcoin ETFs and other major firms like UBS and Merrill Lynch expected to follow. While adoption across advisory networks and tens of thousands of financial professionals will take time, conversations Bitwise has had with advisors in recent months suggest strong pent-up demand, Hougan said.\nGold and bitcoin have emerged as the top-performing major assets of the year, driving what Wall Street calls the \"debasement trade\" \u2014 investing in assets that benefit when governments erode currency value. With the U.S. money supply up 44% since 2020 and JPMorgan highlighting the trend in a recent report, the narrative is increasingly going mainstream. As advisors prepare year-end reviews, many are expected to add gold and bitcoin to client portfolios to capture the year's strongest performers, the Bitwise CIO argued.\nHistorically, strong price gains have also driven higher demand for bitcoin ETFs as renewed media and investor attention fuel inflows, Bitwise noted. Bitcoin recently surged past $125,000, up 9% in early October to set new all-time highs, though it has since corrected slightly and currently trades for around $122,744, according to The Block's BTC price page. Every quarter with double-digit bitcoin returns has coincided with double-digit billions flowing into bitcoin ETFs, suggesting another wave of momentum is likely in Q4, Hougan said.\n\"In the first four trading days of the quarter, we've already had $3.5 billion in net flows, bringing total YTD flows to $25.9 billion,\" Hougan concluded ahead of the latest flow data. \"We have 64 more days to get another $10 billion. I think we'll do that and then some.\"\nThe bitcoin ETFs have since added another $875.6 million to that total on Tuesday, led by BlackRock's IBIT with $899.4 million, according to data compiled by The Block. On Monday, the ETFs attracted their largest daily haul since pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election last November \u2014 bringing in $1.21 billion.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

                "body": "Should You Buy ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) While It's Under $40?\nKey Points\nThe ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) provides pure Bitcoin exposure at less than $40 per share.\nIt's just easier to manage a $40 share than a $120,000 coin.\nARKB investors face the same Bitcoin volatility and risks, from regulatory crackdowns to competition from other cryptocurrencies.\nCryptocurrency headlines can be tiresome. Who cares if Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is worth $100,000 or $120,000 per coin, right? Both figures are enough to cover four years of college tuition, or buy a luxury car will all the bells and whistles (yes, even that one!). Sure, you can buy just a small fraction of a Bitcoin at a time, but it can be difficult to wrap your head around these large numbers.\nBut what if you could get exposure to Bitcoin's potential upside without dealing with those intimidating five- and six-figure price tags? Enter the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKB), trading at $37.75 per share on September 24, 2025.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\nThat's enough for a nice dinner, not a tricked-out SUV. Let's use the lower stakes of ARKB shares to consider the value and risks of Bitcoin investments.\nSame Bitcoin exposure, friendlier price tag\nFor all intents and purposes, buying shares of ARKB is the same thing as buying Bitcoin directly. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest team is actually buying and selling Bitcoin to reflect the cash being invested in this fund. As an exchange-traded fund (ETF), ARKB brings a couple of small quirks to your Bitcoin investment:\nThere's a modest management fee with an annual expense ratio of 0.21%. It's a bit higher than the 0.01% expense ratios you see in Vanguard ETFs, but it's actually one of the lowest fees in the spot Bitcoin ETF arena.\nWhen Bitcoin prices go up, ARKB's chart will follow. The direct effect remains when the crypto chart is pointing down, too.\nBitcoin is the only holding in the single-asset ARKB fund's portfolio.\nWith $4.86 billion of (pure Bitcoin) assets under management, ARKB is one of the most popular and most liquid spot Bitcoin funds. Investors should have no problem completing trades in this fund at a fair price.\nThe fund currently holds roughly 42,744 Bitcoins in its portfolio, and offers investor access to these assets through 50.3 million ARKB shares. That's how ARKB can provide Bitcoin exposure at such modest share prices -- by dividing a large pie in lots and lots of smaller slices. ARKB will be worth $40 right after Bitcoin passes the $120,000 mark.\nWhy Bitcoin believers are still buying\nNow that you know what the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF is, it's time for a more direct investing question. Is ARKB a buy below $40 per share, based on what's going on with the underlying Bitcoin market?\nWell, Bitcoin and related investments have been strong performers lately. These Bitcoin bets have approximately quintupled the 15.7% gains of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index over the last year:\nThat chart includes last November's election results, which brought a more crypto-friendly administration to Capitol Hill. Excluding that surge, Bitcoin's results have been comparable to the stock market in 2025. Generally speaking, the cryptocurrency tends to jump when the economy looks strong and fall when investors feel more pressure. Bitcoin is a very volatile asset, and many bulls make leveraged crypto investments with borrowed money. That's harder to do when interest rates are high, so macroeconomic moves have a direct impact on this sector.\nThe risks don't shrink with the share price, though\nIn a longer perspective, you have to weigh Bitcoin's potential gains against a plethora of unique risks. Bitcoin maximalists expect the \"digital gold\" to replace the U.S. dollar and physical gold as the preferred methods for storing and transferring money around the world. If that happens, the sky just might be the l"

                "body": "BlackRock, celebrated for its diverse suite of exchange-traded funds spanning decades of market trends, has a new crown jewel: its Bitcoin ETF.\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), launched just 21 months ago, is on the verge of reaching $100 billion in assets under management, making it BlackRock\u2019s most profitable fund \u2014 outranking even products that have been in circulation for more than two decades.\nAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT currently generates roughly $244.5 million in annual revenue.\n\u201cCheck out the ages of the rest of the Top 10. Absurd,\u201d Balchunas noted on X, highlighting the speed and stark contrast between the Bitcoin fund and BlackRock\u2019s long-established revenue leaders like the 25-year-old iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF.\nLast quarter, IBIT passed Coinbase Global\u2019s Deribit platform to become the world\u2019s largest venue for Bitcoin options.\nA Bitcoin ETF lets investors gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually buying or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Instead, the fund holds Bitcoin (or Bitcoin-related contracts) while investors simply buy shares on a stock exchange, with the share price moving alongside Bitcoin\u2019s market value.\nBeing a regulated financial product, it provides a safer, more accessible way to invest in Bitcoin through familiar brokerage accounts.\nBlackRock and other investors are turning to Bitcoin\nThe fund\u2019s meteoric rise underscores a broader shift in investor behavior. Bitcoin itself hit a new all-time high of $126,200 on Monday, fueling inflows into IBIT.\nMarket conditions are playing a critical role: declining U.S. interest rates, combined with a weakening dollar amid the ongoing government shutdown, are driving investors to seek alternative stores of value.\nETFs tracking digital assets like Bitcoin have emerged as a natural destination for capital in this climate.\nFor IBIT, every 1% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price translates into nearly $1 billion added to assets under management, bringing the $100 billion milestone tantalizingly close. In less than two years, IBIT has leapfrogged traditional stalwarts and cemented itself as a central player in both the crypto and ETF worlds."

While lawmakers remain cautiously optimistic, political gridlock and the upcoming 2026 midterm elections are introducing further uncertainty into the legislative process.\nGovernment Shutdown Stalls Progress on Crypto Legislation\nAs the federal government enters its second week of shutdown, thousands of federal employees are furloughed, slowing critical work on drafting the crypto regulation bill. Kristin Smith of the Solana Policy Institute called the halt \u201cthe biggest setback for U.S. crypto legislation at the moment.\u201d With agency staff unable to participate fully, key advisors are absent from discussions that would shape the bill.\nRon Hammond, a crypto strategist at Wintermute, estimates there\u2019s only a 60% chance the bill will be voted on before the end of the year, warning that an extended shutdown could significantly reduce those odds.\nPolitical Calculations Ahead of 2026 Midterms\nThe legislative future of crypto is increasingly influenced by political strategy. With midterm elections approaching in 2026, lawmakers may prioritize campaigning over complex bills. Some Democrats are highlighting former President Donald Trump\u2019s involvement in crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial and TRUMP memecoins, as part of election narratives.\nRebecca Liao, CEO of Saga, stressed, \u201cCrypto policy remains too important to be sidelined completely, even amid political tensions. However, prolonged shutdowns may slow progress, giving lawmakers reasons to distance themselves from crypto-friendly stances.\u201d\nComplexity in Passing a Comprehensive Crypto Market Structure Bill\nPassing a robust crypto market structure bill is proving more challenging than the GENIUS Act the stablecoin legislation passed earlier this year. Key debates include defining ancillary assets (such as cryptocurrencies not classified as securities) and applying money transmission laws to decentralized networks.\nFormer SEC counsel Teresa Goody Guill\u00e9n highlighted the need for simplification, stating, \u201cThe current draft relies heavily on decentralization terminology that could confuse both regulators and innovators. Simplifying language is essential for effective implementation.\u201d\nSummer Mersinger of the Blockchain Association noted, \u201cBoth parties agree on the necessity of clear, balanced crypto regulations. While the shutdown has slowed momentum, bipartisan cooperation could still deliver a framework that fosters innovation while providing clarity for the crypto industry.\u201d\nCrypto Market Reacts to Legislative Uncertainty\nFollowing the political gridlock, the crypto market faced a sharp downturn. Bitcoin fell below $121,000, and total market capitalization dropped to $4.15 trillion. Over 180,000 bullish traders were liquidated, triggering forced selling across Ethereum, Solana, and other major cryptocurrencies. Analysts attribute part of the sell-off to investors taking profits after Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally to $126,000, while fears of a potential AI market bubble added pressure on digital assets.\nMarket strategist Ron Hammond added, \u201cUncertainty in U.S. crypto regulation directly impacts market sentiment. Traders are cautious as they wait for clarity from Washington.\u201d\nFAQs\nIs the US government shutdown affecting crypto?Yes, the shutdown has stalled progress on a major crypto market structure bill by furloughing key staff and delaying critical legislative discussions.\nWhy is crypto regulation taking so long in the US?Passing a comprehensive bill is complex, involving debates over asset definitions and decentralized networks, with progress now halted by the government shutdown.\nHow does political uncertainty affect crypto prices?Regulatory uncertainty from "

This surge marks a growing trend of traditional assets moving into decentralized finance ( DeFi ) ecosystems \u2014 and gold is leading the way.\nTokenized gold allows users to own digital representations of physical gold, with each token typically backed 1:1 by real gold reserves. These tokens combine the value stability of gold with the speed, transparency, and accessibility of Ethereum-based transactions.\nPlatforms like PAX Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) have seen significant adoption, as both institutions and retail investors seek exposure to gold without needing to store or handle it physically.\nEthereum\u2019s Role in Bridging TradFi and DeFi\nEthereum has become the go-to chain for asset tokenization due to its smart contract capabilities, liquidity, and ecosystem maturity. The presence of $2.7 billion in tokenized gold on Ethereum showcases the network\u2019s growing role in merging traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized infrastructure.\nThis movement reflects a broader narrative: Ethereum is not just about crypto \u2014 it\u2019s becoming the base layer for digital finance, where assets like gold, real estate, and treasury bonds can be represented, traded, and managed on-chain.\nAs regulatory clarity around tokenized assets improves, more institutions are expected to adopt Ethereum-based solutions for issuing and managing real-world assets.\nWhat This Means for the Future of Finance\nThe rise of tokenized gold is just the beginning. Ethereum\u2019s secure and programmable environment offers a scalable solution for global asset tokenization. As more physical assets are brought on-chain, the financial system becomes more transparent, accessible, and efficient.\nFor DeFi users, tokenized gold offers a new kind of collateral and store of value \u2014 especially in volatile markets. And for the traditional investor, it provides a digital, borderless, and liquid way to own gold.\nExpect this trend to accelerate as demand grows for real-world utility in crypto."

On-chain analyses show that Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply reached $15.3 billion, while BNB Chain\u2019s stablecoin supply was close behind at $13.9 billion for both networks to achieve all-time highs.\nThe uptick in supply also represents a growth in confidence by investors into DeFi ecosystems built on blockchain networks like BNB chain and Solana. Stablecoins are a digital asset that is pegged to the value of fiat currency and are becoming increasingly important liquidity tools for decentralized exchanges or yield protocols in the same way as fiat currency is being used in traditional financial liquidity. The increase in supplies on Solana and BNB chain reflects the larger recovery of on-chain activity after a several months long consolidation period in price.\nAs adoption of cryptocurrency continues to push forward, there are other deeper trends involved in these record numbers. Developers and users are galvanizing toward scalable and low-fee networks with faster transaction times, which is contributing to even more stablecoin activity toward Solana and BNB chain.\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING: $SOL & $BNB Chain stablecoin supply just hit ATHs! $SOL 's stablecoin supply just hit a record $15.3B, while $BNB Chain surged to $13.9B. pic.twitter.com/kgCy8D5WyR\n\u2014 Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) October 8, 2025\nThe rapid growth of Solana and BNB Chain stablecoin supply is not just a number, it\u2019s a clear indicator of DeFi market growth. When stablecoin circulation increases, it often suggests higher on-chain liquidity and trading volume.\nIn Solana\u2019s case, its efficient architecture and low transaction costs have made it a preferred network for stablecoin-based applications. Developers are building DeFi platforms that rely on instant settlement and minimal fees, both strong advantages Solana provides.\nSimilarly, BNB Chain continues to attract liquidity through a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). From lending platforms to yield farms, its stablecoin activity reflects both user engagement and market depth. This liquidity expansion is critical for sustaining DeFi growth in the coming quarters.\nSeveral factors explain why the Solana and BNB Chain stablecoin supply has soared to record levels. First, institutional participation in stablecoin-based DeFi products has grown steadily throughout 2025. Hedge funds and trading firms now see stablecoins as efficient tools for liquidity management and on-chain yield.\nMoreover, the environment for blockchain liquidity is also shifting. More users are bridging assets cross-chain and moving stablecoins to faster networks like Solana and BNB Chain, which is one way the cross-chain process arises to allow users to earn diversification of risk exposure while providing new opportunities to earn a return through DeFi applications, which are now mildly popular.\nFinally, digital asset price recovery has generally been a confidence restoration for decentralized systems. As Bitcoin and Ethereum have exhibited price resiliency, traders are starting to deploy stablecoins into DeFi pools at a stable return, ultimately helping liquidity demand in a feedback loop.\nWhile both Solana and BNB Chain have achieved record-breaking stablecoin levels, their growth paths differ. Solana\u2019s ecosystem has benefited from technical innovation and major partnerships that brought liquidity to its DeFi protocols. Its fast confirmation times make it ideal for real-time financial applications.\nBNB Chain, on the other hand, has leveraged Binance\u2019s global reach to attract millions of retail and institutional users. Its compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s tools has made migration easy for developers seeking high throughput and lower costs.\nTogether, they represent the new wave of DeFi market growth, bridging traditional finance and blockchain innovation.

(NASDAQ: FORD), a treasury company with a strategic focus on the Solana blockchain, announced the activation of its institutional-grade validator node on Solana in collaboration with DoubleZero, a blockchain infrastructure provider specializing in performance optimization. The move marks a significant step in the company\u2019s transition from a capital allocator to a key participant in Solana\u2019s technical ecosystem.\nAccording to the company, the validator node is already operational on DoubleZero\u2019s infrastructure and has been developed in association with Galaxy, leveraging Jump Crypto\u2019s Firedancer client to achieve greater speed and scalability. Designed to meet institutional standards, the validator aims to strengthen Solana\u2019s overall throughput and efficiency while advancing the blockchain\u2019s readiness for large-scale financial applications.\nForward Industries has set the validator\u2019s commission rate at zero percent, allowing holders of Solana\u2019s native token, SOL, to delegate their stake to the company\u2019s node at no additional cost. The firm has also confirmed that all of its own SOL holdings are staked through this validator. Future validators planned by Forward are expected to be deployed exclusively on DoubleZero\u2019s network, reinforcing a unified and high-performance architecture across its operations.\nInstitutional-grade infrastructure for decentralized networks\nThe collaboration between Forward Industries and DoubleZero extends beyond validator deployment. Both organizations are jointly conducting pilot programs aimed at improving network revenue optimization, increasing bandwidth, and minimizing latency. These efforts are expected to further enhance Solana\u2019s reliability and position it as a preferred choice for institutional and enterprise blockchain solutions.\nAt launch, Forward\u2019s validator is projected to rank among the top ten Solana validators globally, underscoring the firm\u2019s growing influence within the blockchain community. The company\u2019s leadership has emphasized that the strength of decentralized networks depends on achieving enterprise-level standards of performance, scalability, and security.

The funding round, led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, included a collective investment exceeding $300 million from these major backers.\nThe company stated that the funds would primarily support the creation of its cryptocurrency treasury operations, emphasizing the accumulation of SOL tokens as a core component of its strategy. Additional capital will be directed toward operational expenses, working capital, and upcoming investment opportunities tied to the Solana network.\nThe PIPE financing also attracted participation from several global investment firms, asset managers, and notable angel investors across the digital asset landscape. This widespread interest has been interpreted as an indicator of growing institutional confidence in both Solana\u2019s long-term viability and Forward Industries\u2019 approach to fostering its ecosystem.\nBy deploying cutting-edge validator technology and securing a substantial capital base, Forward Industries has positioned itself as a central force in driving institutional engagement within the S"

However, Democrats insist it will not sway them in the increasingly bitter shutdown standoff.\nDow Jones FAQs\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the oldest stock market indices in the world, is compiled of the 30 most traded stocks in the US. The index is price-weighted rather than weighted by capitalization. It is calculated by summing the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing them by a factor, currently 0.152. The index was founded by Charles Dow, who also founded the Wall Street Journal. In later years it has been criticized for not being broadly representative enough because it only tracks 30 conglomerates, unlike broader indices such as the S&P 500.\nMany different factors drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The aggregate performance of the component companies revealed in quarterly company earnings reports is the main one. US and global macroeconomic data also contributes as it impacts on investor sentiment. The level of interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve (Fed), also influences the DJIA as it affects the cost of credit, on which many corporations are heavily reliant. Therefore, inflation can be a major driver as well as other metrics which impact the Fed decisions.\nDow Theory is a method for identifying the primary trend of the stock market developed by Charles Dow. A key step is to compare the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) and only follow trends where both are moving in the same direction. Volume is a confirmatory criteria. The theory uses elements of peak and trough analysis. Dow\u2019s theory posits three trend phases: accumulation, when smart money starts buying or selling; public participation, when the wider public joins in; and distribution, when the smart money exits.\nThere are a number of ways to trade the DJIA. One is to use ETFs which allow investors to trade the DJIA as a single security, rather than having to buy shares in all 30 constituent companies. A leading example is the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA). DJIA futures contracts enable traders to speculate on the future value of the index and Options provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the index at a p"

Investors seemed happy to hear, yesterday morning, that a U.S. trade court had decided to order President Trump to lift most of the tariffs he announced in April. But by evening the joy had faded, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stepped in to grant a temporary restraining order preventing the tariffs from being lifted.\nSo the on-again, off-again tariffs are right back \"on again\" -- and in fact, could be even more \"on\" than we thought last night.\nThis morning, in a post on Truth Social, the President accused China of having \"TOTALLY VIOLATED\" a trade agreement under which the President had cut China tariffs from 145% to 30% earlier this month. \"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!,\" posted the President, apparently threatening to raise tariffs even higher.\nHow high will tariffs go? No one knows, but investors are already spooked and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is predictably slumping in response.\nEarnings\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) and Costco (Nasdaq: COST) both reported earnings after close of trading last night. Dell's earnings were \"mixed,\" with a Q1 sales beat but an earnings miss. On the plus side, Dell said both sales and earnings in Q2 will be better.\nCostco's report featured top-and-bottom line beats for that company's fiscal Q3.\nAdvertisement\nAnalyst Calls\nRegarding the effect of tariffs, Loop Capital observed that Costco is refraining from passing on higher costs from tariffs to its customers, which is helping the company to grow market share. Loop upped its price target on Costco to $1,115 per share, and maintained a buy rating on the stock.\nIn related trade news, and easily confused with Costco, JPMorgan upgraded Shanghai-based Cosco Shipping to overweight this morning, setting a target price of 19 Hong Kong Dollars ($2.42) on the stock. That's about 40% more than what Cosco stock costs now.\nSo at least JPMorgan seems to remain bullish on international trade. I guess that's good news.\nIf you\u2019re one of the over 4 Million Americans set to retire this year, you may want to pay attention.\nFinding a financial advisor who puts your interest first can be the difference between a rich retirement and barely getting by, and today it\u2019s easier than ever.

Anglo American is also on the leaderboard, up 2.4%.\nNext is Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LSE:MKS), up 2.8%, which comes a day after the retailer provided an update on the shake-up of its retail estate, with 11 cafes to be closed in order to create space for a wider range of popular products.\nLloyds is up 2.7% on the FCA motor finance update, Rentokil Initial is adding to recent gains, while other banks not really connected to the motor lending sector are also on the up, including NatWest and Standard Chartered.\nPrecious metals miners Endeavour and Fresnillo are also doing their bit, thanks to the ever elevating gold price.\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets have highlighted that while global gold equities surged more than 120% in the third quarter, UK-listed names have lagged.\nThey think the real interest now lies in how miners use their windfall, with Fresnillo and Hochschild Mining both due to report this month with free cash flow in focus.\nAcross the sector, producers are on track for a 7% earnings rise and a 22% jump in free cash flow, despite a 3% increase in all-in sustaining costs to $1,638 an ounce, which RBC expects to feed buybacks and debt reduction.\nThe FTSE 250, now in positive territory for the day thanks in part to gains at Hochschild, is up 1.6% over the past month and 6.7% so far this year.\nQuilter, IP Group and Diversified Energy Company are top risers among London mid-caps.\nAnalysts at RBC have been pondering this week whether Lloyds could buy Quilter to bolster its wealth management arm.\nThe broker suggested that the imminent rollout of the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s \u201cTargeted Support\u201d regime could give Lloyds both the motive and opportunity to buy a wealth manager.\n12.39pm: US futures positive\nUS equity futures are modestly positive with just under two hours to go until the opening bell.\nFutures for the Dow Jones are up 0.2%, while those for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both up around 0.1%.\nAs a reminder, Wall Street saw selling overnight after a positive start, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 0.7% decline, while the S&P dropped 0.4% and the Dow 0.2%.\nThe dollar index is higher for the third consecutive session, up 0.3% to 98.8, rallying to the highest since August 11.\nWTI crude oil futures are 1.1% higher at $62.41.\n\"In the absence of any significant data to offer markets direction, the belly of the curve led Treasury yields lower yesterday, largely just reversing Monday's modest rise in yields,\" says analyst John Canavan at Oxford Economics.\nUS government bond yields were 2bps to 3bps lower ahead of the close after having been 3bps to 4bps lower at the day's peak early in the afternoon.\n\"A pullback in equities may have lent Treasuries a small safe-haven bid, and the day's best levels were reached following the afternoon's strong three-year Treasury note auction, before yields eased a little off the lows over the rest of the afternoon.\"\nHe notes that trading in London has been supported as gilt yileds have dropped after the HM Revenue and Customs error in calculating VAT receipts, which reduced the UK borrowing figures for the first five months of the fiscal year.\n\"The spill over support helped to push Treasury bond yields 3bps lower as the curve flattened, with two- and three-year yields declining less than 1bp.\"\n\"Firmer US equity index future"

                "body": "DAX Index analysis: Why German stocks are rising this year\nThe DAX Index has held steady in the past few days and is hovering at near its all-time high of \u20ac24,635. It was trading at \u20ac24,378 today, up by over 32% from its lowest level in April. This article highlights why the blue-chip German index is rising and the top movers this year.\nReasons why the DAX Index is soaring\nThere are three main reasons why the German DAX Index is in a strong rally this year. First, the rally is being supported by the actions of the European Central Bank (ECB), which has slashed interest rates several times and brought them to 2% this year.\nIt is common for the stock market to do well when the central bank is cutting interest rates as this makes the equities market more interesting than bonds.\nThe index has also reacted positively to the interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which cut them by 0.25% in the last meeting in September. Analysts expect that the bank will cut interest rates again later this year.\nThe DAX Index has also jumped because of the general correlation with the other global indices like the Hang Seng, Dow Jones, and the S&P 500. Historically, these global indices have had a close correlation with each other.\nAdditionally, the index benefited from the increased government spending in Germany as officials sought to supercharge the economy.\nThe gains, however, have been limited by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have applied on all goods that Germany sells to the United States, especially its vehicles. Trump has warned that he will add a 25% tariff on trucks, a move that will affect Daimler Trucks, one of the biggest players in the industry.\nPorsche, the maker of luxury vehicles, has been one of the most affected companies by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs as the US is its only growing market. The most recent results showed that the Chinese business has continued to deteriorate, while Europe is not growing. Porsche makes all its vehicles in Germany, meaning that it has to pay more in tariffs than other manufacturers.\nTop gainers and laggards in the German DAX\nThe top gainer in the DAX Index this year is Rheinmetall, the giant company in the defense industry whose shares have jumped by 207% this year amid increased defense spending.\nSiemens Energy share price has soared by 112% this year and 211% in the last 12 months, making a spectacular comeback for a company that received a government bailout a few years ago. Its performance has happened because of the ongoing demand for power globally.\nThe Commerzbank share price has jumped by 100% this year, helped by the ongoing speculation that Unicredit will make a full bid for the company.\nThe other top gainers in the DAX Index this year are Deutsche Bank, Heidelberg Materials, Bayer, E. On, Fresenius, and RWE. On the other hand, the top laggards in the index are Symrise, Beiersdorf, Adidas, Zalando, and Merck.\nDAX Index technical analysis\nDAX chart | Source: TradingView\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the DAX Index has rebounded in the past few days, moving from a low of 23,347 in September to a high of 24,400 today. It is now hovering near the year-to-date high of 24,635.\nThe index has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has also formed an ascending triangle pattern, which often leads to a strong bullish breakout over time.\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is where it jumps in the coming weeks and hits the important resistance level at 25,000. A drop below the support at 24,000 will invalidate the bullish outlook.\nThe post DAX Index analysis: Why German stocks are rising this year appeared first on Invezz\n\u0427\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\nNifty 50 Index analysis: to rebound ahead of earnings season\nDAX Index analysis: Why German stocks are rising this year\nThe DAX Index has held steady in the past few days and is hovering at near its all-time high of \u20ac24,635.

Contracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the tech-dominated Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) also moved up around 0.2%.\nMeanwhile, gold (GC=F) futures continued their record-breaking rally after topping $4,000 per ounce for the first time on Tuesday.

Market Open.\nCaution is seeping into markets as the AI trade loses its fizz, as questions emerge about AI spending and a potential dot-com-style bubble in stocks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) snapped a seven-day run of gains on Tuesday amid doubts over cloud profit outlook at Oracle (ORCL).\nAt the same time, the federal stoppage continued to breed uncertainty, with no end to the gridlock in sight as President Trump threatens to withhold back pay for furloughed government workers.\nThe shutdown, which is entering its seventh day, has deprived Wall Street and the Federal Reserve of the crucial economic data needed to shape their thinking.\nLater today, investors get minutes from the Fed's September meeting, when it switched to lowering interest rates for the first time in 2025. The watch is on for any risk to expectations for two more cuts this year, as policymakers remain divided on policy and Wall Street frets at the lack of data inputs to help set rate-cut expectations.\nLIVE 13 updates Equifax cuts credit score prices as competition with FICO ramps up\nThe competition among credit score data companies continues to intensify after Fair Isaac's (FICO) announcement last week that it would begin licensing its FICO scores directly to mortgage lenders.\nOn Tuesday, Equifax countered by cutting its VantageScore 4.0 mortgage credit score price to $4.50 for two years, undercutting the $10 score FICO is offering for 2026. Additionally, Equifax said it will provide free scores to all mortgage, automotive, card, and consumer finance customers who purchase FICO scores through the end of 2026.\nEquifax (EFX) stock rose nearly 3% in premarket trading on Wednesday, while Fair Isaac stock fell over 2%.\n\"We support Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Pulte's decision in July to end the 30-year FICO scoring monopoly in the mortgage industry, and believe that the best way to drive change in the marketplace, and to lower costs for consumers and our customers, is through open competition,\" Equifax CEO Mark W.

Markets are looking for catalysts amid a lack of economic data while the U.S. government shutdown drags on, which means today\u2019s minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting may carry even more weight than usual.\nDow Jones Industrial Index futures were up 96 points in Tuesday\u2019s premarket, or 0.2%. The S&P 500 was rising 0.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was also up 0.2%.\nThe S&P 500 fell for the first time in more than a week Tuesday as Wall Street pumped the brakes after a series of record highs in what looked like signs of buyer exhaustion. The Dow and Nasdaq also finished the session lower.\nThe continuing government shutdown means there is a vacuum of economic data on which the Fed usually depends to inform its decisions. That leaves traders looking for any other signs from the central bank about its intentions on interest rates.\nThere were mixed messages yesterday that may have contributed to the market malaise. Fed Gov. Stephen Miran said his expectations for a limited tariff impact on inflation mean the central bank can keep easing monetary policy. While Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari warned that any drastic rate cuts would risk stoking prices.\nHowever, today\u2019s minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee could offer something more concrete. The central bank cut rates by a quarter point at the last meeting with Miran, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Fed board, the lone dissenting voice. Market watchers will look for any indication from other members that they advocate a further loosening of monetary policy.\n\u201cMarket bulls benefited significantly in the past few days amidst a lack of economic figures, however, as multibillion dollar AI deals strengthened sentiment regarding modern technology\u2019s growth potential. While that exuberance has quelled, further upside may emerge from Fed speakers acknowledging that decelerating labor conditions warrant imminent rate cuts across several meetings,\u201d wrote Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\nAmong equities, tech will also remain in focus. The giants of the sector led markets lower Tuesday amid a report that cloud margins from software maker Oracle are below many estimates. Meantime, Tesla stock sank over 4% after the car maker introduced new versions of its top-selling models priced at under $40,000, with critics saying the lower-price models are too expensive to convert buyers to the brand.\nAI continues to be the hot topic but as the earnings season gets going many of the market-moving tech titans don\u2019t report until the end of the month. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines post results tomorrow, which could give an indication of the health of the consumer and Americans\u2019 spending power in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Any indication of the strength of the economy will likely be amplified by markets in the absence of official numbers.\nGold continued to be the big winner amid political uncertainty as the price of the precious metal settled above $4,000 for the first time. The haven asset has jumped more than 50% this year in the face of uncertainties over global trade, the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence, and U.S. fiscal stability. It was rising again early Wednesday, up 1.2% in early trade.\nElsewhere, bonds rose as a $58 billion Treasury sale drew solid demand but the benchmark 10-year was paring back on Wednesday\u2014edging lower by up to 0.4 basis points, according to Tradeweb data."

Wind speeds in a tornado need to reach at least 200 mph for it to be classified as an EF-5, the highest rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.\nThe initial estimate in the days after it happened was an EF-3.\nAuthorities said two men and a woman died during the tornado, which caused extensive tree damage, tipped several train cars fully loaded with grain and lifted tanker cars. The NWS said one tanker car was thrown just over 475 feet.\nThe severe weather event also destroyed a farm in the area, with the foundation of at least one of its buildings \"considered to be swept clean,\" according to the NWS.\nAccording to officials, the tornado lasted just under 20 minutes, from 11:02 p.m. to 11:21 p.m., and created a 12-mile path of destruction from Enderlin to Alice, North Dakota.\nEnderlin is around 57 miles southwest of Fargo, North Dakota.\nThe last confirmed EF-5 tornado in the U.S. touched down in Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20, 2013, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe 2013 tornado had wind speeds of up to 200 mph. According to the NWS, it traveled over 14 miles, killed 24 people, injured over 200 others and damaged many structures."

                "body": "Japanese Stocks Surge on \"Takaichi Trade\": ETFs in Focus\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index surged more than 4% on Oct. 6, 2025, to hit an all-time high. The country\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party elected conservative Sanae Takaichi as its new leader on Saturday. The election positioned her to become the country\u2019s first female prime minister, per CNBC.\nThe move sparked optimism over a potential revival in government spending and a continuation of loose monetary policy, per Reuters, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. The recent rally in the Japanese stock markets was helped by real estate, technology, and consumer cyclical shares.\nBond Yields and Yen React Sharply\nThe 30-year Japanese government bond (JGB) plunged, pushing its yield to a record high, per Reuters, while the two-year note yield fell amid expectations of delayed rate hikes by the Bank of Japan. The yen tumbled moderately against the U.S. dollar and dropped to historic lows versus the euro.\nTakaichi\u2019s Expansionist Agenda\nTakaichi is viewed as the most expansionist candidate among the five contenders in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) race, succeeding the hawkish Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, per Reuters.\n\u201cThe Nikkei was on course to reach as high as 48,000 by year-end, but because Takaichi was chosen as the LDP leader, it shot up toward that level already,\u201d said Hitoshi Asaoka, chief strategist at Asset Management One, as quoted on Reuters.\nAs a candidate, Takaichi proposed enhancing investment in strategic business sectors, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, nuclear fusion and defense, per the Reuters article.\nETFs to Gain\nAgainst the aforementioned backdrop, below we highlight a few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that could be potential winners.\nCurrency-Hedged Large-Cap ETFs\nThe rally in Japanese equities will likely boost demand for Japan-focused large-cap ETFs. The Nikkei is an export-heavy index and thus fares better in a falling yen environment. A weaker yen boosts the profitability of Japan's major export-oriented companies.\nHowever, this also means that the U.S. dollar will likely gain strength against the yen. This makes the case for investing in a currency-hedged Japan large-cap ETF strong.\nWisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund DXJ, Xtrackers MSCI Japan Hedged Equity ETF DBJP and iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan ETF HEWJ are some of the ETFs that should gain ahead. DXJ was up 2.8% on Oct. 6, 2025.\nInverse Yen\nProShares UltraShort Yen YCS gained 3.8% on Oct. 6, 2025, on a falling yen. Note that hopes of easier monetary policy weighed on the yen ETF Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust FXY. The ETF FXY slumped 1.9% on Oct. 6, 2025.\nThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).\nZacks Investment Research"
