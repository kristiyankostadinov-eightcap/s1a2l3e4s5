In a note to clients, the firm said gold faces \u201cuptrend exhaustion,\u201d which could lead to \u201ca consolidation or correction\u201d in the fourth quarter.\nThe warning followed months of inflows into gold-backed ETFs and record central bank purchases \u2014 trends that analysts say have created a feedback loop driving prices even higher.\nExplore Top Gold IRAs\nAmerican Hartford Gold is a precious metals dealer that specializes in gold and silver for physical delivery and retirement accounts.

                "body": "Gold hits $4,000 for the first time ever\nThe price of gold surpassed $4,000 on Tuesday, Oct. 7 for the first time ever as the government entered its seventh day of a partial shutdown.\nGold futures were trading at $4,006 around 11 a.m. ET before slipping under the benchmark but quickly recovered. The commodity is up 50% year to date.\nGold has continued to rise as the U.S. dollar weakens and inflation persists, according to the CME Group, an American financial services company.\nThe dollar is down 10% year to date. Additionally, the current rate of inflation is 2.9%, which is above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.\nInvestors are worried about the potential for inflation to erode the purchasing power of the dollar, according to CME Group analysis. As a result, many are using gold to hedge their portfolios.\nWhy is the price of gold going up?\nGold has historically gone up during times of uncertainty and inflation, which is what makes it appealing to investors.\nAccording to CNBC, banks and retail investors are buying gold at an increased pace. Countries, including China, are moving away from U.S. Treasurys after President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Russia over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\nWhile speaking at the Greenwich Economic Forum, Founder of Bridgewater Associates Ray Dalio said gold should make up about 15% of investment portfolios.\n\"Gold is a very excellent diversifier of the portfolio,\" he said. \"It is the one asset that does very well when the typical parts of your portfolio go down.\"\nInvestors can access gold through physical holdings, gold ETFs and futures contracts.\nCostco, Walmart selling out of gold bars\nGold bars continue to fly off the shelves of retailers, including Costco and Walmart, as investors seek to get in on the action.\nCostco got in on the gold-selling business in 2023, but the 1-ounce gold bars quickly sold out after the launch. The membership warehouse club has since struggled to keep up with demand as the price of gold has steadily risen.\nIn October 2023, Costco had gold bars listed for just under $2,000, USA TODAY previously reported. By May 2025, gold bars were listed above $3,000. In September, USA TODAY found a gold bar listed for $3,700 but the next day, it was unavailable. USA TODAY was unable to find gold bars in stock on Costco's site as of Oct. 7.\nHowever, some gold bars appear to be in stock on Walmart's site. USA TODAY found a 5-gram gold bar for $751 and its 1-ounce Gold Bar PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan for $4,193.\nWith gold prices soaring, gold bars have reached 100% gain for investors who purchased them when they first went on sale and a more than 50% gain for those who purchased one a year ago.\nContributing: Reuters\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

                "body": "EIA expects substantial increase in global oil inventories\nKey Highlights\n- Global oil inventories are expected to rise through 2026, putting downward pressure on prices.\n- China\u2019s stockpiling has helped limit price declines, even as global supply increases.\n- US crude oil production hit a record of over 13.6 million b/d in July, with forecasts remaining steady at around 13.5 million b/d through 2026.\n- Uncertainties remain regarding China\u2019s future oil demand and the ability of OPEC+ members to meet production targets, influencing the global supply outlook.\nThe US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects global oil inventories to rise through 2026, leading to significant downward pressure on oil prices in the coming months. EIA, in its October Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), forecasts Brent crude oil prices will drop to an average of$62/bbl in fourth-quarter 2025 and $52/bbl in 2026.\nBrent crude oil spot prices averaged $68/bbl in September, unchanged from August average. Several factors have likely offset strong growth in supply to keep oil prices relatively stable in recent months, EIA noted.\n\"One likely factor is China\u2019s additions to its oil stockpiles. China does not report data on its oil inventories,\" EIA said, but \"based on imports, exports, refining data, and oil inventory data from third-party and official sources, we [EIA] assess that China has accumulated significant oil inventories this year.\nBecause China\u2019s inventory builds have been strategic in nature,\" EIA continued, \"they have potentially acted as a source of demand, limiting downward price pressures more than our estimated balances would otherwise suggest.\"\n\u201cIt is also possible that global oil demand was higher over the summer than we currently estimate. The lag in actual oil demand data, particularly outside of the OECD, means that our estimates for global demand for second-quarter 2025 and third-quarter 2025 are still a mix of model results and initial data observations for much of the world,\" EIA said.\nInventory builds are significant even with expectation that OPEC+ will produce below its targets in the coming months, according to EIA forecasts. Along with strong production growth among non-OPEC countries, the forecast increase in global oil inventories is based on the OPEC+ announcements to increase the group\u2019s oil production.\n\u201cOPEC+ began increasing production in April 2025, and for much of this year, the group\u2019s production has been close to its targets. Last month, the group increased production targets through October 2025, but there is uncertainty regarding some members\u2019 ability to reach the targets given near term limits on spare capacity,\u201d EIA said.\nAccording to EIA, global production growth is led by countries outside of OPEC+, where production is expected to rise by 2.0 million b/d in 2025 and by 0.7 million b/d in 2026. OPEC+ is expected to increase total liquids production by 0.6 million b/d in both 2025 and 2026, as the group unwinds crude oil production cuts. However, according to EIA, OPEC+ production will remain below announced targets, preventing inventory builds from accelerating too quickly and limiting the decrease in oil prices.\nGlobal liquid fuels consumption by non-OECD countries is expected to grow by 1.2 million b/d in 2025 and 1.0 million b/d in 2026, while OECD consumption is forecast to fall by 0.1 million b/d in 2025 before increasing by 0.1 million b/d in 2026, according to EIA. Most non-OECD growth is concentrated in Asia, with liquid fuels consumption in India and China adding more than 0.4 million b/d of consumption by 2026 compared with 2024.\nIn EIA\u2019s forecast, global oil inventories will increase by an average of 2.1 million b/d in 2026, compared with an average annual increase of 1.9 million b/d in 2025. The pace at which China continues to purchase oil to fill inventory and any major supply disruptions are key forecast uncertainties.\nUS crude production\nIn July, US crude oil production averaged more than 13.6 m"

                "body": "Most Read: OPEC + Delivers Modest Output Hike, Brent Crude Rises 1.7%. What Next for Oil Prices?\nEUR/USD continued its slide this morning as a combination of US Dollar strength and concerns around the French political drama rambled on.\nThe most recent news indicates that President Macron has given the outgoing Prime Minister, Sebastien Lecornu, until Wednesday evening to try and get the divided parliament to agree on a new prime minister.\nIt is unclear what will happen if Lecornu is unsuccessful, but the likely choices would be either appointing someone who is an expert but not a politician (a technocrat) or calling for early elections.\nResurgent US Dollar Keeps EUR/USD on the Back Foot\nThe US Dollar has surprised many by its resilience over the past two weeks. What could be the driving force of the Greenback stubbornness at the moment? Let us take a look.\nOne of the reasons benefitting the US Dollar may be down to the one-week interest rate which is rather expensive. The current rate rests near 4.15%. With a lack of high impact US data, market participants appear to be staying away from the loading up on US Dollar short positions.\nMarket participants may have also changed their outlook due to an IMF report last week. The prevailing theory of late was that Central Banks were the sellers of US Dollars in April and May, however the IMF data showed the dollar\u2019s share in bank reserves remained about 57% in the second quarter of 2025. That suggests something else could be at work and maybe it was the private sector dumping US Dollar during Q2.\nThe US Government shutdown has not had the impact many market participants had hoped it would. I think many expected the US Dollar to slide if the shutdown drags on.\nThe latest predictions show that people are slightly less worried that this shutdown will become the longest ever (which would be more than 35 days); the chance of that happening is now down to 22%.\nNevertheless, markets are scheduled to hear from several officials from the Federal Reserve today, including Bostic, Bowman, and Miran, all speaking between 4:00 PM and 4:30 PM Central European Time (CET).\nHowever, I don't expect their comments to significantly change the market's strong belief that the Fed will cut interest rates two more times before the end of the year.\nAs things stand, markets are still pricing in around 44.5 bps of rate cuts through December 2025.\nSource: LSEG\nTechnical Analysis - EUR/USD\nFrom a technical standpoint, EUR/USD is approaching a key confluence level which could prove key to the pair's next move.\nEUR/USD had broken above a descending trendline from the YTD high, before pushing lower. However, it is approaching the medium term ascending trendline which coincides with a retest of the descending trendline and the 100-day MA around the 1.1626 handle.\nA break of this level could see the start of a deeper pullback toward the trendline touch and swing low on August 1, resting just below the pivot price of 1.1450.\nBefore that, there is support at 1.1584 and 1.1528 which could come into play and provide some short-term relief.\nA move higher from here faces resistance at 1.1700 before the 1.1800 swing high and YTD high at 1.1918 comes into focus.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart, October 7, 2025\nSource: TradingView.com (click to enlarge)\nClient Sentiment Data - EUR/USD\nLooking at OANDA client sentiment data and market participants are short on the EUR/USD Index with 61% of traders net-short. I prefer to take a contrarian view toward crowd sentiment and thus the fact that so many traders are short means EUR/USD could rise in the near-term.\nFollow Zain on Twitter/X for Additional Market News and Insights @zvawda\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or directors.

                "body": "EUR/USD (Euro vs. U.S. Dollar) Struggles Near 1.1650 as Political Turmoil in France and U.S. Dollar Strength Intensify\nThe EUR/USD pair extended its decline on Tuesday, falling toward 1.1650, its lowest level in over a month, as investors fled from European assets amid a deepening political crisis in France and a resilient U.S. dollar supported by hawkish Federal Reserve remarks. The euro, which briefly attempted to recover above 1.1700, failed to sustain momentum, dropping 0.42% intraday. Traders are confronting simultaneous headwinds: political instability in the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy and lingering uncertainty over the U.S. government shutdown that continues to distort global risk sentiment. France\u2019s fiscal and political outlook remains the epicenter of pressure on the euro. Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu\u2019s resignation after only 27 days in office left President Emmanuel Macron facing the most severe domestic challenge of his tenure. Macron\u2019s call for Lecornu to negotiate with coalition leaders has failed to calm markets, as opposition parties push for early elections. The French political vacuum raises doubts about fiscal consolidation, with France\u2019s deficit now near twice the EU\u2019s 3% limit, threatening renewed credit downgrades. Investors fear that another sovereign downgrade could lift French yields by 30\u201340 basis points, tightening financing conditions across the bloc.\nEuropean Central Bank Faces Policy Crossroads as Lagarde and Nagel Signal Divergent Outlooks\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) remains trapped between inflation control and deteriorating regional growth. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated this week that the \u201cdisinflationary process is over,\u201d suggesting the recent decline in price pressures may have plateaued. Yet Vice President Luis de Guindos acknowledged risks of recession, while Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel defended the need to \u201cpreserve credibility through restraint.\u201d Markets now price a 46% probability of another 25-basis-point cut by December, as bond spreads between Italy and Germany widen to 184 basis points, the highest since March. Lagarde and Nagel\u2019s upcoming speeches are expected to clarify the central bank\u2019s position on whether to prioritize inflation stability or economic growth. German data added to the pessimism, with factory orders falling 0.8% in August, far below expectations for a 1.4% increase, extending July\u2019s 2.7% contraction. This series of weak data solidifies the view that Europe\u2019s manufacturing base remains under heavy pressure.\nU.S. Dollar Strengthens Despite Fed Rate-Cut Bets as Safe-Haven Demand Lifts the Greenback\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) continues to defy expectations, trading near 98.33, its second consecutive daily gain, after comments from Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who emphasized that inflation \u201cremains too high.\u201d Despite a 94% probability of a Fed rate cut in October and 84% odds in December (per CME FedWatch data), the dollar\u2019s resilience underscores the market\u2019s preference for safety during global political strain. The U.S. government shutdown, now in its seventh day, has failed to weaken the greenback as traders hedge against potential European instability. Fed officials Raphael Bostic, Neel Kashkari, Michelle Bowman, and Stephen Miran are scheduled to speak later today, and any hawkish signals could amplify the dollar\u2019s advantage. The prolonged shutdown is delaying critical data such as Nonfarm Payrolls, CPI, and Retail Sales, adding opacity to Fed decision-making. However, the Fed\u2019s confidence in its \u201cwell-calibrated\u201d policy has prevented broader panic, supporting Treasury yields at 4.12% on the 10-year note.\nTechnical View: EUR/USD Bears Target 1.1610 as Momentum Weakens\nTechnically, the EUR/USD structure remains distinctly bearish. The pair has been unable to reclaim its descending trendline from mid-September, with the 50-day EMA at 1.1726 and 200-day EMA at 1.1715 flattening, confirming a lack of upward momentum. Immediat"

Despite a notable lack of firm bullish momentum, selling pressure remains unable to crack the 1.3400 handle, keeping Cable hobbled in a volatile midrange.\nCentral bankers will dominate headline flows on Wednesday. A raft of Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers will be making public appearances, as well as a speech from Bank of England (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Huw Pill.\nWednesday\u2019s key event will be the release of the Fed\u2019s latest Meeting Minutes, due at 18:00 GMT. The Fed broke the seal on interest rate cuts at its latest rate call, and investors will be looking for signs that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is tilting toward more rate cuts through the remainder of the year.\nAs the US government shutdown rolls on, the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be grappling with a lack of key official datasets as it makes interest rate decisions heading into the tail end of the calendar year. Barring any significant shocks in the data that remains available to the Fed, rate markets have locked in expectations of two follow-up interest rate cuts on October 29 and December 10.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance."

Regardless, the US Dollar Index (DXY) posted its highest close in two months and its best single-day gain in eight.\nUSD/JPY extended its advance to a seven-month high, with the Japanese yen remaining the weakest major amid expectations of a stimulus-driven policy agenda from Japan\u2019s incoming prime minister.

At the very least, a dovish 25bp cut could pave the way for further New Zealand dollar losses.

Tuesday\u2019s bearish outside day reinforced downside momentum as the Aussie dollar slipped back below the 20-day SMA, signalling renewed weakness against the US dollar.\nPrice action now favours sellers while trading beneath 0.6630, with bears likely eyeing the 50-day SMA (0.6544) and the 0.6520 support zone as near-term downside targets. A clean break below those levels could expose the 0.6500 handle, while rallies toward 0.66 may attract fresh selling pressure.\nThe broader bias remains bearish as momentum realigns with the decline from the September high, keeping the Aussie on the defensive into mid-October.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/USD\nNZD/USD Technical Analysis: New Zealand Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe New Zealand dollar (NZD/USD) has turned lower after forming a swing high near 0.5847, a zone that aligns with the 200-day SMA and 20-day EMA, reinforcing its role as a key resistance cluster. Monday\u2019s failure to hold above this level triggered renewed bearish momentum, with the Kiwi falling nearly 0.8%, marking its weakest session in over a week.\nMomentum has now realigned with the dominant daily downtrend, keeping sellers in control heading into today\u2019s RBNZ interest rate decision.

Crucially, the softer wage growth figures followed recent comments from BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who raised concerns about tariffs affecting wages, stating:\n\u201cIf uncertainty regarding overseas economies and trade policies remains high, firms may place stronger emphasis on cost-cutting and may weaken their efforts to reflect price increases in wages.\u201d\nSanae Takaichi, the new leader of Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party and potentially Prime Minister, also underscored the need for sustained wage growth for further monetary policy tightening. She stated:\n\u201cDemand-pull inflation \u2014 wage increases driving demand growth, leading to a gradual rising of prices and corporate profits \u2014 is the best outcome. Until such a situation emerges, we must maintain close communication with the Bank of Japan. We must stay in sync.\u201d\nTakaichi\u2019s support for ultra-loose monetary policy and today\u2019s wage growth data sent USD/JPY to its highest level since February 2025.\nAcross the Pacific, market focus remains on the US government shutdown and the Fed\u2019s upcoming interest rate decision. Overnight, lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a stopgap funding bill needed to reopen the government.\nA prolonged shutdown could weigh on the US economy and further delay key economic data releases. The Fed typically adopts a more dovish stance during extended shutdowns, reinforcing expectations for policy easing. With the next Senate vote today, the US dollar could face selling pressure if the vote fails to reach the 60 required to pass the stopgap funding bill.\nMeanwhile, Fed speakers and the FOMC meeting minutes will also require consideration amid rising bets on multiple Q4 rate cuts. FOMC voting members Michael Barr, Alberto Musalem, and alternate member Neil Kashkari are on the calendar to speak. Views on the shutdown, the economic outlook, and inflation could influence USD/JPY trends.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: Political Factors, BoJ Policy, and Dovish Fed Risks\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nAs traders lower bets on an October BoJ policy adjustment, uncertainty lingers over the RBA\u2019s rate path, spotlighting AUD/USD.\nTurning focus to the AUD/USD pair, Aussie inflation and labor market data are clouding the RBA\u2019s rate path. Australian ANZ-Indeed job ads slid 3.3% month-on-month in September, accelerating from a 0.3% drop in August. The job ad slump followed August\u2019s sharp drop in full-time employment, signaling a deteriorating labor market. A softer labor market may curb wage growth, dampening inflation.\nHowever, recent inflation figures have raised doubts about a November RBA rate cut, fueling monetary policy uncertainty. The Aussie Monthly CPI Indicator rose to 3% in August, reaching the top end of the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target range, up from 2.8% in July. While recent labor market data has weighed on the Aussie dollar, AUD/USD remains above August levels, underscoring uncertainty over the timing of an RBA rate cut.\nOn Friday, October 10, RBA Governor Michele Bullock may share views on recent data and the RBA\u2019s policy stance.\nAUD/USD: Key Scenarios to Watch\nSee our full AUD/USD analysis for detailed trends and trade setups.\nWhile Aussie economic data continues to fuel speculation about an RBA rate cut, developments on Capitol Hill and Fed speakers will also influence AUD/USD trends.\nAnother failed Senate vote and growing calls for back-to-back Fed rate cuts in October and December would narrow the US-Aussie rate differential, favoring the Aussie dollar. A narrower rate differential would likely drive AUD/USD toward $0.66. A sustained move above $0.66 could bring $0.665 into play.\nO"

                "body": "Australian Dollar Price Forecast: Minor hurdle sits around 0.6650\n- AUD/USD reversed two daily advances in a row, breaking below 0.6600.\n- The US Dollar kept the bid bias unchanged amid the prevailing risk-off mood.\n- Australian\u2019s Consumer Confidence receded to 92.1 in October, said Westpac.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) couldn\u2019t keep Monday\u2019s upbeat tone going, with AUD/USD slipping back under the key 0.6600 handle on Tuesday as sellers returned to the market.\nThe move lower came alongside another strong rebound in the Greenback, which pushed the US Dollar Index (DXY) to fresh two-week highs, comfortably above the 98.00 mark.\nDomestic data still holding up\nDespite the softer tone in markets, Australia\u2019s economy is holding up better than expected. The final PMI readings for September eased a touch but stayed above 50, meaning activity is still expanding.\nRetail sales rose a solid 1.2% in June, the August trade surplus narrowed only slightly to A$1.825 billion, and business investment kept improving through Q2. GDP grew 0.6% QoQ and 1.8% on a yearly basis, not spectacular, but steady enough.\nThe labour market has cooled a bit over the summer. The Unemployment Rate held at 4.2% in August, though total employment dipped by 5.4K, hardly a red flag, but a sign that momentum is softening around the edges.\nRBA stays cautious\nInflation, meanwhile, is proving a little too sticky for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The August Monthly CPI Indicator (Weighted Mean) edged up to 3.0% from 2.8%, and Q2 CPI rose 0.7% QoQ and 2.1% YoY.\nThat was enough to keep the RBA on guard at its 30 September meeting. The cash rate stayed at 3.60%, as expected, but policymakers quietly dropped earlier hints about potential easing.\nOfficials warned that disinflation might be slowing after that CPI surprise and that Q3 could run hotter than their 2.6% forecast. The broader economy still looks solid too: real wages are improving, asset prices are rising, and households are feeling more confident, hardly a case for rate cuts.\nGovernor Michele Bullock repeated that decisions will remain data-driven and made one meeting at a time. Rate cuts aren\u2019t off the table, but the RBA wants to see clearer signs that supply and demand pressures are really easing.\nFor now, the trimmed mean CPI at 2.7% YoY in Q2 sits comfortably inside the RBA\u2019s 2%\u20133% target band.\nSo far, markets are pricing in about 15 basis points of easing by year-end and roughly 30 bps by end-2026.\nChina still calling the shots\nAustralia\u2019s fortunes remain tightly linked to China\u2019s patchy recovery. Q2 GDP rose a healthy 5.2% YoY, but August retail sales missed at 3.4%. September PMIs painted a mixed picture \u2014 manufacturing stayed in contraction at 49.8 while services barely held the 50.0 line. Meanwhile, August CPI fell 0.4% YoY, keeping deflation worries alive.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) kept its Loan Prime Rates (LPR) unchanged in September: the one-year at 3.00% and the five-year at 3.50%, as markets expected.\nTraders remain unconvinced\nSpeculative traders aren\u2019t exactly piling in either. With fresh Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data still missing due to the US government shutdown, the latest available figures (week to September 23) showed limited appetite for the Aussie. Net shorts climbed to 101.6K contracts, the highest in two weeks, while open interest ticked up to 160.8K.\nTechnicals views\nAUD/USD seems to have embarked on a consolidative range.\nIndeed, further upside is seen targeting the 2025 peak at 0.6707 (September 17), ahead of the 2024 top at 0.6942 (September 30), which is closely followed by the key 0.7000 threshold.\nOn the flip side, initial contention emerges at the weekly base at 0.6520 (September 26), which appears bolstered by the interim 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). South from here, AUD/USD could attempt a move to the August floor at 0.6414 (August 21), again supported by the significant 200-day SMA. Extra losses from here should see the June valley at 0"

                "body": "It has been a challenging period for the Japanese yen in the short term. The USD/JPY pair has extended its four-day winning streak with an increase of almost 2.7%, reflecting the yen\u2019s continued weakness against the U.S. dollar. For now, bullish pressure remains strong, fueled by uncertainty surrounding the new fiscal policies proposed by Japan\u2019s new political leadership. This uncertainty has caused the yen to consistently lose ground, and as long as this outlook persists, buying pressure on USD/JPY could continue to strengthen in the coming sessions.\nNew Party Leader\nOn October 4, Sanae Takaichi was elected as the new leader of Japan\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Takaichi, a veteran politician with extensive ministerial experience, is on track to become Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, pending confirmation by parliament.\nHowever, what has truly moved the markets are the economic plans expected from her incoming administration. Takaichi is known for advocating aggressive public spending to stimulate growth \u2014 a stance that has raised concerns over Japan\u2019s rising debt levels and fiscal sustainability. In addition, her government could push for lower interest rates to support the economy in the short term, potentially conflicting with the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) inflation-control objectives.\nLooking at Japan\u2019s inflation curve, prices have eased but remain above the 2% target, with the latest reading at 2.7% in August. This suggests that the BoJ should maintain a tighter policy stance to bring inflation back to target. However, the government\u2019s new fiscal direction could undermine that effort, creating a sense of weakened inflation control and possibly reducing confidence in yen demand.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nBefore Takaichi\u2019s victory, markets expected the BoJ to end the year with an interest rate of 0.75%, slightly above the current 0.50%. However, this outlook could change under the new leadership, keeping Japan among the developed economies with the lowest interest rates. Over time, this may make yen-denominated investments less attractive.\nMoreover, the combination of fiscal uncertainty, the risk of economic overstimulation, and weak inflation control could further erode confidence in the yen, leading to a persistent loss of appeal. This environment could reinforce steady buying pressure on the USD/JPY in the near term.\nIs the U.S. Dollar Recovering?\nDespite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, the dollar has shown resilience, rebounding over recent sessions. This strength partly stems from its role as a temporary safe haven amid political uncertainty in the United States.\nThe dollar\u2019s recovery is also reflected in the DXY Index, which measures Greenback\u2019s performance against a basket of major currencies. The index remained above 98 points, maintaining a positive upward slope over recent sessions.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nThis trend indicates that confidence in the U.S. dollar has been steadily improving. As long as the DXY maintains this upward trajectory and market perception of U.S. stability continues to strengthen, the yen\u2019s room for recovery will likely remain limited \u2014 further supporting upward pressure on USD/JPY.\nTechnical Outlook for USD/JPY\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend Back in Play: Since late April, USD/JPY has maintained a solid bullish trend, with consolidation zones acting as structural support. The latest bullish impulse has driven the pair to new highs, confirming that the dominant formation remains upward. If the price manages to break above key resistance levels, buying pressure could continue to dominate in the short term.\n- RSI: The RSI readings show that the average buying momentum remains strong over the past 14 sessions. However, the indicator is approaching the overbought zone (70), suggesting that the market could be entering a short-term imbalance phase. This could open space for minor corrective pullbacks if buying pressure becomes excessive.\n- ADX: The ADX indicator remains below "

The Japanese Yen (JPY) reached its weakest level since February against the US Dollar (USD) after Sanae Takaichi\u2019s surprise win as the new leader of Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The FOMC Minutes will be in the spotlight later on Wednesday.\nJapan's ruling party has elected Takaichi as its new leader, positioning the 64-year-old to be Japan's first female Prime Minister. Takaichi indicated she wants the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to proceed cautiously on a rate hike and favors close communication between the central bank and the government.\nHer victory caused traders to reduce bets that the BoJ will raise interest rates this month, undermining the JPY and creating a tailwind for the pair. Money market traders are currently pricing in nearly a 26% odds that the BoJ will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on October 30, down from around 60% before Takaichi's leadership victory, according to Bloomberg.\nOn the other hand, the ongoing US government shutdown might drag the Greenback lower against the JPY. The Senate on Monday did not pass a House bill for a fifth time that would temporarily fund the US government, deepening the government funding stalemate. US President Donald Trump said that his administration would begin laying off federal workers if the shutdown persists beyond Monday.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

The pair appreciates as the US Dollar (USD) gains ground, as United States (US) Consumer Inflation Expectations for the year ahead rose to 3.4% in September, the highest in five months, compared to 3.2% in August.\nHowever, the US Dollar may face challenges amid prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy stance. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in nearly a 95% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in October and an 83% possibility of another reduction in December.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) Board of Governors member Stephen Miran expressed his belief on Tuesday that inflation itself is simply a cause of \"population increases\". Monetary policy needs to ease to get ahead of the shift down in the neutral rate, Miran added.\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari struck a more reserved tone than some of his Fed counterparts on Tuesday, cautioning that it's still too soon to be able to tell if tariff-led inflation will be \"sticky\" or not. However, Kashkari noted that he's particularly bullish on the labor market and is expecting a return to form for American job creation, which has sputtered recently.\nThe upside of the USD/CAD pair could be limited as the commodity-linked CAD receives support from higher Oil prices. It is worth noting that Canada is the largest crude exporter to the United States.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price continues to gain ground for the fourth successive session, trading around $62.00 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices receive support from a more modest OPEC+ output hike. The Oil group recently decided to limit its production increase, opting for the smallest rise among the options considered.\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have"

It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions an"

These comments pose a veiled threat of a potential intervention and have contributed to providing some footing for the Yen:\nIn the UK, recent data revealed a significant slowdown in the services sector, and a survey by the Bank of England showed that British businesses\u2019 hiring plans fell to their lowest levels since 2020.\nThese figures have raised expectations that the Bank of England might be forced to cut rates again. In that sense, the minutes of the last BoE FPC committee, and BoE\u2019s Chief Economist Huw Pill\u2019s comments will be carefully analysed to confirm those expectations on Wednesday.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and copywriter in diverse Forex-related firms, like FXStreet and Kantox."

Absurd,\u201d Balchunas noted on X, highlighting the speed and stark contrast between the Bitcoin fund and BlackRock\u2019s long-established revenue leaders like the 25-year-old iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF.\nLast quarter, IBIT passed Coinbase Global\u2019s Deribit platform to become the world\u2019s largest venue for Bitcoin options.\nA Bitcoin ETF lets investors gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually buying or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Instead, the fund holds Bitcoin (or Bitcoin-related contracts) while investors simply buy shares on a stock exchange, with the share price moving alongside Bitcoin\u2019s market value.\nBeing a regulated financial product, it provides a safer, more accessible way to invest in Bitcoin through familiar brokerage accounts.\nBlackRock and other investors are turning to Bitcoin\nThe fund\u2019s meteoric rise underscores a broader shift in investor behavior. Bitcoin itself hit a new all-time high of $126,200 on Monday, fueling inflows into IBIT.\nMarket conditions are playing a critical role: declining U.S. interest rates, combined with a weakening dollar amid the ongoing government shutdown, are driving investors to seek alternative stores of value.\nETFs tracking digital assets like Bitcoin have emerged as a natural destination for capital in this climate.\nFor IBIT, every 1% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price translates into nearly $1 billion added to assets under management, bringing the $100 billion milestone tantalizingly close. In less than two years, IBIT has leapfrogged traditional stalwarts and cemented itself as a central player in both the crypto and ETF worlds."

It would also be rarefied air. Only 18 U.S.-listed ETFs currently manage more than $100 billion.\nSource: Bloomberg\nDominating The Crypto ETF Market\nIBIT now accounts for roughly half of all assets in the U.S. spot crypto ETF category. Its nearest competitors, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), hold $26.1 billion and $22.2 billion in AUM, respectively.\nBut while IBIT\u2019s momentum continues to build, rival funds have seen far less enthusiasm from investors. IBIT has pulled in $26.4 billion so far in 2025, while FBTC has gathered just $1 billion and GBTC has suffered $2.6 billion of outflows.\nIBIT and its Ethereum counterpart, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), have together attracted nearly $38 billion of inflows this year\u2014virtually the entire total for spot crypto ETFs. The pair have quickly become the default vehicles for investors seeking crypto exposure in an ETF wrapper.\nRiding Bitcoin\u2019s Rally\nIBIT\u2019s asset surge has been fueled not just by inflows but by the relentless rally in Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency recently topped $125,000 for the first time ever and is up roughly 160% since IBIT\u2019s launch. About two-thirds of IBIT\u2019s asset growth has come from inflows, with the rest from price appreciation.\nAs IBIT\u2019s footprint grows, it\u2019s increasingly becoming a driving force in Bitcoin itself, with inflows large enough to influence price moves and market sentiment.\nAt just under $100 billion in AUM, IBIT represents about 4.2% of Bitcoin\u2019s $2.4 trillion market cap. Given how easy and familiar ETFs have made crypto investing, IBIT\u2019s share of the Bitcoin market could keep rising.\nTo put its potential in perspective, if Bitcoin\u2019s market cap reached $3 trillion and IBIT accounted for 10% of it, the fund would be $300 billion in size. A 20% share of a $5 trillion market would imply $1 trillion in AUM.\nThose scenarios are far from guaranteed, but they show just how large IBIT could become if Bitcoin demand keeps expanding."

                "body": "Ethena Labs has announced that it has started working with UR Global to roll out its USDe stablecoin to clients in more than 45 countries. This collaboration indicates the further narrowing of the gap between decentralized finance and conventional banking system. This partnership is also a major move towards the mainstream consumer making DeFi a reality with a single neobank.\nIncreased Utility of USDe in Everyday Finance\nThe collaboration between Ethena labs and UR global is aimed at attaching USDe, a synthetic dollar stablecoin by Ethena, to the blockchain-based neobank infrastructure of UR. Users can earn up to 5% annual percentage yield (APY) on their USDe holdings, which is comparable to standard savings accounts.\nPerhaps most importantly, the platform reduces off-ramp fees for USDe-to-fiat conversion, reducing one of the major barriers to everyday users engaging in digital assets.\nThe service will be accessible via iOS, Android, and web interfaces, providing widespread availability regardless of device preference. Moreover, direct spending capabilities of the USDe will be offered through a Mastercard debit card within several weeks and will turn the stablecoin into a useful payment method to use in the cases of daily shopping.\nBlockchain-Native Banking Infrastructure of UR\nThe ecosystem supports UR Global, as it is the first fully blockchain-based neobank in the world. The platform integrates the functionality of traditional banking (i.e., multi-currency accounts, debit cards) with blockchain-specific functionality.\nUR\u2019s Swiss-backed infrastructure allows users to hold both fiat currency and stablecoins in the same account, allowing for seamless transitions between traditional and decentralized financial systems.\nThis infrastructure is particularly important for the Ethena cooperation since it provides the regulatory compliance and banking rails necessary to enable meaningful USDe usefulness in real-world situations. Now users can use USDe as a dollar savings tool that generates income and at the same time be able to use ordinary payment networks to pay regular expenses.\nStrategic Timing and Market Environment\nEthena-UR partnership is a timely event on the stablecoin market and the general adoption of DeFi. In 2025, Ethena has been prolifically the product range of USDe, especially starting a collaboration with the TON Foundation to deploy USDe into the ecosystem of a billion-plus users of Telegram and the Sui blockchain to deliver native stablecoins.\nAs McKinsey research on stablecoin infrastructure sees it, tokenized cash and stablecoins are becoming important elements in next-generation payment systems, especially in cross-border transactions where the traditional banking infrastructure is sluggish and costly.\nThis could be particularly beneficial to the customers in the emerging markets that have not yet developed banking systems or where access to dollar-denominated deposits is limited. The stability of USDe, along with the accessibility of UR, and elimination of translation costs offer a very attractive value proposition to investors who seek to preserve wealth in dollar-equivalent assets and maintain realistic spending capacity.\nConclusion\nThe agreement between Ethena Labs and UR Global is a significant step towards making DeFi available to mainstream users in 45+ countries. This partnership is the most effective way to close the divide between decentralized finance and traditional banking by incorporating USDe into the blockchain-native neobank platform of UR, which also has competitive interest rates, no off-ramp fees, and the ability to use a Mastercard debit card.\nThe success of the Ethena-UR partnership will eventually be established by its implementation regarding regulatory compliance, peg stability, and user experience. However, it may serve as an outline for how DeFi protocols might achieve widespread adoption while keeping the core elements that make decentralized finance desirable."

In late July, Ethereum was trading near $3,715, brushing up against its yearly high of $3,765.\nJust weeks later, in August, ETH shattered its previous 2021 record of $4,878, climbing to a new all-time high of $4,965.\nEthereum\u2019s market cap now stands at roughly $534 billion, and technical indicators remain strong.\nWeekly charts show bullish continuation patterns, while the relative strength index (RSI) points to sustained buying pressure.\nOn-chain activity reinforces this outlook, with rising transaction volumes and an uptick in smart contract deployment.\nLooking ahead, Ethereum\u2019s trajectory for the rest of 2025 could hinge on key regulatory decisions\u2014particularly the SEC\u2019s stance on staking within ETFs, a factor that could either fuel further upside or cool momentum.\nThe top 10 Ethereum holders control around 83.9 million ETH, accounting for roughly 70% of the current circulating supply, worth over $300 billion at today\u2019s prices.\nIf you widen the lens to include staking contracts and large custodial pools, that number climbs even higher.\nBy some estimates, these expanded holdings represent up to 52% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply, or about $120 billion in value.\nThe 200 largest Ethereum wallets now hold over 62.7 million ETH, underscoring just how top-heavy ETH ownership remains.\nHowever, unlike Bitcoin\u2014where dormant whale wallets like Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s cast a long shadow\u2014Ethereum\u2019s most oversized holders are anything but idle.\nMost actively participate in the ecosystem: staking contracts secure the network, exchange wallets support millions of users, or institutional custodians facilitate everything from ETFs to validator services.\nSo while the top ETH wallets may appear concentrated, they often represent pooled assets, not individual mega-whales.\nIt\u2019s less about hoarding and more about infrastructure, reflecting Ethereum\u2019s unique role in powering DeFi, staking, and the broader Web3 economy.\nA person or company does not populate the ETH holder leaderboard, but rather a smart contract: the Ethereum Beacon Deposit Contract.\nThis is where users lock up ETH to become validators and secure the proof-of-stake network.\nIt holds an astounding over 36 million ETH, 36% of the total supply, worth roughly $299.5 billion.\nFar from idle, these coins are actively staked, powering the Ethereum consensus engine.\nThis makes Ethereum the biggest holder of the Beacon contract and arguably the most critical one for security and decentralization.\nAs the largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase is a household name in the digital asset space.\nIt holds roughly 6.9 million ETH, valued at $23.5 billion, across multiple wallets.\nThese holdings represent a mix of customer funds, institutional custody accounts, and Coinbase\u2019s cbETH staking derivative program.\nWith s"

                "body": "Solana\u2019s TVL Climbs as SOL Price Holds Steady\u2014Is a Breakout on the Horizon?\nSolana\u2019s on-chain metrics are painting an intriguing picture. While the network\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged steadily over recent weeks\u2014signalling robust ecosystem activity\u2014the SOL token itself remains largely range-bound, consolidating between key support and resistance levels. This divergence between network growth and the market price of Solana could be hinting at a deeper structural shift within Solana\u2019s ecosystem.\nRising Network Activity Amid Price Stagnation\nSolana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, with platforms like Jupiter, MarginFi, Kamino, and Solend driving record inflows. The rising TVL reflects renewed investor confidence and increasing capital deployment into Solana\u2019s decentralized economy. More users are interacting with dApps, staking assets, and utilising liquidity pools\u2014strengthening the network\u2019s real on-chain utility.\nYet, despite this visible growth, SOL\u2019s price has struggled to break out decisively. Traders appear cautious, influenced by broader market uncertainty and Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, which continues to steer capital flows across the altcoin market. This has created a temporary disconnect between Solana\u2019s improving fundamentals and market speculation.\nA Sign of Ecosystem Maturity, Not Weakness\nThis kind of divergence isn\u2019t necessarily bearish\u2014it often signals fundamental strength building beneath surface-level price action. With more than 65% of SOL staked, the circulating supply remains tight, while the liquidity that does exist is being efficiently recycled within Solana\u2019s DeFi protocols. That means rising TVL doesn\u2019t automatically translate into upward price movement\u2014but it underscores a maturing, capital-efficient ecosystem.\nIn many cases, such phases represent accumulation zones, where smart money positions ahead of broader recognition. Historically, strong on-chain growth preceding a price lag has often led to powerful medium-term rallies once sentiment shifts.\nWill SOL Price Rise Above $300?\nAfter a strong push in the first few days of the month, the bulls appear to have been experiencing some upward pressure. Since the rebound in April, the SOL price has been forming consecutive higher highs and lows. However, the current chart patterns suggest the trend is slowly flipping in favour of the bears. If the bulls fail to reverse the persistent trend, the SOL price may face a 10% pullback.\nThe daily chart of Solana suggests the price continues to trade under bullish influence but could be subjected to a small pullback. The token appears to be repeating a previous pattern of forming a lower high within an ascending parallel channel. This has no doubt dragged the price levels lower to the support but has triggered a strong rebound towards the resistance as well. The RSI is also forming a similar pattern, indicating a drop to $210 is quite possible if the local support at $220 is not defended by the bulls. On the contrary, a healthy rebound could lead the rally beyond $260.\nLooking Ahead\nIf Solana\u2019s TVL continues to trend higher and ecosystem participation deepens, market sentiment may eventually catch up to the fundamentals. A sustained increase in network usage\u2014paired with renewed liquidity inflows\u2014could act as the catalyst for SOL\u2019s next major price breakout.\nFor now, Solana stands as one of the few networks showing organic growth, even as its token consolidates\u2014an encouraging sign for long-term believers eyeing strength beyond short-term price noise.\nFAQs\nWhy is Solana SOLUSDT price not rising?Despite strong network growth, SOL\u2019s price is consolidating due to broader market uncertainty and Bitcoin\u2019s dominance steering capital away from altcoins currently.\nWhat is the Solana price prediction?Analysts see a potential rebound toward $260 if key support holds. However, a break below $220 could lead to a pullback toward the $210 level.\nIs Solana a good investment?Solana\u2019s strong fundamentals, including a rising To"

                "url": "https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/breakingcrypto-2025-10-7-solana-dogecoin-and-litecoin-etfs-poised-to-be-2025s-blockbuster-launches-analyst-predicts",
                "body": "October 7, 2025 \u2013 The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with anticipation as a prominent analyst, Luke Martin (@VentureCoinist), has boldly predicted that spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) for Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) could emerge as some of the biggest ETF launches of 2025. This forecast, made on October 6, 2025, comes amidst a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape and growing institutional appetite for digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nMartin\u2019s optimism is rooted in the impressive performance of previous crypto-related ETF launches, drawing parallels to the success of Rex\u2019s XRPR and DOJE ETFs. He anticipates that the new '33 Act' spot ETFs for these altcoins will attract even greater investment flows, mirroring how Bitcoin spot ETFs garnered more capital than their futures-based counterparts. This development signals a significant leap in the mainstream integration of cryptocurrencies, potentially unlocking substantial institutional capital and ushering in a new era of accessibility for a broader range of digital assets.\nMarket Impact and Price Action\nThe potential approval of spot ETFs for Solana, Dogecoin, and Litecoin in 2025 is expected to trigger profound market shifts, echoing the transformative effects observed with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETF approvals. These approvals are set to enhance accessibility for institutional and retail investors, injecting substantial capital and further legitimizing these cryptocurrencies as investable assets.\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 significantly boosted BTC's price and liquidity, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) [NASDAQ: IBIT] alone seeing net inflows exceeding $37 billion. Similarly, the prospect of spot Ethereum ETFs, approved in May 2024 with trading commencing in July 2024, saw ETH's price surge by 25% prior to launch. Ethereum ETFs have since attracted significant inflows, with some even allowing staking, which is expected to boost demand by offering yield and reducing liquid supply.\nFor Solana (SOL), already a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, an ETF approval is widely anticipated to \"open the floodgates\" for traditional finance (TradFi) investment. Solana has already garnered significant institutional interest throughout 2025, with public companies like VisionSys [NYSE: VSYS] and Forward Industries [NASDAQ: FORD] committing billions to SOL strategies. Solana ETPs have seen record inflows, with total AUM for all Solana ETPs surpassing $5.1 billion. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) [CBOE: SSK] is already operational in the U.S. with over $406.6 million in assets under management. Analysts project SOL price targets of $300-$400, assuming a 30-50% post-approval appreciation, with some bullish long-term predictions suggesting a 3,800% move. As of early October 2025, SOL's price has increased by 5% to $219 due to ETF speculation.\nDogecoin (DOGE), despite its meme coin origins, has seen steadily increasing institutional interest. The REX-Osprey DOJE ETF [CBOE: DOJE] is already live, trading at $24.29 with nearly $25 million in AUM. An approved DOGE ETF could transform its perception from a mere meme coin into a legitimate investment asset, potentially triggering a \"massive 200%+\" rally or a \"5x price surge.\" Projections suggest DOGE could receive an additional $12 billion to $20 billion, potentially doubling or tripling its current market value, with price targets of $0.35 by year-end 2025. Dogecoin experienced whale accumulation and a 22% monthly gain in October 2025 due to ETF rumors.\nLitecoin (LTC), often dubbed \"digital silver,\" benefits from its long-standing track record and regulatory clarity as a commodity. Grayscale [OTCQX: GBTC] has submitted a proposal for a spot Litecoin ETF, and Canary Capital has also filed an application. Analysts believe Litecoin's commodity status enhances its chances of approval, positioning it as a \"third wave\" candidate after Bitcoin and Ethereum. An approved LTC"

The move highlights a crucial step toward improving onchain security, which has become an increasing concern amid a year marked by numerous DeFi exploits.\nStrengthening Solana\u2019s DeFi Security\nKamino\u2019s bug bounty initiative is divided into two main categories, smart contracts, and websites and applications. Smart contract vulnerabilities will receive the largest rewards, with payouts scaling based on severity ranging from $150,000 to $1.5 million for critical threats. High- and medium-level vulnerabilities are valued at $100,000 and $10,000, respectively, while website and app bugs can earn up to $50,000.\nThis collaboration with ImmuneFi brings Kamino\u2019s security testing under one of the most trusted cybersecurity networks in the Web3 space. ImmuneFi\u2019s record speaks volumes it has safeguarded over $190 billion in user funds and paid more than $120 million to ethical hackers for uncovering overlooked vulnerabilities.\nPrior to this partnership, Kamino had already self-hosted bounty programs for three years, completing over 18 audits and maintaining open-source, verifiable code. The expanded collaboration significantly scales that effort, giving Kamino access to a global network of professional auditors.\nRising DeFi Exploits Underscore the Need\nThe timing of Kamino\u2019s campaign comes amid an uptick in DeFi vulnerabilities across the sector. In 2025 alone, there were roughly 144 reported DeFi exploits. Although total hack losses fell 37% in Q3 to $509 million, September still witnessed a surge in million-dollar attacks, according to CertiK Alert data. This pattern underscores how vital proactive testing has become for decentralized protocols handling vast amounts of liquidity.\nSOL Price Eyes $300 Ahead of ETF Decision\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s native token continues to show bullish momentum. Trading around $231, SOL has gained over 11% in the past week despite minor intraday declines.\nSource: X\nAccording to Trader Tardigrade, an inverse Head and Shoulders formation on the 4-hour chart signals a potential move toward $300, provided price breaks above $240 resistance.\nHODL GENTLEMAN also highlights an important catalyst ahead the SEC\u2019s final deadline for Solana\u2019s spot ETF on October 10. With approval odds near 95%, Solana may soon enter a new phase of institutional growth, supported by improving security and technical strength.\nKamino Launches Solana\u2019s Largest Bug Bounty with ImmuneFi as SOL Eyes $300 Breakout\nSolana\u2019s leading DeFi protocol, Kamino, has lauched the blockchain\u2019s largest bug bounty program to date in partnership with ImmuneFi, offering up to $1.5 million in rewards for critical vulnerabilities.\nThe program, which launched on October 6, reinforces Solana\u2019s growing focus on strengthening its DeFi ecosystem as institutional interest in the blockchain accelerates ahead of the anticipated spot ETF decision.

                "body": "DAX Index analysis: Why German stocks are rising this year\nThe DAX Index has held steady in the past few days and is hovering at near its all-time high of \u20ac24,635. It was trading at \u20ac24,378 today, up by over 32% from its lowest level in April. This article highlights why the blue-chip German index is rising and the top movers this year.\nReasons why the DAX Index is soaring\nThere are three main reasons why the German DAX Index is in a strong rally this year. First, the rally is being supported by the actions of the European Central Bank (ECB), which has slashed interest rates several times and brought them to 2% this year.\nIt is common for the stock market to do well when the central bank is cutting interest rates as this makes the equities market more interesting than bonds.\nThe index has also reacted positively to the interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which cut them by 0.25% in the last meeting in September. Analysts expect that the bank will cut interest rates again later this year.\nThe DAX Index has also jumped because of the general correlation with the other global indices like the Hang Seng, Dow Jones, and the S&P 500. Historically, these global indices have had a close correlation with each other.\nAdditionally, the index benefited from the increased government spending in Germany as officials sought to supercharge the economy.\nThe gains, however, have been limited by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have applied on all goods that Germany sells to the United States, especially its vehicles. Trump has warned that he will add a 25% tariff on trucks, a move that will affect Daimler Trucks, one of the biggest players in the industry.\nPorsche, the maker of luxury vehicles, has been one of the most affected companies by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs as the US is its only growing market. The most recent results showed that the Chinese business has continued to deteriorate, while Europe is not growing. Porsche makes all its vehicles in Germany, meaning that it has to pay more in tariffs than other manufacturers.\nTop gainers and laggards in the German DAX\nThe top gainer in the DAX Index this year is Rheinmetall, the giant company in the defense industry whose shares have jumped by 207% this year amid increased defense spending.\nSiemens Energy share price has soared by 112% this year and 211% in the last 12 months, making a spectacular comeback for a company that received a government bailout a few years ago. Its performance has happened because of the ongoing demand for power globally.\nThe Commerzbank share price has jumped by 100% this year, helped by the ongoing speculation that Unicredit will make a full bid for the company.\nThe other top gainers in the DAX Index this year are Deutsche Bank, Heidelberg Materials, Bayer, E. On, Fresenius, and RWE. On the other hand, the top laggards in the index are Symrise, Beiersdorf, Adidas, Zalando, and Merck.\nDAX Index technical analysis\nDAX chart | Source: TradingView\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the DAX Index has rebounded in the past few days, moving from a low of 23,347 in September to a high of 24,400 today. It is now hovering near the year-to-date high of 24,635.\nThe index has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has also formed an ascending triangle pattern, which often leads to a strong bullish breakout over time.\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is where it jumps in the coming weeks and hits the important resistance level at 25,000. A drop below the support at 24,000 will invalidate the bullish outlook.\nThe post DAX Index analysis: Why German stocks are rising this year appeared first on Invezz\nRead More\nCAC 40 Index outlook: Understanding the decline and future forecast\nDAX Index analysis: Why German stocks are rising this year\nThe DAX Index has held steady in the past few days and is hovering at near its all-time high of \u20ac24,635.

The price has been continually pushed by fears over the US economy during the past year, accelerated by the government shutdown.\nThe $4,000 price has been hotly watched as it marks a doubling of the value of the precious metal in two years.\nTraders are eagerly anticipating Wednesday\u2019s release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September meeting minutes, which could offer new clues about the central bank\u2019s internal divisions and the outlook for interest rates as the government shutdown deprives policymakers of key economic data.\nLast week, the September jobs report wasn't released as scheduled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figures would normally give investors a sense of the Fed's next moves, considering the labor market plays a central role in its policy decisions.\nIn day trading, all three major averages ended lower after reports of weaker-than-expected cloud margins at Oracle fueled fresh concerns about AI. The declines marked the end of a seven-day long winning streak for both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC).\nMeanwhile, the government shutdown, now in its seventh day, continues to breed uncertainty. So far, no end to the gridlock in Washington is in sight with President Trump backing Republicans' stance that no negotiations will be made with Democrats on the healthcare subsidies they hope to extend until the government is reopened. At the same time, Trump has threatened to withhold back pay for furloughed Federal workers.\nLIVE 1 update"

                "body": "Advertisement|Remove ads.\nU.S. stocks appear on track to shake off Tuesday\u2019s losses, with the major index futures all trading higher late in the day. Uncertainty over the government shutdown persisted, with President Donald Trump considering mass layoffs as a means to rein in spending.\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) deal news flow and investments will likely provide an offsetting impact. A Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, stated that Nvidia would invest $2 billion in Elon Musk-led AI startup xAI as part of the latter\u2019s latest funding round.\nFund manager Louis Navellier shrugged off talks of an AI bubble burst like the one seen in 1999, reasoning that this time around, the players are huge companies with healthy balance sheets and strong cash flow.\nAs of 11 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.14% and 0.19%, respectively, and the Dow futures were up a more modest 0.10%. The Russell 2000 futures climbed 0.25%.\nThe S&P 500 Index snapped a seven-session winning streak on Tuesday as traders, using the ongoing shutdown and data showing rising inflation expectations, booked profits on recent gains. The Russell 2000 Index fell by the most (down 1.12%), dragged down by concerns about the trajectory of interest rates. Some heavily-weighted stocks, including Oracle (ORCL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), fell sharply, denting sentiment toward the tech sector.\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 Index, and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) slipped 0.37% and 0.53%, respectively. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) moved down 0.19%, while the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) slumped 1.07%.\nNavellier conceded that the market breadth and power need to improve overall, but he does not subscribe to the theory of a stock market bubble. The fund manager said traders can confidently invest in stocks as long as earnings estimates continue to move northward and the Fed keeps lowering rates.\nOn the economic front, the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September rate-setting meeting, in which the central bank resumed its cuts, will be released at 2 p.m. ET. Traders will likely sift through the report for cues on the Fed\u2019s future course of action. More Fed speakers will be in action on Wednesday, including St. Louis Fed\u2019s Alberto Musalem (9:20 p.m. ET), Fed Governor Michael Barr (9:30 p.m. ET and 5:45 p.m. ET), Minneapolis Neel Kashkari (3:15 p.m. ET), and Chicago Fed\u2019s Austan Goolsbee (7:15 p.m. ET).\nAZZ, Inc. (AZZ) is scheduled to report its financial results after the market closes.\nCrude oil extended its gains in Wednesday\u2019s Asian session, and gold futures are continuing their record run, with the yellow metal trading past the $4,000 psychological barrier. The U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield ticked up in the Asian session after slipping 3.5 basis points on Tuesday. The dollar has firmed up against most major currencies.\nMajor Asian markets traded mixed, with the Japanese, Indonesian, and New Zealand markets recording gains, while the Hong Kong and Taiwanese markets fell sharply. China and South Korea remained closed for public holidays.\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.\nRead Next: Intel Set To Unveil Panther Lake Mobile Chip Specs In Bid To Halt AMD Market Share Gains: Report"

However, that potential comeback will have to wait.\nBeckham revealed during an appearance on \"The Pivot\" on Tuesday that he is accepting a six-game suspension for a PED violation last season.

                "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Concerns about the fiscal outlook in Japan sent the yen to a more than seven month low against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday and political uncertainty in France dented the euro, with traders also focused on any signs of when the U.S. federal government will reopen.\nThe yen has tumbled since Sanae Takaichi's leadership victory in Japan on Saturday.\nTakaichi, who is expected to become Japan's next prime minister, has pledged to boost the Japanese economy with aggressive spending and has been critical of the Bank of Japan's interest rate hikes.\n\"There's going to be a period of time where [investors] try and figure out how exactly her policies will affect the currency,\" said Lou Brien, strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.\nMoney market traders are now pricing in a 26% chance that the BoJ will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on Oct. 30, down from around 60% before Takaichi's leadership victory.\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar was last up 1% to 151.86 and reached 151.93, the highest since Feb. 19.\nStill, some analysts said that the Bank of Japan is likely to continue hiking interest rates as it battles relatively high inflation.\n\"For this month, the BOJ will perhaps stay on hold just to be on the safe side but in December they'll get a bit more data and I think they'll deliver another hike,\" said Mohamad Al-Saraf, forex research associate at Danske Bank.\n\"Inflation is still too high, rates are still too low, and the case for another BOJ hike this year is still alive.\"\nJapan's finance minister said authorities were watching out for excessive moves in currency markets.\nThe euro remained on a fragile footing following the resignation of France's prime minister on Monday, adding to pressure on President Emmanuel Macron and putting fiscal consolidation in doubt.\nFrance is now likely to miss a deadline to present its 2026 budget bill, meaning lawmakers will need to pass emergency stopgap legislation to authorize spending from Jan. 1 until a full budget is approved.\nThe single currency was last down 0.43% at $1.1659.\nThe dollar index rose 0.46% to 98.57.\nThe U.S. currency has weakened this year on concerns about a deteriorating fiscal outlook, expectations of slowing growth and fears that President Donald Trump's tariff policies will scare investors away from U.S. assets.\nThat move has paused since the end of June with the greenback largely consolidating against most major peers, said DRW's Brien.\nBrien expects dollar weakness to resume, however, on a weakening labor market.\n\"The labor market here is weaker and will continue to be weaker than is generally appreciated. And not only will you get a likely very dovish Fed chair to replace [Jerome] Powell next year, but in between now and then I think Fed policy will probably be a little bit easier than is currently being priced in.\"\nSo far markets have largely shrugged off the government shutdown, however the longer it continues the more likely it will also hurt the greenback \"because you'll get a weaker economic performance,\" Brien said.\nTrump said on Tuesday that his administration plans to eliminate a number of government programs as a result of the ongoing shutdown, adding that he would provide details of job cuts within the next four or five days.\nThe shutdown delayed last Friday's closely watched monthly jobs report for September and is set to postpone other key releases until the government reopens.\nA New York Federal Reserve survey released on Tuesday found that Americans grew more worried about the future of the job market in September, while at the same time bumping up projections for the future path of near-term inflation.\nFed Gov. Stephen Miran on Tuesday said that he is more sanguine about others about the outlook for inflation and said the U.S. bond market's current relative calm supports a swift push to lower interest rates.\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 3.51% to $120,8601 after reaching a record $126,223.18 on Monday."
