                "body": "Gold prices will hit US$4,500 per ounce next year and stay there through 2027, according to CIBC Capital Markets. Analysts say worries about long-term inflation will push prices higher, following 2025's big rally for the precious metal.\nGold futures (GC=F) soared above US$4,000 per ounce for the first time earlier this week. In her latest forecast, CIBC Capital Markets analyst Anita Soni sees bullion rising to US$4,500 in 2026 and 2027, then falling to US$4,250 in 2028, and US$4,000 in 2029.\n(GC=F)\n\u201cWe continue to expect a positive macroeconomic setup for gold,\u201d she wrote in a research note published Thursday. \u201cWe anticipate tariff policy uncertainty will continue, and we believe the U.S. economy has not yet reflected the negative impact of the tariffs implemented to date, and those to come, on consumer purchasing power.\u201d\nAt the same time, Soni says the Federal Reserve gave in to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for rate cuts sooner than she expected, issuing its first reduction since December 2024 last month. CIBC says market expectations now sit at 50 basis points of additional rate cuts before year-end.\n\u201cFed chair Jerome Powell seemingly yielded to Trump\u2019s will to cut rates sooner rather than later, despite sticky inflation,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cWe believe that gold\u2019s ascent earlier this year was tied to rate cuts, but the recent parabolic shift is the result of longer-term inflation and wealth preservation concerns, given that the monetary guardrails of the Fed are not specifically focused on longer-term inflation.\u201d\nThe price of bullion has climbed about 50 per cent year-to-date, fuelled by a buffet of uncertainty that's recently included a U.S. government shutdown and political upheaval in France.\nGold\u2019s appeal to investors has also been boosted by Trump's trade war, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, elevated central bank buying, and general unease about the trajectory of the global economy.\nOn Monday, Goldman Sachs upped its gold price forecast for December 2026 to US$4,900 per ounce, from US$4,300. On Friday, the top executive at Canadian metals streaming company Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM.TO)(WPM) called for prices to hit US$5,000 within a year, in an interview with Bloomberg News.\nGold stocks have also seen a blistering run this year, driving the mining-heavy S&P/TSX Composite Index (^GSPTSE) to fresh records.\nCIBC Capital Markets says its large-cap top picks in the sector remain Agnico Eagle (AEM.TO)(AEM), Kinross Gold (K.TO), Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM.TO)(WPM), and Franco-Nevada (FNV.TO)(FNV)."

                "body": "Gold and bitcoin have traded to record highs as investors look for protection in what's typically a volatile October for the market.\nRising inflation and debt, a weakening U.S. dollar, the government shutdown, and Wall Street's newest buzz, the \"debasement trade,\" have all boosted assets beyond stocks and bonds.\n\"This whole debasement trade is benefiting gold,\" Amplify ETFs CEO Christian Magoon said on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week.\nThe Federal Reserve's battle with inflation and the mounting national debt have heightened investor concern about long-term currency stability. As of early October, the U.S. gross federal debt stands at around $3.7 trillion, according to Fiscal Data from the Treasury. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has declined roughly 8% since the beginning of the year.\nBoth gold and bitcoin are being treated as safe havens in a market shaped by inflation and policy risk. Gold first surged past $4,000 Tuesday, hitting an all-time high. The precious metal continues to rally as uncertainty fuels it. Bitcoin joined gold in the debasement trade as a digital alternative to traditional currencies. The cryptocurrency broke a little over $126,000 early this week, setting a new all-time high.\nThe so-called \"debasement trade\" is a bet that government borrowing and money printing will erode the value of the U.S. dollar, and is leading more investors to flock to safe-haven assets.\n\"Inflation is substantially above target and substantially above target in all forecasts for next year. It's part of the reason the dollar's depreciated,\" Citadel's CEO Ken Griffin told Bloomberg Monday. \"Gold is at record highs and the appreciation on other dollar substitutes ... in items like crypto, for example, is unbelievable.\"\nThe move has not come out of nowhere for gold. It has now bested the performance of all major U.S. equity market indexes year-to-date, and over the past one-year and three-year periods.\nGold continues to attract steady inflows, while silver has gained around 66% since the beginning of the year, with the precious metal surging to $50, an all-time high on Thursday.\n\"We see silver going from the high 40s to into the 60s over the next 12 months,\" Magoon said on \"ETF Edge.\"\n\"We're in the sixth year of limited supply and silver in the trends, from an industrial standpoint, are only getting more bullish for silver,\" he added.\nOctober is historically the most volatile month of the year on Wall Street, and Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's head of equity ETFs, says he's seeing many clients reposition their portfolios, shifting into global monetary alternatives. Jacobs told CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week some traders are seeking non-sovereign assets that behave differently than stocks and bonds, including gold, silver and cryptocurrencies. \"People are looking for assets that live outside of the traditional system. That can be a bit of a portfolio,\" Jacobs said.\nJacobs said SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) remain heavyweight options for gold exposure. Meanwhile, iShares Silver Trust (SLV) is a go-to for silver, and iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is seeing interest from those who want regular exposure.\nThe bitcoin ETF has recently also been besting the biggest U.S. equity ETFs in weekly flows.\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday he would own a combination of gold, cryptocurrencies and Nasdaq tech stocks between now and the end of the year, to take advantage of the rally fueled by the \"fear of missing out.\"\nJones shot to fame after he predicted and profited from the 1987 stock market crash.\n\"Bear markets are tough,\" Magoon said. \"This is a way to hide out or profit during times of uncertainty,\" Magoon said.\nBut he also added that \"often times, bull markets crawl up a 'wall of worry'. It seems like one of these 'wall of worries', that's going to dissipate, and we're going to have, I think a good fourth quarter.\"\nStocks turned sharply lower on Friday as a new risk presented itself amid the r"

                "body": "The recent decision by OPEC+ nations to slightly ease voluntary oil production cuts, effective November 2025, has introduced a fresh wave of uncertainty into the global energy landscape. This cautious unwinding of previous deeper cuts comes amidst a backdrop of shifting market fundamentals and growing concerns over a potential supply surplus, immediately impacting crude oil prices and setting a new trajectory for the commodity market. As the world grapples with energy transition goals and persistent geopolitical dynamics, OPEC+'s move underscores a delicate balancing act between stabilizing producer revenues and maintaining market share in an increasingly competitive environment.\nThis adjustment, made during a virtual meeting on October 5, 2025, arrives as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) prepares to release its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) on October 13, 2025, which is expected to offer further detailed insights into the market outlook. The market's initial reaction has been complex, with immediate price jumps followed by a more bearish sentiment, reflecting the intricate interplay of supply, demand, and speculative trading.\nOPEC+ Navigates a Shifting Supply-Demand Landscape\nThe core of the recent development lies in the agreement by eight key OPEC+ producers to collectively ease voluntary oil production cuts by a modest 137,000 barrels per day (bpd) starting November 2025. This decision marks a careful step towards gradually restoring output after the significant cuts implemented in April and November 2023. The participating countries, including major players like Saudi Arabia and Russia, justified the adjustment by citing a \"steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, including low inventory levels.\" For instance, both Saudi Arabia and Russia are slated to increase their output by 41,000 bpd each, bringing their required production for November 2025 to 10.061 million bpd and 9.532 million bpd, respectively.\nThis move comes as OPEC has maintained its global oil demand growth forecasts, projecting an increase of 1.4 million bpd in 2025 to reach a total consumption of 105.2 million bpd, followed by a similar rise in 2026 to 106.6 million bpd. This growth is primarily anticipated from non-OECD countries, with China, India, other Asian nations, the Middle East, and Latin America driving the bulk of the demand. However, this optimistic outlook contrasts with the International Energy Agency's (IEA) more conservative projections, which forecast slower oil demand growth. The group also reiterated its commitment to market stability and mandated compensation for any overproduced volumes since January 2024, specifically naming Iraq and Kazakhstan as primary overproducers. The next meeting of these eight nations is scheduled for November 2, 2025, to review compliance and market dynamics.\nThe immediate implications for crude oil prices have been notable. While initial reports saw Brent crude prices briefly jump, the sentiment quickly turned bearish. Brent crude has since traded below $65 per barrel, experiencing an approximately 8% decline in a week, largely influenced by concerns of a potential surge in OPEC+ production and an anticipated global supply surplus. Light crude oil futures settled at $61.50 as of October 2025. This downward pressure intensified, with crude oil prices falling to $58.79 USD/Bbl on October 10, 2025, representing a 4.44% decrease from the previous day and a significant 22.19% drop compared to the same time last year. WTI crude oil futures also experienced a commensurate decline, further exacerbated by easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly progress toward a Gaza ceasefire, which removed a key risk premium from prices.\nPublic Companies Brace for Volatility\nThe OPEC+ decision and the resulting market outlook are poised to create both winners and losers across the public energy sector.

                "body": "The recent decision by OPEC+ nations to slightly ease voluntary oil production cuts, effective November 2025, has introduced a fresh wave of uncertainty into the global energy landscape. This cautious unwinding of previous deeper cuts comes amidst a backdrop of shifting market fundamentals and growing concerns over a potential supply surplus, immediately impacting crude oil prices and setting a new trajectory for the commodity market. As the world grapples with energy transition goals and persistent geopolitical dynamics, OPEC+'s move underscores a delicate balancing act between stabilizing producer revenues and maintaining market share in an increasingly competitive environment.\nThis adjustment, made during a virtual meeting on October 5, 2025, arrives as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) prepares to release its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) on October 13, 2025, which is expected to offer further detailed insights into the market outlook. The market's initial reaction has been complex, with immediate price jumps followed by a more bearish sentiment, reflecting the intricate interplay of supply, demand, and speculative trading.\nOPEC+ Navigates a Shifting Supply-Demand Landscape\nThe core of the recent development lies in the agreement by eight key OPEC+ producers to collectively ease voluntary oil production cuts by a modest 137,000 barrels per day (bpd) starting November 2025. This decision marks a careful step towards gradually restoring output after the significant cuts implemented in April and November 2023. The participating countries, including major players like Saudi Arabia and Russia, justified the adjustment by citing a \"steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, including low inventory levels.\" For instance, both Saudi Arabia and Russia are slated to increase their output by 41,000 bpd each, bringing their required production for November 2025 to 10.061 million bpd and 9.532 million bpd, respectively.\nThis move comes as OPEC has maintained its global oil demand growth forecasts, projecting an increase of 1.4 million bpd in 2025 to reach a total consumption of 105.2 million bpd, followed by a similar rise in 2026 to 106.6 million bpd. This growth is primarily anticipated from non-OECD countries, with China, India, other Asian nations, the Middle East, and Latin America driving the bulk of the demand. However, this optimistic outlook contrasts with the International Energy Agency's (IEA) more conservative projections, which forecast slower oil demand growth. The group also reiterated its commitment to market stability and mandated compensation for any overproduced volumes since January 2024, specifically naming Iraq and Kazakhstan as primary overproducers. The next meeting of these eight nations is scheduled for November 2, 2025, to review compliance and market dynamics.\nThe immediate implications for crude oil prices have been notable. While initial reports saw Brent crude prices briefly jump, the sentiment quickly turned bearish. Brent crude has since traded below $65 per barrel, experiencing an approximately 8% decline in a week, largely influenced by concerns of a potential surge in OPEC+ production and an anticipated global supply surplus. Light crude oil futures settled at $61.50 as of October 2025. This downward pressure intensified, with crude oil prices falling to $58.79 USD/Bbl on October 10, 2025, representing a 4.44% decrease from the previous day and a significant 22.19% drop compared to the same time last year. WTI crude oil futures also experienced a commensurate decline, further exacerbated by easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly progress toward a Gaza ceasefire, which removed a key risk premium from prices.\nPublic Companies Brace for Volatility\nThe OPEC+ decision and the resulting market outlook are poised to create both winners and losers across the public energy sector.

                "body": "- EUR/USD forecast stays cautiously supported as trade war reignites\n- Trump cites recent hostile export controls on rare-earth minerals\n- Weak German data, French politics had held the euro back all week\nThe markets badly needed something to trigger a bit of volatility and it looked like nothing was to happen heading towards the weekend. But then, bam! Judging by market\u2019s reaction to a lengthy social media post by Donald Trump, it looks like the trade war has officially re-started with China. Trump threatened a \"massive increase of tariffs\" on China, pointing to the recent hostile export controls on rare-earth minerals. The news triggered a plunge in stock markets and crude oil prices, while the dollar nosedived against the yen but rallied against the more risk sensitive commodity dollars like the Aussie. The euro, which had outperformed during the height of the trade war earlier this year, before everything bottoming in April, again showed strength, causing the EUR/USD to climb back above 1.1600 handle. Heading into the week ahead, the EUR/USD forecast will be in spotlight as traders watch trade war developments.\nHas the trade war restarted?\nApparently, China has sent letters worldwide signalling its intent to impose export controls on rare earths and other production elements, even those not manufactured in China. This has angered the US and other countries, in a move Trump described as China planning to build a monopoly over rare earths and magnets, holding the world \u201ccaptive.\u201d Trump added that the US also holds stronger monopoly positions in other areas, which haven\u2019t been used, but now may be deployed in response to China\u2019s move.\nFrench political and Eurozone economic uncertainties\nThe EUR/USD forecast had turned bullish after the recent run of weak US data releases, but during the past couple of weeks the pair slipped below a few short-term support levels as it felt the weight of weak German data and lingering political instability in France. Meanwhile, the dollar\u2019s renewed strength during the government shutdown also added some pressure. Even so, the greenback\u2019s recovery appears overdone, with short-term rate differentials no longer fully justifying current levels. Some consolidation is possible, but sustained gains from here may be difficult unless new catalysts emerge. The resumption of the trade war should be net negative for the dollar, as was the case earlier this year.\nECB\u2019s policy stance should provide support for EUR/USD forecast\nThe European Central Bank\u2019s rate cutting cycle is potentially over, although if incoming data weakens again then we may see another cut in the coming meetings. According to the minutes of the central bank\u2019s September meeting, the ECB still sees inflation risks as balanced but leaning slightly to the downside. Several members flagged the risk of undershooting, while only a few warned about possible overshoots. The hawks will be watching the trade developments closely, as the potential for more tariffs from the US could reignite global inflation worries. Still, the ECB has left the door open to react swiftly if the macro backdrop shifts, as you would expect.\nMacron set to nominate new French prime minister\nThe political turmoil in France held the euro back and while markets await the appointment of a new prime minister, uncertainty is not going to go away quickly. While outgoing PM Lecornu\u2019s pledge to meet budget commitments have for the time being calmed some nerves, concerns about fiscal discipline won\u2019t go away with the appointment of the new PM. Still, the announcement of a new leader could offer a brief reprieve for the euro, but without deeper reforms or stronger political cohesion, any relief may prove temporary.\nUS CPI to be release on October 24\nMeanwhile, across the Atlantic, the US government shutdown continues with no resolution in sight. Ironically, this may be doing the dollar a favour \u2014 fewer economic releases mean fewer chances for weak data to dent sentiment. Reports sug"

                "body": "The EUR/USD pair saw a recovery, climbing above 1.1600 due to a plunge in the US Dollar amid growing trade tensions between the US and China. This move followed four days of declines for the Euro and came despite political uncertainties in France and weak Eurozone economic data.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron reappointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as Prime Minister, ending recent political chaos. Macron vowed to address France\u2019s budget issues and general instability, which had affected confidence in the Euro.\nUs Dollar Weakens Amid Trade Tensions\nThe US Dollar weakened after renewed threats from Trump concerning tariffs on China. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment in the US remained steady, with inflation expectations showing slight changes. The US Dollar Index dropped by 0.52% to 98.87.\nEUR/USD was impacted by the Federal Reserve\u2019s stance, with markets anticipating a 25-basis-point rate cut. The pair\u2019s technical indicators show immediate support at 1.1550 and potential resistance at 1.1650.\nThe Euro is influenced by factors like inflation data, economic performance, and trade balance. High inflation often leads to adjustments in interest rates by the ECB, while strong economic indicators and a positive trade balance typically boost the Euro\u2019s value.\nChristian Borjon Valencia, a retail trader since 2010, specialises in technical analysis.\nGiven the sharp selloff in the US Dollar, we see an opportunity in the coming weeks centered on continued dollar weakness. The renewed threat of massive tariffs against China is a significant driver, creating uncertainty around the US economic outlook. This environment suggests that positions benefiting from a falling dollar, like long EUR/USD positions, are becoming more attractive.\nThe market has almost completely priced in a Federal Reserve rate cut for the October 29th meeting, with odds sitting at 94%. This expectation is the primary force weighing on the dollar, a trend we\u2019ve seen build over the last few weeks. As derivative traders, this means we should be prepared for volatility around the announcement, but the path of least resistance for the dollar appears to be downwards leading into the meeting.\nImpact Of Government Shutdown\nAdding to the dollar\u2019s woes is the ongoing US government shutdown, which historical data shows can directly impact economic growth. We saw this back in the 2018-2019 shutdown, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated trimmed GDP by about 0.2% in the first quarter of 2019. Any similar drag on the economy today only strengthens the case for the Fed to cut rates, further pressuring the dollar.\nOn the Euro side, caution is warranted as gains seem limited by underlying weakness within the Eurozone. The recent political relief in France is positive, but it doesn\u2019t erase the fundamental challenges facing the bloc\u2019s economy. Recent data showed German manufacturing PMI, a key indicator for the region, fell to 48.5, signaling a contraction that will likely keep the European Central Bank from pursuing any aggressive policy.\nThis mixed picture suggests that while being long EUR/USD is the straightforward trade, using options could be a more prudent approach to manage risk. For instance, buying EUR/USD call options allows us to capitalize on potential upside while limiting our downside risk if Eurozone data worsens unexpectedly. This strategy seems especially relevant as the pair struggles to break and hold key resistance levels.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the EUR/USD is attempting to stabilize after falling below its 100-day moving average. The fading selling pressure, indicated by the RSI moving towards neutral, supports the idea that the pair may consolidate or drift higher. We are watching the 1.1650 level as the first major resistance, and a break above it could open the door for a move toward 1.1700 ahead of the Fed\u2019s decision."

The pair is trading right above 1.1560 at the time of writing, down from session highs near 1.1590. The common currency has lost over 1.4% so far this week and is on track for its worst weekly performance this year, with all eyes on the US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which is expected to show a further deterioration.\nPolitical uncertainty in France has hammered the Euro this week, after the French Prime Minister (PM), S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, resigned unexpectedly. The market is now awaiting President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a new one, who will face the same challenges as the previous five PMs to approve a tightening budget, amid fierce opposition within the parliament.\nThe US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, is drawing support from concerns about France and similar worries in Japan, as the pro-stimulus new President of the Liberal Democratic Party Sanae Takaichi emerges as the likely next Prime Minister. With the release of most US economic indicators delayed due to the US government shutdown, recent dovish comments from Fed policymakers have failed to dent USD strength.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the British Pound.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily digest market movers: US Dollar reigns amid political uncertainty\n- The US Dollar has outperformed its peers this week. The USD Index (DXY), which measures the value of the Dollar against six major currencies, has rallied nearly 1.7% this week so far and is set for its best weekly performance in the year to date. The political impasse in France and concerns that the new Japanese cabinet might hamper the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) tightening plans have triggered a rush for safety this week, boosting speculative demand for the Greenback.\n- In France, President Macron is expected to name his sixth Prime Minister within the next 24 hours, to avert the opposition's demands for parliamentary elections. The market, however, remains sceptical about his chances of approving a new budget, amid a deeply divided parliament.\n- On Thursday, the European Central Bank's September Monetary Policy Meeting Accounts revealed an increasing concern about the uncertain global context, although policymakers considered that there is no immediate pressure to change the bank's policy. Regarding inflation, the committee has shown some divergence, with some members observing upside risks while others see price pressures abating. The impact of the accounts on the Euro was marginal.\n- San Francisco Fed President, Mary Daly, has called for further rate cuts in the coming months amid a \"worrisome\" deterioration of the US labour market.\n- Later on Friday, the preliminary US University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index will provide one of the few data releases since the government's shutdown. The survey is expected to show a further deterioration in consumers' confidence, with the index dropping for the third consecutive month to 54.2 in October from September's 55.1.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD remains vulnerable below 1.1600\nEUR/USD broke a key support area at 1.1600 on Thursday, dropping to fresh two-mo"

Despite dovish remarks from Federal Reserve officials, GBP/USD remains vulnerable due to USD\u2019s strong safe-haven demand following developments in Japan and France.\nThe US Dollar Index clings to gains near a two-month high of 99.56. Traders expect an 81.5% chance of the Fed cutting interest rates by 50 basis points to 3.50%-3.75% by year-end, as indicated by the CME FedWatch tool.\nFed Members Express Differing Views\nFed members express differing views: some suggest further rate cuts, while others advise caution due to persistent inflation risks. UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is anticipated to announce tax increases in November, which concerns financial markets as it may dampen household sentiment.\nThe UK labour market\u2019s latest data, released on Tuesday, will be significant in assessing economic conditions. The Pound Sterling faces technical challenges, with its decline to the 200-day Exponential Moving Average and potential support at 1.3140.\nThe upcoming Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index values can influence USD\u2019s strength, reflecting consumer willingness to spend. While the survey is a reliable economic indicator, actual figures surpassing consensus generally boost the US Dollar.\nMarket Showing Strong Bearish Sentiment\nWe are seeing Pound Sterling test a critical technical level around 1.3280 against the US Dollar, which lines up with its 200-day moving average. The market is showing a strong bearish sentiment, suggesting that a breakdown below this point could trigger further selling. This makes it a crucial time to consider strategies that profit from downside moves.\nThe main weight on the Pound comes from expectations of tax hikes in the UK\u2019s Autumn Statement late next month. With the UK\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio recently reported by the Office for National Statistics to be holding above 104%, we believe the government has little choice but to increase fiscal tightening. This prospect is dampening economic sentiment and suggests any strength in the Pound will be temporary.\nOn the other side, the US Dollar is strong for now, but the Federal Reserve is clearly signaling rate cuts before the end of the year. Recent US jobs data from last week showed the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2%, giving dovish Fed members more reason to push for cuts. This conflict between short-term dollar strength and a longer-term dovish outlook creates significant uncertainty.\nGiven this setup, derivative traders should consider buying GBP/USD put options with expirations after the late November Autumn Statement. This provides a way to profit from a potential drop in Sterling while capping risk if the market suddenly reverses. A strike price below the 1.3200 level would offer a good risk-reward profile if the current support at 1.3280 fails.\nWe only need to look back to the market chaos following the UK\u2019s \u201cmini-budget\u201d in 2022 to understand how sensitive the Pound is to fiscal policy surprises. That event showed how quickly currency markets can punish what they see as unsustainable fiscal plans. This history makes holding downside protection through derivatives a prudent strategy ahead of another major fiscal announcement.\nIn the immediate term today, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index will be a key focus. A weaker-than-expected number would reinforce the view that the Fed needs to cut rates soon, which could weaken the dollar and provide a temporary bounce for the GBP/USD pair. Traders could use such a bounce as a better entry point to establish bearish positions."

Fiscal pressures in the U.K. remain a central driver of this weakness, as investors brace for the Autumn Statement in November, where Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce new tax increases aimed at offsetting the widening public deficit. Market sentiment turned sharply risk-off as concerns grew that further fiscal tightening could choke economic momentum already strained by stagnant productivity and weak consumption.\nRecent data showed U.K. GDP contracting by 0.1% in Q3, highlighting the fragility of the recovery. Meanwhile, inflation eased modestly to 2.8% in September, but wage growth remains elevated, forcing the Bank of England (BoE) to maintain its restrictive stance for longer. BoE policymaker Catherine Mann reinforced that view, emphasizing that \u201chigh inflation itself is behind scarring, income uncertainty, and weak consumption growth,\u201d confirming that monetary policy will stay tight to ensure price stability.\nU.S. Dollar Strength Anchored by Safe-Haven Demand and Labor Market Resilience\nThe U.S. dollar index (DXY) held near 99.56, a two-month high, supported by strong safe-haven demand amid political uncertainty in France and Japan and an unresolved U.S. government shutdown now entering its ninth day. Despite dovish expectations for further Federal Reserve rate cuts before year-end, investors continue to prefer the greenback due to its relative macro stability.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are pricing an 80% probability of a 50-basis-point cut by December, but the Fed remains cautious. Officials John Williams and Mary Daly acknowledged that the current monetary stance is restrictive, while Governor Michael Barr warned against \u201cexcessive easing\u201d given that inflation remains unlikely to return to the 2% target within two years.\nOn the data front, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index slipped slightly to 55.0 in October from 55.1 in September, still better than expectations of 54.2. The mixed macro picture allows the Fed to justify a controlled easing path while maintaining dollar dominance as global investors retreat from risk-sensitive assets.\nTechnical Breakdown Confirms Sterling\u2019s Bearish Momentum\nFrom a technical perspective, GBP/USD broke decisively below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) near 1.3300, extending its decline toward key support at 1.3280. Momentum indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 36, show persistent bearish pressure without signaling oversold exhaustion. The 50-day EMA also turned downward, confirming a medium-term trend reversal since the September high of 1.3620.\nAnalysts at UOB Group noted that the sharp drop has increased downside momentum, projecting potential extensions toward 1.3245 in the short term and 1.3200 as the next key target if bearish momentum persists. Minor resistance stands at 1.3330, with stronger selling interest around 1.3410. Unless Sterling reclaims the 1.3460\u20131.3500 zone, the directional bias remains decisively negative.\nMacro Divergence Between BoE and Fed Keeps Sterling Under Pressure\nThe divergence in monetary outlook between the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve remains the primary macro catalyst driving GBP/USD weakness. While both central banks are expected to ease policy into 2026, the Fed\u2019s stronger labor market and deeper capital markets have allowed it to maintain a yield advantage. U.S."

According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders see an 81.5% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) in each of its remaining two monetary policy meetings this year.\nAdditionally, Fed officials are also arguing in favour of extending the monetary expansion cycle amid growing labour market risks. \"We\u2019re to a point now where the softening in the labor market looks like it could be more worrisome if we don\u2019t risk manage it, San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly said on Thursday, Reuters reported.\nIn Friday\u2019s session, investors will focus on the preliminary Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and Consumer Inflation Expectations data for October, which will be published at 14:00 GMT. The Consumer Sentiment Index is expected to have deteriorated to 54.2 from 55.1 in September.\nGoing forward, the next trigger for the Australian Dollar (AUD) will be the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes for the September policy meeting, which will be released on Tuesday.

The questions cover three broad areas: personal finances, business conditions and buying conditions. The data shows a picture of whether or not consumers are willing to spend money, a key factor as consumer spending is a major driver of the US economy. The University of Michigan survey has proven to be an accurate indicator of the future course of the US economy. The survey publishes a preliminary, mid-month reading and a final print at the end of the month. Generally, a high reading is bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is bearish.\nRead more.Next release: Fri Oct 10, 2025 14:00 (Prel)\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 54.2\nPrevious: 55.1\nSource: University of Michigan\nConsumer exuberance can translate into greater spending and faster economic growth, implying a stronger labor market and a potential pick-up in inflation, helping turn the Fed hawkish. This survey\u2019s popularity among analysts (mentioned more frequently than CB Consumer Confidence) is justified because the data here includes interviews conducted up to a day or two before the official release, making it a timely measure of consumer mood, but foremost because it gauges consumer attitudes on financial and income situations.

The AUD/USD pair gained ground following the cautious remarks from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Michele Bullock.\nRBA Governor Bullock stated on Friday that services inflation remains somewhat sticky. Bullock noted that second-quarter inflation came in slightly above expectations but is moving in the right direction. She emphasized the need for caution, given the volatility of the monthly CPI data, and added that the labor market remains somewhat tight but may be nearing balance.\nAustralia\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations for October rose to 4.8% from 4.7% prior, marking the highest reading since June. The mounting concerns that Australia\u2019s inflation may exceed forecasts in the third quarter support the cautious stance surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia. Traders expect Australia\u2019s central bank to maintain its interest rates after deciding to keep its Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 3.6% in September.\nAustralian Dollar declines despite a weaker US Dollar\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is holding losses after a four-day winning streak and trading around 99.30 at the time of writing. The US Senate remained deadlocked on legislation to end the government shutdown on Friday.\n- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes from the September meeting suggested policymakers are leaning toward further rate cuts this year. The majority of policymakers supported the September rate cut and signaled further reduction later this year. However, some members favored a more cautious approach, citing concerns about inflation.\n- The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in a 95% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and an 82% possibility of another reduction in December.\n- Federal Reserve (Fed) Board of Governors member Stephen Miran expressed his belief on Tuesday that inflation itself is simply a cause of \"population increases\". Monetary policy needs to ease to get ahead of the shift down in the neutral rate, Miran added.\n- Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari struck a more reserved tone than some of his Fed counterparts on Tuesday, cautioning that it's still too soon to be able to tell if tariff-led inflation will be \"sticky\" or not. However, Kashkari noted that he's particularly bullish on the labor market and is expecting a return to form for American job creation, which has sputtered recently.\n- Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid delivered hawkish remarks on Monday, saying that the Fed must maintain its inflation credibility and stressed that inflation is too high. Schmid added that monetary policy is appropriately calibrated.\n- China's Commerce Ministry announced on Thursday that the country will tighten rules on rare earth exports, effective December 1. Foreign businesses and individuals must obtain a dual-use items export license for rare earth exports.\n- Private house approvals in Australia declined by 2.6% month-over-month (MoM) to 9,027 units in August, as expected, and reversing a 1.3% rise in the previous month. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted Building Permits fell by 6% MoM to 14,744 units, following a 10% decrease previously, marking the second consecutive monthly decline.\n- University of Melbourne reported on Tuesday that Australia\u2019s Westpac Consumer Confidence declined 3.5% month-over-month (MoM) to 92.1 in October, a sharper decline than the previous 3.1% fall, marking the fastest drop since April.

The pair then eased as Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato warned against \u201cexcessive\u201d FX moves. Price now pivots around 153.00 with first support stacked at 152.60\u2013152.55 and the psychological 152.00. Momentum remains USD-positive while spot holds above that 152.00 break point; a close back below 152.00 would open 151.00 and the post-gap magnet toward 150.00, with a deeper hole to fill near 147.50 if risk aversion flips to outright liquidation. On the topside, layered offers sit near 153.70\u2013153.75, then 154.00, with acceleration risk toward 154.70\u2013154.80 (February 11 swing high) and the round 155.00 if those give way.\nMacro fuel: why USD/JPY still trends higher even as RSI flashes \u2018hot\u2019\nThe bull case is simple math. The US Dollar Index (DXY) set a fresh two-month high as haven demand built around Japan and France, and despite traders still penciling in two Fed cuts before year-end. Meanwhile, Japan\u2019s inflation has run at or above the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target for more than three years, growth logged a fifth straight quarter in Q2, and yet the BoJ\u2019s policy rate remains barely positive. That rate gap continues to tax the Yen, so momentum buyers keep leaning long USD/JPY on dips. Technically, the daily RSI is stretched, so near-term pullbacks are probable rather than fatal to trend. The four-hour 20-period moving average near 152.20 is the first test; a hold there would tell you the grind higher is intact.\nPolitics is a catalyst, not a cure: what Komeito\u2019s exit and Takaichi\u2019s win mean for USD/JPY\nTwo headlines mattered for Yen traders. First, NHK reported Komeito will quit the LDP-led coalition, injecting fresh uncertainty into the handover to LDP chief Sanae Takaichi. Second, Takaichi\u2019s platform implies aggressive fiscal outlays in the Abe tradition. Bigger deficits and delayed BoJ normalization are Yen-negative in isolation. Her advisors have floated tolerance for a BoJ hike in December or January, but markets hear \u201clater, not now,\u201d which sustains USD/JPY strength. The wrinkle is that Takaichi also said she does not want an \u201cexcessively\u201d weak currency, which invites faster jawboning if spot sprints toward 155.00 and beyond.\nBoJ path: one hike in sight, not a hiking cycle\nProducer Prices rose 0.3% m/m in September after a 0.2% drop in August, a modest push toward pass-through and a case for a December tweak. Average cash earnings growth slowed to 1.5% y/y from 3.4%, keeping the BoJ cautious about declaring victory on wages. Private consumption is ~55% of GDP; without broader wage momentum, the BoJ is more likely to move once and pause. That keeps rate differentials wide and Yen rallies shallow unless accompanied by official action.\nWashington watch: shutdown optics, Michigan sentiment, and Fed speakers set the tape\nEven with a government shutdown extending into a second week, USD strength persisted. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment printed 55.0 versus a 54.2 consensus and 55.1 prior\u2014hardly a collapse\u2014while 1-year inflation expectations eased to 4.6% from 4.7% and 5-year held at 3.7%. That mix doesn\u2019t force an urgent Fed pivot. Speeches from FOMC members (Daly, Musalem) matter at the margin; anything that leans less dovish than markets expect would re-steepen rate spreads and support a retest of 154.00\u2013155.00 in USD/JPY.\nIntervention risk: where the Ministry of Finance\u2019s line likely sits\nKato\u2019s comments capped intraday momentum and helped drag spot off its highs, but the market\u2019s working assumption is that verbal intervention begins in the low-to-mid 150s and hard action risks rise if disorderly trade drives USD/JPY toward 158\u2013160.

Japan\u2019s ruling coalition fell apart today after Komeito, the junior partner to Sanae Takaichi\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party, indicated it planned to pull out of the partnership. The loss of Komeito support mean Takaichi will face significant constraints to push ahead with her fiscally profligate pledges, BBH FX analysts report.\nUSD/JPY rally outpaces previous BOJ FX interventions\n\"Moreover, Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato warned against 'one-sided and rapid movements' in the yen and reiterated 'The government will carefully assess any excessive or disorderly movements in the market.' The comment suggests USD/JPY is nearing levels that could trigger official intervention, under 155.00.\"\n\"USD/JPY is up 4.6% in 10 days, which puts it ahead of the pace seen in the last two Bank of Japan (BOJ) FX interventions. The BOJ bought \u00a59.79 trillion from April 26, 2024 through May 29, 2024 after USD/JPY rallied by 5.7% in 20 days. And, the BOJ bought \u00a55.53 trillion from June 27, 2024 through July 29, 2024 after USD/JPY rallied by 4.2% in 30 days.\"\n\"Meanwhile, the growing disconnect between USD/JPY and US-Japan bond yields spreads points to heightened risk of a sharp USD/JPY pullback.

Of note, Canada\u2019s CPI report is set for release on October 21, and it very well may tip the scales one way or another for the BOC, with clear implications for USD/CAD.\nCanadian Dollar Technical Analysis: USD/CAD Daily Chart\nSource: StoneX, TradingView\nTurning our attention to the chart, USD/CAD saw an immediate reversal of yesterday\u2019s bullish momentum. As we go to press, the North American pair is trading back below the psychologically-significant 1.40 handle after stalling out near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the H1 fall.\nFor the rest of the day, traders will remain laser-focused on the 200-day MA around 1.3975. If bulls are able to defend that key long-term trend indicator, despite the strong jobs figure, it would suggest that this week\u2019s bullish momentum remains resilient and that USD/CAD could rally toward 1.4100 or the 50% retracement closer to 1.4160 in the coming weeks. On the other hand, a close below the 200-day MA would favor a return to the recent consolidation below 1.40 as traders wait for more clarity from the BOC.\n-- Written by Matt Weller, Global Head of Research\nCheck out Matt\u2019s Daily Market Update videos on YouTube and be sure to follow Matt on Twitter: @MWellerFX"

                "body": "The Canadian Dollar (CAD) has experienced a tumultuous period over the past year, grappling with a complex web of global economic shifts, diverging monetary policies, and a notable weakening of its traditional correlation with commodity prices, particularly oil. As of October 10, 2025, the loonie has once again softened against the US Dollar, falling past the 1.400 mark and reaching its lowest level since May 2025. This recent dip underscores a broader trend where the CAD's value is increasingly influenced by factors beyond its rich natural resource endowment, signaling a new era of volatility for Canada's currency.\nThe immediate implications are significant for Canada's trade balance, import costs, and the profitability of various sectors. While a weaker CAD can boost exports by making Canadian goods cheaper abroad, it simultaneously raises the cost of imports, potentially fueling domestic inflation. Investors and businesses are keenly observing whether the Bank of Canada (BoC) will intervene further or if global economic forces will continue to dictate the loonie's trajectory, especially as the currency's sensitivity to interest rate differentials and broader geopolitical tensions appears to overshadow its historical ties to the commodity supercycle.\nA Year of Swings: Unpacking the CAD's Journey Through 2025\nThe period between late 2024 and October 2025 has been a rollercoaster for the Canadian Dollar, characterized by sharp declines, a significant rebound, and a recent softening. After losing approximately 8% of its value against the US Dollar (USD) in 2024, dropping from C$1.33 to C$1.44, the CAD continued its descent into early 2025, hitting its weakest point at C$1.46 against the USD by February. This depreciation was largely attributed to a widening interest rate differential as the Bank of Canada (BoC) embarked on an easing cycle earlier and more aggressively than the US Federal Reserve, cutting its policy rate from 4.75% in April 2024 to 2.50% by September 2025.\nHowever, the loonie staged a remarkable recovery in the first half of 2025, strengthening to C$1.36 by July 8, 2025, and settling around C$1.38574 by September 9, 2025. This resurgence was primarily fueled by a depreciation of the US Dollar, as investor concerns over the health of the US economy prompted a shift away from US assets. This period highlighted the CAD's increasing susceptibility to global risk sentiment and the relative performance of other major currencies.\nAs of October 10, 2025, the CAD has once again found itself under pressure, falling past 1.400 per US dollar. Over the preceding month, the CAD weakened by 1.15% against the USD and by 1.67% over the past 12 months. Against the Euro (EUR), the CAD fluctuated significantly, moving from a minimum of 1.4561 in November 2024 to a maximum of 1.6387 in early October 2025. Key players involved in these movements include the Bank of Canada, whose monetary policy decisions have a direct impact on interest rate differentials, and global commodity markets, which, despite a weakening correlation, still play a role in Canada's economic narrative. Initial market reactions to these fluctuations have been a mix of caution and strategic adjustments, as traders and investors recalibrate their expectations for Canada's economic outlook.\nThe commodity landscape during this period presented a mixed picture. Oil prices, historically a strong determinant of the CAD's value, experienced significant decline and volatility. Brent crude prices notably fell to $60 per barrel in early May 2025, influenced by concerns about a potential trade war, robust non-OPEC+ production, and the unwinding of OPEC+ supply cuts. While geopolitical events, such as Israel's attack on Iranian installations in June 2025, caused temporary spikes, by October 10, 2025, Brent crude was around $63 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices followed a similar trend, closing at $60.70. This decline in oil prices, combined with the CAD"

The Unemployment Rate remained unchanged at 7.1%, beating expectations for a rise to 7.2%, while Average Hourly Wages grew 3.6% YoY, matching August\u2019s pace.\nWhile wage growth remains moderate, the improvement in labour market conditions reduces the urgency for the Bank of Canada (BoC) to cut rates further this month. According to swap market data, traders now price a 57% probability of an October rate cut, down from around 72% before the data. However, markets still fully expect a 25-basis-point (bps) reduction in interest rates by year-end.\nMeanwhile, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil extends losses on Friday, slipping below the $60.00 mark and hovering near a four-month low, down more than 2% on the day. The decline in Oil prices could limit further gains for the Loonie, given Canada\u2019s status as a major crude exporter.\nThe Loonie also draws some support as the Greenback\u2019s rally cools, with the US Dollar Index (DXY) trading slightly weaker around 99.35. Despite holding near two-month highs, the index appears to be consolidating after a strong week and remains on track for its biggest weekly advance of the year.\nCanadian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Canadian Dollar (CAD) against listed major currencies today.

The cryptocurrency's lowest valuation of the day was US$119,967, and its highest was US$123,548.\nBitcoin price performance, October 10, 2025.\nChart via TradingView\nBitcoin may be trading near record highs, but one of its most respected on-chain indicators suggests the rally could still have significant room to run possibly as far as US$180,000.\nThe Mayer Multiple, a long-term metric that compares Bitcoin\u2019s current price to its 200-week moving average, remains well below levels that have historically marked market tops.\n\u201cBitcoin is at all-time highs and the Mayer Multiple is ice cold,\u201d crypto analyst Frank Fetter wrote on X (formerly Twitter). According to Fetter, Bitcoin would need to climb to around US$180,000 before the indicator flashes \u201coverbought\u201d conditions, implying that the current cycle could still have room to expand.\nThe indicator\u2019s historical context adds weight to that view. During Bitcoin\u2019s 2017 and 2021 peaks, the Mayer Multiple surged well above 2.4, signaling excessive market exuberance before major corrections followed.\nThis time, the pattern looks different. The Multiple\u2019s highest level in the current cycle\u20141.84 in March 2024, when Bitcoin neared US$72,000\u2014never approached prior extremes, according to Glassnode data. Analysts see this moderation as a sign of a more sustainable advance.\nDespite these encouraging on-chain signals, not everyone is convinced the path higher will be smooth. Short-term traders remain divided on whether Bitcoin can maintain momentum into the final quarter of the year.\nTrader Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d Severino argued that Bitcoin may be entering a decisive 100-day window. Writing on X, Severino pointed to the Bollinger Bands indicator on Bitcoin\u2019s weekly chart, which has tightened to levels not seen before. He noted that Bitcoin\u2019s recent inability to hold above US$126,000, after briefly testing the upper band, could signal a short-term pullback before any sustained breakout.\nEther (ETH) also slid after last week's rally, but has since recovered some of its losses. It was up by 0.7 percent over 24 hours to US$4,365.58. Ether's lowest valuation on Friday was US$4,285.77, and its highest was US$4,401.99.\nAltcoin price update\n- Solana (SOL) was priced at US$222.58, an increase of 1.1 percent over the last 24 hours and its highest valuation of the day. Its lowest valuation on Friday was US$217.57.\n- XRP was trading for US$2.83, trading flat over the last 24 hours. Its lowest valuation of the day was US$2.78, and its highest was US$2.84.\nDerivatives trends\nThe crypto derivatives market saw heavy liquidations over the past 24 hours, totaling roughly US$674 million, according to Coinglass data. Long positions accounted for US$505 million of that amount, while short positions made up US$169 million, marking one of October\u2019s sharpest liquidation waves.\nAmong major assets, Bitcoin long liquidations reached US$116 million, compared to US$68.22 million in shorts, indicating that overleveraged bullish traders bore the brunt of the latest downturn. Ether long positions were liquidated for US$146 million, against US$34.54 million in shorts, reflecting a similar shakeout of optimistic bets amid heightened volatility.\nDespite the sell-off, futures open interest for Bitcoin rose 0.23 percent in the last four hours to US$90.19 billion, suggesting that traders are gradually re-entering positions or maintaining leverage at elevated levels.\nEther futures open interest also ticked up 0.22 percent to US$59.53 bill"

After another $4 billion streak of inflows this week, IBIT now holds more than 800,000 BTC, worth roughly $98 billion, and is within striking distance of a milestone that no ETF has ever reached this quickly.\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate IBIT now generates over $240 million a year in revenue from its 0.25% fee, making it BlackRock\u2019s most profitable product across its global lineup of more than 1,000 ETFs. That\u2019s a stunning outcome for a fund launched less than two years ago and one that has already redefined what \u201cmainstream adoption\u201d looks like for Bitcoin.\nIBIT\u2019s scale is unmatched. According to Bloomberg data, the fund has taken in $37 billion in its first year and another $26 billion so far in 2025. With more than $70 billion in assets ahead of its nearest competitor, BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin fund has effectively consolidated Wall Street\u2019s control of the crypto ETF landscape. Farside data shows total spot Bitcoin ETF holdings now exceed 1.3 million BTC, with IBIT accounting for more than 60% of that supply.\nThe growth has been powered by a feedback loop of price and inflows. Bitcoin reached a new ATH of $125,000 over the weekend, extending a 70% rally since Donald Trump\u2019s election win in November. His administration\u2019s push for broader crypto integration, including friendlier custody and ETF frameworks, has unlocked a wave of institutional demand that mirrors the early days of the gold ETF boom two decades ago. Every uptick in price brings in fresh money from allocators eager to gain exposure without dealing with wallets or private keys.\nBalchunas and Seyffart noted that IBIT is on track to hit $100 billion in assets about five times faster than any ETF in history, a record that puts it in a league of its own. The world\u2019s largest ETFs (SPY, QQQ, VOO) all took years to cross that threshold. IBIT could do it in under 24 months. \u201cThe fact that IBIT is now BlackRock\u2019s most profitable product is extremely impressive,\u201d Seyffart told Bloomberg, recalling that even their \u201cmost bullish expectations\u201d have been surpassed.\nBehind the scenes, this surge reflects both marketing muscle and timing. BlackRock used its retail distribution network and institutional relationships to channel demand into a single flagship product. According to Kaiko\u2019s Adam Morgan McCarthy, the \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative gained new traction earlier this year, especially after the US tariff announcement in April triggered a rush into perceived inflation hedges.\nETF data supports that view. Over the past two weeks alone, IBIT added nearly $4 billion in net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors, bringing its Bitcoin balance above 800,000 BTC. That\u2019s roughly 4% of the entire Bitcoin supply and more than what MicroStrategy and the next nine largest corporate holders combined possess. At its current growth rate, IBIT could soon hold one out of every 20 Bitcoin ever mined: an unprecedented concentration of BTC in a regulated product.\nBlackRock has declined to comment publicly, but the message to competitors is clear: scale wins. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, the second-largest spot ETF, remains roughly $70 billion smaller. Even if the rest of the market sees healthy inflows, the center of gravity is now fixed around one ticker. IBIT\u2019s rise has turned Bitcoin into a fully financialized asset: not just a hedge or an experiment, but a cornerstone product of the world\u2019s biggest asset manager.\nWhether that\u2019s bullish or concerning depends on perspective. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization was built on independence from institutions. Yet the market now finds itself cheering a fund whose success depends on them.

                "body": "Weekly Crypto Regs Roundup: SEC Mulls Innovation Exemption, Lummis Backs Bitcoin Tax Break\nThe crypto regulation environment for digital assets in the U.S. is evolving rapidly, with policymakers balancing technological development and investor protection ahead of the 2026 election cycle.\nThis week\u2019s developments mark a major shift toward mainstreaming crypto within traditional finance\u2014from Washington\u2019s proposed \u201cinnovation exemption\u201d for blockchain startups to North Dakota\u2019s state-backed stablecoin and Senator Cynthia Lummis\u2019s renewed push for tax reform on everyday Bitcoin use.\nSEC Eyes \u201cInnovation Exemption\u201d to Keep Builders Onshore\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins confirmed that the agency is finalizing an \u201cinnovation exemption\u201d framework intended to support crypto firms experimenting with blockchain applications inside the United States.\nThe measure, expected by the end of 2025, would offer a regulated sandbox for blockchain startups, allowing them to test products under limited oversight rather than relocating to friendlier jurisdictions.\n\u201cAtkins said this remains a top priority despite the government shutdown,\u201d CoinDesk reported. \u201cWe want innovators to feel welcome here so they don\u2019t flee to foreign jurisdictions,\u201d he added.\nIf adopted, the exemption could provide a clear pathway for blockchain firms to innovate within the U.S. without facing immediate enforcement risks\u2014a long-standing concern for the crypto industry. Analysts view the move as a strategic response to international competition, as jurisdictions such as the EU, UAE, and Singapore have already implemented comprehensive digital asset frameworks.\nNorth Dakota Launches the \u201cRoughrider Coin\u201d\u2014A State-Backed Stablecoin\nIn a move that could redefine state-level participation in digital finance, North Dakota has announced plans to launch the \u201cRoughrider Coin\u201d in 2026 through the Bank of North Dakota, the nation\u2019s only state-owned bank. Developed in partnership with fintech firm Fiserv, the stablecoin will be fully backed by U.S. dollars and primarily used for interbank transactions, such as loan settlements and construction advances.\nNorth Dakota\u2019s initiative follows Wyoming\u2019s Frontier Stable Token, launched earlier this year, positioning the two states at the forefront of integrating blockchain into public financial infrastructure. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, the Roughrider Coin seeks to make financial transactions between local banks faster, more secure, and less reliant on traditional payment rails.\nIndustry observers say the project could serve as a blueprint for other U.S. states exploring tokenized money systems, especially as Washington debates the future of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\nSenator Lummis and Jack Dorsey Unite on Bitcoin Tax Reform\nMeanwhile, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) is advancing legislation inspired by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Block and a vocal Bitcoin advocate, to exempt small Bitcoin transactions from capital gains tax. The proposed \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption would exclude purchases under $300\u2014up to $5,000 annually per taxpayer\u2014from IRS reporting requirements.\nThe measure would make Bitcoin more practical for day-to-day payments, removing one of the biggest obstacles to crypto\u2019s mainstream adoption. \u201cWorking on it,\u201d Lummis confirmed on X, pointing out her ongoing collaboration with Dorsey.\nThe initiative revives her earlier Digital Asset Tax Fairness Act, which stalled earlier this year, and aligns with broader Republican efforts to reduce regulatory friction for digital assets.\nCrypto Becomes a Voter Issue Ahead of 2026\nA new poll from McLaughlin & Associates and The Digital Chamber shows that 64% of voters now consider a candidate\u2019s stance on crypto \u201cvery important\u201d in shaping their vote. The results indicate a growing bipartisan interest in digital assets, with most investors favoring Republicans to lead crypto policy reform.\nThree-quarters of respondents said they support the"

If ETH fails to stabilize above $4,100, the path toward $3,800 becomes increasingly likely.\nBearish Indicators Flash As Ethereum Momentum Collapses\nThe 4-hour RSI sits near 27, deep in oversold territory, but still shows heavy bearish momentum.\nA quick recovery above $4,350 would ease selling pressure, while a daily close under $4,100 opens the door for a retest of $3,800.\nOn the upside, only a decisive move through $4,500 would neutralize the bearish outlook.\nOn-Chain Data Confirms Heavy Ethereum Selling Pressure\nETH Netflows (Source: Coinglass)\nData from Coinglass shows net outflows of $235 million on October 10, reflecting strong investor repositioning following Ethereum's recent rally.\nAlthough outflows usually signal accumulation, this trend appears to align with profit-taking instead of new buying.\nSince July, repeated outflow spikes have failed to generate lasting upside momentum, indicating weaker conviction among long-term holders.\nThis divergence between on-chain activity and price structure supports the bearish case in the near term, especially as ETH struggles to reclaim key support levels.\nHow Senate Democrats' DeFi Proposal Could Impact Ethereum\nThe Senate's proposed decentralized finance framework may not name Ethereum directly, but the network sits at the center of its implications.\nEthereum underpins most decentralized lending, trading, and stablecoin activity, making it highly exposed to any policy changes.\nUnder the proposal, individuals or teams providing front-end access to DeFi protocols would need to register as brokers with the SEC or CFTC.\nThat definition could extend to developers or teams managing interfaces for Ethereum-based protocols such as Uniswap (CRYPTO: UNI) or Aave (CRYPTO: AAVE).\nIf implemented, U.S. users could face restricted access, and developers might relocate operations offshore to avoid liability.\nStablecoins And Ethereum's Role In Global Settlement\nEthereum remains the dominant layer for dollar-pegged stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, which anchor over $250 billion in liquidity.\nReports from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered Plc project over $1 trillion in stablecoin-related flows by 2027.\nIf U.S. policy limits how stablecoins interact with DeFi platforms, that demand could shift toward offshore markets or competing blockchains.\nMeanwhile, Wall Street institutions like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are building permissioned blockchain rails for internal settlements.\nThis creates a split between regulated bank-led systems and open networks like Ethereum that prioritize transparency and decentralization.\nWhy It Matters\nEthereum's fight for $3,800 is not just another technical retest, it is where market structure collides with politics.\nThe network carries the bulk of DeFi lending, stablecoin liquidity, and on-chain settlement \u2014 precisely the areas Washington is moving to regulate.\nIf Ethereum loses this level while regulators advance restrictive frameworks, it could reshape how capital flows across decentralized rails.\nThis moment is less about one chart and more about whether Ethereum remains the backbone of open finance or cedes ground to permissioned blockchains led by Wall Street.\nRead Next:\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

                "body": "Institutional belief in Ethereum (ETH) remains strong as Grayscale revealed a fresh $150 million staking pledge. The move is designed to take advantage of longer-term yield potential ahead of substantial SEC altcoin ETF decisions later in the quarter. However, despite positive fundamentals from Ethereum, there remains doubt over how much space will be left for the upside, and whether increased capital inflows will limit its scope to create the exponential returns investors have a tendency to seek in early bull market phases.\nThat\u2019s because more and more investors are starting to diversify into high-upside opportunities beyond the majors, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be one of the most hyped names in that category. At Phase 6 of presale for $0.035, MUTM has already raised over $17.05 million, with over 60% of the tokens already sold and 16,830+ investors invested. In contrast to the majority of altcoin speculation tokens, Mutuum Finance is building a twin-layer DeFi network that combines collateralized lending, peer-to-peer lending and a forthcoming USD-pegged stablecoin.\nGrayscale Doubles Down on Ethereum With $150 Million Bet\nGrayscale is doubling down on the long-term promise of Ethereum by investing 32,000 ETH worth $150 million just weeks after launching the first U.S. crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) with staking rewards. This strategic move allows Grayscale\u2019s investment products, including the Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH), along with their investors, to receive up to 77% to 94% of the staking rewards, depending on the fee setup.\nTiming is key; the SEC is reviewing 16 altcoin ETP applications this month with decisions soon on products from 21Shares (Oct. 23) and BlackRock (Oct. 30) that will feature staking functionality. As much as the ongoing impasse between the government and the funding may slow down the regulatory clearances, growing uncertainty is already pushing investors towards decentralized assets. And with institutional players adding more exposure to Ethereum, retail investors are being lured towards new projects with disruption capability, a development that has created growing interest in Mutuum Finance.\nMutuum Finance Presale Gains Steady Momentum\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to rise in presale now in phase 6. Tokens are available at $0.035, increasing by 16.17% from Phase 5. Investor appetite keeps increasing, with over 16,830 believers who have faith in the project roadmap in the long run.\nTo receive stable, real-time valuations, the protocol takes advantage of Chainlink oracles for USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX feeds. It also makes use of fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references, which provide multi-layer protection and stable prices even in cases of rare instances of market volatility.\nThe protocol is dynamic in its Liquidation and Loan-to-Value ratios, which automatically move based on real-world market conditions, a factor which renders the system highly sensitivity to volatility. Reserve multipliers are between 10% for risky assets and 35% for less risky assets, with provision of a double-layered protection mechanism for platform and users\u2019 security.\nLending & Borrowing Protocol development\nMutuum Finance has announced the launching plans for its lending and borrowing protocol. Version 1 (V1) is going live in Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet with liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be supported day one to collateralize, lend, and borrow, and the protocol offers a safe and scalable experience to the users.\nWhile Grayscale wagers $150M on Ethereum, more reward-seeking investors are rushing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It is a DeFi platform with dual-layer lending, peer-to-peer borrowing, and a USD-pegged stablecoin. Phase 6 has been funded with over $17.05M with 16,830+ investors and 60% sold. With dynamic LTV ratios, Chainlink oracles, and a $50,000 bug bounty, MUTM strikes the perfect balance bet"

Fees from zkVerified DeFi vaults will go to support privacy-focused open-source developers.\nFor the first two months, fees will go to the legal defense funds of the developers of Tornado Cash.\nSponsoredInstitutional DeFi Funds Privacy Defense\nThe Ethereum Foundation and Keyring Network have devised a funding mechanism for privacy development.\nKeyring is a company focused on creating tools that help large financial institutions access compliant decentralized finance (DeFi) products. They specialize in using advanced zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to prove they are verified without revealing their identity on the Ethereum blockchain.\nKeyring recently developed zkVerified vaults, which serve as secure, yield-generating DeFi gateways accessible exclusively to safelisted investors.\nThe joint initiative aims to fund the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, championing the defense of privacy-enhancing, open-source code.\nKeyring provides direct financial support, pledging two months of all protocol fees generated by its new zkVerified vaults for the developers\u2019 defense. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation is the strategic partner. The Ethereum Foundation will coordinate the effort and establish a successful test case for this new funding model.\nSponsoredDevelopers Convicted for Open Source Code\nIn 2019, Storm, Pertsev, and Roman Semenov created and launched Tornado Cash, an open-source cryptocurrency mixer on the Ethereum blockchain. The service significantly enhances users\u2019 transaction privacy and anonymity.\nThe stated primary motivation for its creation was to provide financial privacy for cryptocurrency users. Since Ethereum transactions are public, Tornado Cash was created to disconnect the sending and receiving wallets.\nProponents like Vitalik Buterin celebrated the creation, viewing it as vital for financial privacy. However, critics argued that criminals, like sophisticated North Korean hackers, could use it to launder billions in illicit funds.\nIn August 2022, the US Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash. It also made it illegal for Americans to use the protocol. Pertsev and Storm were subsequently arrested and charged with facilitating money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.\nCourts convicted both Persev and Storm for these crimes. Roman Semenov remains at large.\nAn Alarming Standard\nThe legal cases against the developers of Tornado Cash have resulted in substantial legal fees.\nThe case is seen by many in the crypto community as setting a dangerous precedent for criminalizing developers for simply writing open-source code.\nBeyond this new strategic initiative between the Ethereum Foundation and Keyring, the Foundation pledged an additional $500,000 in donations in August to fund the developers\u2019 legal defense.\nThis new initiative serves as a key proof of concept for the entire industry. If successful, this new model will establish a sustainable, market-driven funding structure that automatically channels the financial success of privacy protocols, eliminating the need to rely on emergency, one-time community donations for all future legal challenges."

The team also hinted at a possible Sorare ecosystem token in the future, as part of its long-term vision:\nWhile the announcement didn\u2019t provide further detail as to why Sorare chose to move to Solana, commentators on X have suggested that Sorare was paid an eight-figure sum to make the switch. The Defiant reached out to Sorare and Solana for comments, but haven\u2019t heard back by press time.\nFounded in 2019 by Nicolas Julia and Adrien Montfort, Sorare started on Ethereum and by mid-2021 moved onto L2 StarkEx, the application-specific scaling engine from Starknet developer, StarkWare, to cut gas costs. That same year the company raised a $680 million Series B that valued it at roughly $4.3 billion.\nMigration Details\nAs part of the migration, starting this month, Sorare said that users\u2019 ETH balances currently on StarkEx will migrate to Base, Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum Layer 2, to improve \u201ctransaction efficiency while keeping the experience familiar.\u201d\nBy the end of October, Sorare cards will be bridged as Solana NFTs while preserving all cards\u2019 attributes like scarcity, serial number, season, XP, and metadata, per the blog post. The team also said that Sorare will cover all gas fees for the migration, specifying that users \u201cwon\u2019t sign transactions or spend crypto during migration.\u201d\nSorare also added that once the migration is complete, cards withdrawn to Ethereum wallets \u201cstill work in gameplay but cannot trade on Sorare until re-deposited or bridged to Solana,\u201d while NFTs left on StarkEx will be bridged to Solana.\nAre NFTs Back?\nSorare's migration comes as the total number of NFT sales has reached its highest level since 2022, per data from blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.\nIn a Thursday research post, the DappRadar wrote that in Q3, the market recorded over 18.1 million NFTs sold, generating $1.6 billion in trading volume, adding that \u201cone of the leading dapps\u201d in this sports field is Sorare, which is responsible for \u201cmultimillions in trading volume, selling hundreds of thousands of digital cards to players and collectors around the globe.\u201d\nEarlier today, Larva Labs, the creators of CryptoPunks, Autoglyphs, and Meebits, wrapped up Art Blocks\u2019 curated series with a new collection, Quine, with the sale closing at 7.56 ETH, or $31,000 per Quine NFT.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

Over $17.05 million has been raised from more than 16,820 investors. Mutuum Finance stands out in prioritizing real utility over speculation, building a two-layer DeFi stack that combines collateralized lending, yield optimization, and decentralized credit markets to address the core inefficiencies of old finance. Mutuum Finance can outdo even the strongest Layer-1 titans in the long run.\nSolana (SOL) has solidly entrenched itself as one of the most lucrative and fast-growing blockchain networks, bringing in a staggering $2.85 billion in revenue over the last year, as reported by 21Shares. Motivated by activity on the trading platform, which accounted for 39%, $1.12 billion, of that figure, Solana\u2019s network remains well-performing across verticals of DeFi, memecoins, AI applications, decentralized exchanges, and launchpads.\nAfter the January memecoin high at $616 million revenue, subsequent to the memecoin bubble, monthly revenues remained firm at $150 million to $250 million, indicating sustainable demand for the network. With 1.2\u20131.5 million active addresses daily, almost three times Ethereum\u2019s during a similar phase, Solana is clearly winning the Layer-1 battle. And yet, though fundamentals for it are being established, investors are looking towards newer project Mutuum Finance.\nMutuum Finance is shaking the DeFi market with its presale, supported by more than 16,830 investors, and already raising more than $17.05 million. MUTM tokens are available during Phase 6, which is already sold out by 60%, priced at $0.035 per token. As a gesture of gratitude to the pioneer investors, the team has organized a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens.\nMutuum Finance is launching a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that have been destroyed during bear markets, the new token will be non-algorithmic and overcollateralized in design to ensure price stability during bear markets.\nMutuum Finance will launch its lending and borrowing protocol. V1 will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and other major functionality. ETH and USDT are supported on day one for collateralization, lending, and borrowing, giving customers a secure, stable, and easy-to-use DeFi experience.\nThe protocol employs a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) process in which the maximum collateral of all assets is determined through its risk category to facilitate proportionate and secured lending. Buffer reserve system is also a protective mechanism where assets with higher risk will have to keep larger reserves, safeguarding users from market volatility while enabling ecosystem stability.\nSolana\u2019s $2.85 billion revenue proves strong demand for scalable blockchain solutions. At the same time, Mutuum Finance is gaining rapid traction, raising over $17.05 million from 16,830+ investors with more than 60% of presale phase 6 tokens sold at $0.035. Its focus on real utility and stable DeFi solutions positions it for long-term growth.\nAct now, secure your MUTM tokens before Phase 6 sells out and be part of DeFi\u2019s next big chapter.\nFor more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the f"

The post came after China heated up trade tensions with the US, adding new port fees on American ships and launching an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm (QCOM). Beijing has also been in the midst of tightening export controls on rare earth minerals, and it recently halted purchases of US soybeans.\n\"Some very strange things are happening in China!\" Trump posted. In his post, he also floated canceling a planned meeting with Xi later this month, saying there was \"no reason\" for it before threatening to dramatically increase tariffs.\n\"Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.

                "body": "The Dow Jones Index closed the week with a decline of more than 2.2% in the short term, as selling pressure remains dominant amid a rising sense of market risk. Recent comments from President Donald Trump about a potential reactivation of the trade war with China have started to erode investor confidence, triggering a steady wave of selling in the index. As this risk sentiment persists, downward pressure may become even more pronounced in the coming sessions.\nWhat Did Trump Say?\nDuring a recent session, President Trump once again addressed the trade situation with China, stating that the Asian nation has been engaging in \u201cimmoral economic practices\u201d against the U.S. economy by restricting the export of rare earth minerals, which are essential for the production of chips and electric vehicles. These materials are considered strategic for U.S. industrial growth, and such restrictions have been described as a direct threat to the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector.\nIn response, Trump warned that new tariffs could soon be imposed on Chinese technology products, although no specific figures were mentioned. It\u2019s worth recalling that in previous disputes, proposed tariffs reached as high as 150%, which had a significant impact on financial markets at the time.\nThis development has had an immediate impact on recent Dow Jones movements, as investors now fear a renewed wave of trade tensions that could raise production costs and hurt key exports from major companies within the index. The negative sentiment has already been reflected in the performance of several key stocks, including Goldman Sachs, which fell more than 2.22%, Microsoft, which dropped 2.73%, and Caterpillar, which lost nearly 2%. However, the most pronounced decline came from UnitedHealth Group, which plunged more than 6%, not only due to trade tensions but also following Trump\u2019s remarks suggesting a potential review or reform of the federal healthcare system, which could directly impact the company\u2019s business model in the short and medium term.\nSource: Slickcharts\nDespite early-week optimism driven by new record highs, the shifting fundamental landscape has quickly eroded market confidence. The prospect of a revived trade war coinciding with the year-end season has dampened expectations that major equity indices \u2014 including the Dow Jones \u2014 will maintain solid demand. If political and economic uncertainty continues to grow, selling pressure is likely to remain dominant in the sessions ahead.\nHow Is Market Confidence Holding Up?\nMarket confidence appears to be weakening toward the end of the week, largely due to renewed concerns about a possible trade war reactivation. The Fear & Greed Index for financial markets has seen a sharp decline, dropping to 29 points in the short term. This steady downward slope brings the index closer to the \u201cextreme fear\u201d zone, signaling a notable deterioration in investor sentiment.\nSource: CNN\nAs confidence continues to fade, interest in risk assets \u2014 such as equity indices \u2014 is likely to diminish. Investors may start shifting toward safe-haven assets, reducing capital inflows into stock markets. Consequently, the Dow Jones could face additional selling pressure in the coming trading sessions.\nTechnical Outlook for the Dow Jones\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Uptrend at Risk: In recent weeks, the Dow Jones had maintained a steady upward trend, reaching new all-time highs above 45,000 points. However, the latest bearish movements have introduced a new negative bias, breaking through the existing uptrend line and potentially altering the chart structure. If the price continues to trade below the 50-period moving average, this could confirm a shift toward a short-term bearish scenario.\n- RSI: The RSI line has dropped significantly below the 50 level, indicating that the average selling momentum over the past 14 sessions has begun to dominate market behavior. As long as the RSI does not approach the oversold zone (30), downward pressure is likely to r"

What to Watch Next?\n2 min read\nKey points:\n- Dow Jones goes lower\n- Stocks notch a red day\n- Q3 earnings are here\nFirst batch of earnings data hit the decks Thursday and it\u2019s only going to get busier from here. Here\u2019s what to watch in the weeks ahead.\n\ud83d\udea8 Stocks Pull Back from Records\n- The Dow Jones Industrial Average index DJI shuffled lower Thursday, giving back 240 points, as markets were once again antsy over the uncertainty around the US government shutdown.\n- But time waits for no one and the third-quarter earnings season officially kicked off despite political jitters and the economic blackout that\u2019s keeping investors in the dark.\n- The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also pulled back after charting fresh record highs a day earlier. The broad-based index erased a modest 0.3% while the tech-heavy index slipped less than 0.1%. Apparently, tech and AI traders held on to their precious shares despite the lofty price tags there.\n\ud83d\udd14 Earnings Season Kickoff\n- Delta Air Lines DAL and PepsiCo PEP were among the first companies to reveal quarterly performance yesterday, ahead of the opening bell. Delta took off by 4.3% and Pepsi popped by 4.2%.\n- Both companies did well, topping analysts\u2019 consensus views, and led to positive reactions from investors. Still, the ripple effect wasn\u2019t enough (these two aren\u2019t in the Dow) to lift the 30-stock index packed with mostly real-economy stocks like Coca-Cola KO and Boeing BA.\n- Levi\u2019s stock LEVI wasn\u2019t so fortunate. The jeans maker reported after the closing bell and even with a raised guidance on both top and bottom lines, it couldn\u2019t get investors excited. The shares fell nearly 8%.\n\ud83d\udd11 What\u2019s Going On?\n- Next up \u2013 more quietness from the economy. The US government gridlock enters Day 10 Friday and the nonfarm payrolls USNFP, which were supposed to go out last Friday, won\u2019t go out today, either. It\u2019s getting pushed further back to next Friday, if the lights are back on by then.\n- On the earnings front, the big banks on Wall Street will be reporters next week. JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, and more will show how the economy fared through the lens of consumer and business spending.\n- Meanwhile, gold XAUUSD fell from its record high, washing out more than 2% from $4,050 to a Friday low of $3,947 per ounce. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) was in the same boat, heading lower toward $121,000 per coin from a weekly high of $126,272 (which is the current record hit on Monday)."

                "body": "JLR to restart production on Wednesday after cyber-attack\nCarmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed that output at some of its manufacturing sites will resume on Wednesday, as it continues to recover from a serious cyber-attack.\nIts production lines have been at a standstill since the start of September, following the attack.\nThe phased return of staff will begin at some sites in the West Midlands and Merseyside.\nJLR has also announced a programme to fast-track payments to its direct suppliers, some of which had laid off workers after their revenues dried up following the hack.\nInitially the scheme will be confined to the most critical suppliers needed for restarting production, but it will be expanded at a later date.\nJLR says the phased restart will begin at its Wolverhampton engine plant and its battery assembly centre in Hams Hall.\nEmployees who work in facilities which prepare pressed metal bodywork at the company's sites in Castle Bromwich, Halewood and Solihull will also be brought back in \u2013 as will those who work in the Solihull car plant's body shop and paint shop.\nJLR says this move will be \"closely followed\" by the resumption of vehicle manufacturing in Nitra, Slovakia. The Range Rover and Range Rover Sport production lines in Solihull are expected to restart later in the week.\nIt is not yet clear when output will resume at JLR's Halewood plant on Merseyside.\nExperts have warned that it is still likely to be several weeks before the production lines are running as normal.\nJLR also released figures showing a sharp drop in sales during the three months to 30 September, partly due to the shutdown following the cyber attack.\nWholesale sales - reflecting deliveries to dealers - were down 24.2% from a year earlier, while retail sales fell 17.1%.\nAdvertisement\nJLR described the period as \"challenging\", with sales also falling as a result of the planned withdrawal of older models ahead of the launch of new Jaguar and the impact of tariffs on its exports to the US.\nJLR has also outlined an accelerated-payment scheme to help its suppliers, many of whom have been struggling financially.\nSo-called Tier 1 suppliers, with which the company has a direct relationship, will be able to get paid for new orders shortly after they have been placed, rather than up to two months after delivery. JLR says this will enable them to get funding up to 120 days earlier than normal.\nThere is an expectation that these companies will then offer similar terms to their own suppliers, allowing funding to flow rapidly down the supply chain.\nThe scheme is being funded by JLR itself, using credit provided by a commercial bank. It is not linked to the \u00a31.5bn loan guarantee recently offered to the carmaker by the government.\nIndustry insiders have warned that the resumption of production, while welcome, does not end the crisis being experienced by many smaller suppliers. Some are heavily reliant on JLR and have had little or no income for the past month and a half, while bills have still had to be paid.\nLast week, one leading contractor told the BBC that the help offered by the government so far was inadequate.\nDavid Roberts of Evtec Group said: \"We asked the government directly, at ministerial level, to directly support the sector. They listened, but they did nothing. It's almost like they've turned a deaf ear to the needs of advanced manufacturing.\"\nAnother supplier, Genex UK, a small company which presses metal parts, told the BBC it had been forced to lay off 18 staff because of a cash shortage.\nBusiness and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said he welcomed the news that production would resume.\n\"This is very welcome news for workers and suppliers, but I know many are still under pressure, particularly further down the supply chain,\" Mr Kyle said\n\"My focus will remain on helping JLR resolve this cyber incident, making further progress towards restarting production, and supporting the long-term health of our automotive supply chain.\""

But still, precious metals continue to find a way to hog the spotlight again with both gold and silver poised for eight straight weeks of gains now.\nAfter a mild \"setback\" yesterday, both are seen pushing higher again today with gold rebounding from $3,947 to retest the $4,000 mark while silver is attempting to make clearance above $50. The latter even crossed above $51 earlier in the session before a bout of profit-taking came along, though price is still up over 2% to $50.13 currently.\nIn the FX space, there wasn't much for major currencies to work with in general. The dollar is holding steady for the most part, only down slightly against the yen after Komeito party leader, Tetsuo Saito, said that they will withdraw from the governing coalition. That adds a complication to LDP president Sanae Takaichi's bid to become prime minister.\nUSD/JPY is down just slightly by 0.2% to 152.67, also cooling off after some verbal intervention by Tokyo officials.\nIn the equities space, things remain more muted with European indices not really doing all too much and keeping more mixed on the day. The DAX remains lightly changed after posting a record close yesterday, which also came just by the slightest of margins. US futures are seen posting a marginal bounce, so there's not too much to work with in terms of risk sentiment.\nWith the US government shutdown still in effect heading into the long weekend, market players continue to be left hanging for the most part and figuring stuff out on their own devices.\nThe dollar is set to end the week higher but remains vulnerable to any potential softening in US data and the economy, if and when there is evidence of that. And as things stand, the Fed remains set to cut interest rates again at the end of the month.\nBut this week, it's all about gold and silver for the most part as the rally continues. Putting the pedal to the mettle metal. \ud83e\udd18\nHave a great weekend, everyone! This article was written by Justin Low at investinglive.com."

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid around 3.6%, leading losses.\nTrump unloaded on China and its leader, Xi Jinping, in a lengthy post on Truth Social on Friday. The post came after China heated up trade tensions with the US, adding new port fees on American ships and launching an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm (QCOM). Beijing has also been in the midst of tightening export controls on rare earth minerals, and it recently halted purchases of US soybeans.\n\"Some very strange things are happening in China!\" Trump posted. In his post, he also floated canceling a planned meeting with Xi later this month, saying there was \"no reason\" for it before threatening to dramatically increase tariffs.\n\"Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A. One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,\" Trump wrote.\nThe return to Trump's tariff war put a pin in an already wobbly week for markets, which were pulled in different directions by AI demand hopes and US government shutdown worries. With Friday's decline, all major indexes logged a firmly down week after a retreat from record highs.\nMeanwhile, private data was in focus for investors as the release of official economic figures has been delayed due to the US government shutdown, which entered its 10th day.

High expectations are priced in, while concerns about gross margins and competitive threats from Nvidia and Intel remain.\n- This deal won't show up on financials until almost three quarters out, so we do see risk of potential pullback on Q3 print, which we believe investors should buy up.\n- We continue to believe AMD's positioning is strengthened by this deal, and the stock is best to buy when it is cheap.\n- Looking for a portfolio of ideas like this one?

                "body": "- A US Navy aircraft carrier was damaged after it collided with a cargo ship in February.\n- The damage to USS Harry S. Truman was spotted at a recent event attended by President Donald Trump.\n- A photo shows that it has been painted over and was covered by a large poster for the event.\nA US aircraft carrier that collided with a cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea earlier this year remains in need of repairs eight months later. Photos show the damage is still there; it's just been painted over.\nSailors spotted the damage to USS Harry S. Truman on Sunday during a celebration of the 250th anniversary of the establishment of the US Navy at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. Thousands of sailors attended the event, which featured a speech by President Donald Trump.\nA photo of the Truman, which was captured by a sailor in attendance and shared with Business Insider, shows a massive Navy poster hanging from the carrier and covering the damage. The sailor, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share their observations from the event, said the poster blocked most angles of the damage.\nThe photo has gone viral on social media. The sign is believed to have been a Navy attempt to obscure the damage.\nIt certainly would not be the first time that optics have come into play when the Navy hosted Trump, who has long been heavily focused on the appearance of ships, from design to rust. During his first term in 2019, the White House requested that the sea service conceal the USS John S. McCain, a warship named after his late critic, for the president's visit to Japan, where the destroyer was forward deployed at the time.\nA Navy spokesperson told Business Insider on Friday that Truman's exterior cosmetic damage will be fixed during its upcoming refueling complex overhaul, a mid-life process for America's fleet of nuclear-powered carriers that allows them to continue operating for another two decades.\nTruman was commissioned in 1998, so that work is coming due.\nCollision in the Med\nThe carrier Truman collided with the merchant vessel Besiktas-M on February 12 while operating in the Mediterranean near Egypt's Port Said. The Nimitz-class carrier had just been in the Red Sea, deployed as part of the Navy's efforts to defend commercial shipping lanes from Houthi rebel attacks.\nThe Navy said Truman suffered external damage, including to a line handling space, the fantail, and the platform above a storage space. The exterior wall of two storage rooms and a maintenance space was also damaged.\nCapt. Dave Snowden, Truman's commanding officer at the time, who was later fired over the incident, said that the ship was fully mission-capable and conducted flight operations after the collision, but it still needed some repairs to continue its deployment.\nThe carrier sailed to a US naval base in Greece for an emergent repair availability, a standard repair process for unexpected incidents that allows ships to remain operational mid-deployment. By February 24, after days of repairs, Truman was back in the Mediterranean conducting routine flight operations. It later returned to the counter-Houthi mission.\nThe collision was one of several mishaps the Truman suffered during its deployment; it lost three F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, including one to a friendly fire incident. The aircraft are estimated to cost roughly $60 million apiece.\nThe Truman returned to Naval Station Norfolk from its eventful Middle East deployment in June. At some point prior to Sunday's big event, the damage from the February collision was painted over to match the color of the ship's hull.\nThe sailor who took the photo of the damage told Business Insider that if it doesn't affect a ship's capabilities, cosmetic damage repairs may be a lower priority.\nIn Greece, new bulkheads were installed inside the damaged spaces \"to establish weathertight integrity,\" the Navy spokesperson said on Friday, adding that the exterior damage will be repaired during the refueling complex overhaul (RCOH), a "

                "body": "Japanese stocks dropped \u2013 and the yen rallied in choppy, indecisive trade \u2013 late Friday as the political fortunes of Sanae Takaichi dimmed dramatically and her ascension to Japan\u2019s prime ministership was suddenly brought into real doubt.\n\u201cWe should be prepared that the dollar-yen rate could fluctuate in a wide range, up to the \u00a5155 level, over the coming month,\u201d said Hideo Kumano, executive economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute, in a report released on Thursday.\nThe Nikkei 225 stock average rallied after Takachi, an outspoken proponent of aggressive fiscal spending and loose money, became the president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) \u2013 and thus the presumptive prime minister \u2013 on Saturday, while the yen weakened.\nJust before the election, the currency was trading around \u00a5147 to the dollar. After the victory of Takaichi, it quickly lost value, breaking the \u00a5153 mark on Friday morning.\nThis was dubbed the \u201cTakaichi trade.\u201d\nMarkets turned on a dime late Friday after Komeito said that it would be parting ways with the LDP after 26 years as a coalition partner, making the political math for the LDP far more complicated and Takaichi\u2019s rise to the prime minister's office far less certain.\nIn futures market trading, the Nikkei 225 stock average was down more than 2%, while the yen traded back into \u00a5152-to-the-dollar territory right after news broke of the Komeito-LDP breakup.\nThe outlook for the yen is far from certain. Its weakness is a function of a number of factors, and not only the expectations of fiscal and monetary largesse under Takaichi, while economic realities prevent a Japanese prime minister from being too aggressive with stimulus.\nThe interest rate differential between Japan and the United States \u2013 now more than 3.5 percentage points \u2013 is widely seen as the primary reason for the weakening of the yen.\nKumano suggests that other factors \u2013 such as domestic political instability and expectations for continued monetary stimulus \u2013 are responsible for \u00a58.6 of depreciation already.\n\u201cIf the yen continues to weaken, it will only trouble Takaichi. Further price hikes will likely result in lowering her support ratings,\u201d Kumano wrote.\nA weak yen increases import costs, which eventually leads to price increases. Takaichi has said high prices are her immediate priority.\nTaking a tolerant stance toward a rate increase would help stop the weakening of the yen, so it would benefit Takaichi, Kumano wrote.\nAppearing on a TV Tokyo program Thursday night, Takaichi refrained from commenting on the exchange rate but said \u201cI don\u2019t intend to provoke an excessive depreciation of the yen.\u201d\nShe added that a weak yen comes with both positives and negatives, saying that it could mitigate the impact of the increased U.S. tariff rates. Takaichi said she plans to implement measures for higher import costs through an extra budget.\nAs for monetary policy, Takaichi stuck to her talking points, saying the government is ultimately responsible for both fiscal policy and monetary policy, but execution is up to the central bank.\nCompared to last year when she also ran in the LDP leadership race, Takaichi has softened her stance on fiscal policy and pressure on the BOJ.\n\u201cI have never said even once that fiscal consolidation is unnecessary,\u201d Takaichi said in the TV Tokyo program. \"An economy that won\u2019t grow would be the biggest burden for future generations,\u201d she said, adding that this is why investments are needed to facilitate sustainable growth.\n\u201cTakaichi\u2019s tone on fiscal expansion and monetary policy has become much more moderate, so I think the market reaction has been a bit excessive,\u201d said Soichiro Tateishi, a vice senior economist at the Japan Research Institute.\nKumano said another factor for the yen\u2019s plunge is the intensifying political turmoil.\nWithout Komeito\u2019s help, it is uncertain whether Takaichi will be elected prime minister, as the LDP lacks a majority in either chamber of parliament.\n\u201cPolitical instability is fueling the yen's de"

Betting markets, which had placed a 60 percent chance on an October hike, quickly revised their expectations downward to 24 percent. Markets are now pricing in a likely hike to 0.75 percent in December. This adjustment has reinforced yen weakness and bolstered equity momentum.\nKey highlights:\n- Political milestone: Sanae Takaichi becomes Japan's first female prime minister.\n- Currency markets: Yen hits record lows against the euro; USD/JPY breaks the 150 threshold.\n- Policy shift: Expectations for a Bank of Japan rate hike postponed to December.\n- Equities rally: Nikkei 225 could surge toward 50,000, with the index already approaching 48,000 on stimulus hopes and continued low interest rates.\n- Near-term catalysts: October's parliamentary confirmation vote and the BOJ's policy meeting loom large.\nThe report underscores the heightened volatility in traditional finance and crypto markets as traders recalibrate strategies around Japan's evolving economic outlook. With the yen under pressure and equities buoyed by stimulus hopes, Japan has returned to the center of global macro discussions.\nThe full Bybit x FXStreet TradFi Report is available now on Bybit's official platform, offering traders in-depth analysis, technical insights, and forward-looking market perspectives.
