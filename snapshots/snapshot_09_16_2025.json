The rally is further supported by structural factors including persistent inflation, high US government debt, and significant central bank buying, particularly from emerging markets. However, technical indicators suggest the metal is overbought, and a potential policy disappointment from the Fed could trigger a significant corrective sell-off.\nSENTIMENT: Mixed\n\n**Overall Market Sentiment:** Mixed",

                "body": "Gold keeps hitting new highs. Here's why \u2014 and whether it's time to sell now\nGold prices are up more than 40% this year. Experts chime in on whether or not it's time to sell\nGold prices are surging right now, with the spot gold price per ounce at $3,656 as of September 15. Gold prices are up 41.8% for the year and up $1,600 since 2023.\nSuggested Reading\nWhat\u2019s more, Goldman Sachs says gold prices could rise to $5,000 if investors back off traditional safe-haven investments like U.S. Treasury bonds if the economy tilts toward recession. In this scenario, investors trust hard assets like gold over the U.S. dollar.\nRelated Content\n\u201cThe price target for gold for 2025 (end) is around $3750 if the interest rate is reduced,\u201d said Jose Gomez, co-founder at Salt Lake City-based Summit Metals. \u201cThe current price already reflects an interest rate reduction; however, if all things stay equal $3,750 is possible.\nWhy are gold prices climbing so quickly in 2025? Precious metals specialists point to multiple flash points.\nThe Federal Reserve and interest rates\nGood gold buying opportunities would continue if the Federal Reserve, as expected, curbs interest rates in the next few weeks.\n\u201cWe have seen this before in 2008, 2020, and even in August 2024,\u201d said Lina Thomas, an economic analyst at Goldman Sachs Research. \u201cTimes like these are good buying opportunities, because gold typically rebounds shortly afterwards as investors seek safe assets.\u201d\nSky-high government debt\nUncle Sam\u2019s debt burden is burgeoning, and that\u2019s sending shockwaves throughout the safe-haven assets markets.\n\u201cU.S. government fiscal and monetary policies, including massive U.S. deficit spending and unfathomable U.S. public debt and actuarial obligations for entitlements (such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans\u2019 benefits, etc.) will require the creation of more U.S. dollars to pay current promises and interest,\u201d said Thomas Winmill, portfolio manager at Midas Funds in Walpole, N.H.\nWinmill believes paying down meaningful amounts owed by the U.S. on its public debt is not feasible given the current budget deficit. \u201cThe continuous creation of U.S. dollars in this environment has and will continue to lead to a depreciated U.S. dollar, which causes U.S. price inflation and an increase in the price of all 'hard' assets, including gold,\u201d he noted.\nThere\u2019s a perfect storm of converging (and troublesome) economic trends\nGold has risen even though interest rates remain elevated, and has traditionally been correlated with real rates. However, this correlation has broken down this year, suggesting that something structural is shifting in capital allocation, reserve management, and risk perception, said Tracy Shuchart, senior economist at Chicago-based Ninja Trader.\n\u201cThe U.S. dollar has weakened, making gold cheaper for foreign buyers and adding further momentum to the move,\u201d Shuchart said. \u201cPersistent inflation, which has been running above the Fed\u2019s target, also has reinforced gold\u2019s appeal as a long-term store of value.\u201d\nThere\u2019s more to the story, as the surge in gold this year is likely the result of converging macroeconomic risks. \u201cThose risks include dollar dynamics, central bank buying, inflation worries, and an underlying suspicion that global financial architecture is being tested as rarely before,\u201d Shuchart said.\nAdditionally, central banks, especially in emerging economies, have also been ramping up their gold purchases as a strategic hedge against currency instability and debt concerns. \u201cThat steady accumulation has put real pressure on the supply side and has put an underlying bid in the gold market as they will buy at any price,\u201d Shuchart added.\nShould gold holders stay the course or sell at a profit?\nAny gold investor\u2019s exit strategy should be based on their portfolio\u2019s cost basis (i.e., the amount they paid for it) and the expected return on investment they targeted. \u201cOne should hold gold until it can be converted to the dollar, to then make another investme"
