That showed up quickly: US stock futures and the US dollar slipped, while the yen, Swiss franc, and precious metals caught a bid. Rate expectations mattered too: Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said the central bank should be ready to cut again if conditions weaken, and lower yields typically support non-yielding gold. ETF demand..\nis joining in as well, with holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust rising, even as physical buying looks uneven across big markets.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Safe havens are setting the tone.\nWhen gold and silver rally alongside a weaker dollar and softer equity futures, it\u2019s a classic risk-off signal. If tariff talk turns into actual duties \u2013 and Europe is already weighing deterrence and potential retaliation \u2013 volatility can spill beyond metals into FX and equities. That tends to lift defensive corners of markets, while sectors most exposed to global supply chains and cross-border pricing power take the bigger hit.\nThe bigger picture: Trade shocks can reshape the rate story.\nTariffs can push up prices while cooling demand, forcing central banks to balance inflation risks against growth damage. If the Fed leans toward easier policy, the opportunity cost of holding gold falls, which can keep support under precious metals. Layer in signs of softer global momentum, including slower growth signals out of China, and uncertainty may stay elevated longer than investors would prefer.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nInsight\ninteractive investor x Finimize\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Gold Risk exposed: why today\u2019s wild swings make \u2018safe haven\u2019 Gold a dangerous bet\n19.01.2026 - 04:54:21The Gold Risk narrative has exploded recently as the so?called \u201csafe haven\u201d has behaved more like a thrill ride than a store of value. In early October, spot gold was trading around $2,300 per ounce; by mid?November it had surged above $2,430, only to lurch back toward the $2,350 area within days. That\u2019s a move of more than 5% up and then a sharp reversal in a market many people still naively believe is calm and predictable. On a shorter horizon, intraday spikes of $30\u2013$50 per ounce \u2013 swings of roughly 1\u20132% in hours \u2013 have become common as traders react violently to every whisper about interest rates, inflation, or war. If you are trading with leverage, these moves can wipe out your margin before you can even hit the sell button. Is this still investing or just a casino?\nFor aggressive traders only: open a high?risk account to Trade Gold volatility now\nRecent warning signals around gold have intensified. In the last few days, analysts have highlighted how rapidly shifting expectations for central bank policy \u2013 especially the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s path for interest rates \u2013 can crush bullish sentiment in Gold overnight. When traders suddenly price in higher?for?longer rates, the opportunity cost of holding non?yielding metal shoots up, and Gold can sell off hard. At the same time, regulators like the CFTC and FCA have repeatedly cautioned retail investors about high?leverage products linked to commodities, including gold and silver, stressing that most short?term speculators in these contracts lose money. Market commentary has also turned more bearish at times as strong U.S. economic data has triggered spikes in bond yields and the dollar, both of which tend to pressure gold prices lower. Combined with geopolitical shocks, this toxic mix of macro headlines and speculative flows creates a constant risk of a sudden downdraft rather than a gentle correction.\nThe deeper you look, the more structural Gold Risk emerges. Many retail traders are not buying physical bars or coins stored in a secure vault; they are using contracts for difference (CFDs), spread bets, futures, and options to Trade Gold with 10:1, 20:1 or even higher leverage. That leverage is a double?edged sword. A seemingly modest 3\u20135% drop in the gold price can translate into a 30\u2013100% loss on a highly leveraged position. If you are on margin, your broker can liquidate your position automatically, locking in a total loss before you have time to react. Unlike a bank deposit, these derivative positions have no deposit insurance, no state guarantee, and no safety net. You are exposed not only to the violent swings in Gold prices but also to counterparty risk and the fine print of margin calls and overnight financing charges.\nCompare this to regulated, lower?risk assets. Cash deposits within insured limits at regulated banks, government bonds from stable countries, or diversified index funds typically move in single?digit percentage ranges over months, not in double?digit bursts over days. These traditional vehicles are boring by design. Gold, especially when used for short?term speculation, is the opposite of boring. It can gap higher on a surprise rate cut or a geopolitical shock, but it can just as easily gap lower when tensions ease or inflation data cools. If you are looking for the best broker to buy Gold, you need to be brutally honest with yourself: are you investing for long?term stability, or are you gambling on short?term noise and adrenaline?driven price spikes?\nEven so?called long?term Gold investment is not immune to these dangers. If you buy Gold through leveraged products or unsecured notes rather than fully allocated physical metal, you are stacking risks: market risk, leverage risk, and counterparty risk. A broker failure or liquidity crunch can leave you unable to exit while the market moves against you. If you hold unallocated or pooled gold, you may fi"

The white metal is set to hit a fresh record high as US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats boost the safe-haven flows. The US markets are closed in observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday on Monday.\nTrump said on Saturday that he would slap an additional 10% import tariff on eight European nations, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and the United Kingdom (UK), that have opposed his plan to take Greenland, per Bloomberg.\nEuropean leaders are set to hold an emergency meeting in the coming days as they explore possible counter-measures. Renewed fears of retaliation from Europe, which could lead to a trade war, provide some support to the precious metal.\nAdditionally, robust industrial demand, especially in solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs) and AI-related infrastructure, might contribute to Silver\u2019s upside. Industrial applications account for over half of global silver demand and continue to hit record levels.\nOn the other hand, growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will pause its monetary-easing campaign later this month could lift the US Dollar (USD) and create a headwind for the USD-denominated commodity price. Morgan Stanley analysts updated their forecast for 2026, forecasting one rate reduction in June and another in September, instead of in January and April.\nSilver FAQs\nSilver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.\nSilver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply \u2013 Silver is much more abundant than Gold \u2013 and recycling rates can also affect prices.\nSilver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals \u2013 more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers\u2019 demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.\nSilver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\n"

                "body": "A Perfect Storm Brewing for Silver Prices\n19.01.2026 - 05:53:03The silver market is experiencing a convergence of powerful forces that point toward a sustained period of tight supply. A structural deficit, where global consumption consistently outstrips mine production, is being amplified by robust industrial demand and a shifting macroeconomic landscape, setting the stage for significant market dynamics.\nThe broader financial environment is adding considerable fuel to silver's fundamental story. Recent U.S. inflation data came in softer than anticipated, leading markets to speculate that the Federal Reserve may pivot toward a more accommodative monetary policy, potentially including interest rate cuts. In a climate of falling or stagnant rates, non-yielding assets like precious metals typically gain appeal. A movement into tangible assets is being accelerated by investor skepticism regarding central bank independence, ongoing geopolitical friction, and mounting concerns over financial system stability. Silver captures a unique dual benefit in this scenario: it serves as a traditional store of value during uncertainty while simultaneously being a critical industrial input.\nIndustrial Consumption Outpaces a Constrained Supply\nA primary driver of the deficit is relentless industrial demand that the mining sector cannot easily match. Silver is indispensable in modern technology, particularly in the manufacture of high-efficiency photovoltaic cells for solar panels, a sector with explosive growth. The electronics industry also consumes vast quantities for use in various components. On the supply side, inherent limitations exist. A significant portion of silver is produced only as a by-product of mining for other metals, such as copper or lead. Consequently, mining operators lack the agility to ramp up silver output directly in response to price signals, creating a rigid supply structure that magnifies the impact of any demand increase. Current recycling efforts and the drawdown of existing stockpiles have proven insufficient to bridge the gap.\nPhysical Tightness Manifests in Global Vaults\nEvidence of this strain is becoming visibly apparent in the physical trading hubs. Registered inventories held at major exchanges like the COMEX in Chicago and within the LBMA system in London have been trending lower. Depleting warehouse stocks signal to the market that immediately deliverable metal is becoming less plentiful.\nShould investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Silber Preis?\nFurthermore, a telling price disparity has emerged between the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) and Western benchmarks. Consistently higher premiums in China reflect intense regional demand and scarce local supply. Such arbitrage opportunities do not arise arbitrarily; they are direct indicators of tangible tightness in the physical market.\nThis narrative of scarcity is gaining traction among prominent market voices. Investor Robert Kiyosaki has publicly cited impending supply shortages as a core reason for his bullish outlook on the metal. Regardless of specific price predictions, this highlights how central the scarcity theme has become in market discourse.\nKey Market Drivers Converge\nIn summary, the current silver landscape is defined by four interconnected factors:\n- Persistent Supply-Demand Gap: A lasting global deficit where consumption exceeds primary mine supply.\n- Unrelenting Industrial Demand: Accelerated usage, especially from the renewable energy and electronics sectors.\n- Tangible Physical Shortage: Declining exchange inventories and Asian price premiums provide concrete evidence of market tightness.\n- Supportive Macro Backdrop: Expectations for easier monetary policy and systemic uncertainties bolster its appeal as a hard asset.\nThe collision of inelastic supply and structurally rising demand creates a market poised for continued volatility and opportunity.

Among other developments, US President Donald Trump\u2019s speech at the World Economic Forum and the Supreme Court judgement on trade will be most important to watch,\u201d said Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG \u2013 Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services Ltd.\nOn the domestic front, gold futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) rose Rs 3,698, or 2.7 per cent, over the past week, touching a record high of Rs 1,43,590 per 10 grams on Wednesday.\n\u201cGold prices on the domestic market were up 2.7 per cent for the week, partly supported by a weaker rupee against the dollar. Later, the yellow metal pared some gains on Friday amid profit-booking and long-liquidation, as the risk premium eased following the US President\u2019s softer tone on Iran, better-than-expected jobs data, and a firm dollar,\u201d Mer said.\nIn the international market, Comex gold futures climbed USD 94.5, or 2.09 per cent, last week, closing at USD 4,595.4 per ounce on Friday after hitting a record high of USD 4,650.50 earlier in the week.\n\u201cGold prices rose by more than 2 per cent over the week amid geopolitical risk coming out of Iran, driving strong investor interest in safe haven assets. Expectations of interest rate cuts by the US Fed, a weaker dollar, lower treasury yields and continued central bank buying remain supportive for the yellow metal,\u201d said Prathamesh Mallya, DVP\u2013Research, Non-Agri Commodities and Currencies, Angel One.\nMallya expects gold prices to extend gains towards Rs 1,46,000 per 10 grams on the MCX and around USD 4,750 per ounce in global markets in the near term.\nSilver, meanwhile, saw an exceptional rally, jumping nearly 14 per cent, or Rs 35,037, on the MCX during the week to hit a lifetime high of Rs 2,92,960 per kilogram.\nGlobally, silver prices gained USD 9.2, or 11.6 per cent, to close at USD 88.53 per ounce, after touching a record high of USD 93.75 last week.\n\u201cSilver\u2019s parabolic rally continued as prices gained more than 11.5 per cent for the week, as some profit-booking and consolidation were seen in the last couple of trading sessions, following reports that the Trump administration won\u2019t be levying tariffs on critical miners for now,\u201d Mer said.\nWhile silver is likely to remain supported, analysts cautioned that the sharp surge could be followed by a correction as prices approach the USD 100 per ounce level. \u201cWe expect a big corrective move either before or after the USD 100 is breached,\u201d Mer added.\nVijay Kuppa, CEO of InCred Money, said both gold and silver remain structurally positive despite near-term volatility.\n\u201cCentral banks are adding gold to their reserves, while ETF inflows are absorbing a significant portion of supply. Geopolitical tensions and persistent macroeconomic uncertainty reinforce the role of holding precious metals as portfolio hedges,\u201d he said.\nOn silver, Kuppa noted that its dual role as both a precious and industrial metal continues to support long-term demand. \u201cAfter an extended rally, phases of consolidation and price corrections are normal. Short-term pullbacks do not necessarily change the broader trend and are often part of the price-discovery process,\u201d he added.\n*With Agency Inputs"

Damascus and the SDF have signed similar understandings before.\nBut what made this latest agreement different was the timing.\nThe 14-point accord, released late on Sunday by Syria's information ministry, followed two days of rapid advances by government forces into areas the SDF had controlled for years, including Arab-majority districts where its grip had long appeared fragile.\nGovernment forces also seized the country's largest oil field early on Sunday, extending state control across large swathes of northern and eastern Syria.\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\nThe battlefield shift stripped the SDF of both revenue and leverage before talks even began, analysts told Middle East Eye.\nUnder the agreement, the SDF accepted the \"full and immediate administrative and military handover\" of Raqqa in the north and Deir Ezzor in the east, leaving it with only northeastern Hasakah.\nFor those who followed the talks closely, the contrast between earlier negotiations and the current agreement was stark.\nSDF on the backfoot\nIn early January 2026, the SDF rejected a proposal that would have allowed the incorporation of three regional divisions spanning Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa, alongside shared control of border crossings.\nUnder the new deal, the balance has shifted decisively. The SDF will hand full control of border crossings to Damascus, and its fighters will enter the Syrian army as individuals rather than as organised units.\nState institutions in the previously semi-autonomous, Kurdish-dominated northeast will now fall under central government authority.\n'Damascus has the upper hand now and wants to transform the military success into a political gain. The agreement is meant to achieve that'\n- Fadil Hanci, Syria analyst\nPoint four of the deal makes the balance of power explicit.\nThe Syrian government \"shall take control of all border crossings, oil fields, and gas fields in the region, with protection secured by regular forces to ensure the return of resources to the Syrian state, while considering the special case of Kurdish areas\".\nThe agreement also addresses international concern over ISIS detainees held by the SDF, stating that Damascus \"assumes full legal and security responsibility for them\" and will continue operations against remaining ISIS elements.\nOmer Ozkizilcik, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the terms looked strikingly familiar.\nHe told MEE that the deal largely replicated what Ankara and Damascus offered the SDF a year ago as an \"olive branch to not engage in escalation and to resolve this peacefully\".\nIn March last year, the SDF agreed in principle to integrate its civilian and military structures into the state.\nThat announcement prompted celebrations in several cities, with many Kurds hoping it would deliver equal citizenship and constitutional recognition. But implementation stalled with the SDF largely forgoing implementation.\nDamascus regains initiative against SDF\nIn December, Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned that the SDF was \"in coordination with Israel\" to obstruct Syria's stabilisation.\n\"The SDF stalled and did not implement the offer from Ankara and Damascus, and now we are seeing them agreeing to the same offer as last time,\" Ozkizilcik said.\nAccording to Sunday's agreement, another central clause requires foreign SDF elements linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, designated a \"terrorist\" organisation by Turkey, the European Union and the United States, to leave Syria.\nRe"

An administration official told Reuters that additional oil sales are expected in the coming days and weeks.\nAlongside the Venezuelan oil sale, U.S. forces on Thursday seized a sixth oil tanker linked to Venezuela, signaling a continued tightening of the U.S. blockade on Venezuela's oil exports. Shipping analytics provider Kpler revealed that the only vessels loading crude at Venezuela's ports are tankers headed for the U.S. or those transporting oil to Venezuelan refineries.\nThe U.S. is one of the world's largest oil producers. Despite that, it still eyes Venezuelan oil. This raises an important question: Why does the U.S. still need Venezuelan oil?\nIndustrial Complementarities and Geopolitical Ambitions\nAlthough the U.S. now produces more crude than any other country, thanks to a boom in drilling for lighter shale oil, most of its refineries were designed to process heavier grades of oil. Nearly 70 percent of the U.S. refining capacity operates most efficiently with heavier crude, which is why 90 percent of U.S. oil imports are heavy sour crude, according to the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers.\nVenezuela, which holds the world's largest proven oil reserves \u2013 estimated at 303 billion barrels, or about 17 percent of the global total \u2013 has a wealth of heavy sour crude, primarily located in the Orinoco Oil Belt.\nShon Hiatt, director of the Zage Business of Energy Initiative at the University of Southern California, told Al Jazeera that U.S. refineries would greatly benefit from an increase in Venezuelan oil exports. He noted that heavy Canadian crude has displaced Venezuelan crude over the years due to sanctions. If Venezuela's heavy crude exports rise again, it could push Canadian oil out of the market, as Venezuelan crude is typically sold at a lower price to U.S. refineries.\nBeyond the industrial benefits, Marcus Vinicius De Freitas, a senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, told CGTN that the U.S. views Venezuelan oil as a means to assert hegemony in the Western Hemisphere. \"The U.S. wants to maintain its privileged and hegemonic position within the Americas,\" he explained.\nChallenges Ahead\nWhile Trump aims for U.S. companies to dominate the global energy market by revitalizing Venezuelan oil production, some major U.S. oil firms remain hesitant.\nExxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump during a White House meeting on January 9, alongside other oil executives, that Venezuela would need to reform its laws before it could become an attractive investment opportunity. \"If we look at the legal and commercial frameworks in place today in Venezuela, it's uninvestable,\" Woods said.\nAnalysts have voiced doubts about U.S. oil companies rushing to invest in Venezuela, given the uncertain political situation and the global oil supply glut. \"You need political stability before companies will consider such investments,\" Daniel Sternoff, a senior fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told AP. \"We have more questions than answers about Venezuela's future government.\"\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright acknowledged that rebuilding Venezuela's oil infrastructure would take time. He added that increasing Venezuela's daily oil production to 3 million barrels could take 8 to 12 years.\nAdditionally, the increasing import of Venezuelan heavy oil is putting pressure on the survival of U.S. domestic oil companies. The Guardian recently reported that U.S. oil producers are already struggling with a global oil supply glut. In an article titled \"U.S. frackers were already facing a global oil supply glut.

                "body": "Gas Prices Are Headed Toward $2\nThe average price of a gallon of gasoline nationwide recently slipped below $3. Due to the war in Ukraine and concerns about the oil supply, it topped $5 in mid-2022. It was as low as $2.15 in 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. And it was about that low in 2016, due primarily to an oversupply of oil, resulting from the shale boom.\nQuick Read\nThe average price of a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. has slipped below $3 as oil supplies continue to increase.\nGas prices could fall to $2, and least in some states, if not nationwide.\nSome investors get rich while others struggle because they never learned there are two completely different strategies to building wealth. Don\u2019t make the same mistake, learn about both here.\nThe supply issue has returned. The International Energy Agency says oil supplies could continue to increase until 2030. Demand could stay high until 2050. One reason for the rise is the lack of worldwide clean energy policies and any effort to enforce those if they emerge. Another reason is that OPEC+ has increased production. The United States is pumping oil at a record pace.\nGas prices have already dropped to near $2 in some parts of the nation. In one area of Oklahoma, they reached $2.19 this month. The state\u2019s average is $2.49, and the $2.19 price is unlikely to hold for long. The circumstances of the long term are different.\nThree factors have the most significant influence on gas prices. One is the price of oil. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude was $80 a barrel at the start of this year and recently dropped below $60. Bank of America recently forecast that the price of Brent crude could fall as low as $50, given OPEC+\u2019s current production.\nAdvertisement\nThe next significant influence on oil prices is the location of refineries and the transportation distance from them. Refineries that produce large quantities of gasoline have a significant impact. Because of the huge refineries on the Gulf, south of Houston, Texas and neighboring states are more likely to have cheap gas than almost anywhere else in America.\nLNG Export Demand Driving Natural Gas to Highs: 5 Strong Buy Dividend Leaders\nFinally, there are state taxes and levies, which are extremely low in some states and are very unlikely to rise. The national average is approximately $0.50 per gallon. However, in Texas and Louisiana, they are $0.20.\nWill gas prices in the U.S. fall to $2? In some states, probably. On a national basis, if oil prices continue to fall, that may be the price nationwide."

                "body": "WTI bounces off one-week low and retakes $58.00 mark; lacks bullish conviction\n|- WTI attracts some dip-buyers following a bearish gap opening at the start of a new week.\n- Concerns that the US military action against Iran could disrupt Oil supplies offer support.\n- Expectations that Trump\u2019s Venezuela oil plan would increase supplies cap the black liquid.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) US Crude Oil prices rebound from the $58.70 area, or a one-week low touched during the Asian session, and fill a major part of the bearish gap opening on Monday. The commodity currently trades around the $59.20 region, down only 0.15% for the day, amid mixed cues.\nLingering worries about a possible US military strike against Iran, which could disrupt oil supplies, turned out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the black liquid. In fact, the US Navy\u2019s aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln pivoted west after operating in the South China Sea and was expected to arrive in the Persian Gulf this week. This keeps geopolitical risks in play and lends support to Crude Oil prices.\nThe upside potential, however, seems limited amid expectations that the US control of Venezuela\u2019s oil will likely increase global supplies. US President Donald Trump had said earlier this month that Venezuela would be turning over 30 million to 50 million barrels of high-quality, sanctioned oil to the US. Moreover, Trump reportedly is planning to control the Venezuelan oil industry for several years to come.\nThis might deter traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around Crude Oil prices amid relatively thin trading volumes on the back of a holiday in the US. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before confirming that the recent pullback from a nearly three-month top, levels just above the $62.00 mark touched last week, has run its course and positioning for further gains.\nWTI Oil FAQs\nWTI Oil is a type of Crude Oil sold on international markets. The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as \u201clight\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined. It is sourced in the United States and distributed via the Cushing hub, which is considered \u201cThe Pipeline Crossroads of the World\u201d. It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API\u2019s report is published every Tuesday and EIA\u2019s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings. Their decisions often impact WTI Oil prices. When OPEC decides to lower quotas, it can tighten supply, pushing up Oil prices. When OPEC increases production, it has the opposite effect.

Sellers defended the upside at around the 1.1700 level for a second consecutive week, despite broad US Dollar (USD) weakness. Overall, it was a dull week in terms of price action, regardless of the excess of political and macroeconomic headlines.\nTrump amplifies geopolitical noise\nUnited States (US) President Donald Trump did not stop after taking over Venezuela a couple of weeks ago. Not only did he continue his campaign to seize Greenland, but added Iran to the list of countries in which he is willing to intervene.\nProtests in the Middle Eastern country began at the end of December 2025, after the Iranian rial plunged to record lows. The deterioration of the local economy was the initial catalyst, but escalated and spread like wildfire throughout the country, becoming a massive fight against the theocratic government. The latter violent response resulted in what the world believes are thousands of deaths. US President Trump threatened military intervention, warning that if the government keeps \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d the US \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d As days went by, Trump downed the tone, saying that the killing appeared to be ending. Still, the White House stressed that \u201call options remain on the table.\u201d\nThe Federal Reserve holds the key\nPolitical noise also from the inside: The US Department of Justice (DoJ) served the Federal Reserve (Fed) with subpoenas and threatened a criminal indictment on Chair Jerome Powell for his testimony before Congress regarding the Fed\u2019s headquarters renovation. In an unprecedented move, Powell responded by openly saying that such a probe is the result of the Fed\u2019s refusal to cut interest rates at a faster pace.\nPowell said he believed it was opened due to Donald Trump's anger over the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates despite repeated public pressure from the president.\nThe indictment had a relatively low negative impact on market sentiment. And there\u2019s a reason why: Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s mandate will end this May. Whoever will come after him remains a mystery, as President Trump keeps saying he will \u201csoon\u201d announce Powell\u2019s successor, but that \u201csoon\u201d never arrives.\nAnd for sure, Powell\u2019s successor is the key to the USD's next trend. Speculative interest is currently overwhelmed by uncertainty about what the central bank would or would not do next. Fed officials had hinted at one rate cut in 2026 and no action in the first meeting of the year. Investors maintain bets of at least two rate cuts throughout the year, but don\u2019t expect any action in January.\nWhether the next Fed head will lean hawkish or dovish remains a mystery. And as long as the mystery continues, market participants have no new bets to place, partially explaining the current stalemate across the FX board.\nUnimpressive data adds to dull trading\nData releases have been well short of interesting these last few days. The US reported December Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures that came in pretty much in line with the market expectations, yet still signaled that price pressures remain sticky. Annualized inflation, as measured by the CPI, rose by 2.7% in the twelve months to December, while the core reading printed at 2.6%. On a monthly basis, the CPI rose by 0.3%, with the three readings matching November\u2019s figures.\nThe US also released November Retail Sales, which rose by 0.6%, improving from a revised -0.1% in October. However, Retail Sales Control Group, the smoothed figure, came in at 0.4%, shrinking from the previous 0.6%.\nFinally, the US published October and November Producer Price Index (PPI) data, with the annu"

Shorts were trimmed by just 243 contracts, while large speculators remained net-short for a 31st consecutive week, effectively unchanged at -3.2k contracts.\nEuro (EUR)\nLarge speculators turned more cautious on the euro, with net exposure falling by 30.2k contracts on the week \u2014 the sharpest decline since November 2024. Gross longs were cut aggressively, while gross shorts rose, signalling fading speculative conviction despite elevated prices.\nSource: CFTC (COT), LSEG\nJapanese yen (JPY)\nLarge speculators flipped to net-short exposure on the yen for the first time in 12 months. That this occurred just one week ahead of the Bank of Japan policy meeting highlights a lack of conviction in any near-term hawkish shift. The move has pushed percent ranks to 0% across both 3-month and 1-year horizons, flagging a sentiment extreme.\nSwiss franc (CHF)\nNet-short exposure among asset managers has reached a record high, pushing percent ranks to 0% across all three time horizons and warning of a bearish sentiment extreme.\nCanadian dollar (CAD)\nLarge speculators remain net-short CAD, with positioning effectively flat on the week. However, gross longs rose to their highest level since July 2021. The 1- and 3-year percent ranks sit near range highs, with the 3-month close behind \u2014 another warning of stretched sentiment. Asset managers remain marginally net-long, though conviction remains muted.\nNew Zealand Dollar (NZD)\nSentiment appears to be turning in favour of the New Zealand dollar. The 3-month percent rank has rebounded from its lows, with the 1-year measure lagging behind. While the 3-year rank remains near range lows, positioning may be primed to mean-revert higher as the RBNZ signals an end to its easing cycle and domestic data continues to firm.\nAustralian Dollar (AUD):\nBy contrast, AUD positioning hints at a potential cycle high, with both 1-year and 3-month percent ranks at 100%. Large speculators and asset managers remain net-short, although asset managers increased gross long exposure and AUD/USD has already bounced sharply from its cycle lows. With geopolitical risks tied to Trump rhetoric and renewed headlines around Iran and Greenland, the setup argues for consolidation or a pullback rather than fresh upside.\nFX Futures Positioning | COT Report (IMM Data)\nUSD/JPY Futures Positioning | COT Report\nIt is somewhat ironic that large speculators have only just flipped to net-short yen futures, as price action alone already points to a sentiment extreme.

                "body": "EUR/USD rises toward 1.1650 despite increased risk aversion\n- EUR/USD advances despite heightened safe-haven flows linked to the US\u2013Greenland uncertainty.\n- President Trump says tariffs will be imposed on eight European countries opposing his Greenland proposal.\n- The US Dollar may regain ground as strong labor data delays Fed rate-cut expectations until June.\nEUR/USD gains ground after four days of losses, trading around 1.1630 during the Asian hours on Monday. The upside in the risk-sensitive pair may remain capped amid rising safe-haven demand, driven by escalating uncertainty surrounding the US\u2013Greenland issue.\nAccording to Bloomberg, US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he would impose tariffs on eight European countries opposing his proposal to acquire Greenland. Trump stated that a 10% tariff would be levied on goods from EU members Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland, as well as Britain and Norway, effective February 1, until the US is permitted to purchase Greenland.\nMeanwhile, European Union ambassadors reached a broad agreement on Sunday to step up efforts to dissuade Trump from implementing the tariffs, while also preparing retaliatory measures should the duties proceed.\nThe US Dollar (USD) could regain ground against its major peers as stronger US labor market data have pushed back expectations for further Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts until June. Fed officials have signaled little urgency to ease policy further until there is clearer evidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% target.\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley analysts revised their 2026 outlook, now forecasting one rate cut in June followed by another in September, compared with their previous expectation of cuts in January and April.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are "

In case of the weaker-than-expected outcomes, these could drag the Cable lower against the USD in the near term.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a "

                "body": "Traders of the GBP/USD will have to decide on their personal perspectives while judging technical, fundamental and behavioral sentiment this coming week.\nOn the 6th of January the GBP/USD was at nearly 1.35680. Last Tuesday the GBP/USD was around 1.34955 as the high for the week, but the currency pair closed close to 1.33764 going into this weekend. The incremental lower action since the highs made in the first week of January do correlate to the broad Forex markets.\nThe highs seen on the 6th of January touched values last seen in September of 2025, but remained far below the apex highs attained then and in the month of June when the 1.37000 value was penetrated. However, the recent lower price action in the GBP/USD is still within the lower middle crux of the currency pair\u2019s value via a one month chart. And near higher elements when a GBP/USD three month technical glance is taken.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nRecent Downturn and Sentiment\nThe U.K still is producing rather lackluster economic data, this Tuesday employment data will come from Britain, and inflation via CPI statistics will be published on Wednesday. Yet, U.S data and influence via USD centric action remains the dominant force with the GBP. U.S economic data via its inflation statistics were rather mixed, but the most recent releases (October and November data were released last week at the same time due to the U.S government shutdown a couple of months ago) showed inflation remained rather tame \u2013 this if you looked at the November results.\nHowever, this point can be argued and certainly did not impact the USD with weakness. In fact the USD got stronger and the downwards price of action of the GBP/USD and the EUR/USD reflected this trend. It can be said that more risk adverse attitudes in the financial markets caused the selloff of the GBP/USD, which picked up moment from late Tuesday and into the remainder of the week. The close of nearly 1.33764 is traversing territory last seen around the 19th of December.\nU.S Fed Outlook and Global Risks Influences\nThe U.S Federal Reserve is suffering from a rather public debate in its FOMC about the direction of interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and President Trump are engaged in a rather unprecedented tussle regarding policy.\n- The firefight President Trump is trying to start with the Fed may have financial institutions rather nervous about short and near-term effects on the USD.\n- The Fed will conduct its next FOMC meeting the end of January, and not many analysts are predicting a rate cut in this upcoming meeting.\n- Also the threat of escalating tension in the Middle East due to the Iranian situation has likely increased nervousness with financial institutions, this as they look forward and deal with near-term commercial cash positions.\nGBP/USD Weekly Outlook:\nSpeculative price range for GBP/USD is 1.32950 to 1.35020\nDay traders and financial institutions may both feel that the GBP/USD is oversold at its current levels, but nervous sentiment early this coming week should be watched. Depending on news developments the USD could see rather volatile price action due to rhetoric which could influence sentiment rather dramatically in the near-term. If global conditions remain tranquil this could help ease tensions among large institutions, but this doesn\u2019t feel likely. This weekend has produced loud noise regarding threats of more tariffs against Europe due to political diatribes from President Trump about Greenland once again, yes, believe it or not. Thus, large traders are getting hit from many directions regarding noise in the markets.\nAlso it should be remembered that President Trump is scheduled to speak in the middle of this week at the Davos summit in Switzerland. Trump could engage in a calm tranquil policy speech, or he could easily veer off into rhetoric which makes financial markets nervous. If nervousness wins the day, this could create downwards trajectory for the GBP/USD. Although the GBP/USD may be thought of "

Volatility is compressed, correlations are fading, and price action suggests markets are waiting for an external catalyst rather than trading domestic fundamentals.\nGeopolitical risks and key US data releases dominate the near-term outlook, skewing risks modestly lower for AUD/USD. While Australian yields remain elevated and Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) hike speculation lingers, these factors have so far failed to generate sustained upside.\nUntil a clearer driver emerges, AUD/USD looks set to remain rangebound, with traders focused on geopolitics, US data surprises and shifts in broader risk sentiment.\nView related analysis:\n- ASX 200 Market Outlook: Materials Surge, CBA Support Defies Bears\n- Australian Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, EUR/AUD\n- FX Futures Positioning: EUR/USD, USD/CHF, USD/CAD, USD/JPY | COT Report\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Momentum Falters Near Highs\nAustralian Dollar Snapshot: Mixed Signals Across FX Crosses\nThe Australian dollar continues to trade without a clear directional bias, with mixed signals across major FX crosses and volatility remaining compressed.\n- NZD/USD was the strongest major FX pair last week, supported by business confidence rising to a 12-year high and firmer manufacturing PMI. This added a modest lift to Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) hike expectations following a prolonged easing cycle.\n- AUD/NZD formed a bearish inside day on Friday, alongside a two-week bearish reversal pattern (dark cloud cover), warning of potential weakness after its strong rally from the 2025 low.\n- AUD/USD was flat for a second consecutive week, with realised volatility at its lowest in 12 weeks and a weekly high-to-low range below 1%.\n- The Australian dollar pushed higher against the euro, sending EUR/AUD to its most bearish weekly close in 42 weeks.\n- A shooting-star week formed on AUD/JPY, warning of exhaustion following its 24% rally from the April low.\nData source: CME, LSEG\nGeopolitical Risks and US Data Keep AUD/USD Capped\nGeopolitical risks continue to build, with President Trump threatening tariffs on countries opposing a US hostile takeover of Greenland \u2014 a stance that naturally places Denmark in the firing line. Whether this is a serious policy threat or just another throwaway comment remains to be seen. But given the US kicked off the year with a hostile takeover of Venezuela, nothing can be ruled out for now.\nGeopolitics aside, key US data this week includes GDP and PCE inflation. Neither is likely to be a major market mover, but both arguably carry more upside risk for the US dollar than downside. That dynamic could cap near-term upside for AUD/USD.\nDecember Employment: Seasonal Boost or False Signal?\nDecember employment figures are released on Thursday and could recoup some of the softness seen in November\u2019s data. Headline employment fell by 21.3k, with full-time jobs down 56.5k. The participation rate slipped to 66.7%, while unemployment remained steady at 4.3%. With seasonality potentially boosting the December print, a stronger result could reignite speculation around a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) hike.\nData source: ABS, LSEG\nHowever, December labour data is notoriously noisy. Students enter the workforce during the long summer break, while hiring in hospitality, retail and tourism often spikes. Beyond these temporary boosts, productivity arguably softens.\nFor those outside Australia, school holidays can run for around two months, it is the hottest time of the year, and \u201choliday mode\u201d is deeply ingrained in the culture. As a result, it is difficult to read too much into December employment figures from a fundamental perspective \u2014 even if markets still react to the headline.\nAUD/USD Futures Positioning \u2013 COT Report\nNet short exposure among large speculators was effectively flat, as a "

The indicator showed a year-over-year increase to 3.5% in December, up from the previous 3.2%. On a monthly basis, inflation jumped by 1.0% in December 2025, marking the fastest growth since December 2023 and a notable acceleration from the 0.3% rise seen in the prior two months.\nThe AUD/USD exchange rate remained stable after China released key economic figures. Given the strong trade relationship between Australia and China, shifts in China\u2019s economic performance can significantly influence the Australian Dollar.\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), China\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2025, up from 1.1% in the previous quarter and surpassing the 1.0% market forecast. Annually, GDP grew by 4.5% in Q4, slightly lower than the 4.8% in Q3 but still above the anticipated 4.4%.\nRetail sales in China for December increased by 0.9% year-over-year, falling short of both the 1.2% projection and November\u2019s 1.3% growth. Conversely, industrial production rose by 5.2% year-over-year, outperforming the 5.0% estimate and improving from 4.8% in November.\nUS Dollar Under Pressure Amid Rising Geopolitical Tensions\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the dollar\u2019s value against a basket of six major currencies, slipped to around 99.20. US financial markets were closed on Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n- The dollar faced additional headwinds as risk aversion increased due to escalating uncertainty over the US\u2013Greenland dispute. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on eight European nations opposing his proposal to purchase Greenland.\n- Bloomberg reported that Trump intends to implement a 10% tariff on imports from Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, the United Kingdom, and Norway starting February 1, unless the US is allowed to acquire Greenland.\n- Recent US labor market data have delayed expectations for further Federal Reserve interest rate reductions until June. Fed officials have indicated they are in no rush to cut rates further until there is more convincing evidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% goal.\n- Morgan Stanley has updated its 2026 forecast, now predicting a rate cut in June followed by another in September, revising its earlier outlook for cuts in January and April.\n- The US Department of Labor reported last Thursday that initial jobless claims unexpectedly dropped to 198,000 for the week ending January 10, beating the expected 215,000 and down from the previous week\u2019s revised 207,000. This data suggests layoffs remain limited and the labor market is resilient despite prolonged high borrowing costs.\n- Core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes food and energy, increased by 0.2% in December, coming in below expectations. Annual core inflation held steady at 2.6%, matching a four-year low. The figures provide clearer evidence of easing inflation, as previous data had been affected by government shutdowns. Headline CPI rose by 0.3% month-over-month in December 2025, in line with forecasts and mirroring September\u2019s increase. Yearly inflation remains at 2.7% as anticipated.\n- Officials from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) noted that inflation has dropped significantly from its 2022 high, though recent numbers indicate renewed upward pressure. Headline CPI slowed to 3.4% year-over-year in November, the lowest since August, but still above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target range.

                "body": "USD/JPY faces a key test as rising bets on a Bank of Japan rate hike clash with concerns about Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP and fiscal spending plans.\nLast week, the USD/JPY pair surged to a mid-week high of 159.453. Markets reacted to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s hint at a snap election and expectations of fiscal spending spiraling Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio.\nNotably, 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields soared to 2.198%, the highest level in decades, amid rising risk premiums on JGBs, given concerns about fiscal spending and national debt levels.\nDespite concerns about Japan\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio, expectations that the BoJ will bring forward rate hikes to combat higher import prices support a cautiously bullish short-term, but a bearish medium-term outlook.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nThe Japanese economy came under scrutiny in early trading on Monday, January 19. Japanese machinery tool orders fell 6.4% year-on-year in November, down sharply from 12.5% in October.\nFalling machinery orders could be an indication of waning business sentiment and concerns about the economic outlook. Typically, deteriorating business sentiment has an impact on the labor market and wage growth. A cooling labor market and softer wage growth would weaken consumer sentiment, curb household spending, and dampen demand-driven inflation.\nA softer inflation outlook would lower bets on a near-term BoJ rate hike, weighing on the yen.\nUSD/JPY rose from 157.502 to 157.880 following the release of the data, reflecting the potential impact of the data on the BoJ\u2019s rate path. Despite the data and USD/JPY response, the weaker yen may incentivize the BoJ to tighten monetary policy sooner rather than later, which would support a bullish price outlook.\nAccording to January\u2019s Reuters poll, conducted between January 6-13, 43% of economists predicted a July BoJ rate hike, 27% a June hike, and just 8% an April hike. Economists expect the BoJ to delay raising interest rates to assess the impact of December\u2019s rate hike on the economy.\nHowever, the weaker yen has pushed import prices higher, reducing households\u2019 purchasing power. A more hawkish BoJ policy stance, including hints at cutting JGB purchases, would likely offer much-needed relief. Private consumption is a key contributor to Japan\u2019s economy, accounting for roughly 60% of GDP.\nThe BoJ monetary policy decision is set for January 23. 65 of 67 economists polled expected the BoJ to keep rates steady in January and March. The slump in machinery orders supported the economists\u2019 outlook. But, political developments and fiscal spending plans are likely to change the narrative, suggesting a USD/JPY pullback from current levels. Sentiment toward the BoJ\u2019s rate path through H1 2026 will be key, given that most economists expect a rate hike in July.\nThe political uncertainty and fiscal concerns support a cautiously bullish short-term price outlook for USD/JPY. Meanwhile, warnings of yen interventions and expectations of Bank of Japan rate hikes reinforce the bearish medium-term projection. Hawkish BoJ rhetoric and intervention warnings would likely challenge the cautiously bullish short-term outlook.\nRising Japan-China tensions have added another layer of policy uncertainty into the mix. US tariffs and friction with China have led economists to predict slower growth and softer inflation in 2026.\nNatixis Asia Pacific Chief Economist Alicia Garcia Herrero commented:\n\u201cAll in all, Japan\u2019s GDP is expected to slow to +0.9% in 2026 from +1.3% in 2025, dragged by higher US tariffs and tensions with China. [\u2026] With the Yen remaining relatively weak, inflation is expected to slow down only to +2.3% YoY in 2026 from +3.1% YoY in 2025.\u201d\nOn the BoJ\u2019s monetary policy stance, Alicia Garcia Herrero stated:\n\u201cWith PM Takaichi\u2019s strong preference for a lax monetary policy to realize her vision, the BoJ is likely to remain cautious in normalizing fu"

Speculations that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may soon call a snap election to cement her authority and further boost the expansionary fiscal policy hold back the JPY bulls from placing aggressive bets. However, a warning of a possible intervention by Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama, to counter weakness in the domestic currency, might continue to act as a tailwind for the JPY.\nFurthermore, prospects for an early interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) should contribute to limiting losses for the JPY. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump vowed on Saturday to impose tariffs on eight European countries that have opposed his plan to take Greenland, reigniting trade war concerns. This comes on top of geopolitical risks and tempers investors' appetite for riskier assets, which should lend an additional boost to the safe-haven JPY. The USD, on the other hand, retreats from its highest level since December 9. This warrants caution before confirming that the USD/JPY pair's pullback from the 18-month top, touched last week, has run its course and positioning for any further recovery.\nJapanese Yen bulls have the upper hand amid flight to safety, intervention fears and BoJ rate hike bets\n- Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said on Friday that all options, including a direct and coordinated intervention with the US, are being considered to address the recent weakness in the Japanese Yen.\n- A Reuters report, citing sources, suggests that some policymakers inside the Bank of Japan see scope to raise interest rates sooner than markets currently expect, as early as April, further lending support to the JPY.\n- US President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 10% tariff on goods from eight European countries starting from February 1, until the US is allowed to buy Greenland, triggering a fresh wave of the risk-aversion trade.\n- European Union ambassadors reached a broad agreement on Sunday to intensify efforts to dissuade Trump from imposing levies on allies, while also preparing retaliatory measures should the duties go ahead.\n- Moreover, geopolitical risks stemming from the protracted Russia-Ukraine war and lingering worries about a possible US military strike against Iran benefit the JPY's safe-haven status at the start of a new week.\n- The US Dollar attracts heavy selling as fresh trade war fears trigger a crisis of confidence in US assets, which offsets reduced bets for two more interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve by the end of this year.\n- Reports suggest that Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi plans to dissolve parliament and call a snap parliamentary election in the first half of February to seek public backing for her fiscally expansionist policies.\n- With Takaichi's popularity running high, a win would bolster her coalition government\u2019s parliamentary majority and cement her authority to pursue her spending plans, which warrants caution for the JPY bulls.\n- Traders might also opt to wait for the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index on Thursday and the crucial BoJ monetary policy decision on Friday before placing fresh directional bets.\nUSD/JPY finds some support near 61.8% Fibo. level; not out of the woods yet\nThe USD/JPY pair finds decent support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent move up from the monthly peak.

                "body": "The USD/JPY pair fell to around 157.80 in the early Asian session on Monday. Japan\u2019s government signalled potential intervention to support the Yen, causing its value to increase against the US Dollar. The US observed the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, leaving markets closed.\nPossible Joint Intervention\nJapan\u2019s Finance Minister, Satsuki Katayama, hinted at the possibility of joint intervention with the US to tackle the Yen\u2019s weakness. She emphasised that all options, including direct currency intervention, are on the table. Improved US labour market data have postponed expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts until June.\nThis situation may bolster the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. Federal Reserve officials see no urgency to act further, waiting for more evidence that inflation will ease toward their 2% target. Morgan Stanley analysts predicted rate cuts in June and September 2026.\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s value is influenced by Japan\u2019s economic performance, the Bank of Japan\u2019s policies, and the bond yield differential between Japan and the US. The Yen is often considered a safe haven, attracting investors during market stress. The Bank of Japan\u2019s gradual policy change since 2024 has given some support to the Yen.\nWith the USD/JPY pair hovering just below the 158.00 mark, the immediate risk is a sudden, sharp drop triggered by Japanese authorities. We are seeing clear verbal warnings about intervention, which creates a highly unstable environment for anyone holding long dollar positions. This means traders should be prepared for a spike in volatility in the coming days.\nHistorical Precedent and Current Positioning\nLooking back, we saw similar jawboning before the Ministry of Finance stepped in with massive yen purchases back in 2024 when the pair crossed the 160 threshold. The current level is uncomfortably close to that pain point, suggesting the threat of real action is not a bluff. This historical precedent makes holding unhedged positions extremely risky.\nFor derivative traders, this setup screams for buying protection against a downturn. The implied volatility on USD/JPY options has already risen, with the JPM G7 Volatility Index climbing to a three-month high of 8.5% last week. Purchasing yen call options or USD/JPY put options offers a way to profit from, or hedge against, a sudden intervention-driven slide.\nThe risk of a violent move is magnified by crowded positioning. The latest CFTC data from the week ending January 13th showed that speculative net short positions on the Japanese Yen are still near multi-year highs, exceeding 120,000 contracts. An intervention could trigger a massive short squeeze, forcing these traders to buy back yen and accelerating the pair\u2019s fall.\nHowever, the Federal Reserve provides a strong counter-narrative that should limit how far the pair can fall. Following strong labor data in December 2025, the market has drastically repriced Fed expectations. The probability of a rate cut by March has plummeted from over 70% just a month ago to under 20% today.\nThis fundamental divergence suggests any intervention-led dip in USD/JPY might be temporary and could represent a buying opportunity for those with a longer horizon. Therefore, using options to define risk is superior to trading spot currency right now. A strategy could involve buying short-dated puts to protect against the immediate intervention risk while looking for opportunities to enter bullish positions if the pair experiences a significant, policy-driven drop."

The pair depreciates as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) receives support from higher Oil prices, given Canada\u2019s status as the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price extends its gains for the second successive session, trading around $59.40 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices appreciate following China\u2019s key economic data.\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that China\u2019s industrial production rose 5.2% year-over-year YoY in December, accelerating from 4.8% in November, supported by resilient export-driven manufacturing activity. China\u2019s GDP expanded 1.2% QoQ in Q4 2025, up from 1.1% in Q3 and above the 1.0% consensus. On a YoY basis, growth eased to 4.5% from 4.8% but exceeded expectations of 4.4%.\nHowever, the upside in Oil prices may remain capped as easing tensions with Iran have reduced concerns over potential supply disruptions. Market anxiety subsided after US President Donald Trump signaled last week that he may delay any military action, following Iran\u2019s pledge not to carry out executions of protesters. However, Trump warned that forceful measures could still be taken if executions resume, leaving some geopolitical risk premium priced into the market.\nThe USD/CAD pair may regain its ground as the US Dollar (USD) could appreciate against its major peers, as stronger US labor market data has pushed back expectations for further Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts until June. Fed officials have signaled little urgency to ease policy further until there is clearer evidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% target.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts mor"

                "body": "Traders of the GBP/USD will have to decide on their personal perspectives while judging technical, fundamental and behavioral sentiment this coming week.\nOn the 6th of January the GBP/USD was at nearly 1.35680. Last Tuesday the GBP/USD was around 1.34955 as the high for the week, but the currency pair closed close to 1.33764 going into this weekend. The incremental lower action since the highs made in the first week of January do correlate to the broad Forex markets.\nThe highs seen on the 6th of January touched values last seen in September of 2025, but remained far below the apex highs attained then and in the month of June when the 1.37000 value was penetrated. However, the recent lower price action in the GBP/USD is still within the lower middle crux of the currency pair\u2019s value via a one month chart. And near higher elements when a GBP/USD three month technical glance is taken.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nRecent Downturn and Sentiment\nThe U.K still is producing rather lackluster economic data, this Tuesday employment data will come from Britain, and inflation via CPI statistics will be published on Wednesday. Yet, U.S data and influence via USD centric action remains the dominant force with the GBP. U.S economic data via its inflation statistics were rather mixed, but the most recent releases (October and November data were released last week at the same time due to the U.S government shutdown a couple of months ago) showed inflation remained rather tame \u2013 this if you looked at the November results.\nHowever, this point can be argued and certainly did not impact the USD with weakness. In fact the USD got stronger and the downwards price of action of the GBP/USD and the EUR/USD reflected this trend. It can be said that more risk adverse attitudes in the financial markets caused the selloff of the GBP/USD, which picked up moment from late Tuesday and into the remainder of the week. The close of nearly 1.33764 is traversing territory last seen around the 19th of December.\nU.S Fed Outlook and Global Risks Influences\nThe U.S Federal Reserve is suffering from a rather public debate in its FOMC about the direction of interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and President Trump are engaged in a rather unprecedented tussle regarding policy.\n- The firefight President Trump is trying to start with the Fed may have financial institutions rather nervous about short and near-term effects on the USD.\n- The Fed will conduct its next FOMC meeting the end of January, and not many analysts are predicting a rate cut in this upcoming meeting.\n- Also the threat of escalating tension in the Middle East due to the Iranian situation has likely increased nervousness with financial institutions, this as they look forward and deal with near-term commercial cash positions.\nGBP/USD Weekly Outlook:\nSpeculative price range for GBP/USD is 1.32950 to 1.35020\nDay traders and financial institutions may both feel that the GBP/USD is oversold at its current levels, but nervous sentiment early this coming week should be watched. Depending on news developments the USD could see rather volatile price action due to rhetoric which could influence sentiment rather dramatically in the near-term. If global conditions remain tranquil this could help ease tensions among large institutions, but this doesn\u2019t feel likely. This weekend has produced loud noise regarding threats of more tariffs against Europe due to political diatribes from President Trump about Greenland once again, yes, believe it or not. Thus, large traders are getting hit from many directions regarding noise in the markets.\nAlso it should be remembered that President Trump is scheduled to speak in the middle of this week at the Davos summit in Switzerland. Trump could engage in a calm tranquil policy speech, or he could easily veer off into rhetoric which makes financial markets nervous. If nervousness wins the day, this could create downwards trajectory for the GBP/USD. Although the GBP/USD may be thought of "

On 6 January the pair printed a high around 1.3566\u20131.3568, revisiting territory last seen in September 2025 and still well below the June spike when 1.3700 was briefly traded. Last week\u2019s intraday high near 1.3495 failed to hold, and the market closed the week around 1.3376, effectively revisiting the band seen around 19 December. Short-term price action confirms a grinding, lower-high structure: first from 1.3566, then from the 1.3495 area, with sellers defending every test of the mid-1.35 handle. At the same time, a separate signal piece flags a drop to 1.3435 from that early-January peak, underlining how quickly intraday rallies are being sold and how heavy the pair feels above 1.3450. Even DailyForex\u2019s speculative range of 1.32950\u20131.35020 for the coming week tells you where the market thinks gravity sits: rallies are capped near 1.3500, while downside probes toward 1.3350\u20131.3300 are now on the table.\nUS CPI at 2.7% headline and 2.6% core keeps USD bid against GBP/USD\nOn the USD side, the data backdrop does not justify a weaker dollar, and GBP/USD is paying the price. The latest US CPI release showed headline inflation stuck at 2.7% for December, while core CPI ticked down only marginally to 2.6%. That is not a backdrop that forces the Federal Reserve into urgent easing. Markets have odds of no rate cut in the January FOMC very close to 100%, and multiple Fed officials \u2013 Stephen Miran, Neel Kashkari, John Williams and Anna Poulson \u2013 are scheduled to speak again after both jobs and inflation data. The result has been a stronger USD across the board rather than the textbook \u201cdisinflation = weaker dollar\u201d reaction. Risk-off flows after the inflation print and geopolitical headlines drove a synchronized sell-off in GBP/USD and EUR/USD, confirming that the dollar is still the defensive asset of choice. Add Trump\u2019s push for Fannie Mae to buy $200 billion in mortgage securities, which helps pin US yields and supports the greenback, and you get a macro mix that makes it very hard for sterling to sustain levels above 1.35.\nUK data, soft demand and BoE easing risk cap upside for GBP/USD\nOn the GBP side, the macro story remains fragile and does not justify chasing GBP/USD higher while the USD is firm. The UK is still printing \u201cmediocre at best\u201d numbers: employment data are due on Tuesday and CPI on Wednesday, but the starting point is weak. Recent retail indicators show households closing 2025 cautiously; consumer demand has stayed soft despite the relief that November\u2019s Budget did not blow up gilt markets. Business surveys such as the Lloyds Business Barometer and the IoD confidence index have improved from the worst levels, but they sit close to historically weak territory and look more like a post-Budget sigh of relief than a real inflection in growth. On policy, several banks expect the Bank of England to cut rates during 2026. Rabobank explicitly frames sterling\u2019s recent resilience as positioning rather than a structural bullish story. Danske Bank openly recommends selling GBP/EUR with a target at 1.11, while Deutsche Bank also sees GBP/EUR sliding toward 1.11 over six months. Those cross-currency calls matter for GBP/USD because they underline a common theme: UK fundamentals do not support a sustained strong pound once the Budget euphoria fades and rate-cut speculation returns.\nHead-and-shoulders, channel break and 1.3355 Fibonacci level weigh on GBP/USD\nThe tec"

Today, cryptocurrency ETFs account for nearly $150 billion in assets with nearly half of that coming from the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT).\nBut if you're choosing to go with a Bitcoin ETF this year instead of buying Bitcoin directly through one of the exchanges, there are a couple of things you should know first.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\nImage source: Getty Images.\nBitcoin ETFs don't trade 24 hours a day like Bitcoin does\nBuying a Bitcoin ETF gives you the same exposure as buying Bitcoin itself. But when you own it through an ETF, you get the trading rules that come with it.\nSpecifically, Bitcoin ETFs trade during normal market hours. They don't trade around the clock like spot Bitcoin does. If you're a frequent crypto trader, this might make a Bitcoin ETF less attractive.\nYou need to consider management fees and expenses\nVirtually every ETF comes with a fee known as an expense ratio. The Bitcoin ETFs do as well. The iShares Bitcoin ETF's expense ratio of 0.25% is below average within this category, but it's something that will reduce returns over time. For something that can easily move up or down 5% in a day, a 0.25% annual fee may seem negligible, but it's something to keep in mind.\nAdvertisement\nShould you buy stock in iShares Bitcoin Trust right now?\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Bitcoin Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and iShares Bitcoin Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, the latest inflows into U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) suggest that traders are seeking increasingly directional bullish bets, moving away from the sophisticated arbitrage play.\nPrediction Market powered by\nThink of the trade this way: imagine buying a gallon of milk for $4 today because someone has signed a contract to buy it from you for $5 next month. You don't care if the price of milk crashes or skyrockets in between, because you\u2019ve already locked in your $1 profit.\nIn the crypto world, investors were doing this by buying spot bitcoin ETFs and \"shorting\" (betting against) bitcoin futures. It wasn't about bitcoin's price going up; it was just about pocketing the tiny price difference between the two.\nNow that the gap between \"now and \"later\" has shrunk, and the costs of funding such trade have risen, the trade has lost its luster, at least that's what the data shows.\nBut large investors are still looking for exposure to bitcoin, which has led them to ditch the sophisticated trades and play it the old-school way: bet on the long-term price rally potential.\nThe vanishing profit\nWhile spot ETFs in the U.S. have registered a net inflow of $1.2 billion, the total number of open or active standard and micro bitcoin futures contracts on the CME has increased by 33% to 55,947 contracts.\nThis combination of ETF inflows and an increase in CME open interest is usually associated with the \"cash-and-carry\" arbitrage.\nHowever, the latest ETF inflows are unlikely to be part of carry trades, as the \"basis\" \u2013 the price gap between CME futures and spot ETFs \u2013 has narrowed to levels that barely cover transaction costs and funding expenses.\n\"This view is reinforced by the currently subdued front-month basis of approximately 5.5%. After accounting for funding and execution costs, the implied carry appears close to zero, offering limited incentive to re-engage in the trade,\" Mark Pilipczuk, research analyst at CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\nOne of the main reasons is likely how boring the price swings have been for bitcoin. Since the big drop from its all-time high in October of last year, the price of bitcoin has been \"stuck\" around 90,000.\nLow volatility, smaller chances of price mismatch and less profitable to trade the \"gap.\" And the data is showing exactly that.\nBitcoin's annualized 30-day implied volatility, as represented by Volmex's BVIV index, has dropped to 40%, the lowest since October. It shows that expectations for price turbulence have hit a three-month low, according to analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.\n'Sticky' bullish bets\nThis shift marks a significant change in market microstructure, and it's bullish for bitcoin.\nMake no mistake: investors are still piling into spot ETFs, as evidenced by $1.2 billion in inflows. But the bets are not for the carry trade; rather, they are in favor of direct price upside for longer-term investments.\nAnalysts at Bitfinex are calling these new investors \"sticky\" as they are not here for quick profits based on price gaps, but are in it for the long haul, given that the volatility has vanished. Essentially, the big institutions feel safer diversifying their money into alternative assets like bitcoin, which has been lagging other assets such as precious metals and equities.\n\"Institutions ty"

The fund now oversees about $105.7 million, with the latest redemption wave signaling a notable loss of conviction among traders who had been betting against Bitcoin\u2019s price.\nThe scale of the outflows is significant for a leveraged inverse product. Such a sizable withdrawal in a single day suggests that a segment of the market may be locking in profits from earlier downside moves in Bitcoin\u2014or capitulating on the short thesis amid shifting technical conditions. It also highlights how quickly positioning can turn in leveraged crypto-linked ETFs, where sentiment often swings more violently than in traditional equity funds.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading at $95,249.92. Despite a 3-month decline of about 11.24%, the coin\u2019s short-term setup has brightened: its 1-day technical signal points to a Buy.

Transaction activity has seen a significant surge since mid-December, reversing a general slow decline that began in the middle of 2025.\nAt the same time, average gas fees have fallen to significant lows. The Block's data shows average transaction costs around $0.15 in gas, the lowest in the network's modern history. Etherscan gas data pegs the estimated transaction fees even lower, averaging around $0.04 for a swap on Sunday.\nThe unusual combination of peak activity and rock-bottom costs marks a turning point for Ethereum, which has long faced criticism for high and unpredictable fees that priced out smaller users during periods of congestion.\nThe surge in activity comes seven weeks after Ethereum's Fusaka hard fork went live, which introduced PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling) and kicked off the network's new twice-a-year upgrade schedule. The final Blob Parameters Only fork, deployed January 8, pushed the blob target to 14 and the maximum cap to 21, reducing data costs for Layer 2 rollups.\nThe collapse in mainnet gas fees reflects a separate but related trend. Ethereum's block gas limit rose from 45 million to 60 million in late November, a 100% increase from the start of 2025. As execution has shifted to Layer 2 networks, demand for mainnet blockspace has eased even as overall activity climbs.\nThe activity spike coincides with record stablecoin usage. Standard Chartered recently noted that stablecoin transfers now account for roughly 35% to 40% of all Ethereum transactions, with Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick declaring \"2026 will be the year of Ethereum.\"\nStaking activity has also reached new highs. Over 36 million ETH is now locked in staking contracts, representing roughly 30% of the circulating supply, according to ValidatorQueue data. The entry queue has swelled to over 2.5 million ETH, its highest level since August 2023, while the exit queue has dropped to near-zero.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently declared that 2026 will be the year Ethereum's community works to combat the \"backsliding\" of personal autonomy in crypto, expressing his views on blockchain privacy and user experience in a detailed X post. \"Every compromise of values that Ethereum has made up to this point - every moment where you might have been thinking, is it really worth diluting ourselves so much in the name of mainstream adoption - we are making that compromise no longer,\u201d Buterin said.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

                "body": "How Ethereum quietly crushed its $50 gas problem in 2026\nFor years, using Ethereum [ETH] felt expensive and out of reach for many people.\nDuring the 2021 bull market and the 2024 NFT boom, even a basic transaction could cost around $50, while more complex actions often cost much more.\nThese high fees showed how popular Ethereum had become, but they also kept many users out.\nThat situation has now changed. As of January 2026, Ethereum gas fees have dropped to $0.01, per Etherscan data.\nThis drop isn\u2019t because fewer people are using Ethereum. It\u2019s the result of major technical changes.\nFollowing the Fusaka upgrade in late 2025, the rollout of PeerDAS, and widespread Layer 2 adoption, Ethereum has cleared congestion on its main network.\nWhat was once a costly, crowded system now works as a fast and efficient settlement layer.\nIs Ethereum the new Solana?\nThis shift has also changed Ethereum\u2019s competition with Solana [SOL]. Solana was known for being cheap and fast, but Ethereum now offers similarly low fees.\nAs a result, the comparison is no longer just about cost.\nEthereum focuses on security and decentralization, while Solana prioritizes speed with a more demanding setup. Solana is still faster for certain use cases, but Ethereum\u2019s low fees remove the main reason users once left.\nHowever, lower fees do come with a trade-off.\nEthereum burns part of every transaction fee, and when fees were high, the ETH supply often shrank. With fees now very low, the burn has slowed, and ETH is slightly inflationary for the moment.\nThe most important signal is usage.\nOn the 17th of January 2026, Ethereum processed 2.6 million transactions in a single day, a new record. In the past, this level of activity would have caused congestion and high fees.\nThis time, the network ran smoothly, showing that Ethereum can now handle very high usage without becoming expensive again. This fundamental strength is beginning to reflect in the markets.\nMarket reaction\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,319.87, maintaining a steady climb with a 0.62% gain in the last 24 hours. In contrast, its primary rival, SOL, is feeling the heat.\nDespite its own robust ecosystem, SOL was currently trading at $142.26, down 1.23% over the same period.\nIn fact, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also recently declared that the original Web3 architecture, first outlined in 2014 and long considered a distant roadmap, is now a functional reality.\nAll in all, in 2026, Ethereum isn\u2019t just scaling; it\u2019s coming home.\nFinal Thoughts\n- Ethereum has finally become cheap enough for everyday use without sacrificing scale or security.\n- This shift is structural, not temporary, as upgrades like Fusaka, PeerDAS, and mature Layer 2s have permanently unclogged the mainnet."

His thesis: the protocol stayed trustless, but the defaults drifted. Wallets outsourced verification to centralized RPCs.\nDecentralized applications became server-dependent behemoths that leak user data to dozens of endpoints. Block building is concentrated in the hands of a few sophisticated actors. The base layer held, but the experience became something else entirely.\nThe response is a concrete menu of infrastructure fixes designed to make the trust-minimized path the easy path.\nVerified RPC clients that turn untrusted providers into locally verifiable endpoints. Private information retrieval to hide what users query from the servers they query. Fork-choice-enforced inclusion lists that make censorship resistance structurally enforceable. Block-level access lists make running a node cheaper and faster.\nAdditionally, Kohaku is the Ethereum Foundation's wallet-delivery vehicle for turning protocol research into default user behavior.\nHelios and the local RPC problem\nEthereum wallets today route nearly everything through remote procedure call providers: centralized services that answer queries about balances, state, and transaction status.\nHelios, a light client built by a16z crypto, converts data from an untrusted RPC into a verifiably safe local RPC. It syncs in roughly 2 seconds, runs a local JSON-RPC server on port 8545, and supports Ethereum and OP Stack networks like Optimism and Base.\nInstead of blindly trusting what a remote server returns, Helios verifies cryptographic proofs and serves locally verified data.\nThe trade-off is explicit: Helios still relies on weak subjectivity checkpoints for bootstrapping and leans on an upstream execution endpoint for certain data paths. It reduces trust, but does not erase it.\nHowever, the point is verifiability as a default user experience, not as a hobbyist stance. If wallets embed a verified light client path by default, RPC decentralization becomes a feature users experience rather than a technical preference they have to configure.\nThe Kohaku wallet effort, backed by the Ethereum Foundation, explicitly plans to ship with Helios integrated.\nPIR, ORAM, and the metadata leak problem\nPrivate payments are useless if every balance check and dapp interaction leaks metadata to servers that can monetize access patterns.\nPrivate information retrieval and oblivious RAM are the cryptographic tools designed to hide what users query from the providers they query. Vitalik's privacy roadmap outlines a progression from trusted execution environments toward PIR as the endgame for private reads.\nThe Privacy and Scaling Explorations team clearly frames the scale challenge: a trie with roughly 33 million leaves is about 1 gigabyte, and PIR aims to bring bandwidth per query down to the kilobyte range, with significant server-side computational trade-offs.\nThis is still research and early engineering. The language around 2026 should present PIR and ORAM as trajectories and prototypes, rather than as something users have today.\nYet, the forward-looking angle is structural: private reads are the missing half of the privacy user experience.\nThe Kohaku roadmap explicitly includes privacy-service abstraction as a first-phase deliverable, signaling that wallet-side tooling for private reads is moving from theory to implementation.\nFOCIL and enforceable inclusion\nBuilder centralization is the most visible backslide in Ethereum's transaction inclusion guarantees. A few sophisticated builders dominate block production, and censorship resistance degrades when inclusion depends on their cooperation.\nFork-choice-enforced inclusion lists, formalized as EIP-7805, are the structural response.\nA committee"

In the space of 24 hours, more than 8.9 million new addresses were created on the network, a record that reignites attention on this blockchain known for its speed and efficiency. Behind this sudden enthusiasm lies a more nuanced reality, where the enthusiasm of newcomers clashes with fragile technical signals.\nIn a global context of renewed interest in high-performance blockchains, Solana, thanks to its dominance in crypto trends, has recorded more than 8 million new active addresses in just 24 hours.\nThis spectacular growth is accompanied by strong on-chain activity, highlighting an influx of new users and investors on the network. Such development signals substantial demand for SOL and reflects the growing attractiveness of its ecosystem, notably driven by DeFi projects, memecoins, and other high-yield applications.\nThis massive jump in adoption is generally interpreted as a vitality signal for a blockchain network. It implies a potential increase in liquidity, but also an increased valuation of SOL in the medium term.\nSeveral factors explain this renewed interest in Solana :\nThe exponential increase in the number of active addresses thus seems to confirm the broadening of the user base, beyond a mere fad or one-off event.\nThis bullish momentum is far from unanimous in the markets. Indeed, the selling pressure exerted by long-term holders now outweighs the demand generated by newcomers.\nThe selling pressure begins to dominate as historic investors reduce their exposure or prepare to sell. This often underestimated trend could well neutralize the positive effects of the recent influx of users.\nBeyond portfolio movements, technical analysis strengthens the hypothesis of a short-term pullback. The SOL chart presents an \u201cascending wedge,\u201d a pattern known for its bearish implications.\nThus, the SOL price was around $144, with an identified correction risk of 9.5%. If this scenario is confirmed, the first critical threshold is at $136, with potential support at $129. Conversely, a rebound above $146 could cancel this pattern and restart the bullish momentum.\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

                "body": "Solana Gains Momentum as Network Activity Surges\n19.01.2026 - 04:14:04The Solana blockchain is entering 2026 with renewed vigor. While the previous year delivered mixed results, the current narrative is shifting away from mere price action and toward substantial on-chain utility. A significant uptick in network usage, coupled with technical advancements and a break from a persistent downtrend, is fueling expectations for a recovery grounded in fundamentals rather than speculation.\nThe year 2025 proved disappointing for Solana's native token, SOL. After reaching an all-time high of $294 in January 2025, its value declined by approximately 44% over the subsequent months. By late December, SOL had found a bottom in the $119 to $120 range before initiating a rebound at the turn of the year.\nFrom a technical perspective, this rebound has allowed SOL to break out above a multi-month descending trendline. Buyers successfully defended the key support level at $119.80 and subsequently pushed the price above a falling resistance line near $147, which had previously capped multiple rally attempts. This shift has brightened the market structure, even though the token, currently trading around $133.63, remains roughly 43% below its 52-week high.\nEcosystem Strength and Robust Metrics\nThe recovery is supported by powerful on-chain data. Mid-January metrics reveal a substantially higher utilization of the Solana network. According to analytics firm Nansen, the blockchain averaged about 27.1 million weekly active addresses\u2014a striking 56% increase from the prior week. The network processed 515 million transactions weekly, and on a single day, more than 8 million new addresses were created.\nThis level of real-world usage positions Solana at the forefront, surpassing competing networks like BNB Chain and Tron in terms of both active addresses and transaction volume. Such robust on-chain activity provides a fundamental counterbalance to last year's price depreciation and underpins the current upward move.\nDeFi, Meme Coins, and Institutional Interest\nMomentum is also building at the ecosystem level. A study by 21Shares indicates that the Solana ecosystem generated nearly $3 billion in protocol revenue in the twelve months leading to September 2025. This figure clearly distinguishes Solana from other blockchains that may command high valuations but demonstrate little substantive activity.\nKey ecosystem highlights include:\n* Approximately 50% of the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on Solana in a mid-January week was attributed to meme-coin transactions.\n* Solana and Tron both recorded notable inflows of stablecoins, while Ethereum experienced net outflows during the same period.\n* The disclosure of Solana holdings and staking yields by the company Forward Industries signals the token's growing presence in corporate treasuries and structured products.\nShould investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Solana?\nA major protocol upgrade in late 2025 further accelerated transaction speeds, sharpening Solana's profile as a fast and low-cost blockchain. The upcoming Firedancer upgrade represents another critical step, aiming to potentially increase transaction capacity to up to 1 million per second, directly addressing long-term scalability.\nTechnical Landscape and Market Sentiment\nOn the charts, Solana has decisively broken through the $146.93 resistance level for the first time in months. This move brings several key price zones into focus:\n-\nSupport Levels:\n- $135.50 as a central zone for continued bullish momentum\n- $132.00, coinciding with the 50-day moving average\n- $119.80, marking the December 2025 low\n-\nResistance Levels:\n- The $147 to $150 range as a critical pivot area\n- $155.82, the low from August 2025\n- $172.72, aligned with the 200-day moving average\n- $200.00 as a major psychological barrier\nSentiment in the derivatives market reinforces this positive shift.

Investors will also be watching its results as a bellwether of Big Tech as investors show renewed skepticism toward relentless spending on AI.\nAdvertisement\nIn day trading, stocks cautiously rose Tuesday after President Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook on allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook responded that she would not resign from her position and instead would file a lawsuit, setting up Fed independence to become a court matter.\nAfter the bell, Cracker Barrel (CBRL) saw its second stock surge of the day after the company acquiesced to comments from Trump and public outcry that it should never have scrapped its old logo. Cracker Barrel said in a statement that its \"old\" logo would be reinstated, and its redesign would be abandoned.\nOkta (OKTA) shares also jumped in after-hours trading as investors cheered earnings results that reflected booming demand for cybersecurity tools.\nMeanwhile, UnitedHealth stock continued its slide on reports the US Justice Department is investigating the company over more issues than Medicare fraud."

                "body": "- United States\n- /\n- Medical Equipment\n- /\n- NasdaqCM:ZJYL\nEarnings Working Against Jin Medical International Ltd.'s (NASDAQ:ZJYL) Share Price Following 27% Dive\nUnfortunately for some shareholders, the Jin Medical International Ltd. (NASDAQ:ZJYL) share price has dived 27% in the last thirty days, prolonging recent pain. For any long-term shareholders, the last month ends a year to forget by locking in a 83% share price decline.\nFollowing the heavy fall in price, Jin Medical International may be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 13.3x, since almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 20x and even P/E's higher than 35x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.\nFor instance, Jin Medical International's receding earnings in recent times would have to be some food for thought. It might be that many expect the disappointing earnings performance to continue or accelerate, which has repressed the P/E. However, if this doesn't eventuate then existing shareholders may be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\nSee our latest analysis for Jin Medical International\nWe don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our free report on Jin Medical International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.Does Growth Match The Low P/E?\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Jin Medical International would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.\nIf we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 39%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 99% in aggregate. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.\nWeighing that medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 16% shows it's an unpleasant look.\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Jin Medical International's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.\nThe Bottom Line On Jin Medical International's P/E\nThe softening of Jin Medical International's shares means its P/E is now sitting at a pretty low level. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\nWe've established that Jin Medical International maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its sliding earnings over the medium-term, as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future under these circumstances.\nThere are also other vital risk factors to consider and we've discovered 4 warning signs for Jin Medical International (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\nYou might be able to find a better investment than Jin Medical International.

                "source": "Yahoo Finance",
                "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lpl-financial-holdings-nasdaq-lpla-110051795.html",
                "body": "LPL Financial Holdings (NASDAQ:LPLA) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last five years\nThe worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) share price has soared 229% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 11% gain in the last three months.\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for LPL Financial Holdings investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nOver half a decade, LPL Financial Holdings managed to grow its earnings per share at 11% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 27% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of LPL Financial Holdings' earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWhat About Dividends?\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of LPL Financial Holdings, it has a TSR of 238% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nA Different Perspective\nLPL Financial Holdings shareholders gained a total return of 8.9% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 28% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with LPL Financial Holdings (at least 2 which are a bit unpleasant) , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."

                "body": "For decades, Owl Farm was Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s lair, the place where he wrote, drank and drugged, entertained celebrities, shot guns at all hours, commanded his quixotic campaign for sheriff in 1970 and, finally, on a snowy Sunday evening in February 2005, died in front of his IBM Selectric typewriter from a single gunshot to the head.\nThe next day, a doctor conducted an autopsy and reported, \u201cthe injuries were consistent with the reported self-inflicted gunshot wound.\u201d\n\u201cCase status is Closed/noncriminal,\u201d the chief investigator for the county sheriff\u2019s department wrote to close out his report.\nThat\u2019s where things seemed destined to remain, until quite recently.\nDid Hunter S. Thompson Really Kill Himself?\nAnita Thompson, Hunter\u2019s widow, paid little mind for two decades to the particulars of the sheriff\u2019s office report, she told people. But last year she looked back. Reading the report closely for the first time, questions emerged that hadn\u2019t occurred to her in the immediate aftermath of her husband\u2019s death.\nAround the same time last year, she also heard from someone close to Hunter\u2019s son, Juan, who was at Owl Farm with his then-wife, Jennifer Winkel, the evening Hunter died. In a text message reviewed by The New York Times, Anita told the former sheriff that the ex-wife of Juan and Jennifer\u2019s son was claiming that Jennifer had over the years said that Hunter\u2019s death had to be made to \u201clook like a suicide,\u201d suggesting there\u2019d been a cover-up.\nOver the summer, Anita, who still lives at Owl Farm, brought her suspicions to the current sheriff of Pitkin County, Colo., Michael Buglione.\nAfter several conversations, Mr. Buglione had heard enough to take the unusual step of asking the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to re-examine the case, and in late September he issued a statement: \u201cBy bringing in an outside agency for a fresh look, we hope to provide a definitive and transparent review that may offer peace of mind to his family and the public.\u201d\nEven in Aspen, where gossip about the famous flows easily on the ski resort gondolas and at the bars, the rumor set off by Anita\u2019s suspicions was startling. Newly uneasy about the facts of the case, she came to doubt the official story that her husband, on his own, took his own life.\nWas there a dark secret behind the death of Hunter S. Thompson? Was it something more than suicide?\nAlmost from the moment Hunter was laid to rest, his widow and his son began to feud, over everything from the future of Owl Farm to Juan\u2019s belief that his father had been mistreated by Anita in his last days.\nThe estrangement deepened with time, and now, Anita\u2019s suspicions have taken the feud to a more pointed place, revealing a long, bitter fight over the legacy of the man who pioneered the personal, participatory style of reporting known as gonzo journalism.\nBut they were all together the weekend Hunter died.\nJuan wrote in his memoir that he was in another room and heard a thump that sounded like a book hitting the floor. Anita was at a health club in Aspen waiting for a yoga class to start. She later told the news media she was on speakerphone with her husband before he shot himself, and heard the \u201cclicking\u201d of the gun.\nLooking back, there were signs from that last weekend that Hunter had planned to take his own life, Juan and Jennifer said in interviews.\nHe insisted on watching one of his favorite movies, \u201cThe Maltese Falcon,\u201d with his 6-year-old grandson, Will. He gave away gifts \u2014 an old clock that had belonged to his mother and a signed copy of \u201cFire in the Nuts,\u201d a short book with his frequent collaborator, the artist Ralph Steadman.\n\u201cSo there is nothing new to know about Hunter\u2019s actual death,\u201d said Juan, 61. \u201cSo I do not know why she raised this. And I can\u2019t imagine that the C.B.I. would find anything to act on.\u201d\nHe and Jennifer said they did not have any role in Hunter\u2019s death. \u201cThis is really shocking,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cIt\u2019s been disruptive to our family. It\u2019s obviously been very traumatic to be revisi"

                "body": "It\u2019s rare to get a bunch of scientists to agree on anything\u2014but health experts are near unanimous in saying that there\u2019s no scientific reason for the CDC\u2019s recent changes to the recommended childhood vaccine schedule. The American Academy of Pediatrics called the Trump administration\u2019s move \u201cdangerous and unnecessary.\u201d Omolara Thomas, MD, a pediatrician who specializes in public and global health, puts it bluntly: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s extreme to say that children will potentially die.\u201d\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s ferocious weirdness\u2014his alleged pregnancy fetish, his love of roadkill, his brain worm\u2014can make it hard to decipher any coherent ideology. Yet Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine project should be understood as part of the broader Trump agenda, part and parcel with ICE raids and cuts to health care subsidies and food stamps. It\u2019s a program that seeks to completely overhaul the American population and redefine who gets to be an American, as well as who deserves health and safety. Under Donald Trump, fitness, inherent health, and morality are all associated with a specific type of person: able-bodied, white \u201cheritage Americans.\u201d\nIf this all sounds vaguely familiar in a terrible, old-timey way, it\u2019s because this rhetoric echoes one of the darkest ideologies of the 19th and 20th centuries, one that has never really gone away: eugenics. Some eugenicists were obsessed with purity, and saw illness as nature\u2019s way of eliminating the unfit. Historical comparisons are never exact, but the reawakening of this ideology is pervasive once you start to notice it. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you were a musician and you kept hearing the same notes, and you said, \u2018Wait a minute, I know that tune,\u201d says Paul A. Lombardo, a legal historian of eugenics.\nKennedy has echoed these points in remarks like the ones he made last year, after a six-year-old Mennonite girl died from measles. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe see a correlation between people who get hurt by measles and people who don\u2019t have good nutrition or who don\u2019t have a good exercise regimen.\u201d Texas officials told The New York Times that the little girl had been healthy before she contracted the disease.\nLast month, a contractor working with the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made similar comments, falsely claiming that hepatitis B is primarily a concern for babies of \u201cforeign-born\u201d mothers that occurs in some \u201chigh-risk immigrant families,\u201d and that there is little risk to the \u201caverage American child.\u201d Of course, in the real world, disease does not discriminate: Before rotavirus vaccination, for instance, the virus caused up to 70,000 hospitalizations and 60 deaths each year. Prominent pediatrician Paul Offit, MD, recently told The Atlantic about a nine-month-old girl he treated in the 1970s who had been totally healthy before she contracted rotavirus. She was so dehydrated that his team could not find a vein for an IV; he had to try to drill into her bone marrow to hydrate her. Despite her medical team\u2019s efforts, the girl died.\nThrowing around the word eugenics has become a bit like crying Nazi, but increasingly, using either term seems apt. Broadly, eugenics is the belief that society can engineer a better, stronger, and smarter population primarily by controlling who has babies. It\u2019s the notion that some people have bad genes, making them inherently weak\u2014a concept Trump loves. If those people reproduce, it\u2019s therefore a threat to the whole country.\nEugenics led to the forced\u2014but entirely legal!\u2014sterilization of disabled people and people of color in the US throughout the 20th century. Eugenics was never a fringe idea; it was seen as legitimate science, and promoted by many political and scientific leaders. In 1912, The New England Journal of Medicine, then known as the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, published an editorial titled \u201cImmigration as a Factor in the Increase of Insanity,\u201d an article that warned of the malign influe"
