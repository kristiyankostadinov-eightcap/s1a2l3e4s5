                "body": "The price of gold surged above US$4,100 (A$6,300) an ounce on Wednesday for the first time, taking this year\u2019s extraordinary rally to more than 50%.\nThe speed of the upswing has been much faster than analysts had predicted and brings the total gains to nearly 100% since the current run started in early 2024.\nThe soaring price of gold has captured investors\u2019 hearts and wallets and resulted in long lines of people forming outside gold dealers in Sydney to get their hands on the precious metal.\nWhat explains the soaring price of gold?\nA number of reasons have been suggested to explain the current record run for gold. These include greater economic uncertainties from ballooning government debt levels and the current US government shutdown.\nThere are also growing worries about the independence of the US Federal Reserve. If political interference pushes down US interest rates, that could see a resurgence in inflation. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation.\nBut these factors are unlikely to be the main reasons behind the meteoric rise in gold prices.\nFor starters, the price of gold has been on a sustained upward trajectory for the past few years. That\u2019s well before any of those factors emerged as an issue.\nThe more likely explanation for the current gold price rally is growing demand from gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nThese funds track the movements of gold, or other assets such as stocks or bonds, and are traded on the stock exchange. This makes assets such as commodities much more accessible to investors.\nBefore the first gold ETF was launched in 2003, it was considered too difficult for regular investors to get gold exposure.\nNow gold ETFs are widely available, gold can be traded like any other financial asset. This appears to be changing investors\u2019 view of gold\u2019s traditional role as a safe-haven asset in times of political or financial turmoil, when other assets such as stocks are more risky.\nIn addition to retail investor demand, some emerging market economies \u2013 notably China and Russia \u2013 are switching their official reserve assets out of currencies such as the US dollar and into gold.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, central bank holdings of physical gold in emerging markets have risen 161% since 2006 to be around 10,300 tonnes.\nTo put this into perspective, emerging market gold holdings grew by only 50% over the 50 years to 2005.\nResearch suggests the reason for the switch into gold by emerging market economies is the increasing use of financial sanctions by the US and other governments that represent the major reserve currencies (the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and British pound).\nIndeed, Russia became a net buyer of gold in 2006 and accelerated its gold purchases following its annexation of Crimea in 2014. It now has one of the largest stockpiles in the world.\nMeanwhile, China has been selling down its holdings of US government bonds and switching to buying gold in a process referred to as \u201cde-dollarisation\u201d. It wants to reduce its dependency on the US currency.\nEmerging market central banks also lifted their gold holdings after Russia\u2019s exclusion from the international payments system known as SWIFT and a proposal by US and European governments to seize Russian central bank reserves to help fund support for Ukraine.\nFurther de-dollarisation efforts by emerging market economies are expected to continue. Many of these economies now view the major Western currencies as carrying unwanted risk of financial sanctions. This is not the case with gold. This could mean financial sanctions become a less effective policy tool in the future.\nCould gold have further to run?\nOngoing demand from Russia and China, and investor demand for gold ETFs, means the gold price could rally further. Both factors represent sustained increases in demand, in addition to existing demand for jewellery and electronics.\nFurther price rises will likely fuel increased ETF inflows via the \u201cfear of missing out\u201d effect.\nThe"

UBS experts add their weight\nGold is shining brighter than anticipated this year, with the current price of $4,000 (\u20ac3,437) per troy ounce exceeding all expectations. But will this last?\nGold is currently experiencing a rally for the ages, with the price surge already surpassing its forecasted ceilings for 2026. However, as Wayne Gordon, the head of Investment Advice, Distribution and Research in APAC at UBS, noted on Monocle radio this week, the forces driving today\u2019s \u201cgold mania\u201d are distinct and structural.\n\u201cIt has been a tremendous rally in gold. In fact, it\u2019s one of the strongest that we have seen in the metal on a year-to-date basis since about 1979,\u201d Gordon told Monocle Radio\u2019s Tom Edwards. While the upswing in the 1970s was largely driven by inflation, the current ascent is fundamentally tied to geopolitics. \u201cThe reasons we\u2019re here today started to build at the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, when we saw a significant shift in the way that banks viewed holding US dollar-denominated reserves,\u201d adds Gordon. \u201cCentral banks have continued to buy large amounts of gold since.\u201d\nThe power of two buyers: central banks and ETFs\nThe price of gold has continued to rise, even with the strengthening US dollar and increased interest rates. This unusual resilience was due to the \u201clevel of influence that central banks have had on the price of gold,\u201d says Gordon.\nWhat\u2019s new this year, he adds, is that \u201ca reversal of nearly three years of outflows from exchange-traded funds\u201d has amplified the rally. \u201cAt the start of the year, we thought there would be about 400 to 450 metric tonnes of inflows into ETF funds,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we expect that number to be approximately 800 tonnes.\u201d\nThis combination of renewed investor interest and geopolitical uncertainty has driven prices up roughly 50 per cent year to date. \u201cWe think that ongoing political risks, as well as potential further weakness in the US dollar, can lift gold prices even higher,\u201d says Gordon. UBS now has a target of around $4,200 (\u20ac3,613) per ounce.\nHow much gold should investors hold?\nGordon says that a mid-single-digit allocation makes sense for most portfolios. \u201cHistorically, we have seen that somewhere between 5 to 10 per cent allocation to gold has improved the overall volatility of your portfolio,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has protected your portfolio to some degree from more material drawdowns.\u201d He adds that gold still plays a vital role even at higher prices. \u201cThere\u2019s no counterparty risk and no credit risk to gold. It is insulated from significant moves in currency.\u201d\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity. Listen to the full, detailed conversation on \u2018The Bulletin with UBS\u2019 on Monocle Radio."

According to OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais, the global economy will require $18.2 trillion in oil and gas investment by 2050 to meet rising demand and maintain supply stability.\nAl Ghais made the statement during the Russian Energy Week conference in Moscow, reiterating OPEC\u2019s longstanding position that new exploration and development are essential to sustain the world\u2019s energy needs. He emphasized that despite growing interest in renewable energy, oil and gas will remain cornerstones of the global energy mix for the foreseeable future.\n1. Global demand projected to surge by 23%\nOPEC projects that primary energy demand will rise by 23% between now and 2050, driven largely by population growth, rapid urbanization, and expanding economies across Asia and Africa. The organization expects oil to continue supplying around 30% of total global energy consumption by mid-century.\nThat figure highlights OPEC\u2019s belief that fossil fuels will remain dominant even as renewable energy capacity expands. The group argues that new investments in oil and gas infrastructure are critical to prevent supply shortages and market volatility in the decades ahead.\nIn its World Oil Outlook 2025, OPEC forecasted global oil demand reaching 123 million barrels per day by 2050\u2014up from approximately 104 million barrels per day today. The report underscores that energy transitions will take time and require a balanced approach that integrates both traditional and renewable sources.\n2. A $18.2 trillion call to action\nOPEC\u2019s estimate of $18.2 trillion represents the total capital needed for exploration, production, transportation, and refining to sustain oil and gas output through 2050. The group views this investment as vital for both consumers and producers, warning that underfunding the sector could disrupt global economic stability.\nAl Ghais described consistent funding as essential to ensuring reliable access to energy worldwide. He said that without adequate investment, nations could face supply shortages and price volatility that would affect industries and households alike.\nThe call for major spending comes amid increasing tension between traditional energy producers and climate advocates. While OPEC acknowledges the importance of decarbonization, it maintains that oil and gas will continue to support economic development, especially in emerging markets where renewable infrastructure remains limited.\n3. Responding to shifting energy narratives\nOPEC\u2019s position comes as the International Energy Agency (IEA) makes a notable shift in its outlook. After previously suggesting that no new oil and gas projects were needed for a net-zero scenario, the IEA recently stated that new developments are necessary just to maintain current production levels.\nOPEC has used this change to reinforce its argument for sustained investment. The group said that inconsistent messaging from global agencies has discouraged funding and created uncertainty for the oil industry. It urged all stakeholders to align around a realistic path forward that balances emissions reduction with energy security.\nAccording to OPEC, its consistent advocacy for investment ensures preparedness against decline rates in existing oil fields and meets growing global demand. The organization stressed that the world cannot afford to retreat from energy development rhetoric if it hopes to maintain economic growth and stability.\nEnergy realities meet long-term strategy\nThe debate over oil\u2019s future remains intense, but OPEC insists that realistic planning must consider both short-term needs and long-term sustainability. As renewables scale up, oil and gas are expected to complement rather than compete with cleaner alternatives, ensuring that developing nations have reliable access to afforda"

But they also see the market rebalancing in the medium term and supply struggling to catch up with demand in the long term.\nEveryone concurs that there will be a glut in the short term; projections vary only about how big the oversupply will become later this year and early next year.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) this week warned, again, that soaring supply and \u201csubdued\u201d demand would bloat the oversupply to record levels.\nSurging Middle East supply, combined with robust flows from the Americas, boosted oil on water in September by a massive 102 million barrels, equivalent to 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd), which is the largest increase since the pandemic, the agency said in its monthly report.\nRelated: North Sea Oil: Booming in Norway and Doomed in the UK\n\u201cLooking ahead, as the significant volumes of crude oil on water move onshore to major oil hubs, crude stocks look set to surge while NGLs start to drop,\u201d the IEA noted.\nOil executives may be concerned about falling oil prices and declining profits in the short term, but they have seen their fair share of periods of oversupply and remain upbeat about the medium and long term.\n\u201cFundamentally, the short term market is a little bearish,\u201d Patrick Pouyanne, the chief executive of TotalEnergies, said at the forum.\n\u201cBut we are quite bullish on the medium-term,\u201d the executive added, pointing out to production decline rates and continued growth in global oil demand.\nNon-OPEC crude production will begin to decline when oil prices are at $60 per barrel and lower, Pouyanne noted.\n\u201cThere is a point at $60 per barrel where we'll see the shale industry beginning to slow down,\u201d Pouyanne said on the sidelines of the forum, as carried by Reuters.\n\u201cOur view is that from mid-2026 non-OPEC supply will be much lower, no growth, and then OPEC will be regaining control of the market,\u201d TotalEnergies\u2019 top executive said.\nRyan Lance, chairman and CEO of ConocoPhillips, said that \u201cAt $60-$65 a barrel WTI oil prices, the US is probably plateau-ish.\u201d\nU.S. oil output could grow by between 300,000 bpd and 400,000 bpd this year, Lance said."

The report underscores that energy transitions will take time and require a balanced approach that integrates both traditional and renewable sources.\n2. A $18.2 trillion call to action\nOPEC\u2019s estimate of $18.2 trillion represents the total capital needed for exploration, production, transportation, and refining to sustain oil and gas output through 2050. The group views this investment as vital for both consumers and producers, warning that underfunding the sector could disrupt global economic stability.\nAl Ghais described consistent funding as essential to ensuring reliable access to energy worldwide. He said that without adequate investment, nations could face supply shortages and price volatility that would affect industries and households alike.\nThe call for major spending comes amid increasing tension between traditional energy producers and climate advocates. While OPEC acknowledges the importance of decarbonization, it maintains that oil and gas will continue to support economic development, especially in emerging markets where renewable infrastructure remains limited.\n3. Responding to shifting energy narratives\nOPEC\u2019s position comes as the International Energy Agency (IEA) makes a notable shift in its outlook. After previously suggesting that no new oil and gas projects were needed for a net-zero scenario, the IEA recently stated that new developments are necessary just to maintain current production levels.\nOPEC has used this change to reinforce its argument for sustained investment. The group said that inconsistent messaging from global agencies has discouraged funding and created uncertainty for the oil industry. It urged all stakeholders to align around a realistic path forward that balances emissions reduction with energy security.\nAccording to OPEC, its consistent advocacy for investment ensures preparedness against decline rates in existing oil fields and meets growing global demand. The organization stressed that the world cannot afford to retreat from energy development rhetoric if it hopes to maintain economic growth and stability.\nEnergy realities meet long-term strategy\nThe debate over oil\u2019s future remains intense, but OPEC insists that realistic planning must consider both short-term needs and long-term sustainability. As renewables scale up, oil and gas are expected to complement rather than compete with cleaner alternatives, ensuring that developing nations have reliable access to afforda"

While technicals show resistance being tested after a trend break, momentum remains neutral, leaving near-term setups dependent on price action. With light data ahead, Fed speakers could provide the next directional catalyst.\nDovish Powell Halts USD Rebound\nEUR/USD has bounced strongly over the past two sessions, coinciding with remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at a National Association for Business Economics event earlier in the week. Powell continued to flag downside risks to the U.S. labor market, doing little to dissuade market pricing that sees another rate cut later this month as essentially locked in.\nSource: Bloomberg\n\u201cWhile the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have slowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower immigration and labor force participation,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIn this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen.\u201d\nPowell\u2019s remarks did not meaningfully shift near-term expectations for the Fed funds rate, but they did push Treasury yields further out the curve lower, sending the policy-sensitive two-year tenor to levels not seen since May.\nDespite EUR/USD showing no consistent relationship recently with outright U.S. yields or yield differentials with Europe over timeframes ranging from one week to one month, it\u2019s hard to ignore that since Powell\u2019s speech\u2014which included comments that quantitative tightening may be paused soon\u2014the dollar has been offered. That likely contributed to the bounce in EUR/USD, defying what has been an uninspiring run of euro area economic data relative to expectations.\nEUR/USD Eyes Upside\nSource: TradingView\nLooking at EUR/USD on the daily chart, you can see the price is currently testing minor resistance at 1.1650 having broken the downtrend that had been in place from the high set on September 17 on Wednesday. The bullish move was sparked after bears failed to take out the October 9 low of 1.1544. Given where EUR/USD now trades, it provides multiple setups to consider depending on how the near-term price action evolves.\nShould we see the pair push above 1.1650, longs could be established with a tight stop below for protection. EUR/USD has seen a flakey relationship with the 50-day moving average recently, sometimes interacting with it and others not. Despite that, it cannot be ignored among those contemplating bullish setups, making it screen as an initial target to consider. Should it be cleared successfully, the pair ran into sellers late last month and in early October above 1.1750, putting it on the radar for consideration.\nAlternatively, should the pair remain capped beneath 1.1650, the setup could be flipped with short positions established beneath with a tight stop above for protection. The obvious target would be the double-bottom set earlier this month at 1.1544.\nWhen it comes to directional bias, both RSI (14) and MACD are providing neutral signals on momentum, placing more emphasis on price action in the near term. While RSI (14) has broken the downtrend it had been in over the past month, that only suggests bearish momentum is now diminishing, rather than delivering an outright bullish signal.\nWith several ECB speakers due, including President Christine Lagarde, the European calendar is otherwise light, including the final read of September inflation which rarely surprises. On the U.S. side, tradable economic signals are scarce amid the ongoing government shutdown, leaving Fed speakers as the most likely source of a funda"

The major currency pair trades higher as the US Dollar (USD) continues to face selling pressure amid firm Federal Reserve (Fed) dovish bets and ongoing United States (US)-China trade tensions.\nDuring the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades marginally lower to near 98.50, the lowest level seen in a week.\nThe speculation of more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in the remaining year remains firm due to growing labor market concerns.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, traders see a 94.6% that the Fed will reduce interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75% in the remaining year.\nOn Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell also acknowledged labor market risks in a conference stating, \u201cDownside risks to the US job market have risen\u201d. Powell didn\u2019t comment over the likely monetary policy action in the remaining year.\nMeanwhile, trade relations between the US and China are going through a test as President Donald Trump has signaled that he would persuade Beijing to halt buying oil from Russia. However, trade frictions are unlikely to long last as Trump and Chinese leader XI Jinping are scheduled to meet later this month in South Korea to discuss over trade terms.\nIn the Eurozone, chances that French Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu would survive the no-confidence vote by the cabinet have increased as he has suspended the controversial pension reform until at least after the 2027 presidential elections.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process whereby the Federal Reserve stops b"

But with earnings still supporting risk sentiment and the Beige Book potentially flashing warning signs, the balance of risks today remains modestly negative for the greenback.\u201d\nThe US-China trade wars will also be a key element with President Trump threatening further action against China over cooking oil.\nTensions will remain high ahead of the November 1st deadline with expectations that Trump is attempting to secure Chinese concessions.\nDanske Bank commented; \u201cThe tariff escalation announced on Friday underscored two key points: first, that any renewed trade tensions under a Trump administration are unambiguously negative for the broad USD. Second, markets still view the announced measures largely as negotiation tactics rather than policy reality.\u201d\nLike this piece?

Meanwhile, the annual production could fall 0.6% in the same month, following a 0.1% increase prior.\nHow could UK GDP, Industrial Production data affect GBP/USD?\nGBP/USD may extend its gains if the UK economy shows expansion in August, which could ease the odds of the Bank of England (BoE) further rate cuts in the remaining year. Any contraction could lead to an increase in the likelihood of easing monetary policy, following mixed UK labor market figures for the three months ending in August. Traders will watch UK Industrial Production closely, a key gauge of manufacturing strength, with Manufacturing Production data due later today. Money markets are pricing in a 46-basis-point (bps) interest rate reduction by the BoE in the remaining two monetary policy meetings this year, per Reuters.\nThe GBP/USD pair also draws support as the US Dollar (USD) struggles amid market caution, driven by the escalating United States (US)-China trade tensions, the world\u2019s two largest economies. US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he saw the US as in a trade war with China, even as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent proposed a longer pause on high tariffs on Chinese goods to resolve a conflict over critical minerals.\nTechnically, the GBP/USD pair trades around 1.3420 at the time of writing, with the immediate barrier appearing at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.3451. A break above this level would support the pair to explore the region around the three-month high of 1.3726, reached on September 17. On the downside, the immediate support lies at the psychological level of 1.3400, followed by the nine-day EMA at 1.3390. Further decline below this confluence support zone would prompt the pair to test the two-month low of 1.3248.\nGDP FAQs\nA country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the rate of growth of its economy over a given period of time, usually a quarter. The most reliable figures are those that compare GDP to the previous quarter e.g Q2 of 2023 vs Q1 of 2023, or to the same period in the previous year, e.g Q2 of 2023 vs Q2 of 2022. Annualized quarterly GDP figures extrapolate the growth rate of the quarter as if it were constant for the rest of the year. These can be misleading, however, if temporary shocks impact growth in one quarter but are unlikely to last all year \u2013 such as happened in the first quarter of 2020 at the outbreak of the covid pandemic, when growth plummeted.\nA higher GDP result is generally positive for a nation\u2019s currency as it reflects a growing economy, which is more likely to produce goods and services that can be exported, as well as attracting higher foreign investment. By the same token, when GDP falls it is usually negative for the currency. When an economy grows people tend to spend more, which leads to inflation. The country\u2019s central bank then has to put up interest rates to combat the inflation with the side effect of attracting more capital inflows from global investors, thus helping the local currency appreciate.\nWhen an economy grows and GDP is rising, people tend to spend more which leads to inflation. The country\u2019s central bank then has to put up interest rates to combat the inflation. Higher interest rates are negative for Gold because they increase the opportunity-cost of holding Gold versus placing the money in a cash deposit account. Therefore, a higher GDP growth rate is usually a bearish factor for Gold price.\nAuthor\nAkhtar Faruqui\nFXStreet\nAkhtar"

                "body": "The Pound Sterling (GBP) recovers to near 1.3370 against the US Dollar (USD) during the European trading session. This follows a correction in the US Dollar after Federal Reserve members, including Jerome Powell, expressed concerns about the labour market.\nAnalysts at UOB Group suggest that GBP/USD is likely to trade within a range of 1.3290 to 1.3365. Despite slowed downward momentum, there remains a possibility for GBP to decline further to 1.3200.\nUK Data and Bank of England Stance\nUK data have provided varied signals, with the Bank of England\u2019s stance remaining uncertain. The Pound\u2019s underperformance affected its position against core G10 currencies, while EUR/GBP experienced its largest gain since 16th September. The probability of a rate cut by the Bank of England increased from 20% to 40% over the last three days, as the 2-year Gilt yield dropped by 5 basis points.\nFrom our perspective on October 15, 2025, the Pound is caught between a weaker US Dollar and growing concerns about the UK economy. The US Dollar\u2019s recent slide follows Federal Reserve comments on the labor market, giving GBP/USD a temporary lift. This creates a conflicted environment where neither currency has a clear advantage.\nWe see the pair likely trading within a narrow channel between 1.3290 and 1.3365 in the coming weeks. The recent US Non-Farm Payrolls report from early October, which showed a disappointing gain of only 155,000 jobs against an expected 200,000, supports the view of a less aggressive Federal Reserve. This should provide a floor for GBP/USD near the low 1.33s for now.\nSterling\u2019s Limited Upside\nHowever, the upside for Sterling appears limited due to mounting speculation of a Bank of England rate cut before the end of the year. Last week\u2019s UK inflation data, which saw CPI unexpectedly fall to 2.2%, coupled with stalling Q3 GDP growth, has doubled the market-implied probability of a rate cut to 40%. This suggests that rallies toward the 1.3370 level will likely face selling pressure.\nFor derivative traders, this outlook supports strategies that profit from low volatility, such as selling strangles with strikes set outside the expected 1.3290-1.3365 range. Given the underlying risk of a sharper GBP decline, a slight bearish bias could be prudent, perhaps by buying cheaper, out-of-the-money puts below 1.3200 as a hedge. The current low implied volatility makes these options relatively inexpensive.\nThis situation feels similar to the choppy market conditions we experienced in the second half of 2024 when central bank policies were also diverging. During that period, range-trading strategies performed well until a clear trend emerged. We should therefore remain cautious of any breakout, but for now, the path of least resistance appears to be sideways."

While still low by historical standards (the long-term average sits at 6.54%) the trend is clearly rising.\nUnemployment has been steadily climbing from its record low over the past two years, but the pace now appears to be increasing. September\u2019s 0.2-percentage-point increase was the second such rise in four months. Over the past 11 months, the rate has risen four times, held steady four times, and fallen only once in November last year.\nView related analysis:\n- ASX 200 Morning Market Outlook: Fortescue Breakout, Materials Rally\n- Japanese Yen Price Action Setups: AUD/JPY, GBP/JPY, USD/JPY\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Sentiment Sours Into RBA Mins, Jobs\n- Bitcoin, S&P 500 Outlook: Wall Street Volatility Rattles BTC\nAustralian Dollar Weakens as Traders Price In RBA Rate Cut\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: Australian Bureau of Statistic (ABS), LSEG\nEmployment Growth Remains Positive but Slows\nJob growth was relatively weak at 14.9k, but still growing with 8.7k full-time jobs added to 6.2k part time. While August\u2019s figures saw job growth revised lower to -11.k from -5.4k (and full-time to -48.k from -40.9k), this is backwards looking and not a huge increase from the original estimates.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: Australian Bureau of Statistic (ABS), LSEG\nRBA Rate Cut Speculation Builds \u2014 But It\u2019s Not a \u201cSlam Dunk\u201d\nWhile this has renewed some market excitement about a potential RBA rate cut, I don\u2019t think it makes it a slam dunk. The participation rate ticked up by 0.1 percentage point to 69%, not far from its record high. The employment-to-population ratio held steady at 64%, and 14.9k jobs were added overall \u2014 with full-time employment up 8.7k and part-time up 6.2k. These figures aren\u2019t exactly screaming \u201crecession,\u201d even though unemployment is rising.\nRBA Minutes Highlight Ongoing Inflation Risks\nThe RBA minutes were slightly more hawkish, noting that household consumption and growth have been stronger than expected. Policymakers described the labour market as still \u201ctight.\u201d Even if today\u2019s data suggest it\u2019s slightly less so, the employment sector has hardly collapsed. Perhaps more importantly, the minutes also stated that \u201crecent data suggested that inflation in the September quarter may be higher than had been expected in the August Statement on Monetary Policy.\u201d\nRBA Likely to Wait for CPI Before Considering Rate Cuts\nUltimately, I do not see the RBA cutting rates without first seeing the next quarterly CPI figures \u2014 particularly while they remain on guard for higher-than-expected inflation, stronger growth, and resilient consumption, even as unemployment edges higher.\nAUD/NZD Leads Losses as Australian Dollar Slumps\nThe Australian dollar is the weakest currency of the day, with bears toying with the idea of an RBA rate cut in December. AUD/USD is the weakest major pair, currently down 0.4%, while AUD/JPY fell as much as 0.8% before recovering some losses. AUD/NZD is the weakest Australian dollar cross, down 0.7% on the day, and has also been the most volatile \u2014 trading within a high-to-low range equal to 128% of its 10-day ATR.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson \u2013 data source: LSEG.\nAUD/NZD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs New Zealand Dollar\nThe weekly chart shows that the strong rally from the May low has come to a halt, with a shooting star and bearish pinbar hinting at a retracement. Today\u2019s news flow has worked against the Australian dollar, sending AUD/NZD to a three-week low.\nThe daily chart suggests a head and shoulders top pattern has formed, projecting a downside target near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, around 1.1140.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) gains ground after Sarah Hunter, Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), warned on Wednesday that inflation risks in the economy remain tilted to the upside. Speaking at the Citi Australia & New Zealand Investment Conference in Sydney, she said that \u201cinflation is likely to be stronger than expected in the third quarter, while labor market and economic conditions might be tighter than assumed.\u201d\nHer remarks reinforced the idea that the RBA is unlikely to embark on an aggressive rate-cutting cycle in the near term. Investors are now waiting for the release of the third-quarter Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, due later in October, for further guidance on inflation dynamics.\nMeanwhile, market attention turns to the September employment data, due on Thursday. Consensus expects a 17,000 increase in employment after a 5,400 drop in August, with the Unemployment Rate edging higher to 4.3% from 4.2%. According to ING, such a move is unlikely to concern the central bank unless a sharper deterioration in job conditions emerges.\nOn the global front, persistent trade tensions between the United States (US) and China remain a downside factor for the Australian Dollar, given Australia\u2019s heavy reliance on Chinese demand.\nThe US Dollar (USD) remains under pressure, weakened by firm expectations of monetary easing by the Federal Reserve (Fed). According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are pricing in a 95.6% chance of two rate cuts totaling 50 basis points before year-end, which would bring the target range down to 3.50%\u20133.75%.\nRecent remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell strengthened this view. He emphasized that the deterioration in the labor market is now a bigger concern than inflationary pressures, suggesting that further rate cuts could come as early as the October meeting. In a similar tone, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she continues to expect \u201ctwo more rate cuts before the end of this year.\u201d\nThis dovish outlook, combined with a recovery in global risk appetite, is weighing on the US Dollar and supporting the Australian Dollar\u2019s rebound. In the short term, the AUD/USD pair\u2019s direction will depend largely on the upcoming Australian employment data and the evolution of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Four scenarios for the Aussie dollar amid renewed trade tensions\nThe Aussie dollar finds itself once again tied to US-China trade developments. We discuss four scenarios for AUD/USD based on potential developments in Sino-American relationships. Further escalation will weigh on AUD, but a re-run of April's chaos could actually lead to a higher AUD/USD\nWe admit we didn\u2019t expect AUD/USD to be trading below 0.6550 a month ago. The USD rally \u2013 hardly sustainable in our view \u2013 and the rapid re-escalation in US-China trade tensions have both surprised. Until markets are reassured we\u2019re not heading for a repeat of April\u2019s mammoth US tariffs on China, the Aussie dollar will struggle to benefit from its otherwise constructive fundamentals.\nBut those fundamentals would crumble in a major trade war: the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would need to cut more, growth would falter, and commodity prices would suffer. It\u2019s a sliding door moment for AUD \u2013 and here are four scenarios based on our estimated impact.\nScenario 1. De-escalation (AUD/USD at 0.68 year-end)\nTrade: Markets\u2019 high sensitivity to China and tariffs forces the US to de-escalate. A Trump-Xi summit in South Korea on 31 October leads to conciliatory tones, an extension of the tariff pause, and some sort of agreement on rare earths. It\u2019s not necessarily a step towards structural improvement in Sino-American trade relationships, but it takes market sentiment on the matter back to September levels.\nFX: Aussie rallies on the de-escalation, thanks to the risk premium being lifted and some hawkish RBA repricing. The RBA proceeds with caution on easing, and can wait until December (15bp priced in), if not February (23bp priced in), to cut as some risks remain on the disinflationary path. If our call for Fed and data-led USD depreciation also materialises, 0.68 is a very reachable target by year-end.\nScenario 2. Volatile status quo (AUD/USD at 0.66 year-end)\nTrade: No major re-escalation, but some tit-for-tat retaliation drags on into 2026. A combination of sectoral duties and curbs results in a higher tariff rate on China, but no outright increase in the tariff rate. Uncertainty becomes the new normal.\nFX: No additional risk-premium build-up on AUD, but antipodeans will hardly shine in this scenario. That leaves idiosyncratic USD weakness doing the heavy lifting on any AUD/USD rally. The upside is significantly restrained, but seasonality can pair with Fed cuts to take the pair to 0.66 by Christmas.\nScenario 3. Escalation (AUD/USD at 0.62 year-end)\nTrade: The US increases the tariff rate on all Chinese products and adds sectoral duties, as Beijing scales up retaliation. Global trade is significantly impacted, and both China and the US face material economic consequences. No meaningful de-escalation until the new year.\nFX: A very negative scenario for AUD/USD. While the single announcement causes some pockets of USD sell-offs, there\u2019s no rerun of the sell-America narrative. The Fed slows easing on higher tariff-related inflation risk, offering the USD some support. Ultimately, it\u2019s the China proxies like AUD that bear most of the brunt, also because the RBA faces increased pressure to cut.\nScenario 4. April 2.0 (AUD/USD at 0.67 year-end)\nTrade: Trump slams 100%+ tariffs on China, which turns highly aggressive on export restrictions and other retaliatory measures. This time, the de-escalation isn\u2019t quick, and multiple months of mammoth tariffs cause severe consequences for both the US and China. But the US bears most of the brunt, with risks of stagflation flaring.\nFX: The 'sell America' trade returns in full swing, and AUD/USD follows the April script: initial drop followed by a big rebound as the dollar sells off alongside US equities and Treasuries. The Fed keeps cutting, weighing further on the dollar. AUD will probably be the worst performer in the G10 after USD. But as a net effect, AUD/USD would still end the year higher.\nOur four scenarios for AUD\nThis publication has been prepa"

                "body": "TOKYO \u2013 October 15, 2025 \u2013 The relentless ascent of the Japanese Yen (JPY) against the U.S. Dollar (USD) has hit a significant snag, with the USD/JPY currency pair's recent breakout stalling abruptly at a crucial technical pivot zone. After a robust rally that saw the Yen weaken by nearly 9.6% from its yearly lows, pushing the pair to fresh eight-month highs, market participants are now grappling with an inflection point that could redefine the landscape for Japan's vital import and export sectors.\nThis unexpected pause, highlighted by financial analysis from FOREX.com, signals a potential shift in momentum, forcing businesses reliant on international trade to re-evaluate their strategies. The implications are particularly acute for commodity prices, where the Yen's value directly translates into the cost of raw materials for importers and the competitiveness of goods for exporters. As the market digests this stall, the immediate future of the Yen hangs in the balance, with profound effects anticipated across global supply chains and corporate bottom lines.\nTechnical Barriers and Market Hesitation\nThe USD/JPY pair's impressive rally, which surged into the October open, has now encountered formidable resistance, specifically in the 151.63-151.95 region. This critical pivot zone is not arbitrary; it's defined by the 61.8% retracement of the yearly range and encompasses significant swing highs from 2022 and 2023. Further resistance looms near the 152.35 mark and the psychologically important 156.00 level, creating a formidable ceiling for further upward movement. Technical indicators, such as the Daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), are flashing overbought conditions, reinforcing the notion that the bullish momentum may be stretched thin, making the pair vulnerable to a near-term correction if these barriers hold.\nThe timeline leading up to this moment saw the Yen steadily depreciating throughout much of 2025, driven by persistent interest rate differentials between the hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve and the dovish Bank of Japan. This monetary policy divergence provided a strong tailwind for the USD, propelling the pair higher. However, the current stall suggests that the market is hesitant to push beyond these established technical boundaries without a fresh catalyst. Key players, including large institutional traders and algorithmic systems, are closely monitoring these levels, amplifying their significance. Initial market reactions indicate a cautious sentiment, with some profit-taking observed and a wait-and-see approach dominating trading floors. Geopolitical factors, such as ongoing U.S.-China trade disputes and the spectre of a U.S. government shutdown, are also contributing to market volatility and investor uncertainty, influencing the Yen's safe-haven appeal.\nThe concept of a \"key pivot zone\" in currency trading is fundamental, serving as an objective price level derived from previous period's highs, lows, and closing prices. These zones act as critical junctures where the market often pauses, reverses, or experiences intensified price action. For the USD/JPY, the current stall at such a zone is a clear signal that the market is at a critical crossroads, suggesting either a period of consolidation before a potential continuation of the rally or, more significantly, a precursor to a substantial retracement. This technical hesitation underscores the market's current indecision and the heightened sensitivity to any new economic data or policy statements.\nCorporate Winners and Losers in a Volatile Yen Market\nThe stalling of the USD/JPY breakout creates a bifurcated outlook for Japanese corporations, with clear winners and losers emerging depending on their exposure to international trade and commodity markets. For Japanese importers, a stabilizing or strengthening Yen offers a much-needed reprieve. Companies such as Toyota Motor Corporation (TYO: 7203) and Sony Group Corporation (TYO: 6758), which rely heavily on imported raw "

                "body": "USD/JPY Range-Trading Phase\nThe USD/JPY pair may drop to 151.20, with further decline below this level currently unlikely. Analysts suggest that price movements are early indicators of a range-trading phase between 149.50 and 153.00.\nIn the last 24 hours, the USD traded within a range of 151.58/152.61, closing at 151.83, down 0.29%. Today, there is potential for the USD to edge lower and test 151.20, though a significant breach is not anticipated. Resistance levels are noted at 152.00 and 152.40.\nIn the next 1-3 weeks, analysts maintain their view that USD/JPY\u2019s movements are part of a range-trading phase, most likely between 149.50 and 153.00. Further attention is drawn to USD retreats due to trade tensions, Fed easing bets, and US fiscal gridlock.\nMarket observations include the rise in GBP/USD and AUD/USD, supported by shifts in US monetary stance and inflation risks flagged by the RBA. Additionally, gold remains stable below record highs amidst US-China trade tensions. Bitcoin\u2019s recovery faces limitations due to ongoing trade tensions and government shutdown issues.\nMarket Strategy Adjustments\nGiven the view that USD/JPY is entering a range-trading phase, we should adjust our strategies away from expecting strong directional trends. The immediate focus is on a potential test of the 151.20 support level, driven by broader US dollar weakness. This environment suggests that buying short-dated put options could be a tactical way to capitalize on this mild downward momentum.\nThe fundamental backdrop for a weaker dollar is building, as recent US data showed Q3 GDP growth was revised down to just 0.8%, while the latest core PCE inflation figure cooled to 2.7%. This contrasts with Japan\u2019s core inflation, which has now remained above the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target for over 18 consecutive months, increasing pressure on the BoJ to eventually signal policy normalization. This policy divergence reinforces the view that the dollar\u2019s strength against the yen may have peaked for now.\nFor the coming weeks, the predicted 149.50 to 153.00 range makes selling volatility an attractive proposition. We can look at strategies like selling strangles or setting up iron condors with strikes placed just outside this expected range. Implied volatility for one-month USD/JPY options has already compressed to near 8.5%, down from over 12% during the intervention scares we saw back in early 2024, making these positions potentially profitable from time decay.\nLooking at the broader market, significant fiscal gridlock in Washington and lingering trade tensions with China are weighing on the dollar. This is happening as gold prices remain elevated near $4,200 per ounce, a level not seen since the market turmoil of late 2024, signaling a flight to safety. Therefore, any long USD positions should be hedged, as sentiment could sour quickly and push USD/JPY toward the lower end of its new range near 149.50."

The US Dollar (USD) weakens against the Japanese Yen (JPY) due to the continuing trade tensions between the US and China. The Federal Reserve (Fed) officials are set to speak later on Thursday, including Michael Barr, Stephen Miran, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he saw the US is in a trade war with China, even as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent proposed a longer pause on high tariffs on Chinese goods to resolve a conflict over critical minerals. Concerns over escalating trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies could boost the safe-haven currencies like the JPY and act as a headwind for the pair.\nTraders assess comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell for more cues on upcoming rate cuts amid a US government shutdown, which has hampered the timely release of key data. On Tuesday, Powell left the door open to rate cuts by saying the US labor market remained mired in low-hiring, low-firing doldrums. He said the absence of official economic data due to the government shutdown has not prevented policymakers from being able to assess the economic outlook, at least for now.\nOn the other hand, the growing speculation that the political uncertainty in Japan could put pressure on the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to delay interest rate hikes further could weigh on the JPY. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)\u2013Komeito coalition came to an abrupt end last week. The development means the newly elected LDP leader, Sanae Takaichi, would need support from other parties to confirm her as Japan\u2019s first female Prime Minister and for her key policies.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

The pair depreciates as the US Dollar (USD) struggles amid market caution, driven by the escalating United States (US)-China trade tensions, the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he saw the US as in a trade war with China, even as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent proposed a longer pause on high tariffs on Chinese goods to resolve a conflict over critical minerals.\nThe Greenback also faced challenges after US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell stated on Tuesday that the central bank is on track to deliver another quarter-point interest-rate reduction later this month, even as a government shutdown significantly reduces its read on the economy. Powell highlighted the low pace of hiring and noted that it may weaken further. The CME FedWatch Tool indicates that markets are now pricing in nearly a 98% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and a 93% possibility of another reduction in December.\nThe downside of the USD/CAD pair could also be attributed to the positive sentiment surrounding the Oil prices, which provides support for the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD). It is worth noting that Canada is the largest Oil exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price trades around $58.30 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices may gain ground as US President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pledged his country would stop buying Russian Oil, per Reuters.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This"

Typically, falling oil prices would drag the currency lower\u2014since Canada is a major oil exporter\u2014but this time, growing hopes for future Fed interest rate cuts provided some relief. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious note, stressing a data-driven 'meeting-by-meeting' strategy while inflation lingers above the target and signs of a weaker labor market start to emerge. Most traders still expect more US rate cuts before year-end, unless new inflation or jobs numbers surprise. Meanwhile, local Canadian data barely registered\u2014a 1.2% fall in August building permits didn\u2019t move the needle. Bond yields slipped on both sides of the border, with Canadian 10-year notes falling in line with US Treasuries after the Thanksgiving slowdown.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Big picture forces keep the loonie grounded.\nThe Canadian dollar is caught between weaker oil prices and shifting interest rate bets. With US crude down over 1% to $58.70 and the International Energy Agency forecasting a supply surplus in 2026, oil-linked currencies like Canada\u2019s are under pressure. Still, expectations for Fed rate cuts are acting as a cushion, meaning investors are increasingly looking to central bank signals and global economic momentum, rather than just local headlines.\nThe bigger picture: Changing rates and oil trends set the stage.\nCanada\u2019s financial landscape is being shaped by the interplay between global monetary policy and commodity trends. Uncertainty around the Fed\u2019s next steps is keeping the loonie and local bonds on their toes, leaving businesses and governments planning for a world where international policy shifts and oil prices move the needle for growth, investment, and trade.\nTrading is hard enough as it is, so you need tools that make investing simpler.\nAfter all, if you\u2019re switching platforms to track data trends, do deeper research, and make trades, you\u2019re using extra time and effort. Plus, those delays could make you miss an opportunity.\nTradu\u2019s TradingView gets rid of that clutter: you\u2019ll find institutional-grade charts, technical analysis, and trend-marking tools in the same platform \u2013 and, you can execute trades right there and then.\nYou know what they say: tidy desk, tidy mind\u2026 Tidy portfolio.\n65% of retail CFD accounts lose money.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves departed for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank annual meetings, reiterating her message that the UK aims to be a \u201cbeacon of stability and growth.\u201d\nHer comments underscored a continued focus on fiscal discipline \u2014 likely involving a mix of tax increases and spending restraint \u2014 which has done little to lift near-term growth expectations.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) also traded quietly midweek in the absence of fresh domestic data, with the commodity-linked \u2018Loonie\u2019 instead tracking oil price movements.\nCrude prices continued to hover near five-month lows after WTI crude fell sharply earlier in the week, limiting demand for the Canadian Dollar.\nAlthough oil recovered slightly on Wednesday, gains were capped by concerns over softening global demand and ample supply, leaving CAD exchange rates largely rangebound.\nGBP/CAD Forecast: Weak GDP Could Pressure Sterling, BoC Speech in Focus\nLooking ahead, Thursday\u2019s UK GDP report will likely provide the next major directional cue for GBP/CAD.\nAnalysts expect just 0.1% growth in August, following July\u2019s stagnation \u2014 a result that would reinforce concerns over the UK\u2019s faltering recovery and potentially push Sterling lower.\nLater in the day, comments from BoE policymaker Catherine Mann may influence sentiment. As one of the Bank\u2019s more hawkish members, any shift toward concern over soft data could further weigh on GBP.\nFor the Canadian Dollar, attention will turn to Canada\u2019s business barometer index and a speech from Bank of Canada (BoC) Governor Tiff Macklem.\nIf Macklem hints that the central bank could cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting, the \u2018Loonie\u2019 may slip \u2014 potentially allowing GBP/CAD to retest recent highs despite weak UK data."

                "body": "Kenya has officially entered a new era for digital assets. President William Ruto signed the Virtual Asset Service Providers Act, 2025, giving the country its first comprehensive crypto regulation framework.\nThe new law licenses and regulates crypto exchanges, wallet providers, brokers, and payment processors operating in or from Kenya. It also brings the fast-growing sector under the oversight of two main regulators \u2014 the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA).\nUnder the Act, the CBK will supervise payment processors and stablecoin issuers, while the CMA will oversee trading platforms, investment advisers, and asset managers. Both agencies will now be responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and consumer protection standards.\n\u201cWe are hoping that Kenya can now be the gateway into Africa,\u201d said Kuria Kimani, chair of the parliamentary finance committee, according to Reuters reporting. \u201cMost young people between 18 and 35 are using virtual assets for trading, payments, or investment.\u201d\nKenya and crypto uncertainty\nThe law comes after years of uncertainty for Kenya\u2019s crypto sector, where platforms like Binance and Paxful have operated without clear rules.\nThe Act requires all providers to obtain a license, maintain audited records, and meet capital and cybersecurity requirements. Unlicensed operations will now be illegal.\nFor Bitcoin users, the benefits outweigh the costs. Licensed platforms must now segregate client funds, hold adequate reserves, and protect customer data.\nThe law mandates strict Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks, record-keeping, and suspicious transaction reporting to curb money laundering and terrorism financing. Violations could lead to fines of up to KES 20 million ($130,000) or imprisonment.\nThe move places Kenya alongside South Africa, which established its crypto licensing regime in 2023. Analysts say the law could attract new investment and help legitimize digital assets in East Africa\u2019s largest economy.\nCrypto use in Kenya has soared in recent years. According to Chainalysis, Kenya ranked fourth in Africa by transaction volume between July 2024 and June 2025, receiving nearly $20 billion in crypto assets.\nThe country also has a strong digital finance culture. Over 96% of households use M-PESA, a mobile money platform that has paved the way for digital payments adoption.\nStill, the law could challenge smaller operators.

                "body": "Who would have imagined that a titan like Fidelity would energize the world of cryptocurrencies? Its Bitcoin ETF, the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), has struck a chord, drawing in an astounding $103 million in net inflows on October 14 alone. This is no mere blip on the radar; it's a resounding emblem of an evolving trust in cryptocurrency investments. As global finance intersects with crypto, we find ourselves at the precipice of change \u2014 a potential shift in Bitcoin pricing and an expansive view of what the crypto market can become. In the paragraphs that follow, we\u2019ll explore Fidelity's hefty inflows, the rush of institutional interest, and what this all could mean for financial products tethered to Bitcoin in the days to come.\nThe Intricacies of Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF\nManaged by Fidelity Investments Canada, the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF stands tall, grabbing the attention of investors hungry for legitimate exposure to Bitcoin. This isn\u2019t just passive interest; it's strong, decisive action acknowledging that established financial players are now wielding influence in the crypto arena. By focusing solely on Bitcoin, FBTC resonates with those eager for direct involvement in the leading cryptocurrency, rather than a diluted experience through indirect channels.\nThe Momentum of Bitcoin ETF Inflows\nIt seems that institutional investors are casting their nets wider, flooding Bitcoin ETFs with investments like never before. Recent data reveals over $3 billion funneled into Bitcoin ETFs, transforming the landscape and reinforcing investor confidence. This uptick speaks volumes \u2014 people are not merely chasing potential price spikes but are also drawn to the regulatory shields these ETFs provide, which offer a sense of security missing from individual crypto investments.\nAn Evolving Institutional Landscape\nAs with any shift, the entrance of heavyweight entities like BlackRock and Invesco into the Bitcoin ETF fold marks a monumental evolution in sentiment. This movement indicates a growing recognition of cryptocurrency as a valid asset class within traditional finance. Yet, this seeming windfall for Bitcoin ETFs may obscure a troubling reality for smaller players in the Web3 space. They might find themselves on shaky ground, caught in an ecosystem that could amplify volatility and tether them too closely to the fluctuations of these larger financial products.\nStruggles in the Web3 Ecosystem\nThe shining opportunities for financial giants cast shadows on small Web3 startups, many of which grapple with the uncertain terrain created by these institutional shifts. Analysis suggests that while Bitcoin ETFs create liquidity, they also constrain smaller entities that may struggle to keep pace. Regulatory frameworks are evolving, but for these nimble players, navigating a labyrinth of compliance can prove daunting, potentially stifling their growth while leaving them at a disadvantage in a fast-accelerating market.\nLooking Ahead in the Crypto Frontier\nAs Fidelity and other institutional titans blaze a trail into the Bitcoin ETF frontier, we must ponder what lies ahead. The inflows signify thrilling possibilities, yet they raise significant questions about the sustainability of innovation. Will an overreliance on established ETFs inhibit the development of the native payment structures that decentralized organizations need? A wave of Bitcoin ETFs could inadvertently shift focus away from creating seamless, compliant solutions that will power the future of finance.\nConclusion\nThe impressive influx into Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t just a feather in the cap for institutional investors; it marks a pivotal shift for the entire cryptocurrency landscape. What once felt like a fractured market is beginning to unify, yet small startups risk being sidelined by large financial entities that command the spotlight. The path forward for Bitcoin and its advocates appears more dynamic than ever, but it requires a keen eye on how these financial p"

That said, it also continues to sell crypto assets for fiat on centralized exchanges to fund blockchain research and development.\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, the Ethereum Foundation holds over $820 million worth of crypto assets, including $735 million worth of ETH, at current prices, according to The Block\u2019s ETH price page.\nFounded in 2022, Morpho is a decentralized lending protocol on Ethereum that has become a popular institutional option. For instance, Coinbase recently surpassed $1 billion worth of bitcoin-backed onchain loan originations using Morpho, just eight months after the service launched.\nSome $4.6 billion has been locked on Morpho Blue v1, a small fraction of the total Ethereum lending market, but in line with rivals like Compound, Spark, and older versions of Aave, according to The Block's data.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

The Ethereum Foundation has just thrown down the gauntlet by injecting a staggering 2,400 ETH and about $6 million in USDC into Morpho's treasury. This remarkable act isn\u2019t just about expanding into decentralized finance (DeFi); it signifies a monumental shift in how institutions perceive the cryptocurrency landscape, especially regarding treasury management and liquidity strategies.\nA Calculated Move: The Depth of the ETH Investment\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s financial commitment to Morpho transcends mere investment. It's a well-orchestrated strategy aimed at diversifying its assets while bolstering ties with DeFi ecosystems. By blending traditional financial elements like USDC, a centralized stablecoin, with its decentralized ethos, the Foundation illustrates the complex interplay between modern protocols and established financial frameworks.\nThis complex decision sheds light on the pressing need for institutions to reconcile their desire for decentralization with an ongoing reliance on fiat-backed assets. It raises pivotal questions about whether DeFi can genuinely fulfill its promise of autonomy and self-sovereignty amidst an evolving hybrid financial reality.\nSetting the Stage for DeFi Transformation\nThe ripple effects of this ETH infusion are astonishing. As we witness greater institutional acceptance, the potential for enhanced liquidity in the DeFi space becomes increasingly tangible. The Ethereum Foundation\u2019s decisive actions may serve as a beacon, prompting other financial institutions to follow suit, thereby solidifying the legitimacy of decentralized financial solutions.\nIn the crypto arena, liquidity is king. The significant influx of ETH and USDC into Morpho's treasury is anticipated to boost its total value locked (TVL), further establishing Ethereum as a premier network for stablecoins and tokenized assets. This growth isn\u2019t just a boon for Morpho; it revitalizes the entire DeFi landscape, igniting a cycle of fresh investment and relentless innovation.\nCompliance Challenges in DeFi Treasury Management\nAs institutions venture deeper into DeFi initiatives, the critical task of managing compliance and operational risks surfaces. The Ethereum Foundation\u2019s proactive strategy can serve as a playbook for Web3 enterprises looking to integrate decentralized finance effectively into their treasury management frameworks.\nHowever, this approach is fraught with complications. The utilization of stablecoins in decentralized frameworks can unveil substantial liabilities. To navigate risks such as counterparty failures and liquidity restrictions, institutions need to fortify their understanding of regulatory environments. Experts stress that adeptly maneuvering these intricate challenges is essential for the next wave of DeFi innovators, influencing their future success.\nA Promising Horizon for Institutional DeFi Engagement\nMarket analysts are optimistic about the future of DeFi as an avenue for institutional engagement. The Ethereum Foundation's strategic allocation of assets to Morpho is emblematic of a broader trend: organizations are eager to tap into the advantages of DeFi without completely breaking ties with traditional financial structures.\nEven while the true potential of decentralized protocols unfolds, pivotal investments like these have the power to spark broader mainstream adoption. Institutions redefining their approaches to self-custody and compliance will be crucial in shaping the trajectory of decentralized finance as it continues to grow.\nConclusion\nThe Ethereum Foundation's significant deposit into Morpho marks a turning point\u2014not merely a financial transaction but a powerful endorsement of decentralized frameworks by institutional players. This decisive leap fosters liquidity, affirms the credibility of decentralized platforms, and stimulates critical dialogue about the coexistence of centralization and decentralization.

Nansen said the project aims to make staking on Solana more liquid and easy to use.\nSanctum \u2013 which has a TVL of $2.5 billion, up significantly from $900 million in April \u2013 is the fourth largest protocol on Solana and helps to enhance the utility of staked SOL. Currently, around 68% of SOL\u2019s total supply is staked \u2013 that\u2019s about 372 million tokens worth $74.5 billion. Staked SOL earns on average an estimated 4.38% annual yield, according to Coinbase data.\nThe launch of nxSOL adds to Solana\u2019s growing liquid staking market, which includes protocols like Jito and Marinade. JitoSOL currently holds over $2.9 billion in TVL, making it the largest liquid staking protocol on Solana. Meanwhile, Marinade\u2019s liquid staking arm (mSOL) boasts about $835 million in TVL and a 30-day average APY of 6.89%.\nThe addition of nxSOL reflects a broader shift on Solana, where liquid staking is helping to drive growth and make the network more flexible, decentralized, and user-friendly. Solana\u2019s broader ecosystem has recorded strong growth this year as more investors are drawn to its fast transactions and low fees.\n\u201cnxSOL marks the next chapter in Nansen\u2019s staking journey, expanding our reach into Solana while staying true to our mission of making onchain participation simple, liquid, and secure,\u201d said Alex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen. \u201cIt\u2019s about unlocking new horizons for users and builders as staking becomes an integral part of the onchain economy.\u201d\nThe partnership comes as Nansen expands its footprint in staking. Since acquiring validator platform StakewithUs last year, the firm\u2019s total staked assets have grown from $60 million to more than $2 billion, spanning over 20 blockchain networks and 350,000 stakers, according to a press release viewed by The Defiant.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

Jupiter, Solana\u2019s leading DEX aggregator, is also the largest in the crypto industry by volume.\nPump.fun, a memecoin launchpad and social app, attracts around 2 million monthly active users and generates approximately $1.2 million in daily revenue.Source: Grayscale\nHelium, a decentralized physical infrastructure project focused on mobile hotspots, now provides services cheaper than centralized alternatives. The Solana-based protocol has 1.5 million daily users, 112,000 hotspots, and partnerships with major telecom companies like AT&T and Telefonica.\nThese examples represent just a fraction of Solana\u2019s more than 500 unique applications.\nAs a general-purpose blockchain, Solana ranks third in NFT trading, fifth in stablecoin transaction volume, and seventh in tokenized assets.\nAugust on Solana, by the numbers:\u2794 $148 million in app revenue, up 92% from 2024 and surpassing all other networks\u2794 All-time high perps volume of $43.8 billion\u2794 2.9 billion transactions, up 46% y/y and more than 4x all other networks combined\u2794 $144 billion in DEX\u2026 \u2014 Solana (@solana)\nSolana apps generate about $425 million in monthly fees, or over $5 billion annualized.\n\u201cWe believe that fees are the most direct measure of total demand for a blockchain and its applications, and the data indicate there\u2019s substantial demand for Solana,\u201d Grayscale\u2019s research stated.\nSolana has carved out a competitive position by offering fast and cheap transactions.\nThe network produces new blocks every 400 milliseconds, and transactions reach finality in approximately 12\u201313 seconds. Transaction costs have remained low, with users paying an average fee of just $0.02 per year to date.Source: Grayscale\nSolana uses local fee markets, which limit fee competition to specific high-demand applications, and median daily transaction fees this year have averaged just $0.001.\nAdditionally, a forthcoming upgrade called Alpenglow is expected to reduce finality time to 100\u2013150 milliseconds.1,000+ Solana Developers Building What Ethereum Can\u2019t Easily Copy\nDespite crypto\u2019s user experience challenges, Solana offers one of the best new-user experiences in the industry. Its fast and cheap transactions, diverse applications, and \u201cmonolithic\u201d design eliminate the need to bridge assets between network components. Its wallet infrastructure, led by Phantom, also contributes to this advantage.\nSolana uses a distinct architecture called the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) used by Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche.\nSVM-based applications can\u2019t be easily transferred to non-SVM blockchains, potentially creating sticky demand.Source:\nMore than 1,000 full-time developers work on Solana and SVM-based applications.\nThe number of Solana-focused developers has also grown faster than any other smart contract platform over the last two years, according to Electric Capital\u2019s blockchain developer report.Source: GrayscaleIndustry Leaders Project SOL Could Push Past $260 to Hit $520 by Year"

Another round of Wall Street earnings reports is kicking off the quarterly review period on a high note, with investment bank and luxury handbag earnings outpacing expectations.\nStill-rising trade tensions between the US and China are still simmering away on the back burner, and the ongoing US government shutdown remains a key sticking point for global markets, but equities remain focused on earnings, the one blue patch in an otherwise grey sky.\nEarnings trump trade wars and non-functioning governments, apparently\nMorgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) both beat earnings expectations during the third quarter, rising nearly 6% and 5% respectively, on Wednesday. French luxury goods conglomerate Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH) soared over 12% on the day after thumping earnings expectations, further bolstering broad-market expectations that companies will continue to churn out record-setting earnings periods.\nOfficial US datasets remain a large blank space as the Trump administration largely avoids getting involved in solving the federal government\u2019s ongoing funding shutdown. Little indication has been given that the two sides of the US government are in a particular rush to bring an end to the federal closure, sparking comments from Trump aides that a sweeping firing of government workers is now underway. A federal judge in San Francisco issued a sweeping block of any firings by the Trump administration, at the specific request of multiple federal worker unions, a move that will both draw ire from President Trump and further assuage any concerns about long-term fallout from the shutdown for investors.\nInvestors also continue to brush off any negative outcomes from the government data freeze, largely due to a lack of any official reporting on labor, wages, and employment makes it easier for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to maintain its near-term trajectory of delivering two more interest rate cuts before the end of the year.\nDow Jones daily chart\nDow Jones FAQs\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the oldest stock market indices in the world, is compiled of the 30 most traded stocks in the US. The index is price-weighted rather than weighted by capitalization. It is calculated by summing the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing them by a factor, currently 0.152. The index was founded by Charles Dow, who also founded the Wall Street Journal. In later years it has been criticized for not being broadly representative enough because it only tracks 30 conglomerates, unlike broader indices such as the S&P 500.\nMany different factors drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The aggregate performance of the component companies revealed in quarterly company earnings reports is the main one. US and global macroeconomic data also contributes as it impacts on investor sentiment. The level of interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve (Fed), also influences the DJIA as it affects the cost of credit, on which many corporations are heavily reliant. Therefore, inflation can be a major driver as well as other metrics which impact the Fed decisions.\nDow Theory is a method for identifying the primary trend of the stock market developed by Charles Dow. A key step is to compare the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) and only follow trends where both are moving in the"

                "body": "New York, NY \u2013 October 15, 2025 \u2013 The Dow Jones Industrial Average staged a notable recovery today, rising modestly after a tumultuous Tuesday session, as robust third-quarter earnings reports from banking titans Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) injected a much-needed dose of optimism into the markets. The positive corporate results helped to temper investor anxieties stemming from escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, which have cast a long shadow over global economic sentiment throughout the week.\nToday's upward movement signals a resilient market grappling with conflicting forces: the fundamental strength of corporate America versus the unpredictable headwinds of geopolitical disputes. While the strong performance of major financial institutions provided a clear impetus for the market's rebound, the underlying concerns regarding international trade relations continue to dictate a cautious approach for many investors.\nBanking Sector Propels Market Forward Despite Geopolitical Headwinds\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by approximately 320 to 358.55 points, or between 0.7% and 0.77%, by mid-morning Eastern Time, reaching 46,627.33. This recovery followed a volatile Tuesday where major indexes closed lower, primarily due to renewed U.S.-China trade disputes. The financial sector emerged as a significant driver of today's gains, with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley leading the charge.\nBank of America (NYSE: BAC) saw its shares climb between 3.9% and 4.9% after reporting an impressive third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $1.06, comfortably surpassing analyst estimates of 95 cents. The bank also posted strong revenue of $28.24 billion, exceeding expectations of $27.5 billion, driven by robust performance across all its business lines and an upward revision to its interest income forecast. Similarly, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) shares surged between 5% and 7.2%, hitting a record high, after announcing a third-quarter EPS of $2.80 against an estimated $2.10, and revenue of $18.22 billion, significantly above the $16.7 billion anticipated. The firm attributed its strong results partly to a buoyant period in dealmaking.\nThe backdrop to today's market action was a week marked by significant volatility. Last Friday, October 10, saw a pronounced selloff with the S&P 500 plummeting 2.7% after President Donald Trump threatened a \"massive increase\" in tariffs on Chinese imports and imposed export controls on \"critical software.\" However, markets experienced a brief rebound on Monday, October 13, following a more conciliatory tone from Trump on social media. This fragile calm was shattered on Tuesday when Trump escalated trade concerns by threatening an embargo on cooking oil as retaliation for China's perceived failure to purchase U.S. soybeans, alongside China's response of sanctions on five U.S. subsidiaries in South Korea and new port fees on U.S. vessels. These aggressive actions and counter-actions continue to fuel uncertainty, even as strong corporate earnings provide a temporary reprieve.\nCorporate Earnings Offer Resilience Amidst Trade War Jitters\nThe strong earnings from Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) position them as clear winners in the current market environment. Their robust financial performance, particularly in a period of economic uncertainty, underscores their operational efficiency and strategic positioning. Bank of America's broad-based profit growth and increased interest income forecast suggest a healthy core banking business, while Morgan Stanley's strength in dealmaking highlights the continued, albeit perhaps selective, activity in capital markets. These results could lead to increased investor confidence in the broader financial sector, potentially drawing more capital into other well-managed banking institutions.\nConversely, companies heavily reliant on global supply chains or with significant exposure to the Chinese market might face ongoing chall"

Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.7%. All three indexes lost hold of bigger gains earlier in the session, continuing market choppiness after Tuesday's rocky session.\nThe stronger start to the session followed a solid start to earnings season, which buoyed market spirits in the face of US-China trade friction and a US government shutdown with no end in sight.\nOn Wednesday morning, Bank of America (BAC) posted a 23% jump in profit, becoming the latest big US bank to benefit from this summer's bonanza of big deals on Wall Street. Morgan Stanley (MS) saw its profits surge 45% in what its CEO hailed as an \"outstanding\" quarter.\nMeanwhile, comments from Jerome Powell also lifted spirits. The Federal Reserve Chair said that \"downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" implying more rate cuts are on the cards. Investors closely scrutinized Powell's remarks, given the current lack of insight into the economy as the federal stoppage delays the release of key data.\nInvestors have cemented bets on a rate cut later this month, and odds of a rate cut in December have jumped in recent days to around 96%.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday raised hopes on that front, saying Trump was still planning to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this month. Bessent also floated extending a tariff pause, even as he slammed China's recent trade moves.\nAt the same time, the Trump administration is preparing for the government shutdown to drag on.

Revenue also fell short, with $21.3 billion reported versus the estimated $21.6 billion. Net income dropped 48% year over year.\nProgressive experienced a $950 million expense in September due to a 2023 policy change in Florida that limits profits made on auto insurance.\n\"Despite actions to lower rates in the last year, it is probable that our personal auto profit in Florida for the 2023 to 2025 period will exceed the statutory profit limit that a Florida statute imposes...,\" the company said. \"In such event, we would need to credit any profit above the limit to all Florida personal auto policyholders active at December 31, 2025.\"\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has failed to maintain its 'Uptober' gains as investors move risk-off amid the US-China tariff turmoil.\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency has typically experienced its strongest month of the year in October.

                "body": "Our verdict\nPros\n- Premium MATRYX upper\n- Durable Contagrip rubber\n- Comfortable, precision-fit heel lockdown\n- Versatile lug design\n- Smooth, forward-rolling toe rocker\n- Good breathability\n- Suitable for various distances\n- Quicklace system allows fast tightening\n- Well-designed tongue\nCons\n- Really high price\n- Low energy return for its category\n- Heavy for a racing model\n- Extremely snug fit\nAudience verdict\nComparison\nThe most similar running shoes compared\nWho should buy\nIn our view, the Salomon S/Lab Ultra is a great match for:\n- Trail runners loyal to the Salomon brand who don\u2019t mind paying a premium for the S/Lab experience.\n- Those with narrow feet seeking a reliable shoe that offers a secure fit for trail running or hiking.\n- Fans of the MATRYX upper who value its top-tier tech and precision feel, even at the expense of affordability.\nWho should NOT buy\nWe believe that the Salomon S/Lab Ultra isn\u2019t the best choice for most runners. Its snug fit can feel overly restrictive, even for those with average-width feet, limiting natural toe splay and overall comfort. In our lab, we found that the Nike Zegama 2 provides a more relaxed fit, better toe space, and even superior energy return... all for a lower price!\nAdditionally, we think the S/Lab Ultra\u2019s energy return falls far short of expectations for such a premium price tag. Based on our lab measurements, the rebound is just average. If you\u2019re seeking an energetic trail shoe, we recommend the Hoka Tecton X 3 or Adidas Terrex Agravic Speed Ultra instead.\nCushioning\nShock absorption\nNewWe found that the S/Lab Ultra absorbs impact far better at the heel than at the forefoot.\nDuring testing, it reached 130 SA in the rear, while the front registered only 95 SA. This is a noticeable difference that gives the shoe a distinctly heel-striker-friendly character. Or makes it a great choice for runners who like a forefoot that slightly cushions impact but feels natural underfoot.\nEnergy return\nNewWe found in our lab tests that the Ultra\u2019s energy return fell short of what we expected for a competition shoe.\nThe foam produced only 55.4% rebound in the heel and a slightly higher 59.8% in the forefoot\u2014both sitting in the average range at best. These numbers reveal a low-bounce performance that fails to justify its high-end price tag, and we think that results should have reached the 65-70% zone.\nHeel stack\nThe heel stack lives up to its \u201cUltra\u201d name, standing well above average at 36.3 mm, which makes it ideal for heel strikers seeking extra cushioning on each landing.\nWe also appreciate how it strikes an interesting balance by offering solid shock absorption without exceeding 40 mm of total height, where stability often starts to suffer.\nForefoot stack\nOur digital calipers measured the forefoot stack of the S/Lab Ultra at 26.1 mm. While this doesn\u2019t qualify it as a maximalist shoe like the ASICS Trabuco Max 4, it\u2019s slightly higher than most trail models.\nDrop\nWe measured a 10.2 mm heel-to-toe drop. Sure, it's uncommon for a trail shoe, though not far from Salomon\u2019s stated 8 mm. In our view, this midsole design is another clear nod to heel strikers and those running long distances, as form usually suffers after 2-3 hours and everyone starts to heel strike.\nMidsole softness\nThe Energy Foam midsole feels slightly softer than most trail models, a sensation we confirmed with our Shore A durometer, which measured 17.5 HA.\nHowever, as with all trail shoes, the lugs naturally firm up the ride compared to a road shoe with the same reading, so keep that in mind when expecting certain underfoot feel.\nRocker\nThe S/Lab Ultra shows a pronounced forefoot rocker for a trail shoe, with noticeable curvature in both the heel and forefoot. This design encourages a smoother forward roll and helps maintain momentum during long runs and ultra events.\nWe also found that the heel\u2019s rounded shape also eases landings for rearfoot strikers.\nPlate\nNewThe S/Lab Ultra uses a fiberglass profeelPLATE with an X-shaped "

This recovery also offset the sharp decline on the 14th triggered by Komeito's exit from the ruling coalition. The TOPIX (Tokyo Stock Price Index) also rose by 15.54 points to 3,199.18 points, surpassing last week\u2019s closing level. The Nikkei Average hit an intraday high of 48,201.50 yen, up 528.83 yen at 9:03 a.m. Expectations grew for progress in coalition talks between the Liberal Democratic Party and Japan Innovation Party, strengthening bullish sentiment. Additionally, in the U.S. stock market on the 15th, technology stocks were bought, driving up both the Nasdaq Composite Index and the SOX Index (Philadelphia Semiconductor Index), which led to solid gains in semiconductor-related and other tech stocks. The dollar-yen exchange rate hovered in the upper half of the 150-yen range, showing some appreciation of the yen from earlier levels.\nThe trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime Market was 1.05423 billion shares, with a trading value of 2.6788 trillion yen. Among listed issues, 814 saw price increases, 715 saw declines, and 86 remained unchanged.\nBy sector, 23 of the 33 industries showed gains while 10 declined.
