                "body": "Gold climbs as stalling inflation and weak spending fuel December Fed cut bets\n- Gold rebounds to $4,159 as data shows stalling inflation and softer consumer spending.\n- Conference Board confidence plunges to 88.7, highlighting concerns over jobs, incomes, and stability amid shutdown fallout.\n- Markets price 82% odds of a December 25-bps Fed cut, with more US data due Wednesday.\nGold (XAU/USD) climbs over 0.14% on Tuesday after US economic data augmented speculation of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) at the December 9-10 meeting. Also, falling US Treasury yields and a weaker US Dollar keep XAU/USD trading at $4,141 after hitting a daily low of $4,109.\nXAU/USD advances on falling yields, weak Dollar\nUS inflation and Retail Sales have shown that rising prices seem to have stalled, while households reduced their consumption in September, two months ahead of the Christmas season. In addition to this, the Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence dipped in November as Americans remain uncertain about jobs, incomes and their financial situation, due to the government shutdown.\nGiven the backdrop, money markets price in an 82% chance of a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut at the next meeting, up from last week\u2019s 50% odds.\nOn Monday, the Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said that \u201cthere are real use cases for AI, but not for crypto, adds people are feeling hardship due to inflation,\u201d reaffirming his hawkish stance, amid a divided Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nAhead this week, the US economic docket will feature Durable Goods Orders and Initial Jobless Claims on Wednesday, which could set the stage ahead of Fed officials entering their blackout period.\nDaily market movers: Lower US inflation reading, to cement Fed cut in December\n- The Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 2.7% YoY in September, matching both forecasts and August\u2019s reading, signaling that price pressures have steadied. Core PPI eased to 2.6% from 2.9%, coming in below expectations of 2.7%.\n- Retail Sales increased 0.2% MoM in September, down from August\u2019s 0.6% gain, pointing to softer consumer spending. Meanwhile, the Conference Board reported that household sentiment deteriorated in November, with Consumer Confidence dropping 6.8 points to 88.7 from 95.5 in October.\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the buck\u2019s performance versus six currencies, plummets 0.50% below the 100.00 mark at 99.69. At the same time, US Treasury yields fall, with the 10-year US Treasury note yield falling three basis points to 4.00%. US real yields, which correlate inversely to Gold prices, are also falling three basis points to 1.80%.\nTechnical analysis: Gold price rallies towards $4,200\nGold remains upwardly biased, even though it has consolidated below the $4,200 mark with traders waiting for a fresh catalyst. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), although flat, is above the 50-level threshold, an indication that buyers are in charge.\nThe first key resistance is $4,200, followed by the November 13 peak at $4,245. A breach of the latter will expose $4,300 and the record high of $4,381. Conversely, a drop below $4,100 clears the path to challenge the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $4,045, before diving to $4,000.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn\u2019t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country\u2019s solvency. Central b"

The pair is gaining as the US Dollar (USD) comes under pressure, with softer United States (US) economic data boosting expectations of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in December.\nThe CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in more than 84% odds that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, up from 50% probability that markets priced a week ago.\nThe US Census Bureau released US Retail Sales on Tuesday, which rose by 0.2% month-over-month (MoM) in September, slowing from the 0.6% increase seen in August, indicating more cautious consumer spending. Retail Sales Control Group declined 0.1%, against the expectations of a 0.3% rise and the previous 0.6% growth. Separately, the Conference Board reported a sharp deterioration in household sentiment, with Consumer Confidence sliding 6.8 points to 88.7 in November from 95.5 in October.\nThe US Producer Price Index (PPI) remained steady at 2.7% year-over-year in September, matching expectations and August\u2019s reading and suggesting that inflationary pressures have stabilized. Core PPI eased to 2.6% from 2.9%, undershooting forecasts of 2.7%.\nAdditionally, the EUR/USD pair gains ground as the Euro (EUR) draws support from cautious sentiment surrounding the European Central Bank (ECB) policy outlook. Traders expect the central bank to keep interest rates unchanged throughout 2026, citing a resilient economy and inflation near target.\nECB Governor and Deutsche Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said on Monday that the central bank is also monitoring the strong rise in service prices, noting that December projections will offer clearer insight into whether the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro.

                "body": "USD/JPY Probes Support as US Dollar Stumbles on Fed Cut Bets\nUSD/JPY is probing key support as a weaker US dollar and rising Fed cut expectations ripple across FX markets. Softer US data, dovish Fed commentary and improving risk appetite have pushed traders to reassess the December meeting and the timing of the next cut. With risk sentiment buoyant and the yen firming slightly, USD/JPY is at an important technical juncture.\nView related analysis:\n- Thanksgiving Market Seasonality: US Dollar, EUR/USD and Gold\n- Nasdaq 100 Outlook: Thanksgiving Seasonality and Volatility Trends\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Faces CPI Test as USD Strength Persists\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: AUD/USD Breakout, AUD/JPY Mean Reversion?\nUSD/JPY Outlook: Key Levels Under Pressure as Dollar Softens\nExpectations for a 25bp Fed cut in December have more than doubled over the past week to 82.7%, according to Fed funds futures. Several Fed members have turned notably dovish ahead of the blackout period for the December meeting, helped along by renewed pressure from President Trump for the central bank to ease. But the data is also making the case for a cut.\n- ADP employment contracted by 13.5k, marking its third negative print.\n- Inflation pressures softened, with core producer prices slowing to 2.6% y/y (2.7% forecast) and 0.1% m/m (0.2% expected).\n- Consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low of 88.7, well below 95.5 prior and missing the 93.55 expected.\n- Core retail sales rose just 0.1% m/m, missing the 0.4% forecast and below the revised 0.6% prior (down from 0.7%).\nBad news is good for Wall Street, with Dow Jones futures leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 higher for a third day. It seems traders are satisfied that the US economy is slowing fast enough to justify slower cuts, without slowing fast enough to trigger concerns of a recession.\nAUD/USD rose for a third day ahead of today\u2019s inflation release \u2014 the first monthly data available for Q4, with the official quarterly figures not due until late January. Traders will be watching trimmed mean inflation and CPI excluding travel and volatile items. With the US dollar on the back foot, the Australian dollar could extend its run to a fourth day unless CPI delivers a surprise downside miss \u2014 which seems unlikely at this stage.\nUS Dollar Index Pullback: Is Wave C Nearing Completion?\nThe US Dollar Index fell to a four-day low during its worst session in 13 days, sliding comfortably back below 100 as part of a countertrend move. If incoming US data continues to soften, the dollar could bring forward expectations of another 25bp cut \u2014 currently priced for April with a 40.9% probability.\nStill, the daily trend structure on the US Dollar Index remains firm, so I\u2019m open to wave c terminating around 101 or even 102 before any larger bearish move unfolds.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView U.S. Dollar Index Futures\nUSD/JPY Technical Analysis:\nThe Japanese yen was slightly higher across the board, with the weaker US dollar helping USD/JPY slip to a four-day low. Support has held around the February high (155.89) and the 10-day EMA (155.85), which is likely to be a pivotal zone in the near term.\nThe broader daily trend remains firmly bullish, so traders need to assess whether this is simply a shallow pullback within a strong uptrend or the start of something larger.\nNotably, the 1-week and 1-month USD/JPY risk reversals have not broken to new cycle highs alongside spot prices. This points to some caution from bulls, while implied volatility across the 1-week, 1-month and 3-month tenors remains low \u2014 signalling no sense of panic in this pullback.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nUSD/JPY Short-Term Levels: Bounce Risk Before a Deeper Pullback\nThe 1-hour chart shows a bullish engulfing candle forming around the February high and the 10-day EMA, alongside a bullish divergence on the RSI (2) in the oversold zone.

The pair is rebounding from last week\u2019s low of 1.1470, breaking above the short-term descending trendline that has capped upside since October. The technical landscape is tightening, but with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) falling back below 100.00, the tide is shifting in favor of euro bulls for the first time in several weeks.\nSoft U.S. Data and Rate Cut Expectations Undermine USD\nThe catalyst for the current EUR/USD rally is the erosion of U.S. macro strength. The latest Producer Price Index (PPI) rose just 0.3% month-over-month, while the core measure increased 0.2%, undershooting expectations of 0.3%. On a yearly basis, PPI inflation remained at 2.7%, but soft service-sector pricing pointed to cooling demand. In parallel, U.S. Retail Sales rose a meager 0.2% in September, missing the 0.4% forecast, with core sales excluding autos up only 0.3%, also below consensus.\nThe Retail Sales Control Group, a direct GDP input, contracted 0.1%, a notable reversal from the 0.6% expansion in August. This weakness came alongside a slide in the ADP employment 4-week average from -2.5K to -13.5K, confirming labor-market deterioration. Together, these numbers weakened the case for a strong U.S. dollar and accelerated bets on monetary easing.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, traders now price in an 84\u201385% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the December 9\u201310 FOMC meeting, up from 30% a week ago. The sharp repricing has pulled the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.02%, and the 2-year to 3.48%, while the DXY slipped to 99.84, its lowest level in five sessions.\nFed Policy Shift: Dovish Comments From Key Officials\nThe pivot in U.S. monetary sentiment stems from dovish rhetoric by top Federal Reserve officials. John Williams, President of the New York Fed, stated that the current stance is \u201cmodestly restrictive\u201d and that there\u2019s \u201croom for adjustment toward neutral,\u201d signaling an openness to cuts without endangering inflation progress. Christopher Waller echoed that labor market softening warrants further easing, while Mary Daly of the San Francisco Fed reinforced the argument by citing \u201cbroad moderation\u201d in economic activity.\nThese coordinated comments mark a notable shift from the hawkish tone seen in October, when policymakers were divided over how long to keep rates elevated. The market has since recalibrated: futures now imply at least two cuts before March 2026. This aligns with euro strength, as investors rotate away from dollar-denominated assets amid falling real yields.\nEurozone Stability Offsets U.S. Weakness\nThe euro\u2019s resilience has also been supported by relative stability in the Eurozone\u2019s data stream. Germany\u2019s GDP figures, released earlier in the session, showed a 0.2% quarterly contraction, but that was milder than the 0.3% expected, alleviating concerns about a deeper recession. Meanwhile, the IFO Business Climate Index stabilized near 88.6, suggesting that sentiment has stopped deteriorating after months of contraction.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) remains cautious but balanced. While President Christine Lagarde has reiterated that \u201cthe disinflation process is advancing,\u201d she has avoided signaling any imminent rate cuts. The ECB\u2019s deposit rate stands at 3.75%, and market pricing reflects expectations for easing only by Q2 2026. This divergence in timing between the Fed\u2019s dovish pivot and the ECB\u2019s slower path has contributed to the recent EUR/USD recovery from 1.1450 to 1.1567.\nTechnical Struc"

                "body": "GBP/USD Forecast: All eyes turn to the UK budget\nThe focus in UK markets is turning to the Autumn Budget on Wednesday and ahead of it we have seen a mild recovery in the GBP/USD, which has found support as the US dollar recovery has paused ahead of the release of US retail sales and PPI inflation data today. Consumer inflation in the UK last week came in at 3.6%, which was a tad hotter than expected but this was never going to move the needle as the focus remained on the budget and the direction of the US dollar now that the US government shutdown is over. In recent days, a few Fed officials have highlighted the weakening employment in the US as a reason to loosen policy further in December. This, though, has not materially weighed on the dollar, with the greenback finding decent support lately due to the heightened volatility in the stock and crypto markets. The September payrolls report was mixed last week, but other macro indicators from the world\u2019s largest economy have been not so great. Will that trend continue, with the release of US retail sales and a few other macro pointers today?\nCan the dollar extend recovery?\nIn what will be a lighter week for trading due to Thursday\u2019s US Thanksgiving holiday, there are still a few key data releases to watch. September retail sales are due shortly, and if the figures come in as strong as expected of around +0.4% m/m for the headline and +0.3% m/m for the core, markets may find fresh justification to push the dollar higher. We also have PPI released at the same time i.e., 13:30 GMT. This is expected to show +0.2% m/m reading on the headline front. A few other macro pointers will be released later on this afternoon.\nTraders should also keep an eye on Wednesday\u2019s Fed Beige Book, which offers anecdotal insights from the central bank\u2019s 12 districts. If it shows clearer signs that the employment slowdown is spreading, investors may grow more confident in the likelihood of a December rate cut.\nNotably, a few Fed officials such as Chris Waller and Mary Daly have expressed support for a December rate cut. New York Fed President John Williams has also recently signalled his support for another cut next month, prompting market expectations for a December move to climb back toward 75%.\nIt\u2019s All About the UK Budget for GBP/USD forecast\nWith just a day to go until the Chancellor, Rachael Reeves, steps up for the Autumn Budget, the pound is treading carefully. Gilts have been volatile, and the pound has drifted sideways as traders weigh up the government\u2019s fiscal credibility. The recent rise in yields isn\u2019t entirely homegrown \u2013 global yields, especially in Japan, have also pushed higher \u2013 but UK-specific jitters have certainly played a part. Reports that the government may ditch income tax increases have only amplified concerns over how a \u00a325 to 30 billion fiscal hole will be plugged. Reeves will need to deliver a convincing plan tomorrow; if she doesn\u2019t, UK assets could face a rough ride.\nGBP/USD forecast: Technical levels to watch\nDespite the mild recovery, the GBP/USD chart remains in a short-term bear trend as defined by the lower lows and lower highs. So it remains to be seen whether the cable will be able to climb back above the pivotal levels of 1.3140. This level had served as a double bottom earlier in the year before finally cracking in early November, and since then the pair has hovered around this region without making any decisive move away from it. If the bulls can reclaim this shelf, then that would boost the GBP/USD forecast from a technical point of view. In that case, the next upside markers sit at 1.3200 and 1.3250. But a clean break lower would quickly expose 1.3050 and then the psychological 1.3000 handle. For now, momentum feels indecisive, so watch price action closely to see which direction is the more likely outcome, before deciding on any trades. In truth, a lot will be determined on Friday by the UK budget announcement.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFoll"

Reeves is now compelled to pursue additional revenue-raising measures amid a likely downgrade to Britain\u2019s economic outlook and rising debt-servicing costs.\nUK softer inflation eased to 3.6% in October and strengthened expectations of a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut. Markets now assign an 80% probability of a 25-bp cut in December, pushing gilt yields lower ahead of the budget.\nThe GBP/USD pair also gains as the US Dollar (USD) struggles, with softer United States (US) economic data boosting expectations of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in December. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in more than 84% odds that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, up from 50% probability that markets priced a week ago.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency wi"

                "body": "- CPI beats across headline and trimmed mean, both above target\n- Housing and services inflation remain stubbornly high\n- Market pricing slashes cut expectations, hints at hike risk\n- AUD/USD rebound modest but technicals signal upside potential\nSummary\nAustralia\u2019s latest inflation shock has upended the RBA outlook, killing near-term cut hopes and even raising the prospect of a hike. With underlying pressures entrenched and market pricing turning hawkish, AUD/USD may be entering a new phase. Technical signals point to fading bearish momentum, adding to upside risks if global conditions stay supportive.\nUncomfortably Hot\nAustralia\u2019s first full monthly CPI release delivered an uncomfortable reality check for those banking on further RBA rate cuts. Headline inflation accelerated to an annual pace of 3.8%, above the 3.6% expected, while trimmed mean\u2014the measure the RBA places the greatest weight on\u2014jumped to 3.3%, well above the 3.0% forecast. Both readings sit not only above the top of the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target band but are moving further away from it, suggesting the recent downtrend in inflation has likely bottomed.\nSource: ABS\nThat\u2019s significant because the RBA\u2019s inflation mandate is anchored around the 2.5% midpoint, and its policy framework assumes underlying inflation leads headline, not the other way around. Today\u2019s data reinforces that assumption in the worst possible way: underlying pressures are firming, not easing, making it harder to argue for near-term policy relief.\nThe composition adds to the discomfort. Housing inflation, the largest weighting in the CPI basket and highly sensitive to economic conditions, strengthened further. Rents rose 4.2% over the year, up from 3.8% in September, with the increase partly reflecting a smaller offset from Commonwealth Rent Assistance compared to a year ago. Excluding those adjustments, rents would have risen 4.5%, underscoring persistent tightness in rental markets. New dwelling prices also firmed, rising 1.7%. Combined with surging electricity costs, these trends point to housing pressures that are not going away quickly.\nSource: ABS\nBeyond housing, the broader picture is equally troubling. Services prices are running at 3.9%, while non-tradables inflation is even hotter at 4.8%. Both are heavily influenced by domestic factors rather than international ones, and they sit alongside other major categories growing at annual rates above the RBA target range. This mix suggests that price stickiness is not confined to a few sectors but embedded across the economy, making it harder to keep inflation low and stable even with subdued growth.\nOne caveat regarding the data was this was the first time we've seen a monthly release in Australia, which introduces some uncertainty around the signal. Even so, it aligns with the strength seen in the Q3 inflation report, meaning the trend is real. While the RBA will continue to lean on quarterly data for now, this print is hard to ignore. For those hoping for rate cuts, this is a setback\u2014the inflation fight looks far from over.\nRBA Easing Cycle Seen Over\nSource: Bloomberg\nIf the inflation data wasn\u2019t enough to unsettle rate-cut expectations, market pricing certainly drives the point home. Swaps now imply a maximum of 11 basis points of easing by May 2026, with a small risk that the next move in the cash rate could actually be higher six months later. That\u2019s a dramatic hawkish repricing compared to just a few months ago when the cash rate was seen bottoming below 3%. Now, no further easing is favored over another cut.\nThe residual pricing for cuts looks more like insurance than conviction\u2014hedging against an unexpected negative shock, such as unemployment rising far beyond the RBA\u2019s forecasts or a major global downturn. With inflation running hot and underlying pressures entrenched, the only realistic path to near-term cuts would be a sharp deterioration in the labor market or a significant external shock. Absent that, the easing cycle is likely over.\nA"

                "body": "Australian Dollar rises as CPI beats forecasts, RBA policy in focus\n- The Australian Dollar gains as monthly inflation boosts RBA caution.\n- Australia\u2019s CPI rose 3.8% YoY in October, beating the market forecast of 3.6% and accelerating from the previous 3.5% increase.\n- The US Dollar faces challenges as softer data reinforce the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in December.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) advances against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, extending its gains for the fourth successive session. The AUD/USD pair holds ground after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released the first \u201ccomplete\u201d monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI), which climbed by 3.8% year-over-year (YoY) in October. The reading surpassed the market consensus of a 3.6% rise and a 3.5% increase prior.\nThe AUD could gain ground as the first monthly CPI increased the cautious sentiment surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy outlook. The RBA is expected to maintain the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 3.6% in December as inflation remains above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target range. RBA officials noted that the unemployment rate has risen slightly, but the job market remains healthy and is expected to continue doing so.\nMinutes from the RBA\u2019s November meeting indicated the central bank may keep rates unchanged for an extended period. The ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures indicate that as of November 25, the December 2025 contract was trading at 96.41, implying a 6% probability of a rate cut to 3.35% from 3.60% at the upcoming RBA Board meeting.\nUS Dollar struggles as recent data increase Fed rate cut bets\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is holding ground after registering modest losses in the previous session and trading around 99.80 at the time of writing. The Greenback faced challenges amid rising expectations of a Fed rate cut in December, driven by soft US data.\n- The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in a more than 84% chance that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, up from the 50% probability that markets priced a week ago.\n- The US Producer Price Index (PPI) remained steady at 2.7% year-over-year in September, matching expectations and August\u2019s reading and suggesting that inflationary pressures have stabilized. Core PPI eased to 2.6% from 2.9%, undershooting forecasts of 2.7%.\n- The US Retail Sales rose by 0.2% month-over-month (MoM) in September, slowing from the 0.6% increase seen in August, indicating more cautious consumer spending. Separately, the Conference Board reported a sharp deterioration in household sentiment, with Consumer Confidence sliding 6.8 points to 88.7 in November from 95.5 in October.\n- Fed Governor Christopher Waller told Fox Business on Monday that his main concern is the weakening labour market, adding that inflation is \u201cnot a big problem\u201d given the recent softness in employment. He also said the September payrolls figure will likely be revised lower and warned that concentrated hiring is \u201cnot a good sign,\u201d indicating his support for a near-term rate cut.\n- New York Fed President John Williams said on Friday that policymakers could still cut rates in the \u201cnear-term,\u201d a remark that lifted market odds for a December move. Moreover, Fed Governor Stephen Miran said that Nonfarm Payrolls data support a December rate cut, adding that if his vote were decisive, he \u201cwould vote for a 25-bps cut.\u201d\n- The preliminary reading of Australia's S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) came in at 51.6 in November, versus 49.7 prior. Meanwhile, Services PMI rose to 52.7 in November from the previous reading of 52.5, while the Composite PMI increased to 52.6 in November versus 52.1 prior.\n- The Reserve Bank of Australia published the Minutes of its November monetary policy meeting last week, indicating that board members signalled a more balanced policy stanc"

                "body": "Japanese Yen retreats from one-week top against weaker USD; downside seems limited\n- The Japanese Yen struggles to capitalize on modest intraday gains against a weaker USD.\n- The upbeat market mood and fiscal concerns could act as a headwind for the safe-haven JPY.\n- The divergent BoJ-Fed policy expectations should cap any meaningful upside for USD/JPY.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) retreats from a one-week top, touched against a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD) during the Asian session on Wednesday, though the downside seems limited. Despite reports that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is ramping up rate hike messaging, the prospect for further policy tightening in December or January is still finely balanced. Moreover, concerns about Japan's ailing fiscal position on the back of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s pro-stimulus stance, along with the prevalent risk-on environment, turn out to be key factors undermining the safe-haven JPY.\nMeanwhile, data released earlier today underscored the BoJ's view that a tight job market will keep pushing up wages and service-sector inflation. This reinforces expectations for further BoJ policy tightening. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to the growing acceptance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs again in December. The latter drags the USD to a one-week low and should contribute to capping the USD/JPY pair. Traders now look to more delayed US macro data for short-term opportunities later during the North American session.\nJapanese Yen turns lower as fiscal concerns and risk-on mood offset BoJ rate hike bets\n- Reuters reported this Wednesday that the Bank of Japan, over the past week, has intentionally shifted messaging to highlight the inflationary risks of a persistently weak Japanese Yen, suggesting that a December rate hike remains a live option. The change followed a key meeting between Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda last week, which appeared to remove immediate political objections to rate hikes from the new administration.\n- Meanwhile, data from the BoJ showed that the Services Producer Price Index, which tracks the price companies charge each other for services, rose 2.7% in October from a year earlier. This marked a notable slowdown from a revised 3.1% increase recorded in the previous month, though it suggests that Japan was on the cusp of durably meeting its 2% inflation target. This backs the case for further BoJ policy tightening and boosts the JPY during the Asian session.\n- The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, slides to a one-week low in the aftermath of unimpressive US macro data released on Tuesday, which reaffirmed market expectations for another interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in December. Adding to this, Fed Governor Stephen Miran echoed the dovish view and said in a television interview on Tuesday that a deteriorating job market and the economy call for large interest rate cuts to get monetary policy to neutral.\n- The prospect of lower US interest rates boosts investors' appetite for riskier assets amid hopes for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Ukraine is ready to advance a US-backed framework for ending the war with Russia. This might cap the safe-haven JPY as traders look to the delayed release of US Durable Goods Orders, along with the US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims, for a fresh impetus around the USD/JPY pair.\nUSD/JPY could extend intraday recovery above Asian session top, around the 156.35 area\nThe USD/JPY pair now seems to have found acceptance below the 100-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent move up from the monthly low. Moreover, negative oscillators on hourly charts back the case for additional losses. However, technical indicators on the daily chart are holding in positive territory, suggesting that any further slide is more likely to find decent support near the 155.30 region, "

                "body": "USD/JPY traders brace for a crucial mid-week session on Wednesday, November 26, as markets adjust bets on BoJ and Fed monetary policy stances.\nEarly updates from Japan\u2019s annual wage negotiations for 2026 suggest another substantial pay hike, supporting a December BoJ rate hike. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda recently underscored the importance of annual wage negotiations, commonly known as Shunto. He stated that more data would be needed from wage discussions to assess whether US tariffs would force firms to limit wage hikes.\nMeanwhile, US economic data and FOMC members have fueled speculation of a December Fed rate cut, signaling a potential narrowing of US-Japan rate differentials, and favoring the yen. Monetary policy divergence could materially alter USD/JPY\u2019s recently bullish trajectory, placing a greater emphasis on incoming data.\nOn Wednesday, November 26, Japan\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) will provide insights into business and consumer sentiment at the end of the third quarter. Economists expect the LEI to rise from 107.0 in August to 108.0 in September.\nA higher LEI reading could point to increased business investment and higher wages, aligning with updates from wage negotiations. Crucially, higher wages could boost households\u2019 purchasing power, leading to higher spending and rising demand-driven inflation. Furthermore, improving consumer sentiment may also translate into an upswing in private consumption.\nFor context, the LEI dropped to 104.2 in April, its lowest level in two years before edging higher. LEI trends reflected trade developments. These trends suggest a September pickup, given that the US lowered tariffs on Japanese goods to 15% in September. The softer yen could also lift sentiment, given that USD/JPY strength would offset the effect of tariffs on company profit margins.\nWith the BoJ\u2019s focus on wages and inflation, improving sentiment would support a more hawkish BoJ rate path and a stronger yen. Notably, USD/JPY briefly dropped below 156 this week. Traders reacted to updates from Japan\u2019s wage negotiations and softer US economic data.\nAmid rising bets on a December BoJ rate hike, US jobs data could boost bets on a December Fed rate cut, potentially sending USD/JPY sharply lower.\nEconomists forecast initial jobless claims to rise from 220k (week ending November 15) to 227k (week ending November 22). A larger-than-expected increase could bolster bets on a December rate cut, weighing on demand for the US dollar. A potential narrowing in US-Japan interest rate differentials could push USD/JPY toward 155.\nFor context, the ADP reported a 13.5k 4-week average drop in employment, signaling a cooling labor market. A third consecutive decline in the 4-week average sent USD/JPY lower, highlighting the pair\u2019s likely response to higher jobless claims.\nBeyond the data, traders should monitor FOMC members\u2019 speeches. Reaction to US economic data and views on the timeline for cutting rates will influence USD/JPY trends. Growing calls for a December cut could accelerate the pair\u2019s fall toward 150.\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nFor more in-depth analysis, review today\u2019s USD/JPY trading setups in our latest reports and consult the economic calendar.\nWith over 28 years of experience in the financial industry, Bob has worked with various global rating agencies and multinational banks.

When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named"

The currency is still hovering close to a seven-month low despite Wall Street\u2019s upbeat momentum and oil climbing 1.3% to $58.84 a barrel. Recent economic data hasn\u2019t helped: factory sales slid 1.1%, especially in chemicals and wood products, and the economy likely grew just 0.5% last quarter, barely dodging another contraction. Trade talks with the US remain stalled, adding to investor caution. Canadian bond yields keep dropping alongside US ones, suggesting markets are nervous ahead of the GDP update. The loonie\u2019s typical bounce in risk-on markets just isn\u2019t kicking in this time.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Investors are pressing pause on the loonie\u2019s comeback.\nEven with optimism in global markets and hopes for a US rate cut, the Canadian dollar isn\u2019t gaining ground. The familiar playbook of risk-on sentiment and firmer oil usually gives the loonie a lift, but lukewarm Canadian data and ongoing economic questions have investors sitting on the sidelines. They\u2019re watching to see if Canada can avoid recession and if demand for exports and factory goods can pick up again.\nThe bigger picture: Domestic hurdles are muddying the global view.\nCanada\u2019s economic story is being shaped by more than just local trends. Slow factory sales, modest GDP growth, and uncertain trade relations with the US are feeding into a global narrative, especially with both US and Canadian bond yields drifting lower. The loonie\u2019s muted reaction in the face of positive global moves underlines how much local economic struggles and trade uncertainties are now steering broader market expectations and policy thinking into 2025.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nResearch\nReda Farran, CFA \u2022 about 14 hours ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 19 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

If prices continue to soften, it\u2019s likely to limit CAD demand."

                "body": "Tracking Forex pairs: what GBP/JPY can tell us about the global economy\nImage: Supplied\nEven in South Africa, GBP/JPY is a common choice among active traders, largely because of its strong price movements and liquidity. Yes, there are other, perhaps safer options like gold and USD/ZAR, but GBP/JPY stands out for those looking for faster-paced opportunities.\nNot only this, but GBP/JPY can actually inform trading strategies across multiple markets, mainly because of what it tells us about the global economy. So what does it tell us, and how can you use that information to your advantage?\nWhat GBP/JPY Can Tell Us About the Global Economy\nPut simply, GBP/JPY tells us exactly how global investors are feeling about risk at any given moment. Looking at the GBPJPY live price on Exness right now, for instance, you can see whether traders are leaning towards risk-on or risk-off sentiment.\nIf the pair is climbing steadily, it indicates growing confidence in riskier assets \u2013 often reflecting optimism about the UK economy or broader global growth \u2013 and if there\u2019s a sharp decline, that indicates investors are moving into safer havens like the Japanese yen \u2013 often reflecting uncertainty or caution in global markets.\nThe reason this is the case is because of the unique economic roles and investors\u2019 perceptions attached to both currencies in the pair. The British pound is widely considered a risk-sensitive currency: it tends to appreciate when investors feel confident about economic growth or higher interest rates.\nThe Japanese yen, on the other hand, has earned a reputation as a safe-haven currency: it tends to remain stable or even strengthen during periods of global uncertainty or market stress.\nEssentially, when investors are optimistic, they move capital into riskier assets, including the pound, seeking higher returns, which ultimately push GBP/JPY higher. On the other hand, during periods of global uncertainty, investors flock to safety, buying yen and selling pounds, which drives the pair down.\nIn this way, upward movements reflect risk-on sentiment and global confidence, while downward movements signal risk-off and a flight to safety.\nHow to Use This Information Across Markets\nAs we mentioned before, tracking GBP/JPY isn\u2019t just useful for forex traders \u2013 it can provide meaningful insight for your entire portfolio across multiple asset classes.\nThe reason for this is simple: the currency pair acts as a real-time benchmark of global investor sentiment and economic health, and sentiment is a primary driver of asset prices worldwide. By knowing whether investors are risk-on or risk-off, then, you can make your decisions far more informed across equities, commodities, bonds, or any other currencies.\nLet\u2019s say, for instance, you\u2019re applying a 5 minute scalping strategy in crude oil on a platform such as Exness. Even though oil isn\u2019t a currency, its price is going to react strongly to shifts in global risk sentiment. If GBP/JPY is climbing steadily \u2013 signalling a risk-on environment \u2013 it\u2019s going to be easier to anticipate short-term bullish momentum in crude oil as traders move into riskier assets.\nConversely, if GBP/JPY suddenly drops sharply, it could indicate an imminent risk-off move, meaning crude oil prices might experience a rapid decline. By monitoring the forex pair alongside your scalping charts, you effectively gain an early warning system.\nBecause the pair reacts almost instantly to changes in global sentiment \u2013 often before other markets fully price in these shifts \u2013 you can adjust your entries and exits quickly, confirming the strength of trends and avoiding false signals without having to rely solely on price action in the commodity itself.\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s the only indicator. On the contrary, if you\u2019re only relying on GBP/JPY sentiment to make your scalping decisions, you risk being caught off guard by short-term noise or reversals. But if you use it alongside solid technical analysis and the best indicators \u2013 such as mo"

Technical indicators show the broader bullish momentum losing steam, amid growing concerns about a BoJ intervention, yet GBP's bearish attempts remain limited so far.\nYen crosses have found some support this week following comments by the Japanese Finance Minister on Friday, who said that the Japanese authorities were alarmed about the fast Yen depreciation and that they are ready to take \u201cappropriate action in response to excess volatility and disorderly movements\u201d.\noptimize\nThe Bank of Japan tends to launch Yen interventions at moments of low market liquidity to optimize its impact. Bearing that in mind, the market is speculating on the possibility that the thinned Thanksgiving market, later this week, would provide a great opportunity.\nThe Japanese Yen has depreciated 4.5% since early October, when the pro-stimulus cabinet of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi came into power, and more than 10% since April.\nThe Pound, on the other hand, remains weighed by flaws of their own. Investors are wary about the sterling, awaiting the details of the Autumn Budget, which is due to be released on Wednesday. Chancellor Rachel Reaves faces the serious challenge of bringing the growing budget deficit under control without breaking the Labour Party\u2019s pledge to \u201cnot increase taxes on the working people\u201d.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net"

Texas had previously explored strategic Bitcoin legislation last year, wanting to create a Bitcoin reserve without using taxpayer funds.\nIn June of this year, the Texas governor signed the legislation into law, creating a state Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\nInstitutional investors are increasingly following suit. Harvard University\u2019s endowment recently tripled its IBIT holdings to $442.8 million, making it the university\u2019s largest publicly disclosed investment.\nEmory University and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Al Warda Investments have also significantly increased Bitcoin ETF exposure.\nBitcoin\u2019s price is currently trading near $87,500, roughly 30% below its all-time high. Lee Bratcher was the first to disclose this news.\n\u201cTexas will eventual self-custody bitcoin,\u201d Bratcher said, \u201cbut while that RFP process takes place, this initial allocation was made with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF.\nBratcher is the President and Founder of the Texas Blockchain Council, an industry association with over 100 member companies and hundreds of individuals promoting Texas as a hub for Bitcoin and blockchain innovation.\nHe actively championed the state\u2019s Bitcoin reserve legislation, working on the ground to guide it through the state Senate.\nTexas isn\u2019t the only state interested in buying bitcoin\nIn the legislation explored last year, Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione filed a bill to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the state.\nThe legislation proposed that the state buy and hold bitcoin as a strategic asset, store it in cold storage for at least five years, allow resident donations, and enable state agencies to accept and convert cryptocurrencies to bitcoin.\nIt also mandated transparency through yearly audits and reports. Modeled after a federal proposal by President Donald Trump and Senator Lummis, the bill mirrored the growing global interest of bitcoin.\nEarlier this month, New Hampshire became the first government worldwide to approve a $100 million Bitcoin-backed municipal bond. The state\u2019s Business Finance Authority (BFA) authorized the conduit bond, allowing private companies to borrow against over-collateralized Bitcoin held in custody, with repayment risk resting solely on the collateral.\nBorrowers must post roughly 160% of the bond\u2019s value in Bitcoin, and automated liquidation protects bondholders if values drop. Fees and any BTC appreciation will fund the state\u2019s Bitcoin Economic Development Fund.\nThis move follows New Hampshire and Arizona\u2019s earlier creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve."

As of Nov. 24, Bitcoin is down over 30% from its all-time high, which was set less than two months ago in early October.\nAt its high, Bitcoin was more valuable than every U.S. company except for Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. Now, Bitcoin's market cap has fallen to around $1.7 trillion, falling below Broadcom in the rankings.\nHere's why Bitcoin is under pressure, and an exchange-traded fund (ETF) to consider if you're interested in getting exposure to Bitcoin.\nBitcoin has gone mainstream\nOutside of the broader marketwide sell-off in March and April of this year, Bitcoin enjoyed a mostly uninterrupted surge higher from about $40,000 at the start of 2024 to over $126,000 in October 2025. A big catalyst for Bitcoin's rise has been the consistent adoption and widespread acceptance of Bitcoin's role in diversified portfolios among asset managers and retail investors.\nInvestment management firm BlackRock launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT 2.00%) on Jan. 5, 2024, and the timing could not have been better. One hundred percent of the fund's holdings are in Bitcoin -- making it a simple and effective way to invest in the cryptocurrency asset.\nEven after experiencing record outflows last week during Bitcoin's sell-off, the ETF has attracted over $67 billion in net assets. At the time of this writing, the fund holds 776,293.17 Bitcoin. For context, the total circulating supply is 19.95 million. This means that the ETF holds approximately 4% of the total Bitcoin supply -- making it a \"Bitcoin whale\" in its own right.\nThe ETF offers a straightforward and relatively low-cost way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a brokerage account or an individual retirement account, such as a Roth IRA or traditional IRA.\nMore than any other macroeconomic factor, from central bank adoption to the use of Bitcoin as a currency, pivoting Bitcoin from a fringe asset to an investment class has arguably been the single biggest catalyst for its rising price. The recent sell-off over the last six weeks has been the first downturn to occur during Bitcoin's \"establishment\" phase -- specifically, the era of Bitcoin following the FTX implosion, marked by multiple accounts of fraud and the crypto winter from late 2021 to late 2023.\nNASDAQ: IBIT\nKey Data Points\nBuying Bitcoin in your brokerage account\nAfter a more than threefold increase in less than two years, the Bitcoin rally was arguably overextended and poised for a pullback. But the fundamental investment thesis remains stronger than ever. Bitcoin may not be taking off as a means of exchange, but it is thriving as a store of value.\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is one of the best ways for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without needing to open a digital wallet or store their Bitcoin assets on a separate platform such as Coinbase. The ETF can be especially useful for investors taking an ultra-long-term view on Bitcoin and who want to own the asset in a retirement account, which can reduce the taxable gain on Bitcoin sales. A retail account on a platform like Coinbase would face potentially higher tax penalties.\nPerhaps the greatest benefit of investing in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is to maintain a desired Bitcoin allocation. One of the biggest mistakes investors can make is losing sight of their allocation by accidentally taking on too little or too much risk. Keeping Bitcoin in a brokerage account alongside your stock portfolio can provide a better understanding of Bitcoin's role in your financial planning.\nCRYPTO: BTC\nKey Data Points\nA great way to buy Bitcoin as a store of value\nInvestors seeking to incorporate Bitcoin into their investment portfolios can now do so at a significantly lower price.

                "body": "XRP (XRP 2.47%) has a lot of momentum behind it, gaining more than 340% from the Nov. 2024 elections to Nov. 25, 2025. That's more than 15 times the growth Ethereum (ETH +0.34%) investors saw.\nBut past performance doesn't tell us much about the future. The real question is which coin is likely to perform better now. To answer that, we need to understand the economics of both and, critically, which creates more value from network adoption.\nXRP's value proposition\nTraditional banking settlements are secure, but they are slow and expensive. Transactions can take days or even weeks to finalize, and international transfers can involve multiple intermediaries, each collecting a fee.\nRipple, the company behind XRP, created the coin to solve these problems. Its technology enables secure transactions that are faster and much cheaper. Ripple's technology has gained a significant foothold in the industry and is used by major banks around the world.\nCRYPTO: XRP\nKey Data Points\nThis real-world usage is the core of XRP's investment thesis: as more financial institutions want to use the Ripple network to make transfers, demand for XRP for network fees will grow. More banks mean more demand.\nBut there's a critical flaw in this thesis. Banks can use RippleNet -- Ripple's primary product -- without touching the XRP token. Most major banks that use Ripple's technology do exactly that. They can capture most of the efficiency gains while avoiding exposure to a volatile cryptocurrency.\nRipple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), on the other hand, involves at least some direct exposure to XRP. ODL uses XRP as a bridge asset for cross-border payments, eliminating the need for institutions to maintain prefunded foreign currency accounts. That frees up capital and solves real liquidity problems for those who need it.\nBut most major banks don't have meaningful liquidity constraints that would justify exposing themselves, even temporarily, to an asset as volatile as XRP.\nAnd even XRP's place in ODL transactions isn't certain. Ripple recently purchased Rail, a stablecoin payment platform, and is attempting to position itself as a major player in the stablecoin market -- a market that could be worth trillions of dollars. Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD, could supplant XRP as the primary bridge asset in ODL transactions.\nEthereum benefits from stablecoins\nEthereum presents the opposite case. It will likely benefit if stablecoins take off. The coin is the backbone of much of the crypto industry, including most of the leading stablecoins -- the lion's share of USDC, USDT, and DAI transactions happen on its blockchain.\nStablecoin transactions, indeed all transactions, that happen on Ethereum's blockchain require \"gas\" fees to be paid in Ether, the native coin of the network. Ether has to be acquired -- demand pressure -- to pay gas fees, and each time, a portion is burned and removed from circulation forever -- supply pressure.\nAdmittedly, this is complicated by what are known as Layer-2 solutions. These helper chains process transactions in bulk off the main network, reducing Ethereum's gas fees. But the core of the idea still holds.\nCRYPTO: ETH\nKey Data Points\nXRP has a burn mechanism, too, however. Why am I saying it matters for Ethereum but not XRP? Scale. XRP burns a tiny fraction of a token per transaction, far too little to affect supply in any meaningful way. Ethereum burns enough Ether per transaction to actually move the needle.\nThe verdict\nThe economics of the tokens are substantially different, and I believe Ethereum's are superior.\nThat's not to say Ethereum doesn't have problems. Aside from Layer-2 networks reducing gas fees, new Ethereum is introduced to the market to reward the validators that secure the network -- analogous to Bitcoin's miners -- and this counteracts the reduced supply from token burning. While a relative balance has been struck -- total supply has been relatively stable since 2022 -- that could change if usage changes dramatically.\nAltho"

                "body": "Privacy, ZK Everything and Big Announcements: DevConnect 2025 Recap\nEarly at DevConnect, Vitalik Buterin unveiled Kohaku, a new open-source framework that provides developers with modular tools to build privacy-preserving wallets without relying on centralized services. It\u2019s designed to evolve into a broader suite of primitives that may include mixnets for network anonymity and ZK-powered browsers.\nThe Ethereum leader also announced that the Ethereum Foundation is rolling out Tor and onion hidden services across the ecosystem wherever possible, giving nodes, clients, and users stronger protection from surveillance and metadata leaks, while reducing the network\u2019s dependence on centralized infrastructure.\nThese are signs of where DeFi and Ethereum are headed next. Let\u2019s dive into what DevConnect Buenos Aires 2025 meant for the industry.\nA Mature Ecosystem: 10 Years of Ethereum\nIn July, Ethereum made it to 10 years live on mainnet without ever going down. That maturing process was also seen in other technologies being widely adopted: Zero-knowledge proofs, which have carved their way into the Ethereum ethos and are now set to be the foundation for the next decade of development.Several threads merged into the same bigger picture:\n- ZK tooling is now accessible to developers who are not cryptographers.\n- Boundless is using ZK proofs to design a consensus client for ZCash that enables permissionless transfers to and from Ethereum with no new security assumptions.\n- Privacy is seen as returning to crypto\u2019s \u201croots\u201d after years of being deprioritized.\n- Kohaku, Lean Ethereum, and Tor integration show the Ethereum Foundation is treating privacy and security as key infrastructure.\nSecurity Beyond Smart Contracts\nSmart contract audits are no longer enough when it comes to DeFi security: it\u2019s now about securing the entire stack.\nHere are some of the key takeaways throughout the two days of the DeFi Security Summit:\n- Security is design, testing, monitoring, and threat modeling, not just an audit checkpoint.\n- The Balancer exploit demonstrated how \u201cminor\u201d assumptions like rounding can evolve into major attack vectors.\n- Attack surfaces now include chain splits, DoS vectors, memory corruption, and leader election failures.\n- AI-powered auditing is already catching logical bugs that humans miss, but validation remains the expensive part.\n- Code and smart contracts are cheaper to write thanks to AI, but reviewing them is the new bottleneck.\n\u201cDo users care about security?\u201d was one of the big questions asked. The consensus was that they may not think consciously about it, but care immediately when funds are at risk.\nL1, L2, and the Move Toward a More Robust Ecosystem\nEven though the narratives came from different rooms, they converged on one concern: Ethereum needs to stay resilient and fast enough to remain the ecosystem\u2019s center of gravity.\nHere are some recurring themes about scalability:\n- Ethereum should rely more on L1 for durability and less on centralized external services.\n- Gas limit increases are on the table, potentially scaling by up to 100x over the coming years.\n- L2s must be able to react to incidents quickly, while L1 remains \u201cthe Wild West\u201d by design.\n- The only viable way to scale to millions of transactions is a healthy L2 ecosystem.\n- Founders are pushing for improved interoperability and clearer alignment around a rollup-centric roadmap.\nVitalik emphasized that Ethereum is stabilizing as it matures. Ossification is gradual, but it will eventually happen. The protocol will harden over time, without blocking improvements.\nAdoption in LATAM Shows What \u201cInvisible Crypto\u201d Looks Like\nLatin America, especially Argentina, is showing the world what real adoption looks like. As counterintuitive as it may sound, crypto is becoming more relevant as it becomes less visible. Crypto solutions are now so embedded that many users interact with them without ever realizing it.\nCommon ground across the panels at DeFi Day del Sur:\n- In Argenti"

                "body": "XRP Defies Institutional Crisis, Achieves Significant Gains as\nBTC\n&\nETH\nPlunge\nAmidst the recent upheaval in the crypto market,\nBitcoin\nand\nEthereum\nETFs saw over $1 billion withdrawn in just one day. In contrast,\nXRP\nmoved against the prevailing trend, rallying as the broader market declined. While BTC and ETH reached their lowest points of the year, XRP investment products experienced notable inflows, with the token climbing back above the key $2.00 mark. This divergence signals a shift in how institutions are allocating capital and highlights the increasing appeal of XRP\u2019s expanding use cases beyond conventional payments.\nBitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have been major drivers of market activity in 2025,\nexperienced unprecedented outflows\n. Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered $903 million in net outflows on Nov. 20\u2014their second-highest on record\u2014while Ethereum ETFs lost $261 million, continuing a week-long decline.\nBlackRock's IBIT\n, the leading BTC ETF, suffered its weakest month since inception, with over $2.1 billion pulled out in November. These redemptions reflect growing caution among institutional players as crypto prices fall, with BTC dropping below $82,000 and ETH falling under $2,800.\nDespite the negative sentiment, XRP has become a surprising outperformer. Newly introduced XRP ETFs, such as Canary Capital\u2019s\nXRPC\nand Bitwise\u2019s\nXRP ETF\n,\nattracted significant capital\n, with the latter reaching $22 million in trading volume within hours of its NYSE launch.\nXRP's price\n, which had remained below $2.00 for much of November, bounced back to $2.24, fueled by ETF inflows and increased institutional interest. This strength stands in stark contrast to BTC and ETH,\nwhich together have lost over $1.6 billion\nfrom their ETFs this month.\nRipple, the organization behind XRP, is also looking to expand the token\u2019s functionality to capture more of the DeFi sector. Company leaders have suggested adding native staking to the XRP Ledger (XRPL),\na step that could motivate validators\nand enhance network security.\nJ. Ayo Akinyele\n, head of engineering at RippleX, noted that staking could help address current XRPL shortcomings by providing incentives for network security, a benefit not present in its fee-burning system. Although there is no set timeline, the proposal is part of a larger push to update XRPL\u2019s consensus protocol and make it more attractive to DeFi initiatives.\nThe prospect of staking has already energized the XRP community. Third-party services like Uphold and Binance now offer staking-like returns,\nenabling users to earn yields\non their XRP even without native XRPL support. At the same time,\nDeFi projects such as Doppler Finance\nand Flare Network are piloting liquid staking tokens to bring XRP into decentralized finance, broadening its applications. These advancements put XRP in a position to rival\nSolana\nand Ethereum in the DeFi arena,\nwhere token-based incentives\nand governance rewards are becoming the norm.\nFrom a technical perspective, XRP\u2019s latest price movements point to a possible breakout. After slipping below $2.00 for four days, the token has reclaimed important support levels,\nwith the Relative Strength Index\n(RSI) approaching oversold conditions. Open interest in XRP futures has\nclimbed to $3.6 billion\n, suggesting traders are regaining confidence. Still, bearish sentiment persists, as the MACD indicator continues to show a selling trend, and a fall below $2.00 could trigger renewed declines.\nAnalysts warn\nthat while ETF inflows offer short-term optimism, XRP\u2019s long-term outlook will hinge on broader economic trends and sustained institutional participation.\nThe surge in XRP ETFs also marks a strategic shift for Ripple.\nWith the first U.S. spot XRP ETFs\nnow available, Ripple aims to attract pension funds and financial advisors who have traditionally preferred BTC and ETH. This transition could accelerate as the SEC adopts a more favorable regulatory approach, especially following Ripple\u2019s recent court successes. N"

These include progress in decentralized finance (DeFi), the integration of AI for risk management, and the ongoing transformation of cryptocurrency markets, all pointing to wider changes in capital flows and regulatory priorities.\nDeFi platforms are gearing up for significant expansion, with\nDeFi Development Corp. revealing intentions\nto secure $1 billion through a shelf registration to purchase additional\nSolana\n(SOL) tokens. This initiative reflects strong faith in Solana\u2019s blockchain, which has attracted consistent ETF investments and growing institutional interest. The firm has also submitted paperwork to register 1.24 million shares for its early backers, such as Pantera Capital and Payward, the parent company of Kraken,\naccording to CoinDesk\n. At the same time, regulatory certainty remains essential. Michael Selig, the CFTC chair nominee, stressed the importance of having a regulatory authority actively monitoring digital asset markets during his Senate hearing,\narguing against a \"regulation-by-enforcement\" strategy\nthat might drive companies overseas. Selig\u2019s nomination could pave the way for a more balanced regulatory environment, potentially enhancing DeFi\u2019s credibility.\nArtificial intelligence is becoming a key tool in detecting financial crimes, with Quantifind\nearning a leading position\nin the Chartis RiskTech100 2026 list. Quantifind\u2019s AI-driven platform surpassed established competitors like ComplyAdvantage and Silent Eight, standing out for its accuracy, scalability, and real-time risk analysis. Vibhor Rastogi, Citi Ventures\u2019 Head of AI Investments, commented that Quantifind\u2019s solution \u201ctransforms how organizations tackle the evolving landscape of financial crime,\u201d\nan essential advantage as global markets face increasing fraud\n. This technological leap matches the rising interest among institutions in AI-powered tools, especially in crypto and international payments.\nSolana\u2019s price movement continues to draw attention, with the token trading below $130 amid overall market turbulence. Despite negative signals\u2014such as falling futures open interest and prices under the EMA\u2014\ninstitutional ETF investments have brought in $510 million\nin net inflows so far this year. Experts believe that ongoing ETF activity could help steady Solana\u2019s near-term prospects, though technical measures like the RSI and MACD suggest a period of consolidation may persist. Meanwhile, DeFi Development\u2019s Solana-centric treasury approach could provide additional liquidity,\npotentially strengthening Solana\u2019s position as a core DeFi asset\n.\nThe dynamic between regulatory measures and market innovation is set to intensify in 2026. Selig\u2019s support for a \u201cbipartisan approach\u201d at the CFTC, together with Quantifind\u2019s AI-based compliance offerings,\nsignals a move toward more proactive oversight\n. For DeFi, this could translate into clearer rules for on-chain activities and reduced risks from unregulated intermediaries.\n---"

That represents about $3 billion in reduced issuance at current prices.\nDeFi Development Corp stated that the proposal's timing makes sense given growing ecosystem concerns about Solana's current inflation schedule and its impact on Solana price. Other major digital asset treasuries like Forward Industries and Solana Company have not yet commented on the topic.\nDevelopers argued the existing inflation curve no longer reflects network maturity, pointing to network revenue, user activity, and DeFi throughput as evidence. Trimming issuance could reduce structural sell pressure and align Solana more closely with institutional investor expectations for modern crypto assets.\nSolana fell from $197 on Oct. 26 to $136 at the time of writing, representing a 30% decline over the past month. The sharp downturn added urgency to the inflation debate as corporate holders face mounting pressure.\nForward Industries, the largest corporate Solana holder, faces an unrealized loss of approximately $646.6 million, marking a 41% decline from its aggregate purchase price. Upexi, the fifth-largest corporate holder, sits on about $31 million in unrealized losses, down 10% from entry prices.\nDeFi Development Corp remains profitable on its Solana purchases with approximately $62 million in unrealized gains, reflecting a 26.6% return to date. Solana Strategic Reserve data confirmed the company's holdings and position among top corporate investors.\nThe proposal would bring Solana to its long-term inflation target years ahead of schedule, potentially reshaping supply dynamics for one of the largest blockchain networks by market capitalization."

With the launch of PT-USX, issued by Exponent Finance, Kamino intends to boost the fixed-income network of Solana. As mentioned in Kamino\u2019s social media announcement, the initiative enhances structured income options within the Solana ecosystem. Hence, the move makes Kamino, Exponent Finance, and Solstice the leading players contributing to the stablecoin-driven fixed income in the wider DeFi sector.\nKamino Unveils Exponent Finance-Issued PT-USX on Solstice Market\nKamino\u2019s launch of PT-USX on Solstice Market denotes a key effort to widen the stablecoin-based fixed-income platform of Solana. Thus, the Exponent Finance-issued PT-USX has become the new fixed-income asset that has now joined PT-eUSX, which accounts for over $13M in its total value locked (TVL). This partnership among Kamino, Solstice, and Exponent Finance is getting significant attention among the most effective stablecoin-based income layers within the Solana ecosystem.\nIn addition to this, while PT-USX is maturing on the 9th of February, it provides a nearer-term fixed remit, presently yielding nearly 16.5% APY. So, consumers can borrow $USDC or $USX against the position while having an eighty percent loan-to-value ratio. This enables up to five-times leveraged looping plans to enhance fixed-yield exposure.\nThe issuer of PT-USX, Exponent Finance, is a protocol that has been audited several times by Certora, Offside Labs to ensure transparency and high security. It transforms yield-bearing assets such as $USX into significantly structured income products to split variable and fixed components into Yield Tokens (YTs) and Principal Tokens (PT). PTs have the purpose of locking in fixed yield till its maturity, whereas YTs keep track of variable returns, letting traders speculate on yield conditions in the future. Kamino users can leverage PT-USX as a collateral-ready, predictable instrument with a steady return profile.\nCollaboration Underscores Major Move to Advance Scalable Fixed Income On-Chain\nAccording to Kamino, the integration boosts Kamino\u2019s status among the top next-gen venues providing organized income strategies within the Solana ecosystem. A crucial factor of the respective expansion is the in-house PT oracle mechanism of Kamino to deliver manipulation-resistant and robust pricing. Overall, Kamino, Solstice Market, and Exonent Finance\u2019s collaboration highlights a huge move to scale foreseeable on-chain income."

This works out to a consensus Strong Buy rating.\nAbercrombie, Kohl's surge roughly 40% apiece after earnings\nWhile several tech stocks struggled on Tuesday, a number of retailers had really good days. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), for one, jumped 37.5% after the specialty apparel retailer reported higher-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results as solid growth in its Hollister segment offset weakness in its namesake brand.\nFor its fourth quarter, Abercrombie expects revenue growth of 5% at the midpoint \u2013 below analysts' estimates \u2013 on inline earnings of $3.55 per share. For the full fiscal year, the retailer is calling for revenue growth of 6.5% at the midpoint, slightly higher than the 6.2% Wall Street expects.\nKohl's (KSS) was another big post-earnings winner, climbing 42.5% after the department store chain disclosed fiscal third-quarter earnings of 10 cents per share \u2013 beating analysts' estimates for a per-share loss of 20 cents. Revenue also came in higher than anticipated.\n\"While these results are encouraging, we continue to operate in an environment where our customers are becoming increasingly choiceful as their discretionary income remains pressured,\" said Michael Bender, who on Monday was named CEO of the retailer after serving in the role on an interim basis for the past six months.\nThis is especially true among low to middle-income consumers and younger customers, Bender added, noting that he expects this consumer behavior \"to continue into the fourth quarter as we believe the macroeconomic environment will remain uncertain.\"\nRate-cut hopes rise after September retail sales data\nIn economic news, the Census Bureau said retail sales edged up 0.2% from August to September, missing economists' forecasts for a 0.3% rise and signaling a sharp deceleration from July and August.\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said its Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures what businesses are paying suppliers for goods and services, rose 0.3% month over month in Sept"

                "body": "Wall Street experienced a mixed but ultimately positive trading session on Tuesday morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging more than 250 points as investors digested a wave of corporate earnings and economic data.\nThe blue-chip index climbed 0.61% to reach 46,729.44 in early trading, while the broader S&P 500 edged up a modest 0.08% to 6,710.34. The technology-heavy NASDAQ told a different story, slipping 0.28% to 22,808.72 as investors rotated out of some tech holdings and into other sectors.\nAlibaba delivers impressive performance\nThe standout performer driving market sentiment came from across the Pacific, where Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding reported quarterly results that exceeded what Wall Street analysts had anticipated. The company posted revenue of $34.81 billion for the quarter, representing a 5% increase compared to the same period last year.\nThat figure surpassed analyst expectations of $34.43 billion, demonstrating that Alibaba continues finding ways to grow despite operating in an increasingly competitive and regulated environment. Perhaps even more impressive, the company\u2019s adjusted earnings came in at 61 cents per American Depositary Share, significantly topping the consensus estimate of 49 cents.\nThe strong results from one of the world\u2019s largest online retailers helped fuel optimism about global consumer spending patterns and the resilience of major technology platforms, even as economic conditions remain uncertain in various regions.\nCommunication services lead sector performance\nLooking across different corners of the market, communication services emerged as Tuesday\u2019s clear winner, with stocks in that category jumping 1.4%. This sector includes major telecommunications companies, media businesses and internet platforms that have become increasingly central to how people work and communicate.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, information technology stocks stumbled, falling 1.1% as investors appeared to take profits after the sector\u2019s strong run in recent months. The rotation away from pure technology plays into communication services and other categories suggested traders were repositioning their portfolios rather than abandoning stocks altogether.\nDramatic movements in smaller companies\nWhile the major indexes showed relatively modest changes, several smaller companies experienced extraordinary volatility that illustrated both the opportunities and risks present in today\u2019s market. Three companies posted particularly impressive gains that caught the attention of traders.\n- Clean Energy Technologies saw its shares surge 75% to $1.87 after announcing it had secured a $10 million battery energy storage project in New York. The contract represented a significant win for the company as demand for renewable energy infrastructure continues expanding across the country.\n- Rubico shares shot up 67% to $0.26 following news that the company had extended its tanker charters. The development suggested continued demand for the company\u2019s shipping services in an industry that has faced considerable uncertainty in recent years.\n- Barnes & Noble Education climbed 37% to $9.18 after releasing preliminary financial results for both full-year fiscal 2025 and year-to-date fiscal 2026. The unaudited figures apparently impressed investors who had been concerned about the company\u2019s trajectory in an education market undergoing significant transformation.\nSharp declines hit other stocks\nThe same volatility that propelled some companies higher sent others tumbling dramatically. MingZhu Logistics Holdings suffered the steepest decline, plummeting 84% to $0.17 after announcing an $8 million registered direct offering that would dilute existing shareholders.\nGreenPower Motor Company fell 34% to $0.85, while K Wave Media dropped 24% to $0.68. These movements highlighted how quickly sentiment can shift for smaller companies, particularly those still working to establish consistent profitability and stable "

Currency traders are betting against the pound in the run-up to the Budget where Rachel Reeves is expected to lay the ground for interest rate cuts.\nThe scale of bets on so-called put options, which are used to speculate or hedge against a fall in sterling, have far outstripped wagers on the pound rising, according to CME Group.\nPuts outweighed so-called call options, used to bet on the pound rising, by four to one over the last week, the data showed. It was first reported by the Financial Times.\nMatthew Ryan, an analyst at payments firm Ebury, warned investors to \u201cbrace for volatility in sterling this week\u201d.\nThe Chancellor will try to reassure bond vigilantes that her Budget can put the public finances on a steadier footing.\nEarlier this month, Ms Reeves told a press conference in Downing Street that she would \u201cdo what is necessary to protect families from high inflation and interest rates\u201d.\nLower inflation and rates would be expected to send the pound lower in the short term. Here is what you need to know.\n5 things to start your day\n1.

Asda suffers debt downgrade as turnaround falters | Supermarket\u2019s profits are predicted to fall more than expected as it ploughs more money into price cuts\nWhat happened overnight\nAsian shares mostly gained on Tuesday after US stocks rallied on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon.\nTokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 was nearly unchanged at 48,628.85, after reopening from a holiday.\nA plunge in technology giant SoftBank\u2019s shares weighed on the market. It fell 10.3pc on concerns that returns from its heavy investments in OpenAI may be threatened by the next generation Gemini artificial intelligence model that Google launched last week.\nIn South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.3pc to 3,859.12. Taiwan\u2019s Taiex jumped 1.5pc.\nChinese markets also advanced. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng climbed 0.4pc to 25,821.47, while the Shanghai Composite index jumped 0.9pc to 3,872.45.\nE-commerce giant Alibaba, which was due to report its earnings late Tuesday, gained 1.6pc.\nAustralia\u2019s S&P/ASX rebounded to edge 0.1pc higher, closing at 8,537.00.\nUS stocks surged on renewed hope for an artificial intelligence revolution and mounting expectations for a December interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\nThe US benchmark S&P 500 rose by 1.55pc, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged by 2.69pc and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.44pc.\nTech stocks performed particularly strongly, with shares in Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, surging by 7.1pc to an all-time record high of $317.69. Google last week announced an upgraded version of its AI model, Gemini 3, which has helped to reverse investor fears that the company was losing its edge on AI to OpenAI.\nYields on 10-year US Treasuries declined by two basis points to 4.05pc, while yields on 10-year British gilts dipped by one basis point to 4.54pc."

                "body": "DAX, USD/JPY Forecast: Two trades to watch\nDAX treads water ahead of US data & as the German economy stagnates\n- German GDP was 0% QoQ\n- Fed rate cut expectations are in focus\n- DAX struggles below the 200 SMA\nThe German DAX is trading cautiously following modest gains yesterday, supported by expectations of a December Fed rate cut.\nRecent dovish commentary by Fed officials, including Governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, has lifted rate cut expectations for next month to over 80% from below 30% last week.\nMeanwhile, investors continue to monitor the progress of ongoing talks surrounding a peace plan for Ukraine. While Trump's original piece agreement for the two countries was more favourable to Russia, this has since changed, raising the likelihood that Russia won't agree to it, pushing peace further into the distance. Aerospace and defence stocks are rebounding as the prospect of peace in Ukraine fades.\nOn the data front, German GDP stagnated with just 0% growth in Q3, in line with expectations and up from a -0.3% contraction in Q2. On an annual basis, the economy grew by 0.3%.\nWeak exports have weighed on the economy in the July to September. The data comes after German IFO business sentiment figures yesterday unexpectedly fell as firms doubted the likelihood of a recovery. The country appears to be in an ongoing state of paralysis with tariffs, political uncertainty, and the stronger EUR hurting the economy.\nLooking ahead, attention will turn to a US data drop, which could impact sentiment. US retail sales, consumer confidence, pending home sales, and durable goods orders are due in the US session.\nDAX forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nDAX faced rejection at 24,500, falling below the rising trendline and the 200 SMA to support at 22,920 before recovering higher. The RSI remains below 50.\nShould buyers extend the recovery above 23,400 and the 200 SMA at 23,500, this would negate the near-term selloff and bring 24000 into focus.\nSellers would need to take out the support zone at 22920 to create a lower low and head towards 22100, the mid-February low.\nUSD/JPY slips on yen intervention worries and ahead of US data\n- USD falls modestly as December Fed rate cut expectations rise\n- JPY gains on intervention worries\n- USD/JPY eases back from an almost 10-month high\nUSD/JPY is falling, although it remains close to its almost 10-month high reached at the end of last week.\nThe US dollar is only down modestly as investors weigh the chances of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next month following dovish comments from policymakers.\nFed governor Christopher Waller said that the labour market is soft enough to warrant another rate cut in December, and any other action beyond that depends on upcoming data delayed by the government shutdown. His comments follow New York Fed President John Williams, who on Friday adopted a more dovish tone, shifting rate-cut expectations from 30% to over 80%.\nThe market has been very focused on Fed speakers; however, this focus may weaken slightly as U.S. data starts to flow through again. U.S. retail sales, pending home sales, consumer confidence, and durable goods orders are all due today, and could provide insight into how the U.S. Economy is holding up.\nMeanwhile, the yen is strengthening modestly as traders remain on high alert for government intervention. Japanese currency has weakened sharply since fiscal dove Takaichi took over as Japan's Prime Minister. Japanese bond yields have risen, hitting record highs at longer maturities, highlighting concerns over Japan's fiscal outlook.\nTraders have \u00a5158 to \u00a5162 per dollar as a range where Japanese officials may step in, though a move may not be highly effective. It could slow the USD/JPY ascent rather than push it off course.\nUSD/JPY forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nAfter breaking out of the rising channel, USD/JPY ran into resistance at 157.90, a nearly 10-month high. The price has since eased lower, bringing the RSI out"

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shook off an early slide to trade around 0.7% higher, after Monday\u2019s session delivered a strong start to the holiday-shortened trading week.\nStocks have built on the momentum that saw the Nasdaq surge in its best day since May, as tech megacaps snapped back from a bruising stretch while the major US indexes try to recover some of their losses this month. Alphabet continued its torrid streak, while Apple ticked higher to close at its latest high.\nOn the other hand, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) came under pressure after The Information reported that Meta (META) is in talks to spend billions on Google's AI chips. The Alphabet-owned company's challenge to Nvidia's dominance helped push the chip heavyweight's stock down more than 3% while Alphabet shares posted another record high. The tech giant inched closer to a $4 trillion market cap on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, investors continued to keep close watch on the Fed. Markets are now pricing in a more than 80% probability of a quarter-point interest rate cut in December. Bets on a cut jumped after Fed governor Chris Waller added fuel to the fire, joining a chorus of policymakers advocating an easing in rates.\nShutdown-delayed economic data provided glimpses into consumer spending and price pressures. US retail sales rose in September, though the jump was less than forecast. Meanwhile, a look at wholesale inflation from the same month showed producer prices rising 0.3% month over month, matching expectations but representing a bump from a surprise decline in August.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.7%, climbing out of green territory earlier in the session. Even the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index rose more than 2.2%.\nFed officials have been hinting at a December rate cut, while the softening of ADP labor data released on Tuesday and disappointing retail sales supported the thesis that the central bank could opt to loosen monetary policy at its meeting next month.\nHopes of a Fed rate cut sent stocks higher on Tuesday, with the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index outperforming the major averages.\nThe index has rebounded in recent sessions following a volatile November. Lower interest rates are especially important for small companies with existing debt that need to be refinanced.\nStrategists point to soft labor market data and disappointing retail sales as factors that may help convince the Federal Reserve to cut rates in December.\nThe Russell 2000 is up more than 10% year to date, compared to a 14% rise for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and an 18% jump for the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) during the same period.\nInes Ferr\u00e9\nStocks move to session highs as report says Hassett emerges as likely Fed chair frontrunner pick\nStocks moved to session highs on Tuesday after a Bloomberg report indicated that White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is seen as the likely frontrunner to be selected by President Trump to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends next year.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial "

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shook off an early slide to trade around 0.7% higher, after Monday\u2019s session delivered a strong start to the holiday-shortened trading week.\nStocks have built on the momentum that saw the Nasdaq surge in its best day since May, as tech megacaps snapped back from a bruising stretch while the major US indexes try to recover some of their losses this month. Alphabet continued its torrid streak, while Apple ticked higher to close at its latest high.\nOn the other hand, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) came under pressure after The Information reported that Meta (META) is in talks to spend billions on Google's AI chips. The Alphabet-owned company's challenge to Nvidia's dominance helped push the chip heavyweight's stock down more than 3% while Alphabet shares posted another record high. The tech giant inched closer to a $4 trillion market cap on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, investors continued to keep close watch on the Fed. Markets are now pricing in a more than 80% probability of a quarter-point interest rate cut in December. Bets on a cut jumped after Fed governor Chris Waller added fuel to the fire, joining a chorus of policymakers advocating an easing in rates.\nShutdown-delayed economic data provided glimpses into consumer spending and price pressures. US retail sales rose in September, though the jump was less than forecast. Meanwhile, a look at wholesale inflation from the same month showed producer prices rising 0.3% month over month, matching expectations but representing a bump from a surprise decline in August. Year-over-year PPI also rose to 2.7%.\nOn the earnings front, retailers Kohl's (KSS) and Best Buy (BBY) posted better than expected results on Tuesday.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.7%, climbing out of green territory earlier in the session. Even the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index rose more than 2.2%.\nFed officials have been hinting at a December rate cut, while the softening of ADP labor data released on Tuesday and disappointing retail sales supported the thesis that the central bank could opt to loosen monetary policy at its meeting next month.\nHopes of a Fed rate cut sent stocks higher on Tuesday, with the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index outperforming the major averages.\nThe index has rebounded in recent sessions following a volatile November. Lower interest rates are especially important for small companies with existing debt that need to be refinanced.\nStrategists point to soft labor market data and disappointing retail sales as factors that may help convince the Federal Reserve to cut rates in December.\nThe Russell 2000 is up more than 10% year to date, compared to a 14% rise for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and an 18% jump for the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) during the same period.\nInes Ferr\u00e9\nStocks move to session highs as report says Hassett emerges as likely Fed chair frontrunner pick\nStocks moved to session highs on Tuesday after a Bloomberg report indicated that White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is seen as the likely frontrunner to be selected by President Trump to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends next year.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial "

Hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut soared after softer economic data hinted the job market and inflation are cooling, fueling dovish signals from policymakers. According to CME Group, futures now price in an 85% chance of a December rate cut, up sharply from last week. Meanwhile, S&P 500 companies delivered standout third-quarter results: 83% topped profit forecasts, with earnings growth clocking in at nearly 15%. Even so, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still on track for monthly declines, despite Deutsche Bank\u2019s upbeat 2026 outlook.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Tech optimism faces valuation questions.\nTech and artificial intelligence stocks are fueling market gains, but lofty valuations keep some investors cautious \u2013 especially as both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 look set for monthly losses, even after Nvidia\u2019s strong forecast. Deutsche Bank\u2019s bullish S&P 500 target for 2026 has set a positive tone, yet investors will be watching for signs of overstretched prices. Meanwhile, upbeat drug trial results at Bristol Myers and policy moves benefiting healthcare firms like Centene and Oscar Health are making healthcare a sector to watch.\nThe bigger picture: Rate cut hopes could boost spending.\nA potential Fed rate cut may lower borrowing costs and spur more investment, but upcoming retail data will offer key clues about consumer strength. The National Retail Federation expects holiday spending to top $1 trillion, putting this week\u2019s Black Friday sales and upcoming Best Buy results in the spotlight for market sentiment. Strong corporate earnings offer some cushion for the market, but lasting momentum will depend on both Fed decisions and real-world consumer spending.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nResearch\nReda Farran, CFA \u2022 about 14 hours ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 19 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

Aupperle and Campbell Soup Company are all named defendants in the case.\nGarza alleges that in November 2024, he met with Bally to discuss his salary. During the meeting, Bally allegedly went on an hour-and-15-minute long rant about Campbell Soup Company and its customers. Garza, who recorded the expletive-laden rant, also claims that Bally made racist comments and allegedly admitted to using drugs at work. (It is legal in Michigan for one person who is party to a conversation to record another person without their consent, per Detroit Free Press, citing attorney Symantha Heath.)\nGarza alleged in the suit that Bally said the company makes \u201chighly processed food\u201d for \u201cpoor people,\u201d according to WDIV.\n\u201cWe have s--- for f------ poor people.

                "body": "The Japanese government-established company Rapidus, which aims to revive the semiconductor industry, plans to begin construction of its second factory in Chitose, Hokkaido, in 2027. Amid accelerating competition in advanced semiconductor miniaturization processes led by Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics, and U.S.-government-backed Intel, Japan is also stepping up efforts to secure competitiveness in sub-2-nanometer (1 nanometer is one-billionth of a meter) advanced semiconductors, intensifying the global race for cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\nThe Nikkei reported on the 26th that Rapidus is working to mass-produce its cutting-edge 2-nanometer semiconductor products by 2027 at its Chitose, Hokkaido factory. Rapidus, a company formed by the merger of eight entities including Toyota, Kioxia, Sony, NTT, SoftBank, NEC, Denso, and Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, aims to revive Japan\u2019s semiconductor industry. Rapidus announced in July that it had successfully produced a 2-nanometer prototype and is now expanding production facilities to begin full-scale mass production. The company plans to produce 2-nanometer semiconductors by 2027 and cutting-edge 1.4-nanometer semiconductors by 2029. The Nikkei stated, \u201cThe plan is to construct the second factory before the 2-nanometer mass production technology at the first factory matures,\u201d adding, \u201cThe new factory will consider producing 1.4-nanometer semiconductors and others.\u201d\nRapidus plans to invest over 3 trillion yen (28.2 trillion Korean won) by 2031 in the development and mass production of 1.4-nanometer and 1-nanometer semiconductors. Total investments will exceed 7 trillion yen. Cumulative funding support from the Japanese government to Rapidus has reached 2.9 trillion yen. The company plans to pursue a stock market listing in 2031.\nWith Rapidus joining the fray, the competition for sub-2-nanometer advanced semiconductors has taken on the character of a national showdown. The U.S. currently holds a 10% stake in Intel and is supporting the company\u2019s sub-2-nanometer 18A foundry business. President Donald Trump has gone so far as to say, \u201cCreating the most advanced semiconductors and integrated circuits, which is what Intel does, is the foundation of our country\u2019s future.\u201d Notably, the U.S. is leading global semiconductor companies in domestic production to build its own semiconductor ecosystem. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC is constructing three advanced semiconductor factories in Arizona, U.S., with an investment of $65 billion, while South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics is also building a sub-2-nanometer advanced foundry factory in Taylor, Texas, U.S.\nTaiwan is also actively supporting TSMC. In 2023, Taiwan passed the \u2018Taiwan Semiconductor Act\u2019 through cross-party agreement to support advanced technologies including semiconductors, offering tax credits of 25% for research and development costs and 5% for facility investments in strategic industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles. Recently, TSMC announced plans to add three more 2-nanometer factories to the Southern Science Park being developed by Tainan City. China, too, is generously providing tax credits and financial support to its domestic semiconductor companies like SMIC.\nIn contrast, South Korea remains hesitant in directly supporting the semiconductor industry due to perceptions of favoring large corporations. It was recently reported that the National Assembly has tentatively agreed not to include the semiconductor industry\u2019s demand for an exception to the 52-hour workweek in the special semiconductor law it is processing."
