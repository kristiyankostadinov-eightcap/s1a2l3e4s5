                "body": "Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok has found a head-scratcher buried in the financial data: For years, the price of gold and real interest rates have been inversely correlated; as interest rates rise, the price of gold goes down. Now, however, the relationship between the two variables is completely scrambled with no discernable pattern, and Slok sees it as yet another sign investors are getting jittery about the state of the economy.\n\u201cMuch to the frustration of the quant community, when the Fed started raising interest rates in 2022, the strong correlation between gold and real rates broke down,\u201d Slok wrote in a blog post on Monday.\nGold has cemented itself as a safe-haven asset, viewed as a life preserver in a time of choppy market waters. Since the initial rate hike in 2022, the price of gold has skyrocketed, increasing by more than 150% to hit a record-breaking $5,000 per troy ounce last month. Investors like Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio have advocated for 15% of one\u2019s portfolio to be allocated toward gold amid crescendoing geopolitical tensions and mounting U.S. debt. But gold\u2019s now unpredictable relationship with a once-reliable correlate is yet another sign investors are bracing themselves in case things go sideways.\n\u201cIt tells you that investors are anxious about the level of returns they get in traditional assets,\u201d Slok told Fortune. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why investors are beginning to look at alternative assets.\u201d\nCiting data from Bloomberg and Macrobond, Slok notes that prior to early 2022 when the Fed began hiking rates to curb post-pandemic inflation that peaked around 9%, the price of gold and interest rates were inversely correlated. But after the Fed\u2019s 2022 hikes, this was no longer the case. Instead of gold prices falling, which would follow the pattern of previous rate hikes, they instead remained resilient. As the Fed held rates steady, gold prices continued to climb.\nAccording to Slok, this broken-down relationship signals to the market that in times of elevated interest rates, investors have additional considerations when pricing future outcomes\u2014particularly for gold\u2014in part a result of inflation remaining stubbornly elevated since early 2021.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that new risks emerge when inflation is persistently above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, which is where we continue to be today,\u201d Slok said in his blog post.\nWhat caused the breakdown in the gold\u2013interest rate relationship?\nGold is a unique asset, wrote Goldman Sachs analysts Lina Thomas and Daan Struyven in an August 2025 Gold Market Primer report. It is hard to mine, and its supply grows only a little each year, with nearly all of the gold ever extracted from the earth still in supply, trading hands, as opposed to being produced or destroyed, giving it its precious value.\n\u201cEach year, more rock, more energy, more labor, and more capital are needed to produce the same ounce,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThis limited, slow-moving, price-inelastic supply is what has given gold its status as a store of value\u2014what made gold \u2026 gold.\u201d\nIn the past, gold\u2019s inverse interaction with interest rates has resulted from the fact that the precious metal does not have yields and does not pay interest or dividends. When interest rates are high, gold becomes less appealing because of the increased opportunity costs of holding other assets like bonds. Conversely, demand for gold usually skyrockets when rates are cut, when holding assets that can produce cash flow are viewed as less advantageous.\nBut swelling inflation following the onset of the pandemic changed this relationship. In 2022, conventional 60/40 portfolios\u2014made up of 60% equities and 40% bonds\u2014took a hit as markets roiled, and inflation and rate hikes made bonds less of a hedge for stocks. Meanwhile, gold, typically a hedge against inflation owing to its inelastic value, soared.\nWhile inflation has receded, hovering around 2.7%, Slok said he believes its persistent elevation has created a new normal of gold having more a"

                "body": "Gold prices climbed more than 1% on Wednesday (February 11, 2026, US time), as sustained long-term investment demand helped bullion regain momentum after a brief pullback when markets digested stronger-than-expected US employment data.\nSpot gold rose 1.25% to $5,085.93 an ounce at 4.08pm in New York (4.08am Thursday in Bangkok), after earlier touching a session high of $5,118.47 before easing slightly. US gold futures for April delivery settled 1.6% higher at $5,112.60 an ounce.\nUS non-farm payrolls for January rose by a stronger-than-expected 130,000, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, signalling continued labour-market strength. That could give the Federal Reserve room to keep interest rates unchanged as it monitors inflation.\n\u201cOne strong jobs report alone won\u2019t shake the case for buying gold, which is seen as a long-term investment based on fundamentals,\u201d said independent metals trader Tai Wong.\nHe added that since the sharp sell-off, gold has largely returned to a pattern of \u201chigher highs and higher lows\u201d, as investors remain confident amid debt concerns and a gradual shift away from US assets.\nGold suffered steep losses over two sessions on January 30 and February 2 after US President Donald Trump announced his preferred candidate for the next Fed chair. Even so, gold is still up more than 17% so far this year, following last year\u2019s record rally, supported by heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty and increased central-bank buying.\nUS data released on Tuesday showed retail sales were unexpectedly flat in December, which may indicate consumer spending and the economy are slowing as the new year begins.\nA Reuters poll suggested the Fed will keep rates unchanged until the end of Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s term in May, before beginning cuts in June. Economists also warned that monetary policy under Kevin Warsh, expected to take over next, could become too accommodative.\nGold, which offers no yield, tends to rise during periods of geopolitical or economic uncertainty and when interest rates are low. Investors are now watching for the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report due on Friday.\nOther precious metals\nMorning update (February 12, 2026)\nBloomberg reported that spot gold slipped 0.4% to $5,065.56 an ounce at 7.45am Singapore time. Silver fell 0.8% to $83.60, platinum dipped 1%, and palladium dropped 1.5%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was flat after ending the previous session down 0.1%."

                "body": "Gold remains supported above $5,000 after strong US jobs data\n- Gold steadies after rebounding from $5,018 following the US jobs data.\n- Strong NFP and firm wage growth temper near-term Fed interest rate-cut expectations.\n- Technically, XAU/USD holds a mild bullish technical bias above the $5,000 level.\nGold (XAU/USD) holds firm on Wednesday after coming under brief pressure following an upbeat US labour market report. At the time of writing, the metal trades near $5,070 after bouncing from an intraday low of $5,018.\nThe delayed January US Employment Situation Report showed a firmer-than-expected labour market. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose by 130K in January, beating market expectations of around 70K and coming in above December\u2019s revised 48K increase. At the same time, the Unemployment Rate edged lower to 4.3% from 4.4%.\nOn the earnings side, Average Hourly Earnings increased by 0.4% MoM in January, accelerating from 0.1% in the prior month and exceeding the 0.3% market forecast, while the annual pace held steady at 3.7% YoY, also topping expectations of 3.6%.\nThe stronger US labour market report reduces the urgency for near-term Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts and may offer some support to the US Dollar in the near term, which could limit upside in the Bullion.\nHowever, any downside in Gold is likely to remain limited, as broader macro drivers, including persistent geopolitical and economic risks and still-strong central bank demand, continue to underpin the metal\u2019s overall outlook.\nMarket movers: Trump renews rate-cut calls as Fed policy outlook stays in focus\n- US President Donald Trump reiterated his call for lower interest rates in an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday, saying the US should have \u201cthe lowest interest rates in the world,\u201d and again criticized Jerome Powell, calling him \u201cso bad\u201d and saying interest rates should be cut by around two percentage points.\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rebounds above 97.00 after slipping to daily lows near 96.49.\n- On the monetary policy front, markets currently expect around two interest rate cuts from the Fed this year, with those expectations reinforced by recent soft economic data. Retail Sales were unchanged in December at 0.0% MoM, undershooting expectations for a 0.4% increase. Meanwhile, last week\u2019s JOLTS survey showed job openings fell to 6.542 million, marking their weakest level since 2020.\n- Market pricing remains largely unchanged after the NFP release, with the CME FedWatch Tool showing a 49% probability for the first Fed rate cut in June.\n- In addition, comments from Fed officials on Monday were in focus. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said policymakers \u201ccould be on hold for quite some time\u201d and stressed that it is important to see inflation return to 2% before changing interest rates again. Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said it would take \u201cfurther material cooling\u201d in the labour market for additional rate cuts to be appropriate.\nTechnical analysis: XAU/USD remains supported above $5,000\nFrom a technical perspective, XAU/USD maintains a mild bullish bias, with buyers gradually gaining traction after successfully defending the $5,000 psychological level.\nOn the 4-hour chart, price hovers just below the upper Bollinger Band at $5,117.43, and a sustained break above this level would likely extend the current advance.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), at 61, is rising and remains in bullish territory, pointing to improving momentum. On the downside, initial support is seen at the 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), which also marks the mid-Bollinger Band, around $5,019.75.\nThe Bollinger Bands are narrowing, signalling a contraction in volatility and a coiling phase. Trend strength remains weak, with the ADX at 10.56, suggesting that a sustained directional move would likely require a fresh catalyst, with the US Nonfarm Payrolls report in focus.\nFailure to clear the u"

So high elevated costs make like components in uh solar panels just less economical. So you have this substitution risk that occurs. So when these prices go vertical, it's really important to have a strategy and an exit strategy. I mean, you're going to reduce your demand for silver or for jewelry, for silverware.

Historically, it trails other investment options, like stocks. From 1921 onward, silver has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 96%. That means an equal sum invested in silver and stocks back then would now be worth 96% less in silver holdings than stocks.\nInstead, silver is prized for its stability and its power to hedge against inflation. Often dubbed a \u201cstore of value,\u201d it tends to sustain purchasing power when inflation climbs.\nCompared with gold, silver prices generally swing more sharply due to industrial demand\u2014solar equipment, healthcare devices, and more\u2014whereas gold is almost purely a safe-haven asset.\nWhat does \u201cspot silver\u201d mean?\n\u201cSpot silver\u201d refers to the live market rate at which silver can be bought or sold instantly. That said, real-world buyers usually pay a premium over spot for markups, shipping, insurance, and other fees.\nThe spot price serves as a gauge of immediate market demand: a higher spot price means stronger buying interest.\nWhat is \u201cprice spread\u201d in silver trading?\nThe term \u201cprice spread\u201d describes the difference between the buying (ask) and selling (bid) prices for silver. Here\u2019s how those terms are defined.\n- Ask price: the cost to purchase silver.\n- Bid price: the amount you receive when you sell silver.\nA narrower spread indicates high demand.\nHow to invest in silver\nSilver exposure can be achieved through physical ownership or via silver-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs let you own a stake in a fund that holds silver, sparing you storage and insurance responsibilities.\nKey silver investment options include:\n- Bullion bars and rounds. These are sold by weight and purity\n- Government-minted silver coins. Iconic examples include American Silver Eagles and Canada\u2019s Silver Maple Leafs, which often trade at premiums for their rarity and backing.\n- Silver jewelry. Custom pieces that fetch prices above equal-purity bullion.\n- Silver mining equities. Stocks in companies extracting silver, offering a sort of indirect investment in silver.\nOn exchanges, bullion and coins must meet a minimum 99.9% purity. Lower-purity silver generally falls into collectible or industrial categories. Our guide to the best silver IRA companies provide more information on how to shrewdly invest in silver (and other precious metals).\nIs it a good time to invest in silver?\nSilver has surged more than 150% over the past year, hitting its highest levels in over a decade.\nDeciding whether to invest now depends on your unique attitude toward the market. If inflation is top of mind, adding precious metals can be prudent. Or, if you foresee rising industrial applications\u2014such as electronics\u2014demand could potentially push prices even higher.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 8:30 a.m. ET today\nGold remains the benchmark metal, while platinum and palladium exhibit volatility patterns similar to silver due to smaller market caps.

The recent action has been a mix of sharp rallies and nervous pullbacks, a classic tug-of-war between bulls betting on inflation, rate cuts, and industrial demand \u2013 and bears hiding behind a stubbornly strong dollar and shaky growth signals. Volatility is elevated, spreads are wider than usual, and every macro headline is hitting the chart like a hammer.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch deep-dive YouTube breakdowns on the latest Silver price setups\n- Scroll through Instagram Silver stacking pics and vault flex trends\n- Binge viral TikTok clips hyping the next big Silver investment wave\nThe Story: Silver sits right at the crossroads of two powerful narratives: safe-haven precious metal and high-demand industrial input. That dual identity is exactly why the current market is so explosive.\nOn the macro side, traders are laser-focused on central bank policy. The Federal Reserve has spent the last years fighting inflation with aggressive rate hikes. Higher interest rates tend to weigh on precious metals because they make cash and bonds relatively more attractive than non-yielding assets like Silver. When real yields rise, metals usually cool off; when yields fall, metals often catch a serious bid.\nInflation data remains the big wild card. Every CPI and PCE release is a volatility event for Silver. When inflation numbers come in hotter than expected, the market instantly starts whispering about renewed stagflation risk and long-term currency debasement. That feeds into the classic \u201chard asset\u201d narrative, where Silver and Gold become the go-to insurance policies. When inflation cools, the market starts betting on gentler Fed policy, which can also support Silver through lower real yields and a weaker dollar. Paradoxically, both scenarios can be bullish over different timeframes \u2013 the key is how the Fed reacts and how the dollar trades.\nThen there is the dollar. Silver is priced in USD, so a strong dollar tends to pressure Silver, while a weaker dollar often lights the fuse under the metal. Recently, the greenback has been swinging between bursts of strength on safe-haven flows and sudden dips when the market sniffs out future rate cuts. Every bounce in the USD can trigger hesitation in Silver, every wobble in the USD can give Silver bulls courage to press harder.\nAdd geopolitics to the mix: tensions, conflicts, and global uncertainty keep safe-haven demand on the table. But unlike pure safe-haven assets, Silver also answers to the real economy. That is where industrial demand \u2013 especially from the green-energy transition \u2013 comes roaring in.\nSolar panels, EVs, 5G, electronics, and even emerging grid technologies all eat Silver. The metal has exceptional electrical and thermal conductivity, which makes it almost irreplaceable in many high-tech applications. Forecasts for solar capacity expansion, EV penetration, and energy storage growth are not shrinking \u2013 they are ramping. That means structural demand from industry is an ongoing bullish backbone, even when macro jitters cause short-term wobbles.\nMeanwhile, on the street level, social sentiment around Silver refuses to die. The \u201cSilver Squeeze\u201d crowd, born out of the meme-stock era, still watches every dip as a potential generational stacking opportunity. \u201cPoor Man\u2019s Gold\u201d is trending again across forums and social channels whenever there is fear about currency debasement, bank stability, or government debt.

That follows an earlier report from the news agency that the US is considering seizing tankers with Iranian crude.\n\"Oil right now, and just the rest of the commodity complex, is really dominated by three things: geopolitics, trade and technology,\" Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at Bank of America Global Research, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. \"Certainly, right now, geopolitics are the main driving force pushing oil close to the high end of this year's range.\"\nIran is the fourth-largest OPEC producer, pumping an estimated 3.3 million barrels a day in January, according to a Bloomberg survey. Crude and condensate shipments totaled about 1.63 million barrels a day last month, vessel-tracking data show.\nThe WSJ report meant crude erased earlier losses after President Donald Trump said in a social media post that he insisted that talks with Iran continue in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It was widely expected that Netanyahu would push for a broad curtailment of the Islamic Republic's military activities in the region.\nThe commodity has also received support earlier after strong US jobs data brightened the outlook for the world's largest economy.\n\"A resilient labor market underpins demand for transport fuels, petrochemicals and power generation, reducing downside risks to US consumption at a time when macro sentiment had turned cautious,\" said Claudio Galimberti, chief economist at Rystad Energy. The strong numbers are a sign that the demand picture is firming up, he added.\nCrude has advanced almost 13% this year as geopolitical tensions added a risk premium to prices, following a 20% slump in 2025 on concern supplies will outpace demand. After the US and Iran said initial talks last week to seek a deal on Iran's nuclear program were positive, traders fear failure to reach an agreement may lead to US strikes and potential supply interruptions.\nOil Prices\n- WTI for March delivery added 1.1% to settle at $64.63 a barrel in New York.\n- Brent for April settlement gained 0.9% to settle at $69.40 a barrel.\nTraders are also watching for the monthly report from the International Energy Agency on Thursday. The IEA has been warning that there will be a major crude supply surplus this year.\n\"The market is oversupplied and inventories are rising,\" Bank of America's Blanch said. There is oversupply of roughly 2 million barrels a day in the market as the OPEC+ producers group has added output, he said. Should geopolitics push Brent above $70 a barrel, he expects the group will add even more.\nMeanwhile, US crude stockpiles rose by 8.5 million barrels, the biggest surge since January 2025 in barrel terms, figures from the Energy Information Administration show, but that volume was lower than the expected gain of 13.4 million barrels flagged by an industry group a day prior. Overall price reaction was subdued with investors' attention fixed on Iran.\nWhat do you think?

The increase brings commercial stockpiles to 428.8 million barrels according to government data, which is still 3% below the five-year average for this time of year.\nThe EIA\u2019s data release follows API\u2019s figures that were released a day earlier, which suggested that crude oil inventories rose by 13.4 million barrels.\nCrude prices were trading up on Wednesday morning. At 10:40 a.m. in New York, Brent was trading at $69.94 per barrel\u2014up $1.14 (+1.66%) on the day. This is up more than $2 per barrel drop week over week. WTI was also trading up, by $1.09 per barrel (+1.70%) in morning trade at $65.05 per barrel.\nFor total motor gasoline, the EIA reported that inventories had increased by 1.2 million barrels after gaining 700,000 barrels in the week prior. The most recent figures showed average daily gasoline production increased to 9.1 million barrels.

                "body": "U.S. shale oil and gas producers are buying international assets to maintain supply amid revisions of oil demand outlooks for the long term. From South America to the Middle East, frackers are going global.\nContinental Resources is one example. The company of fracking icon Harold Hamm has been expanding in Argentina\u2019s Vaca Muerta shale play, widely considered the second-largest shale oil and gas deposit after the Permian. In the last three months, Continental made two asset acquisition deals in the Vaca Muerta, with its chief executive, Doug Lawler, calling it \u201cone of the most compelling shale plays in the world.\u201d\nBut Continental is not limiting itself to Argentina. The company also recently sealed two exploration deals in Turkey, one for the Diyarbakir Basin of Southeast Turkey and the Thrace Basin of northwest Turkey. Early evaluations suggest the ultimate recoverable reserves could reach 6 billion barrels of oil and 12-20 trillion cubic feet of gas in the Diyarbakir Basin, and 20-45 trillion cu ft in the Thrace Basin, Continental Resources said.\nMeanwhile, the former chief executive of Parsley Energy, Bryan Sheffield, is investing in Australian unconventional energy resources. The Financial Times reported last month that Sheffield\u2014son of Pioneer Natural Resources\u2019 Scott Sheffield\u2014is the biggest shareholder in a company called Tamboran Resources. The company holds the drilling rights to acreage spanning close to 2 million acres in Australia\u2019s Beetaloo basin. The basin is considered to be one of the biggest shale gas deposits globally, with Australia\u2019s Northern Territory government reporting estimated resources of over 500 trillion cu ft in discovered and prospective gas.\nRelated: Libya Awards First Oil Blocks In 20 Years to Chevron and Europe\u2019s Oil Majors\nEOG Resources, meanwhile, recently started drilling in a shale play in the United Arab Emirates. The UAE is not the first country that comes to mind when talking about unconventional energy resources, but it appears to also be as rich in them as it is in conventional oil and gas. The shale major is also planning to drill for oil in a shale play in Bahrain, with chief executive Ezra Yakob saying at an industry event last year, \u201cWe have captured abundant resource in both plays, and we\u2019ve partnered with companies that we have very, very strong stakeholder alignment with.\u201d\nAccording to a recent Wall Street Journal article on U.S. shale drillers\u2019 expansion campaign abroad, the move has been prompted by peaking production at home. The article cited a Wood Mackenzie analyst as saying the global expansion was in fact, long overdue, stumped by the prolific resources of the Permian, which kept everyone\u2019s attention focused on oil and gas resources at home.\n\u201cOne of the things that killed Global Shale 1.0 was the Permian,\u201d Rob Clarke told the WSJ, adding that now the time has come for Global Shale 2.0, as well productivity in the Permian declines from 65 barrels per lateral foot in 2016 to 46 barrels per lateral foot last year. According to data from Enverus from 2024, well productivity in the Permian, the star shale play in the U.S. unconventional oil and gas industry, had declined by 15% since 2020.\nThe international expansion is also an expansion in fracking technology. U.S. companies doubtlessly have the most accumulated expertise in how to extract oil and gas from shale rock, and they are happy to apply this expertise in other parts of the world. Liberty Energy, for instance, provided modern stimulation equipment for the successful drilling of Tamboran Resources\u2019 gas wells in the Beetaloo basin. EOG is sharing its own shale drilling expertise with Adnoc in the UAE. In Saudi Arabia, SLB is working on the kingdom\u2019s shale gas fields as Riyadh eyes a substantial increase in gas output.\nThe global expansion of American shale majors is very likely to continue and intensify in the coming years. According to a senior researcher from Enverus, the big shale players have about 7.5 years of hi"

The ICE Brent front-month contract rose by $3.10/b, m-o-m, to average $64.73/b, and the NYMEX WTI front-month contract increased by $2.39/b, m-o-m, to average $60.26/b. The GME Oman front-month contract rose by $0.83/b, m-o-m, to average $62.79/b. The Brent\u2013WTI front-month spread rose by $0.71/b, m-o-m, to average $4.47/b. The forward curves of all major crude benchmarks strengthened, with the front end of the curves for both ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI moving into stronger backwardation. Oil supply outages, easing selling pressure from speculators and robust physical market fundamentals supported front-month contracts. The forward curve for GME Oman was little changed, m-o-m. Speculative sentiment turned bullish, with hedge funds and other money managers sharply increasing their net long positions.\nWorld Economy\nThe global economic growth forecasts remain unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment at 3.1% in 2026 and 3.2% in 2027. The US economic growth forecast is revised up slightly to 2.2% for 2026, but remains at 2% for 2027. In the Eurozone, the economic growth forecasts remain at 1.2% for both 2026 and 2027. Japan\u2019s economic growth forecasts remain at 0.9% for both 2026 and 2027. The economic growth forecasts for China remain at 4.5% for both 2026 and 2027. India\u2019s economic growth forecasts remain at 6.6% for 2026 and 6.5% for 2027. Brazil\u2019s economic growth forecasts remain at 2.0% for 2026 and 2.2% for 2027. Russia\u2019s economic growth forecasts remain at 1.3% for 2026 and 1.5% for 2027.\nWorld Oil Demand\nThe global oil demand growth forecast for 2026 remains at 1.4 mb/d, y-o-y, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment. The OECD is forecast to increase by 0.15 mb/d, while the non-OECD is forecast to grow by about 1.2 mb/d. In 2027, global oil demand is forecast to grow by about 1.3 mb/d, y-o-y, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment. The OECD is forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d next year, while the non-OECD is forecast to increase by about 1.2 mb/d, y-o-y.\nWorld Oil Supply\nNon-DoC liquids production (i.e., liquids production from countries not participating in the Declaration of Cooperation) is forecast to grow by about 0.6 mb/d, y-o-y, in 2026, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment, mainly driven by Brazil, Canada, US, and Argentina. In 2027, non-DoC liquids production is forecast to grow by about 0.6 mb/d, unchanged from last month\u2019s assessment, mainly driven by Brazil, Canada, Qatar, and Argentina. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) and non-conventional liquids from countries participating in the DoC are forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, in 2026, to average about 8.8 mb/d, followed by similar growth in 2027 of about 0.1 mb/d, y-o-y, to average about 8.9 mb/d. In January, crude oil production by countries participating in the DoC decreased by 439 tb/d, m-o-m, to average about 42.45 mb/d, according to available secondary sources.\nProduct Markets and Refining Operations\nIn January, refining margins declined in all reported trading hubs. Stronger feedstock prices and seasonal demand-side pressures weighed on refining margins, despite a significant rise in offline capacity due to the severe winter in the Atlantic basin and extended maintenance in Asia. In the US Gulf Coast (USGC), losses stemmed from the bottom section of the barrel as increased availability of heavy crude supplies weighed on fuel oil and, to a more limited extent, on gasoil crack spreads. In Rotterdam, all key product margins declined, with gasoline leading the decline, followed by fuel oil. In Singapore, the decline was driven by elevated gasoline and jet/kerosene supplies in the region.\nTanker Market\nDirty tanker spot freight rates had a strong start to the year in January, supported by weather disruptions, geopolitical uncertainties, unplanned outages, and steady loading activity.

                "body": "EUR/USD flat lines below 1.1900; divergent Fed-ECB expectations offer support\n- EUR/USD consolidates in a range during the Asian session amid mixed fundamental cues.\n- The upbeat US NFP tempers bets for more Fed rate cuts and lends some support to the USD.\n- Relatively hawkish ECB expectations act as a tailwind for the EUR and the currency pair.\nThe EUR/USD pair struggles to capitalize on the overnight bounce from the 1.1835-1.1830 region and oscillates in a narrow band during the Asian session on Thursday. Spot prices currently trade around the 1.1875 area, remaining nearly unchanged for the day and staying within striking distance of an over one-week high, reached on Tuesday, amid mixed cues.\nInvestors trimmed their expectations for more aggressive policy easing by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) following the release of a strong US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Wednesday. Furthermore, hawkish comments from Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, saying that further rate cuts risk allowing high inflation to persist even longer, assist the US Dollar (USD) to hold steady above a nearly two-week low. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor acting as a headwind for the EUR/USD pair.\nMarket participants, however, are still pricing in the possibility of at least two 25 basis points (bps) Fed rate cuts in 2026. Adding to this, threats to the US central bank's independence, along with the underlying bullish sentiment, contribute to capping the safe-haven Greenback. The shared currency, on the other hand, is underpinned by the growing acceptance that the European Central Bank (ECB) would likely hold interest rates steady for the rest of the year, lending support to the EUR/USD pair.\nThere aren't any relevant market-moving economic releases due from the Eurozone on Thursday, while the US economic docket features the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims later during the North American session. The spotlight now shifts to the US consumer inflation figures, due on Friday. The crucial data will be looked for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path, which, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the USD price dynamics and providing some meaningful impetus to the EUR/USD pair.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during"

                "body": "EUR/USD faced renewed selling pressure on Wednesday after a stronger-than-expected US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report boosted the US Dollar and dented demand for the Euro. The pair dropped sharply in the immediate aftermath of the release, falling around 68 pips to an intraday low near 1.1833 before stabilizing around 1.1875 at the time of writing.\nJanuary\u2019s NFP report showed that the US economy added 130K jobs, comfortably exceeding market expectations of roughly 70K and improving on December\u2019s revised 48K gain. Meanwhile, the Unemployment Rate ticked lower to 4.3% from 4.4%, signaling continued resilience in the labor market.\nHowever, the details beneath the headline figures painted a more nuanced picture. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revised down the seasonally adjusted level of total Nonfarm employment for March 2025 by 898K. In addition, total job growth for 2025 was sharply reduced to 181K from a previously reported 584K, suggesting that underlying hiring momentum last year was significantly weaker than earlier believed. The BLS also indicated that average monthly job growth in 2025 stood at just 15K, underscoring a subdued longer-term trend.\nOn the wage front, Average Hourly Earnings rose by 0.4% month-on-month in January, accelerating from 0.1% previously and surpassing the 0.3% consensus forecast. On an annual basis, wage growth held steady at 3.7%, slightly above expectations of 3.6%. The stronger earnings data reinforced the view that inflationary pressures from wages remain persistent.\nOverall, the report dampened expectations for near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts and strengthened the argument for policymakers to maintain current rates for longer. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, futures markets now largely price the policy rate to remain unchanged within the 3.50%\u20133.75% range at both the March and April meetings.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY) trades broadly flat near 96.95, after earlier dipping to around 96.49 before rebounding on the jobs data. For now, EUR/USD remains sensitive to shifts in Fed rate expectations, with the strong headline labor figures providing fresh support for the Greenback despite downward revisions to past employment trends.\nTrade Idea:\nSell EUR/USD on rallies toward 1.1900\u20131.1920, targeting 1.1780, with a stop above 1.1970, as strong US payrolls and firm wages support the Dollar."

Traders have been handed the kind of divergent theme FX markets thrive on: a classic mix of diverging monetary policy expectations and mounting political uncertainty.\n- The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) delivered a hawkish 25bp hike. While the move itself was widely expected, the tone of the statement and upgraded forecasts provided the real upside surprise for Australian dollar bulls.\n- The Bank of England (BoE) held rates as expected, but the vote split was far tighter than the anticipated 7\u20132 in favour of a hold. Instead, five MPC members voted to hold and four to cut. The Bank also signalled that further rate reductions are likely.\n- On the political front, UK PM Keir Starmer is under pressure amid fallout linked to the Epstein files. While not directly implicated, scrutiny around his decision to appoint Mandelson \u2014 and whether he was aware of prior controversies \u2014 has raised questions over judgement and governance. Even without concrete findings, political uncertainty is adding to sterling\u2019s headwinds.\nSource: LSEG\nGBP/AUD Hits 13-Year Low as Bearish Momentum Accelerates\nThis ideal mix of bearish drivers for GBP/AUD has pushed the cross to a 156-month low, with momentum clearly accelerating. The key question now is how much further it can fall.\nIf history is any guide, there may still be room to the downside. GBP/AUD has declined just 11.7% from its recent peak \u2014 less than half the magnitude of the previous two major tops.\n- March 2020 \u2013 September 2022: -23.7%\n- August 2015 \u2013 October 2016: -30.1%\n- April 2025 \u2013 Present: -11.7%\nIn other words, the current drawdown remains modest relative to prior cyclical declines, which suggests the move could extend further if the macro and political divergence persists.\nSource: TradingView / ICE\nGBP/AUD Tests 200-Month EMA as Bears Eye 1.80 Handle\nThe monthly chart shows GBP/AUD testing a break below its 200-month EMA (1.9186). While that could spark a near-term bounce, momentum suggests bears are targeting the 2024 low at 1.8605, or potentially the 200-month SMA near the 1.80 handle.\nFor context, a move down to 1.80 would amount to a 16.8% decline from the recent high. Even a drop to 1.70 would still fall short of the previous major market-top selloff of 23.7%.\nGBP/AUD Technical Analysis: British Pound vs Australian Dollar\nThe cross has now broken below its 200-week SMA \u2014 a technically significant level. With price hovering around the October 2024 low, bears should be alert to the risk of near-term two-way volatility before the broader downtrend potentially resumes.\nOn the daily chart, price is stretched well below the 10- and 20-day EMAs, while RSI (14) is deeply oversold.

The BoE held rates unchanged at its February meeting but surprised markets with a 5-4 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) vote split, with four members backing an immediate 25 basis point cut, a more dovish outcome than expected.\nGovernor Andrew Bailey noted that inflation is set to reach the 2% target sooner than anticipated, and markets are now pricing in 50 basis points of additional easing in 2026. UK political risk flared as Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for Prime Minister Keir Starmer to step down amid the Peter Mandelson scandal, though cabinet support has since steadied the situation. The critical event for the Pound this week is Thursday's release of UK preliminary Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Q4 2025, with the quarter-over-quarter consensus at 0.2% (down from 0.1% in Q3) and year-over-year at 1.2% (previous 1.3%), alongside December industrial and manufacturing production data. The BoE recently downgraded its 2026 GDP forecast to 0.9% from 1.2%, adding to the cautious backdrop. On Friday, Bank of England MPC member Pill speaks, while the delayed US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January takes center stage, with headline year-over-year expected at 2.5% and core month-over-month at 0.3%. A softer CPI print could reignite US Dollar selling, supporting GBP/USD despite the BoE's dovish lean.\nGBP/USD price forecast\nOn the daily chart, GBP/USD is trading at 1.3627, down 0.12% on the session, pulling back from the late-January swing high of 1.3869, a level not seen since early 2022. Price is trading above both the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.3516 and the 200-day EMA at 1.3312, keeping the broader bullish trend structure of higher highs and higher lows from the November low of 1.3010. The pullback from 1.3869 has been orderly, with the pair finding support near the 1.3600 handle on multiple sessions. The Stochastic Oscillator (14, 5, 5) reads 47.10/52.91, sitting at the midline and pointing to neutral momentum after resetting from overbought territory, which suggests the correction may be nearing completion. Immediate support lies at 1.3585 to 1.3620, a zone that aligns with recent consolidation lows and, if held, would preserve the bullish structure for a retest of 1.3735 and the 1.3869 high. Below that, deeper support sits at 1.3516 (50 EMA) and the 1.3380 to 1.3400 zone. Resistance stands at 1.3735, followed by 1.3869. A daily close below 1.3585 would open the door toward 1.3380 to 1.3400, while a bounce from current levels with a bullish Stochastic crossover would favor a push back toward the January high.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for peop"

This development represents a pivotal moment for currency traders who had positioned for imminent interest rate cuts from the world\u2019s most influential central bank.\nGBP/USD Reacts to US Employment Data Surprise\nThe currency market experienced immediate volatility following the release of January\u2019s Non-Farm Payrolls report. Initially, the British pound had strengthened against the US dollar during early European trading. However, the NFP data revealed the US economy added 353,000 jobs in December, substantially exceeding economists\u2019 consensus forecast of 170,000. Consequently, the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, defying predictions of a slight increase. This robust employment picture prompted traders to reassess their positions rapidly.\nMarket participants quickly adjusted their outlook for the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy path. Previously, futures markets had priced in a high probability of rate cuts beginning as early as March. Following the data release, however, these expectations diminished significantly. The shift in sentiment created immediate downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair, which fell from session highs near 1.2750 to trade around 1.2680. This movement illustrates the direct correlation between US economic data and major currency valuations.\nFederal Reserve Policy Expectations Recalibrated\nThe stronger-than-anticipated jobs report fundamentally altered the narrative surrounding the Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves. For months, markets had anticipated a dovish pivot from the Fed as inflation showed signs of cooling. The employment data, however, suggests the US labor market remains remarkably resilient. This resilience gives the Federal Open Market Committee more flexibility to maintain higher interest rates for longer without triggering a recession.\nSeveral key metrics from the report influenced this recalibration:\n- Wage Growth: Average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month-over-month and 4.5% year-over-year, exceeding forecasts.\n- Labor Force Participation: The rate held at 62.5%, indicating stable workforce engagement.\n- Revisions: Previous months\u2019 job gains were revised upward by 126,000, strengthening the trend.\nThese figures collectively reduced the perceived urgency for the Fed to cut rates. Higher wages can sustain consumer spending, potentially slowing disinflation. Therefore, the central bank may prioritize ensuring inflation returns sustainably to its 2% target before easing policy.\nHistorical Context of NFP Market Reactions\nHistorically, significant NFP surprises have produced substantial currency movements. The table below shows recent examples of how large data deviations moved the GBP/USD pair:\nThis pattern demonstrates that positive US employment surprises typically strengthen the dollar against other major currencies. The January 2025 reaction follows this established market behavior precisely.\nComparative Central Bank Dynamics\nThe GBP/USD movement reflects not just US developments but the contrasting monetary policy outlooks between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. While the Fed may delay cuts, the Bank of England faces its own complex economic landscape. UK inflation has proven stickier than in the US, particularly in services and wage growth. However, the British economy shows signs of weakness, with GDP contracting in recent quarters.\nThis divergence creates a challenging environment for currency traders. On one hand, delayed Fed cuts support the US dollar through higher relative interest rates. On the other hand, the Bank of England cannot easily cut rates while domestic inflation remains above"

The board will be data-dependent and continually reassess forecasts.\nAustralia\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations rose to 5.0% in February from 4.6% previously, ending seven months below 5%.

The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report will be the highlight later on Friday.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Iron Ore falls. Higher Iron Ore prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance for Australia, which is also positive of the AUD.\nThe Trade Balance, which is the difference be"

The driver is rate math. Australia\u2019s 3-year government yield is now roughly 75 basis points above comparable US Treasuries \u2013 a sharp swing from about 60 bps below a year ago \u2013 while the spread versus German bunds has widened to about 223 bps, the biggest since late 2022. That repricing..\nfollowed a hotter-than-expected inflation print and an RBA hike last week. Late-April Q1 inflation is the next big test for whether policymakers tighten again.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Higher yields can pull a currency up fast.\nWhen a central bank looks more likely to hike while peers look closer to cutting, global money often flows toward that market\u2019s bonds \u2013 and the currency tends to get a tailwind. That can squeeze exporters and firms with overseas earnings, but it can also damp imported inflation by making foreign goods cheaper. Either way, a data surprise can quickly unwind the trade.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks are drifting out of sync again.\nThe last few years were defined by synchronized tightening, but inflation is now cooling at different speeds across countries. Australia is grappling with stickier price pressures, while parts of Europe and the US are closer to debating cuts.

Moreover, the fundamental backdrop and the broader technical setup support the case for an extension of the weekly downtrend triggered by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory.\nInvestors now seem hopeful that Takaichi could be more fiscally responsible and that her policies will boost the economy. This might prompt the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to stick to its hawkish stance, which continues to underpin the Japanese Yen (JPY). The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, struggles to build on the upbeat US NFP-inspired bounce amid bets that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut rates further in 2026 and threats to the central bank's independence.

The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its sup"

The markets are currently pricing in 60 basis points of Fed easing by the end of the year.

A break below here creates a lower low and exposes the 200 SMA at 150.30.\nResistance is seen at 154.50, the mid-December low, with a rise above this level opening the door to 156.00. A rise above 157.80 creates a higher high.\nEuropean stocks are under pressure on Wednesday, pulled lower by tech and financial stocks amid ongoing worries that new AI models could hurt traditional software businesses\nWhile worries that AI is disrupting software companies hit tech stocks particularly hard in the US last week, those worries are also in Europe. French company Dassault\u2019s shares are down almost 20% and on track for their largest daily drop after the software maker posted disappointing Q4 revenue growth and a weak outlook for this year.\nFears over AI disruption are not only affecting software firms; they are also spreading to other parts of the market, including insurers, asset managers, and index providers, following the release of several new AI tools.\nOn the macro front, attention is on the US jobs report later today, which could help gauge expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.\nThe nonfarm payroll report is expected to show 70,000 jobs added, up from 50,000 in December, and unemployment is expected to rise to 4.5%, up from 4.4%.\nSlightly weaker jobs data could support expectations for Fed cuts, which would be positive for risk assets globally.\nThe DAX rebounded from the rising trendline support, moving above the 50 SMA before encountering resistance around 25,000 as momentum faded.

The US Dollar (USD) edges higher against the Canadian Dollar (CAD) on a stronger-than-expected employment report. Traders will take more cues from the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report later on Friday.\nThe US economy added 130,000 jobs in January, above the market consensus of 70,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday. The Unemployment Rate declined to 4.3% in January from 4.4% in December, better than the forecast of 4.4%.\nThe upbeat report suggests that the US labor market continued to stabilize at the start of 2026, reducing the chances the Federal Reserve (Fed) will see a need to cut interest rates again by midyear. This, in turn, provides some support to the Greenback against the CAD.\nThe US CPI inflation data will be closely watched on Friday. The headline and core CPI are projected to show a rise of 2.5% YoY in January. On a monthly basis, the headline and core CPI are estimated to show an increase of 0.3% during the same period. In case of a softer-than-expected outcome, this could drag the USD lower in the near term.\nOngoing geopolitical risks could boost crude oil prices and underpin the commodity-linked Loonie. It is worth noting that Canada is a major oil-exporting country, and high crude oil prices generally have a positive impact on the CAD.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar.

The downfall is exclusively sponsored by strong follow-through buying around the Japanese Yen (JPY), fueled by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide victory in the lower house election on Sunday.\nThe clear political mandate gives Takaichi the leeway to pursue her expansionary policies. Moreover, investors remain hopeful that Takaichi could be more fiscally responsible and her policies will boost the economy, which might prompt the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to stick to its hawkish stance. Apart from this, speculations that authorities conducted rate checks following the release of the blowout US employment data trigger a fresh leg up in the JPY and exert heavy downward pressure on the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe JPY bulls, meanwhile, seem rather unaffected by softer domestic data, which showed that Japan's annual wholesale inflation slowed for a second consecutive month in January. Even the underlying bullish sentiment \u2013 as depicted by a generally positive tone around the equity markets \u2013 does little to hinder the safe-haven JPY's strong move up. Furthermore, the Bank of England's (BoE) dovish signal contributes to the British Pound's (GBP) underperformance and contributes to the GBP/JPY pair's decline.\nFrom a technical perspective, this week's breakdown below the very important 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) seems to have aggravated the bearish pressure surrounding the currency pair. That said, the prevailing selling bias surrounding the US Dollar (USD) offers some support to the British Pound (GBP) and might limit losses for the GBP/JPY cross.

At the time of writing, the cross is trading near 209.25, extending losses for a third straight day.\nRenewed demand for the Yen is driven by improving investor sentiment following Japan\u2019s election result, after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi secured a decisive victory in the general election. However, some caution persists as Takaichi is expected to push through a \u00a521 trillion stimulus package and has proposed a temporary suspension of the consumption tax on food.\nDespite these concerns, investor optimism around Takaichi's policy agenda and the prospect of stronger economic growth continue to underpin sentiment toward Japanese assets, with Japan\u2019s stock market surging to record highs.\nMeanwhile, political tensions in the United Kingdom appear to be easing, though this has done little to offer meaningful support to the Pound. Prime Minister Keir Starmer survived a leadership crisis linked to controversy over the appointment of Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the United States, after securing backing from his Cabinet and a large number of MPs from the Labour Party.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Starmer sought to downplay internal divisions, saying that \u201cthe real fight is not within the Labour Party, but with the right-wing party.\u201d He added that he would \u201cnever walk away from the mandate I was given to change this nation.\u201d\nInvestors also expect the Bank of England (BoE) to begin cutting interest rates as early as March, after the central bank held its Bank Rate at 3.75% at the February meeting in a narrowly split 5-4 vote.\nAccording to a Reuters report last week, investors polled by the BoE expect the policy rate to be eased gradually to around 3.0% by the March 2027 meeting, reinforcing expectations of a steady easing cycle ahead.\nAgainst this backdrop, GBP/JPY remains vulnerable in the near term as policy divergence favours the Yen, with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) seen staying on a gradual normalisation path.\nExpectations for another rate hike have picked up after the central bank\u2019s recent hawkish hold, and markets are now increasingly pricing the next BoJ rate increase for June.\nAttention now shifts to the UK\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Industrial and Manufacturing Production data, scheduled for release on Thursday.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "LONDON, March 2025 \u2013 The GBP/JPY currency cross has tumbled decisively, striking its weakest level in nearly eight weeks as sustained demand for the Japanese Yen overwhelms the British Pound. This significant move, unfolding across global trading sessions, reflects a potent confluence of shifting monetary policy expectations and contrasting economic fundamentals between the United Kingdom and Japan. Consequently, forex traders and institutional investors are now closely scrutinizing the dynamics behind this pronounced downtrend.\nGBP/JPY Technical Breakdown and Immediate Catalysts\nThe GBP/JPY pair breached several key technical support levels this week, accelerating its decline. Market data confirms the pair now trades at its lowest point since late January 2025. This downward trajectory is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of building pressure. Primarily, a hawkish recalibration of expectations surrounding the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has fueled the Yen\u2019s strength. Simultaneously, softer-than-anticipated UK economic indicators have applied consistent selling pressure on Sterling.\nAnalysts point to recent comments from BoJ officials hinting at a potential near-term adjustment to its yield curve control framework. Furthermore, stronger Japanese wage growth data has bolstered the argument for sustainable inflation. Conversely, in the UK, a combination of muted retail sales figures and dovish rhetoric from certain Bank of England members has tempered expectations for aggressive future rate hikes. This policy divergence forms the core narrative driving the current price action.\nThe Fundamental Drivers Behind Yen Strength\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s resurgence is rooted in a fundamental reassessment of Japan\u2019s monetary policy landscape. For years, the BoJ maintained an ultra-accommodative stance, making the Yen a favored funding currency for carry trades. However, the global inflationary environment and domestic price pressures are forcing a gradual shift. Market participants are now actively pricing in a higher probability of policy normalization, which increases the Yen\u2019s appeal.\nKey factors supporting the Yen include:\n- Inflation Persistence: Japan\u2019s core inflation has remained at or above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for over a year, challenging the bank\u2019s previous \u2018transitory\u2019 view.\n- Wage Growth Momentum: The recent Shunto spring wage negotiations resulted in the highest pay rises in decades, a critical precondition for the BoJ to consider policy shifts.\n- Global Rate Peak: As other major central banks like the Federal Reserve signal a pause, the interest rate differential that weakened the Yen is beginning to compress.\nThis shift marks a significant change in market psychology. Investors are no longer solely focused on borrowing Yen to invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. Instead, they are beginning to account for the currency\u2019s potential appreciation based on changing fundamentals.\nExpert Insight: Navigating the Policy Shift\n\u201cThe market is delicately repricing the terminal point of BoJ accommodation,\u201d notes Dr. Aiko Tanaka, Chief Currency Strategist at the Tokyo Institute for Financial Research. \u201cWhile an abrupt end to negative rates is unlikely, the path is now clearly toward less extreme stimulus. This changes the calculus for crosses like GBP/JPY, where the rate advantage for Sterling is perceived to be narrowing. Traders are front-running this adjustment.\u201d Historical data supports this view; periods of BoJ policy inflection have typically led to sustained Yen strength for several quarters.\nBritish Pound Under Pressure: Economic Headwinds\nWhile Yen strength is a primary driver, the British Pound\u2019s relative weakness has equally contributed to the GBP/JPY decline. Recent UK economic data has painted a mixed picture, leaning toward stagnation rather than robust growth. High-frequency indicators suggest consumer spending is softening under the weight of persistent cost-of-living pressures and previous interest rate increases.\n"

                "body": "Bitcoin's short-lived bounce faded on Wednesday as the volatility in the world's largest cryptocurrency continued.\nBitcoin was trading at around $66,166 at 10:21 a.m. ET on Wednesday, down roughly 4% on the day.\nThe digital coin has been on a downward trajectory since hitting an all-time high above $126,000 in October with the sell-off intensifying over the last month. Bitcoin dropped below $70,000 on Feb. 5 and slid to hold just above $60,000, which is seen as a key level.\nBitcoin then recovered from those lows and was back above $70,000, but has struggled to push higher from that, remaining in the range of $66,000 and $72,000.\nOn Thursday, bitcoin was around 47% lower than its record high.\nSeveral factors have weighed on crypto markets, including volatility in technology stocks in the U.S., with which crypto assets often move in tandem with.\nMeanwhile, the Feb. 5 sell-off was triggered by a wave of liquidations \u2014 when traders are forced to close positions if the price of bitcoin hits a certain point. This has a cascading effect, which can exacerbate selling. Those liqudiations have since slowed down.\nInvestors are also considering whether there will be a shift in U.S. monetary policy following U.S. President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed chair late last month.\nSelling from issuers of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which are large holders of the digital coin, led to outflows from these ETFs. That added to the pressure on the digital coin. However, in the last three days, bitcoin ETFs have recorded net inflows.\nBitcoin cycle back in focus\nMarket participants are looking at whether bitcoin's typical cycle is intact. This refers to the historical pattern after an event known as halving, which often leads to new all-time highs for the cryptocurrency and a subsequent crash before new highs.\nBitcoin's halving \u2014 an event written into its code that happens every four years \u2014reduces the rewards given to bitcoin miners and effectively slows down the supply of bitcoin on the market. The supply squeeze typically precedes rallies to fresh record highs for bitcoin. The most recent halving took place in April 2024.\nThere has been a debate as to whether the typical bitcoin cycle is over or if the patterns are breaking. But investors and analysts suggest the cycle is very much intact.\n\"2026 I expect to be a bear leg to the four-year cycle,\" Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, told CNBC on Wednesday. \"We have experienced several four-year cycles since bitcoin has launched and this is no different than any other.\"\nMcClurg added that he expects bitcoin to fall to as low as $50,000 in the summer before \"things turn around in the fall.\"\nMarkus Thielen of 10X Research told CNBC last week that bitcoin could fall to the $50,000 level."

                "body": "Is iShares Bitcoin Trust the Best Bitcoin ETF You Can Buy?\nKey Points\nBoth IBIT and FBTC charge a 0.25% expense ratio and provide direct exposure to bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\nIBIT is significantly larger by assets under management, while FBTC has a slightly smaller drawdown and had a marginally better one-year return as of Jan. 30, 2026.\nNeither ETF pays a dividend or yield, and both hold bitcoin almost exclusively, offering minimal diversification.\niShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NYSEMKT:FBTC) both deliver pure-play bitcoin exposure with identical expense ratios, but differ in assets under management, trading statistics, and subtle variations in historical performance and risk.\nBoth iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund are designed for investors seeking straightforward access to bitcoin price performance through traditional brokerage accounts, avoiding the technical and custody challenges of holding cryptocurrency directly. This comparison highlights the practical differences that may matter most for those weighing these two leading spot bitcoin ETFs.\nSnapshot (cost & size)\nBeta measures price volatility relative to the S&P 500; beta is calculated from five-year weekly returns. The 1-yr return represents total return over the trailing 12 months.\nBoth funds are priced at 0.25% annually, making them more affordable than most actively managed vehicles targeting alternative assets. With no dividend or yield offered by either ETF, cost efficiency is the primary differentiator on fees.\nPerformance & risk comparison\nWhat's inside\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund is a straightforward vehicle for bitcoin exposure, holding 99.98% of assets in Bitcoin (XBTUSD) and the remainder in net other assets. Sector allocation is not reported, but with just two holdings and over two years on the market, the fund is focused exclusively on tracking bitcoin\u2019s price. There are no notable quirks or leverage resets, and the fund does not track a named index.\niShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is even more concentrated, with 100% of its portfolio in bitcoin and cash, and no sector diversification. Its assets under management (AUM) are much larger, at roughly $64.8 billion, and the fund\u2019s top holdings mirror FBTC\u2019s, with bitcoin dominating the exposure. Like FBTC, IBIT is structured for simplicity, with no additional overlays or quirks.\nFor more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link.\nWhat this means for investors\nThese are the two largest spot bitcoin ETFs available to investors, but IBIT is far and away the largest at around $65 billion in assets under management. FBTC is a distant second with about $17.7 billion.\nThere really is no difference in holdings, as both are 100% invested in bitcoin and have basically identical returns. Both are down about 16.3% year-to-date and 26% over the past 12 months, as of Feb. 4.\nThe similarities don\u2019t end there, as the two ETFs carry the same expense ratio of 0.25%. IBIT had a lower ratio to start, but it is now 0.25% for new investors.\nAdvertisement\nSo, what, if anything, would give the edge to one of these ETFs over the other? Obviously, if you are a Fidelity brokerage customer, it would be more convenient to buy on the Fidelity platform and have custody handled in-house. It would also be kept with your other investments.\nThe advantage IBIT has is that it provides greater liquidity from significantly more trading volume. This typically results in lower trading costs and faster trade execution.\nSo, in reality, there is not a huge difference between the two aside from convenience for Fidelity brokerage customers and the liquidity edge for the iShares ETF.\nShould you buy stock in Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Fid"

Without live prices, the protocol wouldn\u2019t know when the asset is becoming risky, when it needs adjustment, or when it needs to be liquidated to protect the lending pool.\nTokenized equities (as opposed to passive investments) are now available for use on a DeFi protocol because they have real numbers on which it can establish rules for borrowing, collateral limits, and liquidation thresholds.\nOndo also said the tokenized stocks remain aligned with the real value of the equities they represent because the price feeds include updates like dividends and other corporate charges. This keeps tokens up to date, so DeFi apps can use the latest values that reflect what is happening in traditional stock markets.\nThe first group of supported tokenized equities is SPYon, representing the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, QQQon, representing the Invesco QQQ ETF, and TSLAon, representing Tesla stock. Ondo said they will add more tokenized stocks and ETFs with time as Chainlink covers more options and as DeFi protocols start integrating these assets.\nEuler now lets people borrow stablecoins by using Ondo\u2019s tokenized stocks as collateral.\nUsers on the modular lending platform Euler can now use Ondo\u2019s tokenized US stocks as collateral in a DeFi lending market and even borrow stablecoins against them. People can use these tokenized equities to unlock liquidity on Ethereum instead of just holding them to watch the price move.\nIt\u2019s the first time people can use tokenized stocks as collateral in Ethereum-based lending, because users usually buy them for exposure but never use them as crypto assets like ETH or stablecoins.\nUntil now, tokenized real-world assets have been purely passive. Investors could hold a tokenized version of a stock and track its price, but they could not borrow against it, leverage it, or use it to generate income as traditional finance allows. In traditional finance, stocks are often used as collateral for loans, and Ondo wants to make this available in DeFi.\nNow, Ondo believes that the pieces are finally coming together. Tokenized stocks can begin to behave like true building blocks in decentralized finance, with strong liquidity driven by traditional stock exchanges, and Chainlink providing reliable on-chain price feeds.\nCEO of Euler, Jonathan Han, said users can now borrow against securities instead of selling them and giving up long-term profits.\nOf course, good markets require good risk management, especially when new forms of collateral are used. So Ondo said the Senator will set and monitor critical safety limits, such as collateral requirements, liquidation levels, and borrowing limits, to ensure the system remains stable even when markets become volatile.\nSentora CEO Anthony Demartino said retail investors didn\u2019t have the freedom to use their securities before, but they can now use their assets productively while maintaining their long-term investments through tokenization.\nOndo also made it clear that lending is just the first step, as it plans to expand tokenized equities into vaults, structured products, and broader DeFi applications.\nSo, eventually, Ondo\u2019s toke"

Let\u2019s check it out!\nSolana: The High Speed Casino Crushing On Volume\nSolana\u2019s always been the speed demon of blockchains. It processes thousands of transactions per second with that Proof-of-History magic.\nIt\u2019s a timestamp system that lets validators agree on order without endless chit-chat. We\u2019ve seen it handle 65,000 TPS in tests, way faster than Ethereum\u2019s base layer. Think of it like this. It\u2019s like a Ferrari on a racetrack, blazing past competitors when the network\u2019s humming.\nThis is powered by an intelligent routing system on Solana\u2019s blazing-fast blockchain\u2014a true game-changer that could redefine the standard for on-chain payments forever! \ud83d\ude80\nSolana dominates nearly every test with its insane ~65,000 theoretical TPS, sub-second finality (~400ms\u2026\n\u2014 ChainX (@FreedomXTech) December 13, 2025\nThat said, outages have bitten us before.

RSI as are most of the oscillator indicators on TradingView are neutral. And that\u2019s OK for now. It also means sentiment isn\u2019t that great and it could be a bargain for a long-term buy at this price.\nSui: Making the Most of Move\nSui flips the script with its object-centric model using Move language.\nIt\u2019s like combining the Rust language\u2019s safety with parallel execution. No more global state bottlenecks like Ethereum or even Solana.\nIt shards data so transactions process independently, hitting 297,000 TPS in lab tests late 2025. Why does this matter? It\u2019s like upgrading from a single-lane highway to infinite parallel lanes. No traffic jams during peaks. And remember, sharding is Ethereum\u2019s ultimate goal for scalability. Sui does it already.\nSui\u2019s Mysticeti consensus achieves up to 297k TPS in tests, outpacing Aptos\u2019 13k mainnet peak, though real-time averages are similar at ~25 tx/s for both; Sui leads in TVL at $2.6B vs Aptos\u2019 $0.5B as of 2026.\nA purple monkey horse hybrid logically combines primate agility with\u2026\n\u2014 Grok (@grok) January 18, 2026\nThe ecosystem\u2019s maturing fast.

Attention now shifts to planned USDC rate futures tied to onchain borrowing costs.\nWhat to know:\n- Intercontinental Exchange has begun trading cash-settled cryptocurrency futures tied to seven CoinDesk indices, including broad-market and single-asset contracts for bitcoin, ether, solana, XRP and BNB.\n- The new futures are dollar-settled and aimed at institutions seeking crypto price exposure without the operational and custody challenges of holding tokens directly.\n- ICE plans to introduce One Month CoinDesk Overnight Rates USDC futures, pending regulatory review, to bring decentralized finance-style onchain interest rates into regulated markets and expand crypto\u2019s role as a funding and credit market.\nHONG KONG \u2014 Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, began trading a new set of cryptocurrency futures tied to CoinDesk benchmarks earlier this week with plans to bring onchain interest rates into regulated markets next.\nThe contracts went live on Monday after being announced Jan. 9, ICE said, offering cash-settled, U.S. dollar denominated futures linked to seven CoinDesk indices.\nThat includes broad-market products tied to the CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 5 indices, alongside single-asset futures tracking bitcoin, ether, solana, XRP and BNB.\nBecause they settle in dollars rather than delivering tokens, the products are aimed at institutions that want price exposure without the operational and custody friction of spot crypto.\nUp next is ICE\u2019s stated plan to list One Month CoinDesk Overnight Rates USDC futures, subject to regulatory review, the companies said in a press release.\nThese products are designed to reflect the annualized effective interest rate paid by borrowers in decentralized finance markets, a crypto-native analogue to the way traditional markets trade expectations around overnight benchmarks such as SOFR \u2014 which serves as a reference interest rate that helps financial experts price loans and other dollar-based financial products.\nSuch rates products shift the conversation toward crypto as a funding and credit market, where traders can express views on borrowing costs and liquidity conditions rather than only whether bitcoin goes up or down.\nICE also pointed to the scale already built around CoinDesk indices, saying tens of billions of dollars are tied to the benchmarks. The CoinDesk 20, ICE said, is designed to represent most of the digital asset market through a capped market-cap weighted methodology.\nMore For You\nTrump-linked WLFI's Zak Folkman teases forex platform at Consensus Hong Kong\nFolkman says more details will be revealed soon at an event at Mar-a-Lago.\nWhat to know:\n- World Liberty Financial, a Trump-family-linked crypto project, plans to launch a foreign exchange platform called World Swap as part of its USD1 stablecoin ecosystem.\n- Co-founder Zak Folkman said World Swap aims to simplify cross-border transfers and challenge traditional remittance providers that charge fees of 2% to 10% per transaction.\n- The company is building a broader financial stack around its cash-backed USD1 stablecoin, including the recently launched World Liberty Markets lending platform, which has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in deposits."

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is locked in a tense, emotional phase \u2013 not a euphoric melt-up, not a full-blown panic crash, but a nervous, choppy battlefield where every macro headline from Frankfurt or Berlin triggers sharp intraday swings. German blue chips are trading in a wide, volatile range, with recurring spikes of profit taking followed by aggressive dip-buying from global funds that still see Europe as a discounted play versus the U.S.\nWant to see what people are saying?

To understand the opportunity and the risk, you need to zoom out beyond the candles and look at the big levers: the ECB, the euro, German industry, and institutional flows.\n1. ECB Policy: Why Christine Lagarde is basically your 41st DAX stock\nThe European Central Bank is the dominant narrative driver for the DAX. Every sentence from Christine Lagarde and her colleagues is currently interpreted through one question: will Europe stay in a prolonged stagnation zone, or is a monetary-policy-backed rebound brewing?\nThe ECB has already shifted from ultra-aggressive inflation fighting to a more cautious, data-dependent stance. Markets are constantly repricing how many cuts are coming and how fast. That repricing is what you see in the DAX: when traders think the ECB will ease sooner, German exporters and rate-sensitive cyclicals catch a strong bid; when the tone sounds more hawkish, the index quickly slides as recession worries resurface.\nThe euro / USD correlation amplifies this. When the euro weakens versus the dollar, German exporters look relatively more attractive because their products become more competitive abroad and foreign revenues translate into more euros. That tends to support the DAX, especially its industrial, chemical, and auto heavyweights. When the euro strengthens on hopes of a more robust European recovery or a less aggressive Fed, the DAX can face short-term pressure as the currency headwind bites, especially if global risk appetite is already shaky.\nSo the game plan many institutions are playing is simple:\n- If ECB guidance tilts toward looser policy while the Fed stays cautious, euro softness plus cheaper money in Europe can create a powerful backdrop for a German equity rebound.\n- If the ECB stays nervous about inflation and delays cuts while growth data stays weak, the DAX remains in a vulnerable, headline-driven chop zone where rallies are sold and dip-buying is more tactical than long term.\nThis is why you cannot trade the DAX as a closed German story. You are trading the spread between ECB and Fed expectations, plus the euro FX chart, every single day.\n2. Sector Check: German Autos vs. Tech and Industrials \u2013 the internal tug-of-war\nThe next big piece of the puzzle is the internal sector rotation within the DAX. On one side you have the classic German auto giants and old-economy exporters. On the other, more scalable, higher-margin players like SAP and industrial tech champions such as Siemens.\nAutos: VW, BMW, Mercedes \u2013 from national pride to macro headache\nThe German auto industry is under enormous structural and cyclical pressure:\n- EV transition: Legacy internal combustion businesses are still significant cash cows, but EV competition from the U.S. and especially China is brutal. Margin pressure is intense, and markets are questioning long-term "

Not a euphoric melt-up, not a panic crash\u2014more like a mature, tactical market where every dip and every spike is getting faded fast by pros.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch in-depth YouTube breakdowns of the latest DAX 40 setups\n- Scroll Instagram for fresh German stock market mood and chart posts\n- Binge viral TikTok clips on live DAX trading strategies\nThe Story: The DAX 40 right now is a classic push-and-pull battlefield: macro headwinds from the ECB and weak German manufacturing versus structural strength from global champions like SAP and Siemens, plus global flows quietly rotating back into Europe.\nOn the macro level, the European Central Bank under Christine Lagarde is the main puppet master. Inflation in the euro area has cooled from the extreme levels of the energy crisis, but it has not disappeared. That keeps the ECB in this awkward middle lane: they cannot slash rates aggressively like traders would love, but they also cannot stay ultra-hawkish without choking an already fragile German economy.\nThe key for DAX traders: every hint from Lagarde about future rate paths can become a catalyst. When the ECB sounds slightly more dovish\u2014talking about softening inflation trends or acknowledging weak growth\u2014German equities tend to catch a bid, because lower yields boost valuations and soften the pressure on cyclical sectors like autos and industrials. When the language tilts more hawkish\u2014focused on persistent inflation or warning about premature easing\u2014the DAX tends to wobble as bond yields rise and risk appetite cools.\nThen there is the Euro vs. US Dollar. This FX pair is absolutely crucial. A softer euro usually helps the DAX because so many German giants are export machines. A weaker euro makes their products cheaper abroad and inflates their foreign earnings when converted back into euros. Conversely, a strong euro is basically a hidden tax on exporters and a headwind for profit margins. Recently, the euro has been moving in a choppy sideways-to-soft pattern against the dollar, reflecting uncertainty about who cuts rates faster: the ECB or the Fed.\nThat tug-of-war creates a weird but tradeable environment for the DAX: not a screaming bull trend based on massive stimulus, but a rolling, tactical market where each macro data point (inflation prints, PMI data, Fed speeches, ECB minutes) can flip the short-term direction. Add in the fact that US markets still dominate global sentiment: if the S&P 500 wobbles, the DAX often reacts immediately, regardless of domestic German news.\nOn CNBC Europe and across financial media, the narrative right now is dominated by three themes that DAX traders simply cannot ignore:\n- Lingering recession fears in Germany and the eurozone, with growth indicators showing fatigue rather than acceleration.\n- Persistent weakness in German manufacturing PMIs, signaling contraction or at best stagnation in the industrial backbone of Europe.\n- Energy prices that have come down from crisis peaks, but remain structurally elevated and volatile compared to the pre-2020 era, especially for heavy industry.\nThis mix leads to a market that is not priced for disaster but also not fully buying a strong recovery story. In other words: the perfect playground for active traders.\nDeep Dive Analysis: Let's talk about the elephant in the German room: the automotive sector.

No clean moonshot, no catastrophic collapse\u2014just a nervous, choppy range where every rally feels suspicious and every dip gets hunted by aggressive dip-buyers. German blue chips are trading like they are testing important zones, with price action swinging between cautious optimism and sudden risk-off waves.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh DAX breakdowns from top YouTube traders\n- Scroll the latest German stock market mood on Instagram\n- Binge fast-paced DAX trading strategies on TikTok\nThe Story: What is actually driving this weird, fragile DAX environment? Let\u2019s unpack the real macro story behind German stocks, because this is not just a chart game\u2014this is ECB policy, energy prices, global flows, and an industrial model under pressure.\n1. ECB Policy \u2013 Christine Lagarde vs. Reality\nThe European Central Bank is walking a tightrope. Inflation in the eurozone has been easing, but it is still sticky enough to keep the ECB in a cautious stance. That means: no wild dovish pivot, but also no appetite to crush the economy further. Lagarde is basically trying to look tough on inflation while quietly praying that growth does not fall off a cliff.\nFor the DAX 40, this is critical. When traders see a central bank in this kind of \"wait and see\" mode, two things happen:\n- Rate cut expectations get traded aggressively in advance.\n- Every ECB press conference becomes a volatility event for German equities.\nEuro vs. USD \u2013 The Currency Cheat Code\nThe euro vs. the US dollar is another hidden driver. When the euro weakens against the dollar, German exporters suddenly look more competitive on the global stage. Their products become cheaper in dollar terms, which can support earnings for the big industrials and automakers. That\u2019s why a softer euro often lines up with supportive underlying flows into the DAX\u2014even if headlines are pessimistic.\nBut this cuts both ways. A stronger euro, triggered by expectations that the ECB will stay tighter for longer than the Fed, can act like a headwind for earnings. In that environment, the DAX can look fragile even if the charts still show a grinding uptrend. Right now, traders are stuck in this push-pull environment: central-bank watchers vs. macro bears vs. earnings optimists.\n2. Sector Check \u2013 Autos Under Pressure, Tech and Industrials Holding the Line\nThe DAX is not the S&P 500. It is not a pure tech index. It is old-school Europe: autos, industry, chemicals, financials\u2014with a few modern heavyweights like SAP trying to drag it into the digital age.\nGerman Auto Industry: From Superstar to Problem Child\nVolkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz Group and their extended ecosystem used to be the unstoppable engine of the DAX. Now, they sit at the center of every structural risk narrative:\n- China dependence: German automakers are deeply exposed to China, a market where local EV makers are stepping up with cheaper, aggressively subsidized, tech-savvy models.\n- EV transition: Legacy combustion platforms, huge capex for EVs, and brutal competition from Tesla and Chinese brands create margin pressure and execution risk.\n- Regulation and climate policy: European emissions rules are constantly tightening, forcing more investment into new drivetrains and tech, squeezing profitability.\n- Consumer sentiment: With weak German and European growth, big-ticket car purchases can be delayed\u2014bad news for order books.\nThis cocktail leaves the auto segment in the DAX looking vulnerable.

The report signaled a resilience in the labor market despite showing a heavily revised picture for last year, but it also bolstered the case for interest rates to stay on hold for the foreseeable future.\nThe blue chip-focused Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.1% to retreat from its record high, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped below the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%.\n(^DJI)\nAfter a bruising recent run of labor market data, the unexpectedly strong \"Super Bowl of jobs reports\" showed the US economy added 130,000 positions in January, Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed on Wednesday. The unemployment rate ticked down slightly to 4.3% from 4.4%.\nHowever, the bullish monthly data was counterbalanced by heavy revisions to 2025 numbers, which brought the year's payrolls growth at 181,000, down from the previously reported 584,000 additions. That represents the weakest annual job growth since 2003, outside of a recession.\nWednesday's surprise is feeding into bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts, which had been bolstered by soft December retail data that revealed fresh signs of weakness in the economy. Markets are now pricing in a bigger possibility that the Fed will hold rates steady in the coming months, with over 40% expecting the central bank to now stand pat through June. Most traders are still pricing in two cuts by the end of the year.\nEarnings season could provide further insight into the American consumer as well as Corporate America, with McDonald's (MCD) reporting after the bell, while Kraft Heinz (KHC) said in its earnings release Tuesday morning that it would pause its spin-off plans.\nAfter the market close, Cisco's (CSCO) quarterly report comes as the tech stalwart takes on Nvidia (NVDA) for Big Tech spending with a new AI networking chip.\nLIVE 20 updatesModerna stock plunges after FDA refuses to review influenza vaccine application\nReuters reports:"

Record also oversaw the development of the college\u2019s sponsored pediatrics residency; the continued expansion of the Internal Medicine Residency in Everett at Providence Regional Medical Center; the Family Medicine Residency at Pullman Regional Hospital; and the launch of a new critical care medicine fellowship.\n\u201cIt has been an indescribable honor to serve both WSU and the communities of Washington,\u201d said Record. \u201cCommunity-based healthcare is a critical need here and across the country. The opportunity to help our amazing team build a college rooted in service to our most deserving and under-resourced communities has been the most meaningful work of my professional life. Our community partners are incredibly collaborative, and the partnerships we have created are changing lives in Washington and beyond. I am committed to Coug Nation and excited to continue to partner with Provost Riley-Tillman and the health sciences leadership team as we shape the future of medical education and clinical care at WSU. I am proud to remain a Coug and excited to continue teaching the next generation of Coug doctors.\u201d\nBefore joining WSU, Record served as provost and chief academic officer at Ross University School of Medicine and as dean of the Chicago Medical School.

Katsumi is set to open for dinner on Thursday, February 12, replacing its short-lived predecessor Bar Japonais (1520 14th Street NW).\nD.C.\u2019s Hottest New Sushi Place Debuts in a Familiar Space\nMeet Katsumi, the restaurant formerly known as Bar Japonais\nThe Rhythm & Eats team quietly closed its \u201cneo-fusion\u201d izakaya Bar Japonais along the tony nightlife corridor in late 2025 to figure out what they wanted for the space. For its new life as Katsumi, there\u2019s a laser-lens focus on Japanese food in a more intimate atmosphere that includes half the seat count (65, down from over 100) and DJ vibes on weekends.\n\u201cWhen we opened Japonais as a French-Japanese concept, we only had a little bit of sushi,\u201d partner Dean Mosones tells Eater. \u201cWe are now focused on just being a Japanese restaurant.\u201d\nKatsumi fills somewhat of a raw-fish void left behind on the strip when celebrity chef Michael Schlow\u2019s Nama Ko flopped fast in 2024.\nAt its core, the rebrand capitalizes on the stellar slice skills of its executive chef, Masaaki \u201cUchi\u201d Uchino, who came on board a year ago with credentials at Michelin-starred places like Sushi Nakazawa (first in New York, then in D.C.).\nDespite his classical training, the Fukuoka-born chef\u2019s not afraid to stray away from tradition. Toro caviar sashimi with cucumber, and teriyaki, for instance, arrives with truffle oil \u2014 a somewhat unconventional ingredient in Japanese cuisine. Saba (mackerel), uni (sea urchin), and hotate (scallop) make cameos in nigiri and sashimi when the season is right.\n\u201cWe upped the game \u2014 a lot of new items are traditional, modern, but unexpected,\u201d says Mosones, pointing to A5 beef carpaccio as a solid new starter.\nMeanwhile, maki options include a sour cream-and-onion roll with osetra caviar, black porgy, and potato.\nHot dishes \u2014 partitioned into meat, seafood, and vegetarian sections \u2013 include pork katsu senbei with panko, shichimi, and tonkatsu; lobster tail koganeyaki with chives and spicy aioli; gyoza with beef and cabbage; and a five-mushroom medley sauteed in teriyaki.\nAt Bar Japonais 2.0 (Katsumi), the group netted a big fish as its general manager: Andra \u201cAJ\u201d Johnson, a hospitality vet and 2025 James Beard semifinalist (for Outstanding Cocktail Service), who more recently led the bar at Serenata.\nThe bar program also dials into more Japanese ingredients and influences. The multi-toned Matcha Mood, for instance, is a yuzu-vodka drink layered with strawberry.\nOther drinks include the Nitoro Kohi, a Japanese take on the espresso martini with vodka, nitro cold brew, shochu, Okinawan sugar, and Benedictine; and the Anko-Iada, a blend of rum, mango, pineapple, adzuki bean, and coconut milk.\nThere\u2019s also an expansive sake list that includes rarities by the bottle. Bar Japonais\u2019s minimalist look of matte-black surfaces and a stark central bar composed of cement provided a ready-to-wear canvas for Katsumi. \u201cWe wanted to give the restaurant some personality to reflect the new menu,\u201d he says.\nSee: lots of neon-lit signage inside spilling into the street, moody murals, and pops of color throughout.\nKatsumi will be the place to see and be seen come Friday and Saturday nights, when the front half flips into a music-oriented venture outfitted with plush new lounge seating.\nBar Chinois, the team\u2019s original spot that started it all in Mt. Vernon Triangle, continues to enjoy a devoted following for its dumplings, Frenchified cocktails, and small plates from happy hour until late. A second Bar Chinois popped across the Potomac last year in Arlington."

                "body": "Risk sentiment was mixed in Asia today as Japan returned from holiday with Nikkei extending its post-election surge and briefly breaching the 58,000 mark for the first time on record. The breakout, however, lacked follow-through, with the index quickly trimming gains and hinting that near-term momentum may be stretched. Elsewhere in the region, trading was subdued. Broader Asian markets mirrored the near-flat close in the US overnight.\nIn currency markets, Yen remains the standout performer, extending its rally. The move partly reflects repeated official vigilance over currency volatility. Japan\u2019s top currency diplomat, Atsushi Mimura, issued fresh warnings today. While declining to comment on speculation over rate checks following US employment data, he stressed that authorities are maintaining a \u201chigh sense of urgency\u201d and have \u201cnot lowered our guard at all.\u201d Mimura also confirmed that Tokyo remains in close contact with US authorities, reinforcing the perception that officials are prepared to act jointly if volatility becomes excessive.\nTechnically, the breach of near-term Fibonacci support in both EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY suggests that Yen\u2019s reversal may be gaining traction. However, confirmation would require USD/JPY to break corresponding support levels to solidify the broader trend shift.\nFor Dollar, the boost from stronger-than-expected US payrolls proved short-lived. While the report effectively cemented expectations that the Fed will hold rates steady in March, it did little to firm up pricing for June. Attention now turns to January CPI data due tomorrow. A single inflation print may trigger volatility, but unless it materially shifts the inflation outlook, it is unlikely to establish a durable trend in Fed expectations.\nIn the US fiscal backdrop, January\u2019s deficit narrowed compared to a year earlier as tariff collections surged. Customs duties reached USD30 billion for the month, lifting fiscal year-to-date revenue to USD124 billion \u2014 more than triple the level seen over the same period in 2025.\nHowever, legal and political risks around tariffs remain elevated. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on challenges to the legal basis for the measures, keeping concerns that an adverse decision could force reimbursement of collected duties. Meanwhile, the House narrowly passed a resolution opposing tariffs on Canada, though any legislative reversal is unlikely given the high bar required to override a presidential veto.\nOn performance, Dollar remains the weakest currency of the week so far, followed by Sterling, which is awaiting UK GDP data. Euro is the third-worst performer. Yen leads gains, followed by Aussie and Loonie, while Swiss Franc and Kiwi trade mid-pack.\nIn Asia, at the time of writing, Nikkei is up 0.24%. Hong Kong HSI is down -0.89%. China Shanghai SSE is up 0.12%. Singapore Strait Times is up 0.63%. Japan 10-year JGB yield is down -0.02 at 2.217. Overnight, DOW fell -0.13% S&P fell -0.00%. NASDAQ fell -0.16%. 10-year yield rose 0.025 to 4.172.\nJapan PPI eases to 2.3%, but import costs accelerate\nJapan\u2019s producer price index slowed slightly to 2.3% year-on-year in January from 2.4%, matching expectations and suggesting pipeline price pressures are stabilizing. The moderation came despite sharp divergences across components.\nFuel prices dropped -12.9% yoy, providing a significant drag on overall wholesale inflation. In contrast, nonferrous metal prices surged 33%, while agricultural goods rose 22.4%. Food and beverage prices also remained elevated, increasing 4.7% from a year earlier, highlighting persistent cost pressures in parts of the supply chain.\nMeanwhile, Yen-based import prices climbed 0.5% yoy, up from a 0.2% gain in December. Despite a recent rebound in the currency, Yen\u2019s broader weakness over recent months has raised the cost of imported energy and raw materials.\nRBA\u2019s Bullock says inflation above 3% \u201cunacceptable,\u201d keeps door open to more hikes\nRBA Governor Michele Bullock reinforced the hawkish stance"

Since Takaichi began her ascent to become Japan's first female premier in October, the \"Takaichi trade\" has pushed domestic shares to successive record highs while spurring declines in JGBs and the yen. Takaichi reiterated on Monday that she was committed to \"responsible, proactive fiscal policy.\"\n\"Following recent strong earnings results and the LDP's landslide victory under the Takaichi administration, the market has been on a significant upward trend,\" Wataru Akiyama, a strategist at Nomura Securities, said about domestic shares. \"The sense of overheating seems to be intensifying, so profit-taking movements could emerge from here on.\" Takaichi is sensitive to how markets react to her decisions, particularly yen and JGB yield moves, two sources told Reuters. The yen rallied on Thursday after top currency diplomat Atsushi Mimura issued a fresh warning against currency volatility, and mentioned speculation about rate checks, a typical precursor to actual market intervention.\nLong-dated securities led a rally in JGBs on Thursday, while the yen touched a two-week high of 152.28 per dollar.\nThe yen's surprising strength has sprung out of Takaichi's ability to secure a solid majority in the lower house and end concerns about political instability that had lingered since July last year, said Hirofumi Suzuki, chief foreign-exchange strategist at SMBC.\n\"This suggests that short positions in the yen have been unwound,\" Suzuki added. There were 150 advancers on the Nikkei index against 74 decliners. Honda Motor was among the bigger losers, slumping 3.3% after the automaker posted a 61% drop in third-quarter profit after market hours on Tuesday.\nResults from SoftBank Group after the bell on Thursday will be closely watched for details on how it will fund its massive investments in AI.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
