                "body": "Gold deposit accounts surge in turkey as people try to cope with runaway inflation\nWhat do you do if the government is relentlessly devaluing your money?\nSave in gold.\nThat\u2019s exactly what people in Turkey are doing.\nAccording to data from the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK), gold deposit accounts in Turkish banks surged by 99.1 percent year-over-year in the third quarter.\nTurkish gold bank deposits now total 2.72 trillion liras. In Q3 2024, gold deposits totaled 1.36 trillion liras.\nWhile gold accounted for around 8 percent of total Turkish bank deposits last year, its share grew to 11 percent at the close of Q3 \u201925. Out of the 24.85 trillion liras in total bank deposits collected in the first nine months of the year, 2.72 trillion liras were in gold.\nThe majority of these gold deposit accounts (91.3 percent) are held by individuals, with corporate accounts representing just 8.7 percent of the total.\nA gold deposit counts are typically denominated in grams of gold. Turkey ranks as one of the most developed countries in the world when it comes to gold deposit accounts. For instance, Kuveyt T\u00fcrk offers gold deposit accounts with a minimum transaction limit of 0.01 grams. Account holders can buy or sell gold using Turkish lira, dollars, or euros.\nMost gold deposit accounts at conventional banks in Turkey are unallocated book-entry claims on the bank and do not imply a promise to give you specific gold bars. Many accounts don\u2019t allow physical delivery of metal at all.\nIn practice, gold deposit accounts are a convenient way to buy and sell gold without handling the metal. It also allows people to buy fractional amounts of gold. However, these deposit accounts have a higher level of counterparty risk than buying and holding gold yourself.\nGold: A safe haven for inflationary times\nTurks are saving in real money - gold - to avoid the ravages of price inflation.\nTurkish CPI began to spike in 2021, averaging 19 to 20 percent. By 2022, the Turkish economy was nearing hyperinflation status, with the average CPI spiking to 72 percent. It peaked that year between 85 and 86 percent.\nAlthough price inflation eased somewhat in 2023, \u201ccooling\u201d to an average of around 54 percent, before reaccelerating again in 2024. By October of this year, Turkish CPI was still running around 33 percent.\nWhy this sustained surge of inflationary pressure?\nAs always, blame the government and a fiat money system that is backed by nothing.\nLike their counterparts in the U.S., Turkish central bankers cut interest rates and engaged in money printing, despite rising inflation. President Recep Erdo\u011fan even claimed high interest rates cause inflation, a notion counter to standard monetary theory.\nThis loose monetary policy drove real interest rates deeply negative. This incentivized people to dump lira for dollars, euros, or hard assets like gold.\nThis wasn\u2019t merely a case of a policy misstep. It was intentional. The Turkish government used cheap credit and heavy spending to support economic growth in the run-up to national elections. The government implemented voter-friendly policies, including early retirement for over 2 million workers, repeated minimum wage hikes, and large public-sector pay rises. While this helped households struggling with rising prices, it also Fed inflationary pressures \u2013 not unlike U.S. stimulus during the pandemic.\nFrom the government's standpoint, this isn't a bug in the fiat money system. It's a feature. Governments want money backed by nothing because it imposes no restraints on its spending. It's precisely why the U.S. began abandoning the gold standard during Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and President Nixon severed the last link between the dollar and gold.\nHowever, inflation is always the result of this monetary malfeasance.\nThe government doesn't care, as long as inflation doesn't get to the point that you notice it. This is why central banks created the 2 percent target. There's nothing magical about 2 perc"

                "body": "The OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for November 2025 was published recently. The last month reported in most of the OPEC charts that follow is October 2025 and output reported for OPEC nations is crude oil output in thousands of barrels per day (kb/d). In the OPEC charts below the blue line with markers is monthly output and the thin red line is the centered twelve month average (CTMA) output.\nOPEC 12 output for September 2025 was revised lower by 13 kb/d and August 2025 output was revised lower by 3 kb/d compared to last month\u2019s report. OPEC 12 output increased by 33 kb/d with the largest increases from Saudi Arabia (43 kb/d), Kuwait (37 kb/d), Iraq (34 kb/d) and Nigeria (15 kb/d). Iran (-66 kb/d) and Libya (-30 kb/d) saw decreased crude output. All other OPEC members had small increases or decreases of 7 kb/d or less. Combined output from the other 6 members increased by 2 kb/d in October from the September level.\nThe chart above shows output from the Big 4 OPEC producers that are subject to output quotas and where most of OPEC spare capacity currently exists (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, and Kuwait.) After the pandemic, Big 4 average output peaked in 2022 at a centered 12 month average (CTMA) of 20849 kb/d, crude output has been cut by 835 kb/d relative to the 2022 CTMA peak to 20014 kb/d in October 2025. The Big 4 may have about 835 kb/d of spare capacity when World demand calls for an increase in output. Since April 2025 the OPEC Big 4 have increased output from 18346 kb/d to 20014 kb/d, an increase of 1668 kb/d in just 6 months (an average monthly increase of 278 kb/d.) If the rate of increase of last month for the Big 4 (121 kb/d) continues in the future, OPEC spare capacity would run out in about 7 months. Perhaps this is part of the reason that future increases after December 2025 have been put on hold as spare capacity will be down to about 595 kb/d by the end of 2025 (assuming a 240 kb/d increase in output by the Big 4 over the next 2 months.)\nThe chart above shows the most recent 36 month average annual increase of 137 kb/d for the Other 6 OPEC group which excludes the Big 4 and Iran and Venezuela. Iran and Venezuela have seen their output rise over the past 3 years at an annual rate of 364 kb/d which I believe will fall to zero in the near future. The chart below shows the long term trend for the OPEC Other 6 which is roughly flat (a small average annual rate of decrease of 0.75 kb/d) over the past 11 years. I expect the Other 6 will see their output return to this flat trend in the next few years.\nThe only change in the production/demand balance from last month\u2019s MOMR is a 100 kb/d increase in the forecast for Non-DOC liquids production in 2025, this reduces the increase in the call on OPEC by the same amount because the demand forecast is unchanged from last month\u2019s report.\nRefinery crude throughput is a measure of World demand for C+C (though imperfect because some crude is burned directly in power plants in the Middle East.) OPEC data shows the previous peak was 81.68 Mb/d in 2018. For the most recent 4 quarters (ending 2025Q3) the average World refinery throughput was 81.77 Mb/d, a new annual average peak and a significant revision from last month\u2019s report at 81.34 Mb/d for the same 4 quarters.\nFrom the November MOMR:\nPreliminary September 2025 data show that OECD commercial inventories rose by 6.0 Mb, m-o-m, to stand at 2,845 Mb. At this level, OECD commercial stocks were 37.7 Mb higher than at the same time last year, but 22.4 Mb lower than the latest five-year average, and 122.3 Mb below the 2015\u20132019 average.\nOPEC has reduced its estimate of US tight oil output in 2025 and 2026 compared to last month\u2019s report by 10 kb/d for both years. Also the estimate for 2024 increased by 10 kb/d compared to last month\u2019s report (in line with data from the EIA), so the increase in tight oil output from 2024 to 2025 is 20 kb/d lower than last month\u2019s report while the decrease in tight oil forecast from 2025 to 2026 is"

To wit, ICE Brent-Gasoil crack spreads doubled from the $15-17/bbl range held in the first half of the year, to a 21-month high above $32/bbl, good for a nearly 70% increase in the year-to-date. Gasoil is a middle distillate mainly used in commercial and agricultural sectors for off-road vehicles, machinery, and generators. And now reports have emerged that the distillates market continues to tighten even as crude prices remain weak. According to new data by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), gasoline inventories clocked in at 205.06 million barrels (mb) for the week ending 7th November, 8.2mb lower than the five-year average and the lowest level in 12 years.\nFor consumers across the U.S., fuel costs continue to edge higher. Gasoline prices have seen modest gains over the past year, while diesel has climbed by roughly 25 cents per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association. Regional differences remain wide, but diesel remains under particular strain as U.S. distillate inventories \u2014 including diesel and heating oil \u2014 have dropped to their lowest levels in more than a decade. The decline stems from stronger export demand to Europe, reduced refinery capacity, and limited stockpiling ahead of winter. While the Energy Information Administration expects diesel prices to stabilize somewhat in 2026, they are likely to stay elevated compared to historical averages.\nU.S. distillate inventories were 110.91 million barrels, 9.3mb below the five-year average and close to the bottom of their five-year range. U.S. distillate inventories are now at the lowest level since mid-July as we move into the high-demand winter season, which should continue to support product strength. Meanwhile, strength in product cracks continues, with the ICE gasoil-Brent crack now exceeding $34 per barrel (bbl), the highest level since September 2023. The price differential has now stayed above $30/bbl for 10 trading days.\nOil markets, on the other hand, continue to be weak and dominated by bearish supply sentiment, with recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure failing to give oil prices a significant boost. Brent crude for December delivery was trading at $63.32/bbl at 12 pm ET on Wednesday, less than a dollar higher from a week ago, while the corresponding WTI contract was changing hands at $59.28/bbl, up from $58.26/bbl seven days ago. Last week, the port of Novorossiysk, in Krasnodar Krai, was targeted by Ukrainian missiles and drones, with a focus on the Sheskharis oil terminal. The giant terminal has an export capacity of ~2.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), and loadings were suspended for two days. Ukraine\u2019s attacks on Russia\u2019s Black Sea export terminals have, however, highlighted the vulnerability of exports via the southern route.\nRelated: A Trend Break? EIA Sees Jump in Alaska Oil Production in 2026\nAccording to commodity analysts at Standard Chartered, this is particularly important, with the weather closing down the Northern Sea Route via the Arctic over the winter. The winter transit routes to Asia will then be limited to the Suez Canal, taking 10 days longer on average. These longer transit routes have contributed to a 294 million barrels Y/Y surge in seaborne crude to an all-time high of 1.37 billion barrels as of 14 November. Russian crude exports have, however, remained relatively steady, although StanChart has predicted they will slow down sharply after the November 21 deadline for sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft kicks in. The sanctions could also be contributing to the large increase in volumes of oil on water.\nU.S. natural gas prices remain elevated, with Henry Hub gas quoted at $4.55/MMBtu in Wednesday\u2019s session, nearly double in the year-to-date.

                "body": "US crude oil production is again defying gravity. Lower crude oil prices and macroeconomic headwinds were expected to slow or even reverse US output growth as the year progressed, with many outlooks foreseeing a peak or plateau of 13.5 million-13.6 million barrels per day. But official monthly figures for August \u2014 the latest available \u2014 show a new record of nearly 13.8 million b/d. Most surprisingly, the continued growth has come even as upstream activity has indeed slowed over the course of the year in response to \u2014 and in anticipation of \u2014 broader market headwinds. Shale activity isn't as price sensitive as it used to be since production increasingly sits in the hands of well-capitalized heavyweights keen to preserve operational efficiencies. But shale is still not as price-agnostic as conventional megaprojects either, and the anticipation of tariff-impaired global demand alongside robust global supply growth compelled operators to plan for lower activity this year. Services giant Baker Hughes shows a 13% year-on-year decline in rigs drilling in the continental US as of mid-November, while consultancy Primary Vision tracks a 17.5% year-on-year decline in frack spreads. Travis Stice, then-CEO of large independent Diamondback Energy, warned in May that projected activity declines made it \"likely that US onshore oil production has peaked and will begin to decline this quarter.\" Instead, Diamondback became one of several Permian Basin producers to raise production guidance, upping its full-year projection by more than 2%. Exxon Mobil, the Permian's largest producer, pumped nearly 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from the play in the third quarter, a 20% year-on-year increase, and sees its Permian growth continuing \"well into the next decade.\" Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices, at $65.45 per barrel, are so far averaging about 13% below their full-year 2024 average above $75/bbl, but have spent much of the past two months below $60/bbl.\nHow US Crude Oil Output Keeps Setting Records\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Energy Intelligence Group All rights reserved.

At this level, OECD commercial stocks were 37.7 Mb higher than at the same time last year, but 22.4 Mb lower than the latest five-year average, and 122.3 Mb below the 2015\u20132019 average.\nOPEC has reduced its estimate of US tight oil output in 2025 and 2026 compared to last month\u2019s report by 10 kb/d for both years.

                "body": "Previously, we reported that the pivot by Indian refiners away from Russian oil has triggered a spike in oil product prices even as crude prices remain largely unchanged. To wit, ICE Brent-Gasoil crack spreads doubled from the $15-17/bbl range held in the first half of the year, to a 21-month high above $32/bbl, good for a nearly 70% increase in the year-to-date. Gasoil is a middle distillate mainly used in commercial and agricultural sectors for off-road vehicles, machinery, and generators. And now reports have emerged that the distillates market continues to tighten even as crude prices remain weak. According to new data by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), gasoline inventories clocked in at 205.06 million barrels (mb) for the week ending 7th November, 8.2mb lower than the five-year average and the lowest level in 12 years.\nFor consumers across the U.S., fuel costs continue to edge higher. Gasoline prices have seen modest gains over the past year, while diesel has climbed by roughly 25 cents per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association. Regional differences remain wide, but diesel remains under particular strain as U.S. distillate inventories \u2014 including diesel and heating oil \u2014 have dropped to their lowest levels in more than a decade. The decline stems from stronger export demand to Europe, reduced refinery capacity, and limited stockpiling ahead of winter. While the Energy Information Administration expects diesel prices to stabilize somewhat in 2026, they are likely to stay elevated compared to historical averages.\nU.S. distillate inventories were 110.91 million barrels, 9.3mb below the five-year average and close to the bottom of their five-year range. U.S. distillate inventories are now at the lowest level since mid-July as we move into the high-demand winter season, which should continue to support product strength. Meanwhile, strength in product cracks continues, with the ICE gasoil-Brent crack now exceeding $34 per barrel (bbl), the highest level since September 2023. The price differential has now stayed above $30/bbl for 10 trading days.\nOil markets, on the other hand, continue to be weak and dominated by bearish supply sentiment, with recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure failing to give oil prices a significant boost. Brent crude for December delivery was trading at $63.32/bbl at 12 pm ET on Wednesday, less than a dollar higher from a week ago, while the corresponding WTI contract was changing hands at $59.28/bbl, up from $58.26/bbl seven days ago. Last week, the port of Novorossiysk, in Krasnodar Krai, was targeted by Ukrainian missiles and drones, with a focus on the Sheskharis oil terminal. The giant terminal has an export capacity of ~2.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), and loadings were suspended for two days. Ukraine\u2019s attacks on Russia\u2019s Black Sea export terminals have, however, highlighted the vulnerability of exports via the southern route.\nRelated: A Trend Break? EIA Sees Jump in Alaska Oil Production in 2026\nAccording to commodity analysts at Standard Chartered, this is particularly important, with the weather closing down the Northern Sea Route via the Arctic over the winter. The winter transit routes to Asia will then be limited to the Suez Canal, taking 10 days longer on average. These longer transit routes have contributed to a 294 million barrels Y/Y surge in seaborne crude to an all-time high of 1.37 billion barrels as of 14 November. Russian crude exports have, however, remained relatively steady, although StanChart has predicted they will slow down sharply after the November 21 deadline for sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft kicks in. The sanctions could also be contributing to the large increase in volumes of oil on water.\nU.S. natural gas prices remain elevated, with Henry Hub gas quoted at $4.55/MMBtu in Wednesday\u2019s session, nearly double in the year-to-date.

                "body": "EUR/USD Remains the Key for FX Market Trends\nThe US Dollar is threatening to break out yet again and the 100.22 level is the price standing in the way. This was the low last year when the Fed started cutting rates, and then became the high in August when DXY reversed on the release of Non-farm Payrolls. More recently, however, that same level held the highs two weeks ago and is back in-play today following a clean bounce from the 98.98 level. Bulls have an open door to make a push here, but perhaps the bigger question is whether EUR/USD can break below it\u2019s own very key level that remains in-play.\nIt was just two weeks ago when the US Dollar was continuing the rate cut rally that sparked from the Fed\u2019s first move of moderation in September. While the announcement of that rate cut brought a fresh three-year low into DXY, Jerome Powell framing it as a \u2018risk management rate cut\u2019 helped to drive a short-term reversal, that soon found more buyers as a push of higher-highs and lows developed into the end of Q3.\nUS Dollar Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nThis isn\u2019t that unusual, however, as this was a clear case of \u2018sell the rumor, buy the news,\u2019 and it was only a year ago that something similar happened. DXY was pummeled for most of Q3 last year, only to bottom at the rate cut announcement, which then led to a strong bullish reversal in Q4. From the side of counterparts, the Euro, which is a whopping 57.6% of the DXY quote, had stalled at the 1.1200 handle as DXY was bottoming around that announcement, and the pair dropped more than 1,000 pips until finally finding some support two weeks into 2025 trade.\nThat support just happened to show at a big spot \u2013 the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2021-2022 major move. And as USD eased in the month of February, helped along by fears of recession driven by the uncertainty around tariffs, both markets broke in March and furthered the move in April. This lasted all the way until around the Easter holiday, when EUR/USD ran into a massive level that finally stalled the advance: The 1.1500 psychological level.\nEUR/USD Daily Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nThere was a lot going on around that April date: Stocks had just set a significant low after SPX went oversold on the weekly chart for only the third time since the Financial Collapse. USD/JPY also set a significant low at the 140.00 handle, right around the same time that EUR/USD put in a test of the 1.1500 handle, which failed to take.\nThe first push above 1.1500 happened on Easter, in which European markets are closed for holiday even as US markets are open. But when Europe came back to work on Tuesday EUR/USD was slammed below the 1.1500 handle as a retracement developed.\nIt took a few weeks and more bearish-USD push to make that 1.1500 break happen which ultimately took place in June; and once it did, getting back below the big figure has proven to be a similar challenge.\nWe had a test below in late-July after the FOMC meeting, but both EUR/USD and USD reversed at the Non-farm Payrolls release. And then two weeks ago, 1.1500 was back in the headlines, and as I warned in the webinar, chasing that move could produce challenges given proximity to the big figure.\nFrom the weekly chart below, we can see where that price has carried a significant role in the way that EUR/USD price action has built.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nAnd then taking a further step back, we can even go back to the two-plus year range from 2015 to 2017 to see how that level has continually functioned as a sticking point. To be sure, it\u2019s not a brick wall, and there have been breaches. There just hasn\u2019t been many clean breaks without at least some testing or stalling at that price before trends were able to continue.\nEUR/USD Monthly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Near-Term Strategy\nAt th"

Traders await preliminary HOCB Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data for November from Germany and the Eurozone due later in the day. Focus will be shifted toward the US S&P Global PMI data later in the North American session.\nThe EUR/USD pair steadies as the US Dollar (USD) eases after a five-day rally, with September jobs data boosting expectations of a Fed rate cut in December. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that financial markets are now pricing in a 36% chance that the Fed will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points (bps) at its December meeting, up from 30% probability that markets priced a day ago.\nNonfarm Payrolls (NFP) in the United States (US) rose by 119,000 in September, compared to the 4,000 decrease (revised from +22,000) recorded in August. This figure surpassed the market expectation of 50,000. The Unemployment Rate ticked up to 4.4% in September from 4.3% in August. The Average Hourly Earnings held steady at 3.8% YoY, compared to the market expectation of 3.7%.\nThe Euro (EUR) maintains its position amid the cautious sentiment surrounding the near-term European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) monetary policy outlook. The ECB is widely expected to keep rates unchanged through the end of 2026, with inflation hovering near its 2% target, stable economic growth, and unemployment at record lows.\nECB Governing Council (GC) member and Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Gabriel Makhlouf, said on Thursday that the current monetary policy is appropriate and any adjustment is unlikely, unless there is a material change.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro.

Traders eye 1.1480\u20131.1410 | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Trades Near 1.1530 as Fed Signals, Weak Eurozone Data, and Mixed U.S. Jobs Numbers Reshape Market Outlook\nThe EUR/USD pair remains under pressure, trading near 1.1530, down from 1.1614 earlier this week, as the U.S. dollar extends its advance following the latest Federal Reserve minutes and a stronger-than-expected U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report. The euro continues to struggle amid weak regional data, softening construction and manufacturing indicators, and renewed uncertainty over the European Central Bank (ECB) policy path. Traders now see limited room for the euro to recover ahead of the Fed\u2019s December 10 meeting, as rate-cut expectations have collapsed from nearly 90% last month to just 34%, leaving the dollar broadly supported across all majors.\nU.S. Labor Data Reinforces Dollar\u2019s Dominance Over EUR/USD\nThe September U.S. jobs report, delayed by the previous government shutdown, delivered mixed signals but confirmed a labor market still tight enough to deter immediate easing. Nonfarm Payrolls rose by 119,000, beating expectations of 50,000, while unemployment climbed to 4.4%, the highest since 2021. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% month-on-month and 3.8% year-on-year, below the prior 0.3% and 3.9%, signaling wage growth moderation. Despite that softening, the Fed\u2019s CME FedWatch data now shows only 39% odds of a December rate cut, down from 50% last week. This repricing boosted the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) to just above 100.00, while the 10-year Treasury yield held firm at 4.12%, underpinning continued capital inflows into dollar assets.\nCleveland Fed President Beth Hammack reinforced this stance, warning that cutting rates too early could \u201cundermine policy credibility and invite financial instability.\u201d Her tone effectively confirmed that the Fed will prioritize inflation control over growth momentum, a message that directly weakens EUR/USD sentiment heading into year-end.\nEurozone Weakness Adds Weight to the Bearish EUR/USD Trend\nAcross the euro area, economic indicators remain broadly disappointing. Eurozone construction output contracted 0.5% month-on-month in September after a 0.3% drop in August, while annual figures also slipped into negative territory. Final consumer price inflation was confirmed at 2.1% headline and 2.4% core, reinforcing the ECB\u2019s stance that rates can stay restrictive. Meanwhile, industrial output in Germany and Italy continues to deteriorate, and consumer sentiment remains negative as high borrowing costs erode household confidence.\nThe ECB\u2019s Luis de Guindos reiterated that inflation could stabilize near target without further rate hikes, suggesting that the next policy shift\u2014if any\u2014will depend on growth data rather than inflation. Yet with Eurozone PMIs hovering near contraction territory (services PMI last at 49.6) and unemployment steady at 6.5%, the region\u2019s limited resilience offers little support to the euro.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD Faces Critical Breakdown Zone at 1.1510\u20131.1480\nThe technical structure of EUR/USD has turned distinctly bearish. The pair remains trapped under a descending trendline from October highs around 1.1650, and repeated closes below the 20-day EMA confirm sellers\u2019 control. The RSI at 31 reflects near-oversold momentum with no bullish divergence, suggesting that downside risks persist. The key breakdown zone lies between 1.1510 and 1.1480, with a decisive breach likely to trigger a move toward 1.1411, the next major demand level observed during the August consolidation.\nOn the upside, a short-term rebound would require a daily close above 1.1550, opening room toward 1.1598. However, price remains capped below its 50-day moving average near 1.1650, while the 100-day average at 1.1720 now acts as firm resis"

It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling.

The pair has fallen for four consecutive sessions, weighed by hawkish Federal Reserve minutes, weaker U.K. inflation data, and growing speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) could cut rates as early as December. The setup marks a crucial juncture for Sterling, as price action hovers at pivotal support near the 1.3080\u20131.3050 zone, a level repeatedly tested since March 2024.\nThe GBP/USD correction began after the Fed minutes confirmed that most officials now favor keeping policy restrictive for longer, with December rate-cut odds plunging to 31%, down from 46% last week. That repricing lifted the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) above 100.00, its highest in five months, while Treasury yields climbed, amplifying the dollar\u2019s carry advantage. The result has been a decisive reversal in Sterling\u2019s recent momentum, with traders reducing bullish exposure ahead of key macro catalysts.\nU.K. Inflation Eases, Cementing Rate-Cut Expectations\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that headline CPI slowed to 3.6% year-over-year in October, down from 3.8% in September, while core CPI dropped to 3.4%, the lowest since March. The Retail Price Index also fell to 4.3% from 4.5%, signaling broad disinflation across goods and services.\nMarkets immediately priced in a 25-basis-point BoE rate cut, with Deutsche Bank and UOB analysts now expecting the benchmark rate to drop to 4.00% by December. The soft inflation reading, combined with sluggish GDP growth and a cooling labor market, reinforced the view that the BoE\u2019s tightening cycle has peaked. Traders now assign a 74% probability to a cut at the next meeting, a sharp pivot from earlier in the quarter when expectations were for policy to remain unchanged through Q1 2026.\nThe BoE\u2019s dovish tilt contrasts sharply with the Fed\u2019s stance, intensifying downward pressure on the pound. The divergence between the two central banks\u2019 outlooks has widened the interest rate differential by nearly 70 basis points in favor of the dollar, the largest since mid-2023.\nFed Hawkishness Reinforces Dollar Dominance\nThe Fed minutes released on Tuesday confirmed policymakers\u2019 concern that easing too soon could reignite inflation. Chair Jerome Powell and other FOMC members stressed the need to maintain restrictive policy until \u201cclear disinflationary momentum\u201d is achieved. With the CME FedWatch Tool showing just a 30% chance of a December rate cut, traders shifted sharply back into the dollar, driving GBP/USD below the critical 1.3080 pivot.\nFurther evidence of U.S. economic resilience came from regional data: Kansas Fed manufacturing activity rose to 18 from 15, and Existing Home Sales improved to 4.10 million, beating the 4.08 million consensus. This series of positive releases strengthened the case for the Fed\u2019s extended pause, boosting the dollar\u2019s yield premium across major pairs, including GBP/USD.\nTechnical Breakdown and Bearish Structure\nThe GBP/USD pair\u2019s technical structure has deteriorated sharply. The price has fallen below both the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages, signaling a sustained bearish bias. The narrowing gap between the two EMAs points to an impending death cross, a classic signal of deeper downside momentum.\nThe pair also broke beneath the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of its September-to-November rally at 1.3156, confirming a structural shift. Current support stands at 1.3050, followed by 1.2955, representing the 50% Fibonacci retracement. A decisive daily close below 1.3010 wou"

The easing of UK inflation has increased the odds of a rate cut in December by the Bank of England, while the US dollar remains firm after the release of FOMC minutes.\n-Are you looking for automated trading? Check our detailed guide-\nThe latest UK CPI report revealed that annual inflation declined to 3.6% in October, matching the forecast. However, the details reinforced the perspective of weakening domestic demand. Labor market conditions continue to cool, while GDP growth lags behind the BoE\u2019s projection.\nThese dynamics have fueled speculation that the MPC could reduce the benchmark rates to 4% next month. According to Deutsche Bank, the policymakers seem confident enough to begin easing now.\nIn parallel, the pound sterling faces external pressure from resurging US dollar. The greenback gained ahead of key US data releases, while hawkish Fed meeting minutes led traders to scale back their expectations of another cut this year. The Dollar Index hovers near 5-month highs above the 100.00 mark, supported by the shift in the Fed\u2019s probability of a rate cut in December dropping to 31%. Fed officials warned that further easing could reignite inflation, prompting the central bank to stay cautious.\nThe pound sentiment also weakened as global risk sentiment remains fragile ahead of the release of key US macroeconomic data. The markets are bracing for the September US NFP report today, leaving investors uncertain about the underlying strength of the US economy.\nAccording to UOB analysts, the GBP could decline further to the 1.3000 area, but deeply oversold conditions could attract buying traction around the level. However, the pound is also contending with political and fiscal uncertainty as markets watch Rachel Reeves\u2019s upcoming Autumn budget. Speculation grows that the government may extend the income tax threshold freeze. The outcome could unsettle gilt markets again.\nGBP/USD Key Events Ahead\nWith BoE officials split ahead of December, key upcoming data, including UK Retail Sales and flash PMI figures, will be critical in shaping expectations. For now, GBP/USD remains vulnerable, with short-term corrective rallies likely to be sold into as the broader trend continues to favor the US Dollar.\nGBP/USD Technical Outlook: Bears Taking Breather Under 1.3100\nThe GBP/USD 4-hour chart shows a corrective bounce from the key support of 1.3050, which could test the broken demand zone around 1.3090. However, the outlook remains fragile as the price stays well below key MAs. Meanwhile, the RSI remains around 40.0, indicating a rise from the oversold area but hinting at no bullish reversal.\n-If you are interested in forex day trading, then have a read of our guide to getting started-\nKey Support Levels:\n- 3050\n- 3000\n- 2950\nKey Resistance Levels:\n- 3090\n- 3155\n- 3200\nLooking to trade forex now?

The US Dollar Index edged to a fresh six-month high, while Wall Street indices fully reversed their opening gaps and closed with bearish engulfing candles. The extra volatility spilled over into the Australian dollar, which continues to take its cues from the US dollar and S&P 500 rather than yield differentials or the Chinese yuan.\nWhile the Australian dollar has posted minor gains against the New Zealand dollar, Swiss franc and Japanese yen so far this week, it\u2019s on track to form bearish engulfing or outside weeks against the US dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound and euro. The ASX 200 is also on course for its fourth straight weekly decline and its most bearish week in eight months.\nAUD/USD Ignores Yield Differentials, Options Market Stays Calm\nStill, Aussie dollar options traders still do not seem overly concerned with a larger bearish move, with the 1-week and 1-month risk reversals remaining elevated compared to prices. If they were more confident of a breakout, I\u2019d have expected to see the RRs increase their negative skew to show a rise of puts (bearish calls) relative to calls (bullish bets). Perhaps that could change if AUD/USD actually breaks lower by a meaningful amount, but for now they have taken the weaker AUD/USD within their stride. Implied vitality is also lower, which is not one would expect following a relatively volatile down day.\nAlso note how AUD/USD is ignoring yield differentials for now, with the AU-US 2-year spread continuing to rise despite the lower Australian dollar. It really does just seem to be tied to the direction of the US dollar these days.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - source: LSEG\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe Australian dollar is on track for its most bearish week in six, having opened near the weekly high and now trading at the lows. AUD/USD traders are watching the October low, and barring a sharp turnaround in sentiment, a bearish break looks increasingly likely.\nHowever, the key level for bears to clear is the August low at 0.6414, with the 50-week SMA (0.6412) sitting just beneath it. The 0.6400\u20130.6410 zone is loaded with support, so while another dip lower is possible, AUD/USD may initially hold above 64c.\nThe daily chart shows AUD/USD has closed below the 200-day SMA (0.6457) for the first time since late May. With prices resting on the October low, a minor bounce toward the 200-day SMA isn\u2019t out of the question \u2014 and bears may look to fade that move in anticipation of a break lower, targeting the 0.6400\u20130.6410 region in the near term.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - source: TradingView AUD/USD\nAUD/JPY Technical Analysis: Au"

                "body": "For traders of the AUD/USD currency pair, the markets are entering a period of heightened uncertainty as both the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Federal Reserve grapple with conflicting economic signals that could reshape the trajectory of the AUD/USD exchange rate depending on how they act on those signals. Recent policy meeting minutes from both central banks reveal a striking parallel: neither institution is confident about its next moves, leaving traders to navigate an increasingly complex landscape where traditional assumptions about monetary policy are being challenged.\nRBA Caught Between Conflicting Signals: Is Policy Still Restrictive Enough?\nThe RBA\u2019s November meeting minutes paint a picture of a central bank caught between competing pressures, struggling to determine whether its current policy stance remains appropriately restrictive.\nAs the cash rate was lowered to 3.6%, members noted that the reduction had successfully translated into easier financial conditions across Australia, through lower bank funding costs and subsequently, reduced lending rates for consumers and businesses. The most notable development has been the acceleration in housing market activity, particularly the surge in investor credit, which tends to respond more aggressively to rate cuts than owner-occupier lending.\nThis revival in housing market momentum has sparked intense debate within the RBA about whether monetary policy retains sufficient restrictiveness to anchor inflation expectations. The central bank\u2019s assessment reveals a mixed picture, with various indicators pointing in different directions.\nSome metrics suggest financial conditions may actually be accommodative, including compressed risk premia in capital markets, readily available funding, and lending rate spreads that sit well below pre-pandemic levels relative to the cash rate. These developments imply that the neutral interest rate may have risen, meaning the current cash rate level exerts less downward pressure on economic activity than it would have several years ago.\nYet, not all data align. Other indicators persist in suggesting a modestly restrictive stance, leading to uncertainty about the state of monetary policy. This ambiguity matters for the policy outlook because the RBA\u2019s central expectation that inflation will gradually return to target depends critically on maintaining some degree of policy restraint.\nThe inflation data has complicated the picture further, with both headline and underlying measures landing significantly higher than the RBA forecast in August. Both now stand at or above 3%, well outside the central bank\u2019s 2 to 3 percent target band. The bank now expects inflation to remain elevated until mid-2026, settling at 2.6% rather than the preferred 2.5 percent midpoint of its target range.\nThis persistent inflation, combined with the unexpectedly strong employment rebound in October that pushed the unemployment rate back down to 4.3%, has led markets to reassess the probability of further rate cuts. What seemed like a continuing easing cycle just weeks ago now appears potentially finished, with market pricing suggesting only a 40% chance of a May 2026 cut.\nThe minutes make clear that the RBA board sees plausible scenarios pointing in both directions. Members noted several factors that could justify holding rates steady, including stronger-than-expected demand recovery or persistently high inflation. Conversely, they acknowledged scenarios requiring further easing, such as material labor market weakening or a recovery that significantly lags expectations.\nThe board\u2019s conclusion that they can afford patience while assessing incoming data reveals a central bank unwilling to commit to a predetermined path, preferring instead to maintain maximum flexibility as economic conditions evolve. This cautious stance was reinforced by Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter, who outlined three fundamental questions the RBA is examining that could influence policy.\nThese inclu"

Investors are also digesting recent signals from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which increasingly point to a central bank attentive to the persistence of inflationary pressures.\nThe RBA\u2019s cautious message was reinforced by comments from Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter, who warned on Thursday that \u201csustained above-trend growth could fuel inflationary pressures.\u201d She also noted that monthly inflation data can be volatile and that the central bank will not react to a single month of figures. Hunter added that the RBA is closely monitoring labour-market conditions to gauge the economy\u2019s supply capacity and is assessing whether the transmission of monetary policy may be evolving over time.\nHer comments echo the RBA\u2019s November Minutes, which suggested that an extended period of unchanged rates could be appropriate if economic data continue to outperform. Stable Q3 wage growth, strong labour market figures last week, and persistently high inflation all support the idea that the easing cycle has likely ended. ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures show that the December 2025 contract implies only a 6% chance of a rate cut to 3.35% from 3.60%.\nIn the United States (US), the US Dollar (USD) retains moderate support following a mixed labour report. September\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) increased by 119K, far above expectations for 50K, but this strength was offset by a downward revision to August, an uptick in the Unemployment Rate to 4.4%, and slower wage growth at 0.2% MoM. This mixed picture adds uncertainty to the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) policy path, especially with the October jobs report postponed due to the US government shutdown.\nInvestors remain cautious ahead of the December Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets now price only a 31.8% chance of a December rate cut, down from nearly 50% a week earlier. The hawkish tone in the October FOMC Minutes, along with comments from officials such as Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack and Fed Governor Michael Barr, who remains concerned that inflation is still near 3%, has limited expectations for near-term easing.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Downward pressure continues\nAUD/USD 4-hour chart. Source: FXStreet\nIn the 4-hour chart, AUD/USD trades at 0.6447, down for the day. It sits 35 pips below the day\u2019s opening price. The 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) trends lower around 0.6518, reinforcing a bearish bias. Price holds beneath this gauge, and the downward slope keeps rebounds capped. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) slips to 36, below the 50 midline, highlighting persistent selling pressure. A descending trend line from 0.6580 restrains upside, with resistance emerging near 0.6495.\nSupport is seen at 0.6440, then at 0.6415. Resistance aligns at 0.6495, followed by 0.6580 and 0.6630. A break beneath the first support could expose the next level, while a push above the initial resistance would open the path toward the subsequent barriers.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool)\nAuthor\nGhiles Guezout\nFXStreet\nGhiles Guezout is a Market Analyst with a strong background in stock market investments, trading, and cryptocurrencies.

                "body": "USD/JPY\u2019s surge toward the 158 level has set the stage for heightened volatility as traders face a cluster of Japanese and US economic releases that could redefine monetary policy expectations.\nThe Japanese economy and USD/JPY faced heightened scrutiny after the Q3 GDP report showed a slump in external demand. USD/JPY climbed to a ten-month high of 157.893 this week. The USD/JPY pair reacted to the Q3 GDP report and rising concerns about Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s fiscal stimulus goals.\nThe third quarter data tempered Bank of Japan rate hike bets, placing greater emphasis on incoming Japanese economic data.\nOn Friday, November 21, crucial trade, national inflation, and Services PMI data will influence the BoJ rate path.\nJapan\u2019s annual inflation rate ticked up from 2.9% in September to 3.0% in October, with the so-called core-core inflation rate rising from 3.0% to 3.1% in October.\nAn upswing in inflation would typically support a more hawkish BoJ policy stance. However, the third-quarter economic contraction and the BoJ\u2019s projection of softer inflation through H1 2026 could limit the influence of the inflation data on the BoJ\u2019s December interest rate decision.\nNotably, USD/JPY showed a muted response to the data, briefly dropping from 157.415 to 157.195 before reclaiming 157.300.\nJapanese exports signaled a further loss of economic momentum early in the fourth quarter, given Japan\u2019s trade-to-GDP ratio above 45%.\nExports increased by 3.6% year-on-year (YoY) in October, down from a 4.2% rise in September. October\u2019s figures underscored the growing strain on Japan\u2019s export engine, setting a weaker tone for fourth-quarter economic activity. Meanwhile, imports rose 0.7% YoY, down from 3.3% in September.\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance:\nWhile the drop in exports could reduce the likelihood of a December BoJ rate hike, October\u2019s import decline also reflects the yen\u2019s pressure on household budgets.\nUSD/JPY climbed 4.2% in October, raising import prices and Japanese consumer prices. The weaker yen likely contributed to weaker imports, potentially dampening demand-driven inflation. Notably, imports from the US were down 33.6% YoY, following September\u2019s 37.8% YoY decline.\nThe USD/JPY moved from 157.297 to 157.358 after the release of the trade data, as traders reinforced expectations of a cautious BoJ.\nSofter Japanese data and a weaker yen have intensified focus on Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy stance and BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s forward policy guidance.\nOctober\u2019s data came after the first meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda on Tuesday, November 18. BoJ Governor Ueda kept a potential rate hike on the table, stating that monetary policy decisions will hinge on incoming data.\nWage growth trends will likely be crucial for the BoJ, given the weaker yen-import price dynamic. Updates from Japanese labor unions pushing for wage hikes ahead of the 2026 spring negotiations could support a more hawkish BoJ rate path.\nLater in the morning session, Japan\u2019s S&P Global Services PMI also requires consideration. Economists expect the Services PMI to drop from 53.1 in October to 52.8 in November. Slowing services activity would support a less hawkish BoJ rate path, given that the sector contributes around 70% to Japan\u2019s GDP.\nWhile Japanese trade data faced market scrutiny, US services sector data will influence bets on a December Fed rate cut.\nEconomists expect the S&P Global Services PMI to fall from 54.8 in October to 54.6 in November. A modest drop in the headline PMI would signal economic resilience, given that the services sector accounts for around 80% of US GDP.\nHowever, traders should consider service sector price trends, given the Fed\u2019s increased concerns about inflation. As a key contributor to inflation, price trends will likely be the key driver for the US dollar. Elevated prices would support a more hawkish Fed policy stance, sending USD/JPY toward 160.\nBe"

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Soars to 157.70 as BoJ Paralysis Deepens Yen\u2019s 6% Fall\nThe dollar extends gains as the Fed dismisses near-term cuts, driving USD/JPY toward the 52-week high at 158.87 | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY Extends Toward 157.70 as Fed Resets Cut Expectations and BoJ Stays Trapped in Ultra-Loose Policy\nUSD/JPY surged to 157.70, marking a 10-month high, as widening policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan fuels relentless dollar demand. Traders repriced expectations for a December Fed rate cut from near certainty to below 30%, following hawkish meeting minutes that reaffirmed policymakers\u2019 focus on sticky U.S. inflation and tight labor conditions. This shift has re-energized the dollar across global markets, with U.S. yields stabilizing near multi-month highs while Japan\u2019s bond curve remains suppressed by yield-curve control constraints. The yen, already down roughly 6% since Prime Minister Takaishi\u2019s election, continues to face structural pressure as fiscal stimulus expands and real rates remain negative.\nMonetary Divergence Remains the Core Engine Behind USD/JPY Strength\nThe pair\u2019s climb reflects deep asymmetry in monetary policy. The Federal Reserve maintains restrictive settings to contain inflation, while the BoJ resists normalization despite headline inflation lingering near 3%. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hold above 4.35%, compared with Japan\u2019s 10-year yield near 0.8%, preserving one of the world\u2019s widest differentials. Investors seeking yield continue reallocating into U.S. assets, driving persistent capital inflows that underpin USD/JPY\u2019s rally. Japan\u2019s failure to raise rates has anchored the yen as the global funding currency, encouraging leveraged carry positions that amplify every dollar upswing.\nLabor Data and Fed Outlook Reinforce Dollar Dominance\nTraders now await the September nonfarm payrolls report, delayed by the U.S. government shutdown, with forecasts for +50,000 jobs after 22,000 were added in August. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.3%, and average hourly earnings are projected at +0.3%. Given that October\u2019s NFP release was canceled, this report becomes the final labor gauge before the Fed\u2019s December meeting. Stronger-than-expected employment could decisively eliminate remaining rate-cut bets and drive USD/JPY toward new cycle highs above 158.90, last seen in early 2025.\nBoJ\u2019s Dilemma and Yen Intervention Risks\nThe Bank of Japan faces intensifying domestic pressure as the yen trades near levels that historically prompted intervention. Finance Ministry officials have already issued multiple verbal warnings, signaling discomfort with the rapid depreciation. Still, fundamental policy remains unchanged \u2014 Governor Ueda continues to stress patience, citing fragile wage dynamics and uneven growth. Japan\u2019s fiscal spending package, estimated above \u00a515 trillion ($100 billion), compounds the yen\u2019s weakness by expanding public borrowing while offering no monetary offset. Market participants expect that only an explicit policy shift or coordinated intervention could slow the trend, neither of which appears imminent.\nTechnical Structure and Market Behavior\nUSD/JPY broke above its prior rising channel, extending gains toward 157.70 with the RSI signaling overbought conditions near 78, a level not seen since June. The move suggests temporary exhaustion before a corrective phase. Immediate support sits at 156.70, followed by 155.00, the upper band of the prior consolidation range. A sustained drop below 155.70 could open a retracement toward 153.20\u2013152.00, while sustained closes above 158.00 would confirm a breakout targeting 158.87 (52-week high) and 159.50. Price action continues to show strong impulsive legs and shallow retracements \u2014 a hallmark of trending strength fueled by capital flows rather than speculation.\nInstitutional Positioning and Capital Flow Dynamics\nCFTC data show leveraged funds maintaining net-long USD/JPY positions near 13"

Spot prices, however, bearish conviction and remain on track to register strong weekly gains amid the underlying bullish sentiment surrounding the US Dollar (USD).\nThe USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, advanced to its highest level since late May on Thursday amid reduced bets for another interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). The expectations were reaffirmed by the delayed release of the US NFP report, which showed that the economy added 119,000 new jobs in September compared to consensus estimates for 50,000 and followed the 4,000 decrease (revised from +22,000) in August. This helps ease concerns about the softening labor market and offsets an uptick in the Unemployment Rate to 4.4% from 4.3%.\nThe USD bulls, however, pause for a breather on the last day of the week amid growing concerns about the weakening economic momentum on the back of the largest-ever US government shutdown. The Canadian Dollar (USD), on the other hand, continues to be undermined by data released earlier this week, which pointed to signs of easing domestic inflation pressures. Furthermore, sustained selling around Crude Oil prices undermines the commodity-linked Loonie and limits the downside for the USD/CAD pair, warranting some caution for bearish traders and positioning for any meaningful decline.\nTraders now look forward to the release of monthly Canadian Retail Sales data and flash US PMIs for some impetus later during the North American session. Apart from this, speeches from a slew of influential FOMC members will be scrutinized for cues about the Fed's rate-cut path, which, in turn, will drive the USD demand. This, along with Oil price dynamics, should contribute to producing short-term trading opportunities around the USD/CAD pair heading into the weekend. Nevertheless, spot prices seem poised to register strong weekly gains and remain close to a multi-month peak.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to res"

The US economy added jobs in September, but unemployment climbed to a four-year high, complicating the Fed\u2019s next moves. As one strategist put it, the Fed is 'essentially flying blind' into its year-end meeting.

With the US dollar holding strong and oil\u2014Canada\u2019s economic linchpin\u2014dipping, the loonie found itself under more pressure. Canadian producer prices jumped 1.5% in October, up 6% from last year, but traders seemed laser-focused on US policy and global risk, largely shrugging off domestic data.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Reading between the lines of market moves.\nA resilient US dollar and falling oil prices mean choppy conditions for commodity-linked currencies like the loonie. Canadian bond yields tracked US Treasuries lower after recent highs, underscoring just how closely Canadian markets mirror US trends. With retail sales expected to decline following a strong August, analysts expect more swings ahead as investors wait for clearer signals from central banks.\nThe bigger picture: North America\u2019s economic tug-of-war.\nThese developments highlight how global currents shape both Canadian and US economic outlooks. Rising producer prices point to persistent inflation in Canada, even as consumer demand shows signs of cooling. It\u2019s the ongoing dance between US policy decisions, swings in commodity prices, and domestic economic data that\u2019ll keep driving the loonie\u2014and investment flows\u2014across the border.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nInsight\nRussell Burns \u2022 about 12 hours ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 15 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The pair\u2019s reversal from the fresh 16-month high, right above 206.00, has found support above the previous year-to-date high, in the 205.35 area, before returning to 205.75 at the time of writing.\nThe Yen has sold off against its main rivals over the last few days, as investors' concerns about a potential intervention by the Japanese authorities eased, and news reporting that the Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi would be preparing a large stimulus package.\nOn Wednesday, the Japanese Finance Minister, Satsuki Katayama, affirmed that she did not discuss foreign exchange matters at a meeting with the Governour of the Japanese Central Bank, Kazuho Ueda, which has been taken by traders as a sign that the Japanese authorities are comfortable with the current Yen weakness.\nBeyond that, recent news reports suggest that Prime Minister Takaichi would be assembling a Yen 21 trillion (USD 135 billion) stimulus package to help households cope with the higher inflation levels. This is likely to add pressure to the already strained public finances and is contributing to the JPY sell-off.\nIn the UK, data released on Wednesday showed that consumer prices moderated to 3.6% year-on-year in October, from the 3.8% peak in the previous three months. These figures feed hopes that the Bank of England might cut interest rates further in the coming months, and put some bearish pressure on the Pound.\n(This story was corrected on November 20 at 12:30 GMT to say that the size of the Japanese stimulus package was JPY 21 trillion (USD 135 billion), instead of USD 20 billion, as previously reported).\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nto\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor and copywriter in diverse Forex-related firms, like FXS"

It points to the risk of a delay in the timing of the BOJ\u2019s next rate increase even as most economists see a hike by January.\nCoordination between the government and the central bank completely undermines the notion of its independence.\nAbove: JPY performance over the past month.\n2) A spat with China.\nTensions are rising between China and Japan after Takaichi said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan threatening Japan\u2019s survival could trigger a military response.\nThis spat has continued to worsen with China banning Japanese seafood imports.\n\"But what has investors most concerned is that China could restrict the flow of rare earths to Japan\u2019s economy hurting its car and electronics industries,\" explains Marinov.\n3) Debt sustainability.\nThe Japanese government is soon expected to finalise a monstrous fiscal stimulus in the region of $110BN, maybe more.\n\"Such an enormous sum would undoubtedly provide fresh a fresh liquidity injection for financial markets, but there are questions over the viability of such a package in an environment where Japanese CPI is above target, debt to GDP is already at eye-watering levels and bond yields are already reflecting concerns,\" says Benjamin Picton, Senior Market Strategist at Rabobank.\nA 20Y Japanese government bond auction yesterday was weak as investors fret over the size of the stimulus package to be announced on Friday.\nIn a world awash with debt, the risk is that demand stalls.\n\"Worries over Japanese debt levels are usually met with a shrug and a comment that most of the debt is owed internally and balanced out by large asset holdings, but with the numbers getting this high and markets already showing signs of indigestion how long can that show go on?\" asks Picton.\n\"Investors may have been in a 'Sell Japan' mood lately, and it remains to be seen whether the BoJ will indeed decide to raise interest rates soon or whether authorities will intervene into the market and buy the yen as dollar/yen approaches the 160.00 psychological zone,\" says Charalampos Pissouros, Senior Market Analyst at Trading Point."

                "body": "U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs snapped a five-day outflow streak with $75.47 million in net inflows on November 19, a tentative sign of stabilization after a period of sustained selling.\nThe rebound was led by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT, which contributed $60.61 million in inflows, starkly contrasting Tuesday\u2019s record outflow of $523.15 million, per SoSoValue data. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT was followed by inflows of $53.84 million to Grayscale\u2019s BTC.\nThe inflows mark a potential shift in the bearish sentiment amid macroeconomic uncertainty that has kept flows largely negative since the second week of October. The recent five-day rout highlighted deepening institutional caution as markets shift from momentum to a more cautious phase, pushing market sentiment firmly into fear territory, experts previously told Decrypt.\nWhile the outflow streak was significant, it should be viewed in the context of the massive wave of capital that entered ETFs this year, Wali Makokha, chief product officer at Mansa, told Decrypt.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge wave of money into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs this year, over $60 billion in net inflows since launch, so a few days of outflows don\u2019t mean the story is broken,\u201d Makokha said. \u201cWhat\u2019s really changed is the backdrop: Bitcoin had a big run-up to new highs, then pulled back, and interest rates are still high.\u201d\nDoubts about market recovery remain, as reflected in outflows from VanEck\u2019s HODL and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, which saw $17.63 million and $21.35 million leave their funds, respectively.\nUsers on prediction market Myriad reflect this uncertainty and bearish sentiment, with the chances of Bitcoin hitting $115,000 and Ethereum revisiting $5,000 sliding from above 60% last week to 35% and 38%, respectively.\n(Disclaimer: Myriad is owned by Decrypt\u2019s parent company Dastan)\n\u201cDefensive positioning\u201d\nThe scale of the recent ETF redemptions, particularly from major funds like IBIT, suggests that institutional investors are reassessing their exposure, Wenny Cai, COO and Co-Founder of Synfutures, told Decrypt.\n\u201cSeveral forces are driving the move,\u201d Cai explained. \u201cBitcoin has retreated sharply from its October peak, sliding below $90,000 and testing the conviction of newer ETF entrants who bought near the highs.\u201d\nAlongside price declines, broader risk-off sentiment and questions around U.S. interest rates are prompting a rotation out of risk assets, the analyst explained. There are also signs of active hedging, with the cost of put options on IBIT climbing to multi-month highs, suggesting some investors are preparing for additional downside."

IBIT's inflows followed its record-setting net outflows of $523 million on Tuesday, which was its largest daily outflow since launch.\nYesterday's net inflows were partially offset by two funds that reported net outflows. Fidelity's FBTC recorded $21.35 million in outflows, while VanEck's HODL saw $17.63 million exit the fund.\nThe five-day net outflow streak from Nov. 12 to 18 pulled more than $2.26 billion from bitcoin ETFs. This negative flows corresponded with a broader downturn in the crypto market, with bitcoin recently dropping below $90,000 after hitting an all-time high of over $126,000 just weeks earlier.\nKronos Research CIO Vincent Liu told The Block earlier on Wednesday that ETF outflows were a sign of institutional recalibration rather than capitulation, and predicted that risk-on appetite would quickly return when macroeconomic signals become clearer.\nThe Federal Reserve's December interest rate decision continues to add macro uncertainty, as Chair Jerome Powell's recent comments dampened traders' hopes for another rate cut next month.\nThe CME Group's FedWatch Tool currently gives a 33.8% chance that the Fed would cut rates by 25 basis points next month, down from 48.9% earlier this week. Traders remain wary, as seen in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index pointing to 11 \u2014 signaling extreme fear.\nOther analysts have also previously explained that the crypto prices were suffering from reduced liquidity in the market as a result of the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, which blocked authorities from spending on non-crucial operations. Market experts said liquidity is expected to return slowly as the government resumes normal operations.\nBitcoin has shown a slight recovery, up 0.72% in the past 24 hours to $92,200, according to The Block's bitcoin price page.\nMeanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs extended their net outflow streak to a seventh day, with $37.35 million leaving the funds.\nNewly launched altcoin ETFs performed better, with spot Solana ETFs taking in $55.6 million in net inflows yesterday. With two new funds debuting Wednesday, there are now six spot Solana ETFs in the U.S.\nCanary Capital's spot XRP ETF posted $15.8 million in net inflows, while its Hedera (HBAR) fund saw $577,180 worth of inflows on Wednesday. Canary's Litecoin ETF saw zero flows for the day.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

This launches the decentralized consensus layer that powers the Aztec Network,\" Aztec announced on X.\nThe event happened when the validator queue hit 500, a key checkpoint that signals readiness to secure the network and initiate block production\nThe Ignition Chain is the engine powering Aztec's goal of being a fully decentralized \"private world computer,\" enabling developers to create DeFi applications while maintaining total secrecy.\nIt combines zero-knowledge proofs with Ethereum\u2019s robust security, enabling truly private, scalable blockchain transactions. So, users get the speed and cost savings of L2, plus privacy that\u2019s been missing in many decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\nAnyone can become a validator or sequencer by staking AZTEC tokens to earn rewards and early birds get a bonus to jumpstart decentralization. The AZTEC token auction is scheduled for Dec. 2, opening the doors for more community involvement.\nThe debut means privacy-focused, decentralized L2 networks are not just experimental projects, they\u2019re about to become vital infrastructure shaping the future of blockchain.\nWhy 500 validators?\nEthereum\u2019s consensus depends on distributed trust\u2014meaning lots of independent validators confirm transactions. But if too many validators try to join all at once, network stability risks taking a hit. So new validators queue up, entering in stages.\nReaching 500 validators means Aztec Ignition Chain has hit a critical mass: a strong, resilient base of participants ready to defend the network. More validators mean better decentralization, a lower risk of a bad actor taking control, and a network secure enough to launch fully on Ethereum.\nMore For You\nProtocol Research: GoPlus Security\nWhat to know:\n- As of October 2025, GoPlus has generated $4.7M in total revenue across its product lines. The GoPlus App is the primary revenue driver, contributing $2.5M (approx. 53%), followed by the SafeToken Protocol at $1.7M.\n- GoPlus Intelligence's Token Security API averaged 717 million monthly calls year-to-date in 2025 , with a peak of nearly 1 billion calls in February 2025.

The filing reveals that BlackRock has registered its iShared Staked Ethereum Trust, according to a post by Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\nThe registration isn\u2019t a formal application with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Still, it is a signal that the world\u2019s largest asset manager will submit a fresh ETF bid, one with a baked-in Ethereum staking product.\nThe SEC approved Ethereum ETFs earlier this year, but those products did not include staking rewards. In May, the SEC issued guidance that clarified that certain staking products aren\u2019t securities, paving the way for staking ETFs.\nBlackRock\u2019s bid comes amid Buterin\u2019s alarms about large asset managers accumulating Ethereum. The Ethereum creator warned that a high concentration of Ethereum ownership on Wall Street could distort the blockchain\u2019s governance and create centralised chokepoints.\nBlackRock is already the biggest Ethereum ETF issuer in the US with its ETHA product amassing more than $13 billion in inflows since its launch.\nThe US ETF market as a whole holds about $18 billion in Ethereum, while Ethereum treasury companies hold another $18 billion of the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\nBlackRock\u2019s Delaware registration for its Ethereum staking ETFs also means the firm is set to enter the Ethereum staking ETF race.\nIn October, VanEck filed with the SEC for a Lido Staked Ethereum ETF.

                "body": "In a market where Bitcoin sets the tone, Solana experiments with speed, and Monero protects privacy. And, established names like Cardano and Avalanche keep grinding with solid fundamentals, offering stability and long-term adoption. Enter Apeing ($APEING), the coin engineered for action-takers. But $APEING is where instinct meets opportunity, perfect for those ready to move while others second-guess.\nAs 2025 approaches, the big question on every trader's mind is clear: Which crypto will explode in 2025? The world is crowded, but a few select coins stand out, combining strong fundamentals, active communities, and high growth potential. From blue-chip names like Ethereum and Cardano to high-speed players like Solana and Avalanche, each has its own story, its own opportunity for the bold.\nFor $APEING, hesitation is the enemy. It's built for those who move while others freeze. By rewarding decisiveness over endless chart-staring, Apeing $APEING flips the usual crypto grind on its head, making community action the real currency.\nHolders aren't just spectators, they're players with real sway. Governance votes, exclusive ecosystem updates, and early access to key features put the power directly in the hands of those who ape in early. Each move in the $APEING community shapes the future of the project, turning every participant into a stakeholder rather than a bystander.\nThe thrill of $APEING comes from being part of a movement that thrives on instinct and collective action.\nJoining $APEING is straightforward yet strategic. Navigate to the official website, enter your email in the whitelist section, and confirm through email verification. This step ensures early access to project updates, governance votes, and community-exclusive perks.\nBeing on the whitelist puts investors at the forefront of potential market surges, giving them a clear advantage when others are still analyzing charts. The Apeing community thrives on speed and collective instinct, rewarding the boldest players.\nOnce confirmed, investors can access community forums, governance polls, and priority announcements. This is the essence of Apeing: moving when others pause, acting when others overthink. The philosophy is simple: the only people making serious gains are those who Ape and HODL.\nEthereum has been the backbone of decentralized finance for years. With its upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which aims to improve scalability and reduce energy consumption, the network is positioned for another growth phase. According to CoinDesk, Ethereum's staking yields currently range between 4-7% annually, depending on network activity. This makes it attractive for both short-term traders and long-term holders.\nEthereum's ecosystem of decentralized apps, NFTs, and layer-2 solutions ensures that demand for ETH will continue to grow. Analysts on Twitter and Reddit have highlighted the price potential for ETH post-upgrade, with some expecting double-digit growth by 2025. For those who combine strategic Apeing with solid fundamentals, Ethereum remains a blue-chip bet.\nCardano has earned its reputation as the \"slow but steady\" blockchain. While critics often point to its deliberate development pace, recent updates in smart contract functionality have ignited new optimism. According to a 2024 study by IOHK, Cardano's proof-of-stake mechanism is one of the most energy-efficient in the industry, attracting institutional attention.\nCardano's unique approach appeals to investors who appreciate long-term sustainability and predictable governance. By 2025, its combination of energy efficiency and expanding dApp ecosystem may make it a sleeper hit. For those who Ape early, Cardano offers a compelling blend of stability and growth potential.\nSolana is synonymous with high-speed transactions and low fees, attracting a flurry of DeFi and NFT projects. Analysts have observed that Solana's ecosystem expansion correlates directly with network adoption, and Twitter communities are buzzing with optimism"

                "body": "Major stock indexes erased big morning gains and closed sharply lower Thursday, a day after AI darling Nvidia reported quarterly results above analysts' lofty expectations.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down a respective 2.2%, 1.6%, and 0.8%, with the Dow having lost a 700-point advance to close down nearly 400 points. Yesterday, the Dow and S&P 500 snapped four-session skids ahead of Nvidia's earnings, while the Nasdaq ended higher for the first time this week.\nAfter the bell Wednesday, Nvidia's fiscal 2026 third-quarter results blew past Wall Street expectations and the company also issued rosy revenue guidance for the current quarter, with CEO Jensen Huang saying sales of its AI Blackwell platform are \"off the charts.\" Nvidia shares had risen about 5% earlier in the session but ended down 3.2%.\nIn addition, the U.S. added more than double the expected amount of jobs in September, after the report was delayed since Oct. 3 because of the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, but the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.4%. The mixed report did little to settle the Federal Reserve's dilemma about whether to cut its key interest rate in December. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to about 4.10% from Wednesday's close of 4.14%.\nBitcoin dropped to $86,400, a seven-month low, at 4 p.m. ET amid risk-off sentiment, and crypto-tied stocks Robinhood Markets (HOOD) and Coinbase Global (COIN) sank around 10% and 7%, respectively.\n\"We think the recent IT sector drawdown represents a healthy correction rather than the start of something more threatening,\" Oxford Economics Director of Equity Strategy Daniel Grosvenor wrote in a note. \"Tech stocks are underpinned by robust earnings momentum and Nvidia's stronger-than-expected results yesterday should help to allay concerns that a slowdown is imminent.\"\nThe U.S. dollar index, which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, was little changed at 100.24. WTI crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, slipped 0.3% to $59.25 per barrel. Gold futures ticked 0.2% lower to $4,075 per ounce.\nOne bright spot Thursday was Walmart (WMT), whose shares jumped 6.5% to lead the S&P 500 and Dow after it reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit and revenue, and raised its fiscal 2026 outlook. The world's largest retailer also announced it was switching its stock listing to the Nasdaq from the New York Stock Exchange.\nNoteworthy S&P 500 Movers on Thursday\nDecliners\n- As Nvidia lost ground, other chipmakers followed suit. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped nearly 8% and Broadcom (AVGO) slipped 2%, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index registering a nearly 5% decline. Nvidia memory chip partner Micron Technology (MU) tumbled 10.9%.\n- Jacobs Solutions (J) shares lost the most of any stock in the S&P 500, dropping close to 11% after the engineering and consulting company reported a year-over-year decline in quarterly profits. The company said the results reflected a change in value of its investment in Amentum (AMTM), which was spun off from the company last year and combined its former intelligence arm with its cyber and critical mission solutions business.\n- The price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) extended its downtrend to hover around $87,000. Shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which offers crypto trading on its platform, dropped about 10%, while shares of crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global (COIN) fell 7.4%.\nAdvancers\n- Walmart (WMT) shares jumped nearly 7% to notch Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the retail giant's earnings topped analysts' estimates. Year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales and advertising revenue helped drive the strong performance, in what could be a positive signal for U.S. consumer spending heading into the height of the holiday season.\n- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use of its Eylea HD eye treatm"

However, August\u2019s payrolls were revised from a gain of 22,000 to a loss of 4,000.

The BLS added that it would publish October\u2019s nonfarm payrolls and November\u2019s jobs report on December 16.\nA weaker labor market supports lower interest rates because it signals softer economic demand, allowing the Fed to cut rates to stimulate growth. The odds of a 25 bps rate cut at the December 9-10 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting rose following the data, climbing to 39.6% compared to 30.1% a day ago.\nMeanwhile, Fed Governor Lisa Cook warned of an \u201cincreased likelihood of outsized asset price declines\u201d given elevated valuations in equities, bonds, and housing markets. At the same time, Cook said she doesn\u2019t expect a potential drop in asset prices to pose a risk to the overall financial system.\nThe Dow Jones is down by 0.69% at the time of writing.\nWhich Stocks are Moving the Dow Jones?\nLet\u2019s pivot to TipRanks\u2019 Dow Jones Heatmap, which illustrates the stocks that have contributed to the index\u2019s price action.\nNvidia (NVDA) has given back all of its earnings gains and is now trading in negative territory, surprising many investors and fueling fears of an AI bubble.\nMeanwhile, Walmart (WMT) is the top performer in the Dow Jones after the retailer reported third-quarter revenue of $179.5 billion, topping the consensus analyst estimate of $177.43 billion. Its adjusted EPS of 62 cents was also higher than the estimate of 60 cents.\nElsewhere, all four stocks within the industrials group are trading lower, led by Boeing (BA). BA stock is now down by about 18% over the past month. Amazon (AMZN) is also in the red ahead of Black Friday, which falls on November 28.\nDIA Stock Moves Lower with the Dow Jones\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) is an exchange-traded fund designed to track the movement of the Dow Jones. As a result, DIA is falling alongside the Dow Jones today.\nWall Street believes that DIA stock has room to rise. During the past three months, analysts have issued an average DIA price target of $532.74, implying upside of 15.99% from current prices. The 31 holdings in DIA carry 29 buy ratings, two hold ratings, and zero sell ratings.\nStay ahead of macro events with our up-to-the-minute Economic Calendar \u2014 filter by impact, country, and more."

That\u2019s a sign industrial inflation is cooling off and manufacturers are getting some cost relief. Still, monthly prices edged up 0.1%, hinting these declines could be running out of steam. Across the Atlantic, investors are still watching the US closely: a delay in key jobs data has made a December Fed rate cut less likely, so all eyes are turning to retail sales and jobless claims. On the company side, Siemens Energy\u2019s stock jumped 3.12% after unveiling a massive \u20ac6 billion share buyback through 2028, while Bayer slipped despite FDA approval for its latest lung cancer treatment.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: German industry finds a little breathing room.\nSofter producer prices signal cost relief for German manufacturers, boosting optimism in the DAX after months of high inflation. Siemens Energy\u2019s hefty buyback plan has also put a spotlight on industrials, sparking fresh interest among investors. Still, with US interest rate decisions hanging in the balance, global markets could stay sensitive and volatile as the year winds down.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks and earnings take center stage.\nFalling producer inflation in Europe stands in contrast to the shifting monetary policy outlook in the US. As both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve react to mixed data, their next moves could reshape global trade, manufacturing costs, and supply chains well into 2026. Industrials with a handle on cost swings\u2014like Siemens Energy\u2014could hold the upper hand as economic tides turn.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nInsight\nRussell Burns \u2022 about 12 hours ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 15 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

Bitcoin was trading below $87,000 at the close of stock trading on Thursday, near its lowest levels since April.\nNvidia stock finished the day down 3.1% after surging as much as 5% in early trading after the chipmaker delivered an earnings beat and issued a stronger-than-expected revenue outlook for the fourth quarter.\nCEO Jensen Huang said demand for the company\u2019s Blackwell processors is \"off the charts,\" helping \u2014 at least initially \u2014 to ease concern that the recent cooldown in AI-linked stocks signaled a longer-term slowdown.\n(NVDA)\nMeanwhile, Thursday morning\u2019s September nonfarm-payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the US economy added 119,000 jobs during the month \u2014 well above the modest gain of 51,000 expected. But the US unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, up from 4.3% in August.\nFollowing the report, options traders were pricing in around 38% odds of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in December. Those odds were increased from Wednesday but still reflected the emerging narrative of a Fed divided on its next move.\nThe data marked the first major insight into the US economy since the longest-ever US government shutdown ended. Minutes from the Fed\u2019s October meeting showed policymakers have \"strongly differing views\" over whether a cooling labor market or stubborn inflation poses the greater risk to the economy.\nElsewhere in earnings, Walmart (WMT) raised its full-year forecasts after it beat on profit and sales in the third quarter. Its shares jumped nearly 7% as investors assessed the big box retailer's report, seen as a window into the strength of the consumer heading into the holiday season.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 23 updates"

The S&P 500 fell 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 386 points, or 0.8%.\nAt one point, the Nasdaq was up 2.6%, while the S&P was up 1.9% and the Dow was up 1.6%; all three indexes marked their largest reversal from an intraday high to negative territory since April 8, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s stunning reversal is a sign that market psychology has become quite brittle,\u201d writes Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \u201cIf investors were truly enamored with NVDA\u2019s results and the assurances about the lack of an AI bubble, then by no means would we have succumbed to an algorithmic quirk so quickly. We might have seen a bit of a blip lower but carried on nonetheless. Instead, we got a complete reversal and then some.\u201d\nNvidia closed down on the day after rallying after earnings. Though the numbers were good, there were some doubts on Wall Street as to whether stellar numbers could overpower recent worries about artificial intelligence valuations, Mizuho's Daniel O'Regan told Barron's.\n\u201cThe AI narrative near-term is still somewhat mixed, rightly or wrongly,\u201d O\u2019Regan says. \u201cLong term it seems extremely intact, but it's tough to change mindset, especially retail, near term.\u201d\nThe market, especially riskier stocks, followed a big drop in bitcoin. Sosnick suggests that trading algorithms may be acting on a relationship between stocks and Bitcoin.\n\u201cTraders have always sought to find relationships between asset classes, and there are teams of skilled quants who pore through data, both long- and short-term, seeking inputs that guide their decisions,\u201d Sosnick writes. \u201cWe called them \u2018leads.\u2019\u201d\nSosnick notes Bitcoin has been a lead for the Nasdaq 100 in recent days.\n\u201cWhile correlation is not causality, that can become the case if traders large and small are using that as a basis for their decision making,\u201d he writes."

Smaller than ICE-powered Wagoneers and powered by dual motors good for 500 horsepower, it departs from Jeep\u2019s traditional off-road-first ethos in favor of speed, style, and silence. Despite that (or perhaps because of it), the Wagoneer S can\u2019t help but let its weirdness shine through.\nFor example, where most performance SUVs pound the ground into submission, there\u2019s a squishy yet firm lumpiness to the Wagoneer S\u2019s ride that's reminiscent of your great-grandma\u2019s mashed potatoes or a memory foam mattress laid over a gravel driveway. It\u2019s clear the Jeep\u2019s suspension is trying to do two things at once\u2014be composed and be plush\u2014and it doesn\u2019t quite nail either. On big, lazy undulations, the body starts to bound as if the dampers are off the clock. On quick, sharp bumps, they punch in suddenly with a choppy jolt that feels out of sync with the refined serenity of electric driving.\nIs the Wagoneer S Nice Inside?\nAt least the interior looks good. Jeep\u2019s designers seem to have studied luxury lighting the way sommeliers study grapes. There are ambient strips that glow like dusk, and the McIntosh speaker grilles are illuminated in soft blue, setting a mood that\u2019s part high-end lounge, part home theater. It looks rich.\nThere are issues, of course. The lower touchscreen with climate controls is an answer to a question no one asked. As far as we can tell, most everything it does can be handled on the upper screen, and the lower one only redeems itself by flipping up and hiding away. The screen\u2019s sole useful bits are its temperature sliders that stay visible when it\u2019s folded away, a small win.\nThe seats are big and inviting and generally comfortable. They feel a tad overstuffed, however, which can make long drives more tiresome as you shift around. There\u2019s room enough to go around for all passengers, but given the S\u2019s smaller size, it doesn\u2019t have the outright spaciousness the Wagoneer name might imply. On the plus side, rear-seat ingress and egress are good.\nAs for storage, a small frunk up front holds a charge cable or a 24-pack of cans and not much else. Plus, there\u2019s no release button on the key fob, and it\u2019s not powered, so it\u2019s more of a novelty than anything else. The rear load floor sits a bit high, but it has enough room for a family of four\u2019s luggage, and there\u2019s bonus space underneath for odds and ends.\nSpeed and More Speed\nJeep has given the Wagoneer S serious electric grunt: Its dual permanent-magnet motors (201 hp front, 335 hp rear) combine for 500 hp and 524 lb-ft of torque. That\u2019s enough to sling the 5,724-pound SUV to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds, quicker than most gas-chugging muscle cars.\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s hella fast, and it feels that way. Mash the accelerator, and the Wagoneer S surges forward as if on actual lightning, bolting for the horizon and pressing you into the driver\u2019s seat. The steering doesn\u2019t say much in corners, and the steering wheel goes light in your hands when you hammer the right pedal in straights, but the way the Wagoneer S\u2019s tires scrabble for grip is old-school fun few EVs still manage. Most electric SUVs are too polite and too digital, but this one has a bit of a wild side.\nEven if that wasn\u2019t Jeep\u2019s intent, it certainly tickles our pleasure center. Well, when it\u2019s not slightly scaring us; in cold weather or on less grippy pavement, the search for grip can feel like a loss of control. Still, it\u2019s weirdly charming if you know what to expect. Just budget for winter tires if you live in an area with four seasons.\nLess charming is the regenerative braking system\u2019s habit of resetting to l"

                "body": "RFK Jr.\u2019s Miasma Theory of Health Is Spreading\nThe NIH is picking up Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s argument that a healthy immune system can keep even pandemic germs at bay.\nListen to more stories on the Noa app.\nLast week, the two top officials at the National Institutes of Health\u2014the world\u2019s largest public funder of biomedical research\u2014debuted a new plan to help Americans weather the next pandemic: getting everyone to eat better and exercise.\nThe standard pandemic-preparedness playbook \u201chas failed catastrophically,\u201d NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya and NIH Principal Deputy Director Matthew J. Memoli wrote in City Journal, a magazine and website published by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think tank. The pair argue that finding and studying pathogens that could cause outbreaks, then stockpiling vaccines against them, is a waste of money. Instead, they say, the United States should encourage people to improve their baseline health\u2014\u201cwhether simply by stopping smoking, controlling hypertension or diabetes, or getting up and walking more.\u201d\nOn its own, Bhattacharya and Memoli\u2019s apparently serious suggestion that just being in better shape will carry the U.S. through an infectious crisis is reckless, experts told me\u2014especially if it\u2019s executed at the expense of other public-health responses. In an email, Andrew Nixon, the director of communications at the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014which oversees the NIH\u2014wrote that the agency \u201csupports a comprehensive approach to pandemic preparedness that recognizes the importance of both biomedical tools and the factors individuals can control.\u201d But more broadly, Bhattacharya and Memoli\u2019s proposal reflects the spread of a dangerous philosophy that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of HHS, has been pushing for years: a dismissal of germ theory, or the notion that infectious microbes are responsible for many of the diseases that plague humankind.\nIn his 2021 book, The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health, Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, argues that modern scientists have blamed too much of infectious disease on pathogens, which he suggests are rarely problematic, unless the immune system has been compromised by poor nutrition, toxins, and other environmental stressors. He credits sanitation and nutrition for driving declines in infectious-disease deaths during the 20th century; vaccination, he has baselessly claimed, was largely ineffective and unnecessary. In his view, germs don\u2019t pose a substantial threat to people who have done the work of \u201cfortifying the immune system\u201d\u2014essentially, those who have taken their health into their own hands.\nIn terms of general health, most Americans would benefit from improvements in diet and exercise. A strong emphasis on both has been core to the Make America Healthy Again movement, and in one important aspect, Kennedy and his allies are correct: The immune system, like other bodily systems, is sensitive to nutritional status, and when people are dealing with chronic health issues, they often fare less well against infectious threats, Melinda Beck, a nutrition and infectious-disease researcher who recently retired from the University of North Carolina, told me. Conditions such as obesity and diabetes, for instance, raise the risk of severe COVID and flu; malnutrition exacerbates the course of diseases such as tuberculosis and measles.\nBut applied to widespread infectious outbreaks, the MAHA prescription is still deeply flawed. Being generally healthy doesn\u2019t guarantee survival, or even better outcomes against infectious diseases\u2014especially when an entire population encounters a pathogen against which it has no immunity. Although some evidence suggests that the 1918 flu pandemic strongly affected certain groups of people who were less healthy at baseline\u2014including undernourished World War I soldiers\u2014\u201crelatively healthy people, as far as we could understand, were"

That skepticism quickly spread across global markets, landing hardest in Japan. Big names with hefty AI exposure \u2013 think Advantest and SoftBank Group \u2013 nosedived over 10%. Worries over a holiday weekend and an upcoming government stimulus announcement, likely funded by new debt, only added to the nervous mood. Meanwhile, the yen hovered near a 10-month low as bond yields pressed toward record territory, reflecting deep uncertainty about Japan\u2019s fiscal health and financial stability.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: AI hype puts risk front and center.\nJapan's sharp drop traced the US tech sell-off, rippling through global markets and putting the brakes on AI-fueled optimism. The Nikkei\u2019s decline touched most corners of the market, with 77 stocks finishing lower, though pockets of strength appeared in healthcare, where names like M3 and Olympus notched solid gains. This shakeout underlines how quickly international sentiment can sour, especially for tech sectors built on future growth hopes rather than present-day profits.\nThe bigger picture: Debt worries and a weak yen add pressure.\nThe prospect of more government spending in Japan comes at a time when the nation\u2019s rising debt and falling currency threaten to overshadow any short-term boost. Analysts warn that persistent fiscal strain and yen weakness could complicate recovery efforts just as interest rates inch higher. What happens next in Tokyo \u2013 both from policymakers and markets \u2013 could ripple through the global economy, highlighting the interconnected challenges facing major economies.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nInsight\nRussell Burns \u2022 about 12 hours ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 15 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Japan's Nikkei extends weekly slide as tech shares track Wall Street declines\nBy Rocky Swift\nJapan's Nikkei share average slid sharply on Friday, dragged down by technology-related stocks, as fresh valuation concerns drove U.S. stocks lower overnight.\nThe Nikkei 225 Index NI225 sank 2.3% to 48,653.80, as of the midday break, poised for a 3.4% drop this week. The broader Topix TOPIX was down just 0.3%.\nOvernight, Wall Street stocks slid in a sharp reversal from an early rally, as optimism faded over quarterly results from artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia NVDA.\nNvidia's record profits failed to dispel worries about overextended valuations in the AI sector, and traders in Japan may also be cautious as a holiday weekend looms and new stimulus by the government stirs concerns about the nation's finances, said Nomura Securities strategist Fumika Shimizu.\nThe yen traded near a 10-month low and long-term Japanese government bond yields were close to record highs ahead of the release of a massive new stimulus plan expected to be funded in part by issuance of new debt.\n\"Concerns about Japan's fiscal deterioration and the so-called negative aspects of yen weakness are likely emerging,\" Shimizu said.\nThere were 147 advancers on the Nikkei against 77 decliners. Some of the largest losers in the index were heavyweights in the AI sector, including Advantest 6857, which plunged 11%, and SoftBank Group 9984, which sank 10%.\nThe largest gainers in the index were M3 2413, up 5.84%, followed by Olympus 7733 which gained 4.3%."
