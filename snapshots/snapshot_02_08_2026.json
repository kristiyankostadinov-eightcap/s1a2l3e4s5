                "body": "Despite many weaknesses in the US economy, the role of the dollar as international reserve currency is not yet threatened, explains Michael Roberts\nThe gold price against the US dollar is back above $5000 per oz after its recent short sharp contraction last week. The unprecedented rise in the gold price, particularly since the beginning of the Trump Mark 2 presidency one year ago, is the result of what is being called the \u2018debasement trade\u2019. This trade means that financial institutions, both public and private, are apparently trading out of US financial assets ie dollar cash and dollar debt, in particular. Why? It seems that financial investors and speculators, both foreign and American, fear that the dollar value of the assets that they own will fall. Why? For several reasons.\nFirst, although Trump claims that inflation is falling fast, the evidence is to the opposite. US consumer price inflation is still officially \u2018sticky\u2019 and remains at a rate above the Federal Reserve\u2019s official target rate of 2% a year. Moreover, as we have shown in previous posts, the official rate underestimates by as much as 2% pts the actual rate of inflation. Yet, Trump continues to demand that the Federal Reserve cut its policy interest rate and intends to replace the current Fed chair Jay Powell with somebody (Kevin Warsh) who will do his bidding. Higher inflation alongside lower interest rates is a recipe for investors to get out of dollar assets. The real (after inflation) rate of interest earned on dollar assets will fall further.\nAnother key indicator here is the differential between the interest rate received on the dollar compared to that received on other currencies, particularly the euro and the yen. Financial investors increasingly reckon that US interest rates will fall more than in other major economies over the next year or so. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are in no hurry to cut their rates further \u2013 as they just announced at their meetings today \u2013 while the Bank of Japan is set to hike its rate further to support the yen. So the \u2018forward\u2019 (ie market forecast) differential interest rate for the dollar compared to other currencies has been dropping.\nThe Trump factor is also playing a role in the dollar\u2019s recent demise and thus the debasement trade. His unpredictability, his bullying tactics with other countries, is increasingly forcing foreign holders of dollar assets ie companies investing into the US; financial institutions holding US stocks and bonds; and central banks with large holdings of US short-term assets (cash and treasury bills) to diversify into other currencies \u2013 or into gold. Indeed, gold, that \u2018barbaric relic\u2019 of the past monetary system, has now become the \u2018safe haven\u2019 asset to hold in the place of the dollar, and for that matter other major \u2018fiat\u2019 currencies like the euro, sterling or the yen.\nIn the past, whenever there was a financial crisis or a major political conflict, investors would pile into dollar assets, driving the dollar up \u2013 as happened during the 2008 financial crisis. That hasn\u2019t happened under Trump; the dollar index has fallen 10% against other currencies in 2025. This time, the debasement trade has emerged.\nThe dollar, as the world\u2019s major currency for central bank reserves and in transactions in international trade and finance, has been in gradual decline for decades. US imperialism has been the dominant power globally since 1945. That dominance has depended on four factors: industrial superiority; technological superiority; financial superiority and military prowess. The US was the major manufacturing economy in the 1950s and 1960s, but it gradually lost that position to rising European and then Japanese manufacturing. The litmus test was when the US trade surpluses with other nations turned into deficits, which has continued ever since. Then the US then began to leak dollars globally, not only through outward investment, but also through an excess of spending on imports over ex"

Influenced by his studies under economist Milton Friedman, he has long argued that inflation is driven by printing too much money.\nThat view departs from years of Federal Reserve policy focused on keeping borrowing costs low.\nTrump Nominates Kevin Warsh To Succeed Jerome Powell As Federal Reserve Chair\nFor investors, Warsh's record has signaled a more disciplined approach to inflation and monetary policy.\nAddressing inflation under that framework would likely require tighter monetary policy, including higher interest rates. And higher rates typically strengthen the U.S. dollar, giving investors less reason to seek refuge in gold and silver and prompting a selloff in both metals.\nAdvertisement\nWhat Trump\u2019s Next Pick To Lead The Federal Reserve Means For Your Wallet\nFor months, a gravity-defying rally had pushed gold and silver prices to fresh highs, as investors piled into the traditional safe-haven assets amid inflation, trade tensions and concerns about the long-term stability of the dollar under Trump\u2019s economic policies.\nHours before Trump announced Warsh\u2019s nomination, gold and silver were still holding onto recent gains. The news sparked a swift bust, with gold suffering its worst selloff since 2013 and silver posting its steepest one-day drop since 1980.\nThe sudden reversal rattled investors who had turned to gold as a hedge against inflation and policy uncertainty, including many retirement-age Americans who viewed the metal as a safer place to park their savings.\nThe sharp swings also raised questions about how much more volatility could lie ahead, as markets brace for further policy signals from Washington and potential changes at the Federal Reserve.\nTrump\u2019s Economic Wins Are Real \u2014 Now He Needs To Convince The Country\nClick Here To Download The Fox News App\nEven so, longer-term demand for gold has been supported by steady buying from foreign central banks, including China, which has been diversifying reserves away from the U.S. dollar amid geopolitical tensions.\nOriginal article source: A single Trump announcement sparks billions in losses across gold and silver"

Precious metals trade nearly 24 hours a day.\nFriday\u2019s plunge put an abrupt halt to silver\u2019s red-hot run over the last 12 months. Analysts attributed the drop to investors selling their silver for high returns at what could be the end of its juggernaut.\nBut even accounting for Friday\u2019s losses, silver is still up more than 150% since this time last year.\nSpot gold prices also fell in Friday trading, although not nearly as steeply as silver. The price of gold was down around 11% shortly before 5 p.m. ET, to around $4,864 a troy ounce.\nAdvertisement\nLike silver, gold has made remarkable gains over the past year, as investors flocked to \u201csafe haven\u201d assets like precious metals as a hedge against uncertainty in financial markets and the global economy. After Friday\u2019s hit, gold was still up more than 70% over the past year.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar traded higher Friday, reversing a downward trend that gained steam on Tuesday, when the U.S. currency had its worst day since April 2025.\nThe twin dynamics on Wall Street of investors selling their safe haven metals, while pushing up the dollar, signals an increase in confidence. This is likely due in part to the popular view that Warsh would be an experienced hand at the wheel of the Fed.\nWarsh is also a longtime monetary \u201chawk\u201d who, during his time on the Fed board, generally opposed lowering interest rates as a way to turbo charge economic growth.\nWarsh has pivoted somewhat over the past year, as he carefully positioned himself in Trump\u2019s camp, criticizing the current Fed and sounding open to lowering rates.\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed slightly down Friday, investors weighed other factors, such as Friday\u2019s unexpectedly sharp rise in the Producer Price Index."

Bulls are talking about a potential breakout and another Silver Squeeze, while bears are pointing at macro headwinds, recession fears, and a cautious Federal Reserve.

It sits right at the crossroads of two powerful forces: safe-haven demand and hardcore industrial usage. That combination is exactly why the current environment is so explosive.\nOn the macro side, traders are glued to every word out of the Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell and co. are trying to walk a tightrope between still-sticky inflation and a slowing global economy. Inflation may not be at peak panic levels anymore, but it is far from comfortably low, and every data print \u2013 CPI, PCE, jobs, ISM \u2013 feeds straight into the narrative of whether the Fed stays tighter for longer or starts cutting more aggressively.\nHere is the tension:\n- If the Fed sounds hawkish and keeps rates elevated, the US dollar tends to stay firm, real yields stay resilient, and that usually puts pressure on Silver. Strong dollar plus positive real yields is traditionally a headwind for precious metals, because holding cash or bonds becomes more attractive.\n- If the Fed pivots dovish \u2013 hinting at more cuts, or openly worrying about growth \u2013 then the narrative flips. Suddenly, hard assets and real money alternatives like Silver and Gold look far more attractive as hedges against policy mistakes, currency debasement, and long-term inflation risk.\nOn top of that, there is geopolitics. Ongoing tensions in different regions, fragile supply chains, and energy market uncertainty all feed into the safe-haven component of Silver. When risk-off waves hit, traders rush into Gold first, but Silver often follows with a higher beta move \u2013 bigger swings both up and down.\nAt the same time, the industrial story is growing louder. Silver is a critical input in electronics, 5G hardware, medical tech, and especially green energy. Solar panels, EVs, battery tech, and grid infrastructure demand all lean on Silver as an irreplaceable conductor. When markets rotate into the \u201cgreen boom\u201d narrative, Silver gets bid not just as Poor Man's Gold, but as a must-have industrial metal.\nSo today\u2019s price action is not random. It is the product of:\n- Uncertain Fed path and interest-rate expectations.\n- Mixed but elevated inflation dynamics.\n- A strong-yet-wobbly US dollar.\n- Geopolitical stress keeping safe-haven flows alive.\n- Structural industrial demand from the energy transition and tech build-out.\nCombine that with retail \u201cSilver Squeeze\u201d culture and aggressive futures positioning, and you get a market where moves can go from calm to chaotic in a single session.\nDeep Dive Analysis: Let us break this down like a serious trader, not just a hype consumer.\n1. Macro-Economics: Fed, Inflation, and the Dollar\nThe Fed is still trapped in a balancing act. Inflation has cooled off from the extremes, but core components remain sticky. The labor market is softer than peak but not broken. That kind of in-between macro regime is brutal for clear trend trades, but it is perfect for volatility.\nFor Silv"

You\u2019re reading an excerpt \u2212 sign up to get the whole newsletter in your inbox.\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably heard the news: Australia has an inflation problem. I\u2019m not talking about a run on bouncing castles (unfortunately I\u2019m still waiting for that day), but the much more sobering issue that everything just keeps getting more and more expensive.\nAt the end of January we were hit with the news that headline inflation, otherwise known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), rose 3.8 per cent in the 12 months to December, an increase from 3.4 per cent in November. This led the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates on Tuesday, with warnings more hikes might be required as inflation is set to get \u201cmaterially\u201d higher.\nJust as a refresher, CPI measures the percentage change in the price of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, including things such as groceries, fuel, housing and recreation. The most recent increases were fuelled by a jump in electricity prices, and other areas such as red meat also rose.\nWhat\u2019s the problem?\nBy now, most of us know that high inflation prompts rate rises from the RBA, as forcing people to spend more on their mortgages means they spend less elsewhere, lowering the demand for goods which then, in turn, lowers their prices (at least in theory).\nThis leads to the general view that high inflation is bad for mortgage holders and good for savers. It\u2019s also bad for anyone who has to buy things that cost money, so, all of us.\nWhat you can do about it\nBut there are a number of lesser known situations where inflation can actually be a good thing, so if you\u2019re searching for a silver lining to this whole debacle, read on:\n- A boon for your super: While those of us who are working are quietly (or loudly) grouching about rising prices, those who are retired or nearing retirement might actually be viewing it as a positive. This is because the CPI measure directly affects two crucial parts of our superannuation system: your contribution caps, which dictate how much you can put into super each year, and the Transfer Balance Cap (TBC), which restricts how much super you can move into the tax-free retirement phase. These are both reviewed each financial year, explains Gemma Mitchell, head of education at Rask, and the CPI figure is a critical aspect the government considers when looking at how much to increase them by. \u201cBased on current inflation and economic data, there\u2019s growing expectation that from July 1 we could see the concessional contributions cap increase to $32,500, and the non-concessional cap increase to $130,000 per year,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201c[Similarly] there\u2019s a strong likelihood the TBC could increase again to $2.1 million.\u201d This is great for anyone looking to add more to their super, and while it might not seem like much of a boon now, it can make all the difference once you retire.\n- Good for (some) investments: As inflation rises, it can have different effects on shares and investments, William Buck partner Scott Girdlestone explains. Assets such as bonds or term deposits, which provide investors with a fixed rate of return, can become much less appealing in a high inflation environment as their payouts don\u2019t keep up with rising inflation. \u201cBy contrast, some companies can adjust their prices when their own costs rise, so parts of the share market may hold up better in an inflationary environment,\u201d Girdlestone says \u201cThese include materials, which we\u2019ve seen has been a solid performer in the Australian equity market over the past few months as inflation pressures have moved higher.\u201d Keeping a focus on more staid, \u201cboring\u201d stocks (known as value stocks) over high-growth businesses can also be a smart move. Overall, Girdlestone stresses the importance of having a diversified portfolio in times of hig"

It details that consumption surged to 3.2K tons ($3.2M) in 2024, driven overwhelmingly by Turkey, which accounts for 69% of volume. The market is forecast to grow slowly to 3.4K tons ($3.4M) by 2035. A significant supply-demand gap exists, with regional production falling to 884 tons, leading to high import dependency, primarily by Turkey. Syria is the largest producer but a minor consumer, while Turkey is the dominant importer and a net exporter of small, high-value volumes.\nKey Findings\n- Market consumption peaked at 3.2K tons in 2024, forecast to reach 3.4K tons by 2035\n- Turkey dominates consumption (69% share) and imports (93% share), with consumption growing at an average 91.1% annually from 2013-2024\n- Regional production (884 tons) meets less than a third of consumption, creating heavy import reliance\n- Syrian Arab Republic is the largest producer (65% share) but a relatively minor consumer\n- Turkey is also the region's leading exporter by value, achieving a high export price of $3,292 per ton in 2024\nMarket Forecast\nDriven by increasing demand for crude cotton-seed oil in the Middle East, the market is expected to continue an upward consumption trend over the next decade. Market performance is forecast to decelerate, expanding with an anticipated CAGR of +0.5% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market volume to 3.4K tons by the end of 2035.\nIn value terms, the market is forecast to increase with an anticipated CAGR of +0.7% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market value to $3.4M (in nominal wholesale prices) by the end of 2035.\nConsumption\nMiddle East's Consumption of Crude Cotton-Seed Oil\nIn 2024, consumption of crude cotton-seed oil increased by 48% to 3.2K tons, rising for the second consecutive year after two years of decline. In general, consumption recorded a remarkable increase. As a result, consumption reached the peak volume of 3.2K tons; afterwards, it flattened through to 2024.\nThe value of the crude cotton-seed oil market in the Middle East soared to $3.2M in 2024, increasing by 62% against the previous year. This figure reflects the total revenues of producers and importers (excluding logistics costs, retail marketing costs, and retailers' margins, which will be included in the final consumer price). Over the period under review, consumption recorded resilient growth. Over the period under review, the market reached the peak level at $3.3M in 2020; however, from 2021 to 2024, consumption failed to regain momentum.\nConsumption By Country\nTurkey (2.2K tons) constituted the country with the largest volume of crude cotton-seed oil consumption, comprising approx. 69% of total volume. Moreover, crude cotton-seed oil consumption in Turkey exceeded the figures recorded by the second-largest consumer, Syrian Arab Republic (575 tons), fourfold. Saudi Arabia (262 tons) ranked third in terms of total consumption with an 8.2% share.\nFrom 2013 to 2024, the average annual rate of growth in terms of volume in Turkey totaled +91.1%. The remaining consuming countries recorded the following average annual rates of consumption growth: Syrian Arab Republic (-1.4% per year) and Saudi Arabia (+8.3% per year).\nIn value terms, Turkey ($2.5M) led the market, alone. The second position in the ranking was held by Saudi Arabia ($302K). It was followed by Syrian Arab Republic.\nFrom 2013 to 2024, the average annual rate of growth "

                "body": "Oil finds short-term support as oversupply eases, bearish risks linger\nThe oversupply in the oil market at the beginning of the year is likely to have been sharply lower than previously expected.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its outlook for the global oil market, specifically downgrading its prior expectations concerning the magnitude of the supply surplus.\nThis adjustment was not a recent development but had already been implemented in the preceding month\u2019s market report.\nKey supply drivers\nThis significant recalibration suggests that the IEA now anticipates a tighter balance between crude oil production and global demand than previously modeled, reflecting a reassessment of various factors impacting both the supply and consumption sides of the energy equation.\nSince the beginning of 2025, a strong surge in oil supply has driven the current global surplus.\nNon-OPEC+ producers have been responsible for nearly 60% of the total 3 million barrels per day increase, IEA said in its January monthly report.\nThe increase in OPEC+ supply has been spearheaded by Saudi Arabia as production cuts were lifted.\nConcurrently, the rise in non-OPEC+ output has been primarily driven by five American nations: the United States, Canada, Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina.\nGlobal oil supplies are projected to see a further increase of 2.5 million bpd in 2026.\nAgency forecasts, outages, and inventory snapshot\nThis forecast is contingent on two main factors: that OPEC+ maintains its current production policy, and that there are no significant, sustained disruptions to output, particularly avoiding major downturns in the US shale patch activity.\nCombined with the hefty surplus that has built up in storage tanks and at sea over the past year, this would leave the market with a significant buffer well in excess of demand, which is forecast to increase by 930 kb/d in 2026.\nIn its December report, IEA had said that demand for 2026 was seen at 860,000 bpd this year.\nNext week, the three energy agencies will present their new forecasts, namely OPEC, IEA and the US Energy Information Administration.\n\u201cIn view of the cold weather, they are likely to revise their expectations for global oil demand upwards for the current year, while production expectations are likely to be adjusted downwards due to numerous outages,\u201d Barbara Lambrecht, commodity analyst at Commerzbank AG, said.\nMeanwhile, OPEC\u2019s daily oil production dropped by 230,000 barrels in January compared to December, according to a Bloomberg survey.\nThis decline was partially attributed to lower output from Venezuela, with Kazakhstan also reporting significant production outages.\nOn the other hand, due to the recent winter storm, the EIA will probably adjust the US oil production figures for January, revising them slightly downward.\nUS crude oil inventories dropped by 3.5 million barrels last week, according to EIA\u2019s latest report.\nGasoline stocks rose by 685,000 barrels, while distillate stocks fell by 5.6 million barrels.\nAPI figures showed a greater crude decline (11.1 million barrels), a larger gasoline increase (4.7 million barrels), and a similar distillate drop (4.8 million barrels).\nThe inventory data is distorted by the effects of the winter storm, but the impact was less than expected, according to Commerzbank.\nThe reduction in US crude oil inventories was limited because domestic production only fell by 480,000 barrels per day last week.\nThis modest decline, combined with only a slight dip in crude oil processing and an increase in net crude oil imports, prevented a more substantial decrease in stockpiles.\nAnalyst assessment and long-term price view\n\u201cAll in all, the oversupply in the oil market at the beginning of the year is likely to have been significantly lower than previously expected,\u201d Lambrecht said.\nAs energy organisations downgrade their expectations regarding oversupply this year, oil prices could get some temporary support, according to Lambrecht.\n\u201cHowever, we funda"

The pair is caught between a softer U.S. dollar and an unimpressive European Central Bank that has now left policy unchanged for five straight meetings. The dollar side weakened as the U.S. Dollar Index rolled off weekly highs after Michigan Consumer Sentiment rose from 56.4 to 57.3 in February, beating the 55 consensus but not strong enough to extend the latest USD squeeze. At the same time, EUR buyers lean on a solid December export print from Germany, where shipments rose 4% month-on-month versus a 1% forecast, a clear positive surprise for the euro side. With EUR/USD still inside an uptrend that started from the 1.1590 area and the dollar failing to hold gains above the 97.50 DXY region, the pair is trying to stabilize rather than capitulate lower.\nUS data and USD sentiment: strong numbers, but the bid is fading\nThe recent dollar upswing was driven by better U.S. data and haven flows, but the tone has cooled. DXY is backing away from weekly highs and now risks a pullback toward 97.50 and then 97.10\u201397.25 if profit-taking deepens. Michigan sentiment at 57.3 shows the U.S. consumer is not collapsing, yet markets are already debating when the Federal Reserve can ease again, which caps the upside for the USD. The next impulses will come from Non-Farm Payrolls and CPI in the second week of February, where a hot print can re-ignite dollar demand and a soft one can push DXY back toward its recent lows. For EUR/USD that means a tactical range: stronger U.S. data keeps pressure below 1.1919, while any disappointment on jobs or inflation can drive another test of 1.20 and above.\nEuro-side fundamentals: German exports cushion EUR, ECB refuses to lead\nOn the European side, the most tangible positive is the German export beat. A 4% monthly export gain versus 1% expected is a big gap and helps explain why EUR/USD could reclaim and hold 1.1800 despite a firm dollar earlier in the week. It signals external demand for eurozone goods remains more resilient than feared, limiting downside risk for the currency. By contrast, the ECB continues to do almost nothing: five consecutive meetings without a policy change and a communication stance that avoids clear guidance. That passivity leaves EUR trading more off U.S. data and global risk sentiment than off Frankfurt decisions. Still, the absence of new easing and the perception that the rate-cut cycle will be slow prevent EUR bears from pressing for a sustained break below 1.17 unless U.S. data turns decisively in favor of the USD.\nShort-term technical map for EUR/USD: 1.1746/71 support versus 1.1919\u20131.2042 resistance\nTechnically, EUR/USD sits right above a cluster of support that matters on daily and intraday charts. The 1.1746/71 band combines the objective yearly open with the 61.8% retracement of the January rally, creating a strong reference zone. This same region caught today\u2019s rebound after the 2.6% pullback from the 1.2090 area, underlining its importance. Below that, the January low-day close at 1.1645, the 200-day moving average around 1.1618, and the December low at 1.1590 define the next ladder of supports where downside exhaustion can appear if fear returns to the euro. On the topside, the first real resistance sits at 1.1866/75, which includes the 2025 high close and monthly high. Above that, 1.1919 marks the 2025 high itself and is the level that has to give way to confirm that the uptrend is resuming. If EUR/USD can close through 1.1919, the door opens for another run at 1.2020/42, where the 38.2% retracement of t"

The 1.3550\u20131.3570 pocket now acts as primary short-term support; a daily close below it exposes 1.3500 first and then the 1.3460 area around the 50-day moving average. On the topside, supply is concentrated near 1.37\u20131.3720, where rallies have been consistently sold since the BoE decision.\nGBP/USD \u2013 BoE holds at 3.75% but the vote split screams \u201ccuts coming\u201d\nThe Bank of England left Bank Rate at 3.75%, but the Monetary Policy Committee split 5\u20134, with four members already voting for a cut to 3.50%. That narrow margin makes it clear policy is one or two meetings away from the first reduction, not \u201chigher for longer\u201d. After the decision, markets moved from roughly 35 bps of easing priced for 2026 to around 50 bps, immediately cheapening the pound and pushing GBP/USD down through 1.36 toward 1.3550.\nGBP/USD \u2013 Inflation still above target, labour data weakening and BoE cover to ease\nHeadline UK inflation remains above the 2% target, but December data confirmed a downtrend rather than any renewed spike, which gives the BoE room to discuss cuts. The labour market is the clearest drag: unemployment sits near a four-year high around 5.1%, employment dropped by about 43,000 in December and wage growth is rolling over. With core activity soft and private-sector growth subdued, a 3.75% policy rate is clearly restrictive, so expectations for at least two 25 bps cuts over the next 12 months are consistent with the data and negative for GBP/USD on any UK-centric day.\nRead More\n-\nPetrobras Stock Price Forecast 2026: Is PBR a Deep-Value Oil Buy at $14.87?\n07.02.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nEthereum Price Forecast: Can ETH Hold $2,000 and Reach $2,380 Next?\n07.02.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nOil Price Forecast: WTI and Brent Locked in a $60\u2013$70 Geopolitical Range\n07.02.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nStock Market Today: S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow React to Fed Signals and Tech Earnings\n07.02.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveMarkets\n-\nEUR/USD Price Forecast: 1.18 Support in Focus as NFP and CPI Loom\n07.02.2026 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nGBP/USD \u2013 Fed path, US data and why the dollar can support but not crush the pair\nOn the US side, the dollar got a lift when President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair, tilting expectations away from an aggressively dovish stance. At the same time, incoming data is cooling: ADP private payrolls fell to about 22,000 in January, well below the 150,000+ prints seen in stronger quarters; job openings are trending lower and initial jobless claims have pushed into the mid-200,000s. The market still prices roughly two Fed cuts in 2026, so the dollar can rally on risk-off or hawkish headlines, but it is not set up for a sustained bull run, which limits how far GBP/USD can fall without fresh US upside surprises.\nGBP/USD \u2013 Starmer leadership noise, fiscal uncertainty and the political risk premium\nPolitical risk has become an extra headwind for sterling just as BoE expectations turn dovish. Leadership speculation around Prime Minister Starmer, driven by the controversy around Peter Mandelson\u2019s US ambassador nomination and his Epstein links, has raised questions over the stability of the current team. Any threat to Chancellor Reeves or to the fiscal framework forces investors to demand a premium to hold UK assets, which mechanically weighs on the pound and helped push GBP/USD to 10-day lows below 1.3550 after the BoE meeting.\nGBP/USD \u2013 From 1.3870 br"

The bulls mounted an impressive rebound on Friday with a massive outside-day reversal recovering nearly 2.7% off the lows.

Subsequent resistance objectives are eyed at the 1.382% extension of the broader 2020 advance near 7138 and the 100% extension of the November rally at 7240.\nBottom line: An outside-day reversal off the lows takes the S&P 500 back into a key resistance zone that has capped the equity rally since October.

                "body": "USD/JPY rebounded as Japanese economic data and the upcoming national election sank the yen.\nJapan goes to the polls on Sunday, February 8, with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enjoying impressive approval ratings. Expectations of a landslide win fueled concerns about Prime Minister Takaichi pursuing her fiscal policy plans unchallenged, weighing on the yen.\nMeanwhile, a sharp drop in Japanese household spending tempered bets on a near-term Bank of Japan rate hike, adding to the yen\u2019s pullback.\nUSD/JPY rallied 1.57% to close the week at 157.18, underscoring sentiment toward the BoJ policy stance and the prospects of a landslide win on February 8. Despite last week\u2019s pullback, the medium-term outlook is cautiously bearish, as monetary policy divergence continues to favor the yen.\nBelow, I examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nJapan\u2019s national election will be the main event of the week ahead. A landslide victory that gives the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) a simple majority (233 seats) in the Lower House and the LDP-Japan Innovation Party (JIP) coalition a supermajority (310 seats or more) will be key for near-term USD/JPY trends.\nAn LDP simple majority and an LDP-JIP supermajority would allow the coalition to override vetoes from the Upper House. Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s strengthened position would allow for unchallenged fiscal spending legislation. Amid concerns about Japan\u2019s more than 240% debt-to-GDP ratio, a free rein on legislation would likely push the debt-to-GDP ratio higher.\nNotably, 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields soared from an October 3 level of 1.659% to a January 20 high of 2.382%. The sharp increase in risk premium for holding 10-year JGBs underscored worries about debt-to-GDP.\nSoaring 10-year JGB yields triggered the yen sell-off and USD/JPY climb from 147.056 to a January 14 high of 159.454.\nThe prospect of an LDP-JIP supermajority in the Lower House supports the bullish short-term outlook for USD/JPY. However, yen intervention threats are likely to continue capping the upside below 160 as seen in January.\nMeanwhile, a supermajority would remove the need for Prime Minister Takaichi to make concessions with smaller coalition parties. Over the longer term, this is likely to give the LDP greater control over legislation and ensure prudent fiscal spending, supporting a bearish medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nWhile the election result will be key to near-term price trends, Japanese economic data will influence the BoJ\u2019s policy stance. On Monday, February 9, wage growth will fuel speculation about a BoJ rate hike. Economists expect average cash earnings to rise 3% year-on-year in December, following a 0.5% increase in November.\nA sharp upswing in wage growth would align with the BoJ\u2019s outlook on wages and growing support for rate hikes.\nFor context, higher wages could boost households\u2019 purchasing power, offsetting the effects of rising import prices. Increased purchasing power, coupled with improving consumer sentiment, would indicate a pickup in spending. Higher spending would fuel demand-driven inflation and bolster the economy, given that private consumption accounts for around 55% of GDP.\nCrucially, these scenarios would align with the BoJ\u2019s hawkish quarterly projections, which sent USD/JPY down 1.64% on January 23.\nHowever, leading inflation indicators will also be key given Tokyo\u2019s softer consumer prices in January. Economists expect producer prices to rise 2.3% year-on-year in January, down from 2.4% in December. Holding above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target may revive bets on an H1 2026 rate hike, boosting demand for the yen. A stronger yen would send USD/JPY lower, supporting the bearish medium-term price outlook.\nFollow real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nWhile Japan\u2019s election and Japanese economic data will affect the yen, US economic indicators and Fed rhetoric will influence buying int"

                "body": "A weaker US dollar has done most of the heavy lifting, and CIBC thinks CUSMA renegotiation risks and sticky tariffs could still shape the Canadian dollar\u2019s next move.\n1 day ago \u2022 2 mins\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nCIBC says the Canadian dollar\u2019s recent lift is mostly a US dollar story, as investors reassess risk amid conflict and trade uncertainty.\nWhat does this mean?\nThe loonie\u2019s been climbing because the greenback\u2019s been sliding. CIBC thinks that tailwind could fade as markets refocus on renegotiation risk around CUSMA, the Canada\u2013US\u2013Mexico trade pact. Even so, it expects a slow strengthening, with USD/CAD at 1.37 in Q1 2026, 1.36 in Q2, and 1.34 by end-2026. Tariffs are the wild card: CIBC sees aluminum duties as easier to unwind because they raise US input costs, while autos, lumber, and steel look stickier. A renewed CUSMA or a US Supreme Court decision limiting..\nIEEPA-based tariffs could push many imports back toward low \u201cmost favored nation\u201d rates.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Trade rules are doing the heavy lifting.\nCIBC\u2019s point is that CAD isn\u2019t being driven by local data as much as by US sentiment and tariff risk. It also argues the interest-rate gap may be less of a catalyst from here: the bank expects the Bank of Canada to hold this year while the Fed cuts twice more, with the next cut likely in June. If that path is already priced in, then clearer trade policy and growth expectations will matter more for Canadian assets, especially export-exposed sectors.\nThe bigger picture: Tariffs can boomerang back as inflation.\nWhen duties push up domestic costs, they can become harder to defend, which is why aluminum may be more negotiable than autos, lumber, or steel. CIBC says Canada\u2019s growth cooled in Q4 and unemployment is above a healthy level, but it expects core inflation to drift back toward the Bank of Canada\u2019s target as softer rents feed into CPI. Fewer barriers plus calmer inflation would be the cleanest route to a sturdier loonie later this year.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "- United States\n- /\n- Capital Markets\n- /\n- NYSE:BLK\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF Volatility Raises New Questions On Systemic Risk\n- BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, saw record trading volumes and options activity during a sharp market sell off.\n- Reports indicate leveraged positions tied to IBIT may have contributed to hedge fund failures and faster market downside.\n- The episode has raised questions about the ETF\u2019s systemic importance and its role in amplifying short term volatility.\nFor an asset manager of BlackRock\u2019s scale, NYSE:BLK, the episode is more than a single product story. IBIT sits at the intersection of traditional ETFs and digital assets, an area that has drawn growing attention from both institutions and regulators. For you as an investor, it is a live case study in how new structures can affect liquidity and trading behavior across markets.\nLooking ahead, the key issues are how risk is managed around leveraged trades tied to products like IBIT and how regulators respond to this kind of stress event. You may want to watch for any changes in ETF rules, margin practices, or disclosure standards that emerge, as these can influence how products linked to Bitcoin and other digital assets fit into a diversified portfolio.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for BlackRock by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on BlackRock.\nWhy BlackRock could be great value\nRecord IBIT volumes and options activity during the sell off suggest BlackRock has quickly become a central conduit for Bitcoin exposure, concentrating a lot of short term positioning in a single ETF. For you, that highlights how quickly capital can move through BlackRock\u2019s platform when risk appetite shifts. This can magnify both liquidity and volatility signals compared with more fragmented trading on crypto exchanges.\nHow this turbulence fits into the BlackRock Narrative\nThe IBIT episode sits alongside BlackRock\u2019s push into private markets, infrastructure and technology platforms like Aladdin and eFront. These initiatives focus on being the core operating system for client capital rather than just a product manufacturer. Compared with other global managers such as Vanguard and State Street, BlackRock\u2019s growing role in Bitcoin ETFs, private market SMAs and infrastructure bids suggests it is leaning into complex, higher-touch segments. Episodes like this then become part of its broader risk management story.\nRisks and rewards highlighted by IBIT\u2019s volatility\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Concentrated flows and leveraged options activity around IBIT can increase short term volatility and headline risk for BlackRock when crypto markets sell off.\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Greater systemic visibility in Bitcoin and private markets may draw additional regulatory scrutiny and higher compliance costs over time.\n- \ud83c\udf81 Very high IBIT trading volumes reinforce BlackRock\u2019s role as a preferred access point for digital assets. This can support fee-based relationships if investors stay engaged.\n- \ud83c\udf81 The firm\u2019s broader alternatives and tech platforms give it multiple revenue streams beyond Bitcoin ETFs. Some investors may see this as helpful when any single product faces stress.\nWhat to watch next\nFrom here, you may want to watch how IBIT flows, options activity and any regulatory commentary evolve, and whether BlackRock adjusts product design or risk limits in response. If you want to see how other investors are thinking about BlackRock\u2019s long term story versus short term IBIT volatility, check community narratives on this dedicated BlackRock page.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

There were several macro downturns, too, that capped BTC\u2019s uptrend, like trade tariffs and wars.\nDespite that, BTC holds its level, making it now seen as \u201ca hedge against inflation\u201d more than ever. Major players, including MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and several other entities, are boldly adding BTC to their balance sheets, signaling unshakable adoption and confidence in its future.\nThe market enthusiasm is at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: \u201cCan Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?\u201d and \u201cWill it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?\u201d This Bitcoin price prediction 2026 \u2013 2030 dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop.\nCoinpedia\u2019s BTC Price Prediction 2026\nIn December 2025, Bitcoin price faced resistance leading to a decline to $80,738 by January\u2019s end. This slipped to 200-day EMA by early February. Now, a demand spike is seen but if it jumps beyond $70K, a retest of $80K-$85K is expected; below $65K could lead to a drop to $53K in Q1 2026.\nThe BTC price may range between $67,364.44 and $71,681.31 today.\nBitcoin Price Today\nBitcoin February Price Prediction 2026\nIn early February, BTC dipped to $60, and the next day the fall reversed, briefly touching $ 70 K. Now, if it breaches $70K, we can see a retest of $75K and $80K, but if it fails to clear $70K, a fall to $65K is imminent, which could extend even further.\nBitcoin Price Prediction 2026\nIn December 2025, the Bitcoin price retested the lower border of the ascending wedge pattern as resistance, with a slight bullish attempt that proved to be a fakeout, leading to a deeper decline. This is exactly what was witnessed in January, when the fall worsened to $80738 by the end of January, and early February even briefly penetrated the 200-day EMA band. But a sudden spike came from this area, as it was an earlier demand area. If it moves beyond $70K a retest of $80K-$85K range is expected. But if the 200-EMA is lost, then the $65K support area holds extreme value. If BTC/USD doesn\u2019t take support and keeps falling, the odds suggest that, beneath $65K, Q1 2026 could see the price fall towards $53K.\nBitcoin Price On-chain Outlook\nThe on-chain data has showed strong accumulation in 2025 and sustained declines in exchange reserves. Crucially, this confirms the elevated institutional commitment, which is evident even in the US Spot ETFs data figures and the corporate adoption also reinforces this trend, with public company holdings nearly doubling since the start of the year.\nUltimately, a Bitcoin price prediction 2025 suggests that the future potential depends strictly on how sustained buying demand remains, as well as geopolitical stability and regulatory clarity.\nIf the current bullish sentiment persists, the BTC price is expected to reach a cycle high target of $150,000. Conversely, should global uncertainty intensify and sentiment turn negative, the downside risk is projected to find strong support around the $70,000 mark.\nAlso Read: What is Bitcoin?

Blockchain annual revenue is currently about $7 to $8 billions. As mainstream adoption accelerates, industry revenue will scale to hundreds of billions of dollars, and projects that generate revenue will be rewarded.\nSecond, AiFi. AI agents will use cryptocurrency, stablecoins, and DeFi instead of bank accounts, and its scale is difficult to estimate.\nThird, the decline of fiat currencies. As fiat currencies depreciate, the world will turn to hard currencies, including BTC.\nFourth, institutional adoption. Institutional adoption of cryptocurrency is a decade-long major trend, and its scale will be measured in trillions.\nFifth, regulatory progress. The benefits of proactive regulation have yet to be realized. The Genius Act will take effect in January 2027. After regulatory clarity, investment and mainstream adoption will see hockey stick growth.\nSixth, the stablecoin supercycle. Although stablecoin assets under management have temporarily stagnated at $300 billions, in the future they will grow to several trillions, becoming the backbone of global payment rails in the 21st century.\nSeventh, tokenization. Currently, only $20 billions in assets have been tokenized, while the total value of global stocks, bonds, and real estate markets reaches hundreds of trillions, with a market penetration rate of less than 0.1%.\nEighth, DeFi revival. With the tokenization of RWA assets and improved protocol tokenomics after regulatory clarity, the scale of DeFi will expand by 100 times.\nNinth, Ethereum's \"Steve Jobs returns moment.\" Vitalik Buterin's return to the Ethereum ecosystem is likened to Steve Jobs' return to Apple in 1996, and Ethereum's development is set to enter a period of explosive growth."

Of them, a DeFi project dubbed World Liberty Financial might be the biggest.\nThe platform, which President Trump co-founded, according to its website, along with his three sons, wants to make finance \"reliable, open, and made for how the world works today.\"\nWorld Liberty Financial was announced by President Trump's son Eric in August 2024.

                "body": "Analysts Agree: BitMine Immersion Is the Reason Behind Ethereum Beating Bitcoin\nKey Points\nThis marks two consecutive months of Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in capital inflows, driven by institutional interest in ETH\u2019s DeFi and staking utility.\nAnalysts attribute Ethereum\u2019s boom to BitMine Immersion Technologies\u2018 (BMNR) aggressive ETH accumulation strategy, positioning it as a key driver of market dynamics.\nNvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of \u2018Next Nvidia Stocks\u2019 that could be even better. Click here to learn more.\nEthereum\u2019s Surge Outpaces Bitcoin\nFor two consecutive months, Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) has eclipsed Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) in capital inflows, marking a seismic shift in the crypto market. In July, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw robust inflows, outstripping Bitcoin ETFs, which experienced net outflows.\nSpecifically, Ethereum ETFs attracted $1.87 billion in net inflows, while Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.02 billion in net outflows. This trend intensified in August, with Ethereum funds drawing $3.95 billion in net inflows compared to Bitcoin\u2019s $301 million in net outflows, according to CCN data.\nThis sustained momentum reflects growing institutional enthusiasm for Ethereum, driven by its utility in decentralized finance (DeFi), staking yields, and tokenized assets. Analysts agree, there is a single catalyst behind Ethereum\u2019s dominance: BitMine Immersion Technologies (NASDAQ:BMNR), a company aggressively reshaping the crypto treasury landscape.\nBitMine\u2019s Bold Ethereum Bet\nBitMine Immersion, under the leadership of Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, has pivoted from Bitcoin mining to an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy since the end of June. The company aims to amass 5% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply, a goal valued at over $20 billion at current prices.\nBy the end of August, BitMine held 1.845 million ETH, worth approximately $8.54 billion, making it the largest Ethereum treasury company (ETC) globally, surpassing Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) Bitcoin holdings in scale. It is no coincidence, then, that Ethereum's surge began just as BitMine began buying.\nBitMine\u2019s strategy includes raising significant capital -- $250 million in June and a planned $24.5 billion stock sale -- to fuel its ETH acquisitions. Using immersion cooling technology, BitMine enhances mining efficiency by 25% to 30%, generating revenue to reinvest in ETH purchases while staking a portion of its holdings for 3% to 4% annual yields. This dual approach has attracted institutional heavyweights like ARK Invest, Founders Fund, and Pantera Capital.\nThe Rise of Ethereum Treasury Companies\nBitMine isn\u2019t alone in its Ethereum ambitions. The emergence of Ethereum treasury companies (ETC) reflects a broader trend of corporate adoption. SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ:SBET) pioneered this model, becoming the first ETC by integrating ETH into its balance sheet.\nHowever, BitMine\u2019s aggressive buying has propelled it past SharpLink to claim the title of the largest ETC. Other firms, like ETHzilla (NASDAQ:ETHZ), have also entered the fray, but BitMine\u2019s scale and pace are unmatched, with its stock soaring over 2,000% since June.\nAdvertisement\nDespite this, BMNR\u2019s stock price dipped 18% in the past week, closing out last week at $43.62 per share, reflecting volatility tied to its $20 billion equity raise and concerns over shareholder dilution.\nInstitutional Backing Fuels Confidence\nBitMine\u2019s meteoric rise is bolstered by robust institutional support. Investors like Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, and Galaxy Digital have backed the company, drawn to its high trading liquidity -- $6.4 billion in average daily volume -- and its strategic alignment with Ethereum\u2019s growing role in DeFi and tokenized assets.\nTom Lee\u2019s bullish outlook, predicting ETH could reach $80,000 long-term, underscores BitMine\u2019s confidence in Ethereum as a macro asset. The company\u2019s ability to raise capital efficiently and its staking strategy further enhance its appea"

                "body": "Blazpay vs Bitcoin vs Solana: Crypto Presale 2026 Highlights an Emerging AI Crypto Presale\nThe AI crypto presale narrative in Crypto Presale 2026 is increasingly shaped by platforms that combine intelligent automation, ecosystem depth, and real-world functionality. As capital attention spreads across established networks and early-stage platforms, market focus is shifting toward presale models that demonstrate tangible utility rather than speculative momentum alone.Within this environment, Blazpay ($BLAZ) is positioning itself as an AI crypto presale focused on enhancing how users and businesses interact with decentralized finance. While Bitcoin and Solana remain foundational to the broader digital asset ecosystem, Blazpay represents a presale cryptocurrency designed to unify DeFi services, rewards, and integration tools under a single framework. As the crypto presale landscape evolves, these differing models illustrate how Crypto Presale 2026 is redefining value creation across Web3.\nBlazpay Presale Update: Phase 8 Marks a Strategic Expansion\nBlazpay ($BLAZ) has officially transitioned from Presale Phase 7 into Phase 8, reflecting steady participation and growing ecosystem confidence. Phase 7 concluded at a token price of $0.0178, with 262.47 million tokens sold out of a total allocation of 282.04 million. The project has raised approximately $2.41 million, with the crypto presale now 88.7% complete.\nRather than positioning itself as a single-use protocol, Blazpay continues to expand as a modular DeFi platform built for both individuals and enterprises. Phase 8 introduces BlazRocket and NFT Marketplace V2, expanding the platform's scope into interactive participation. NFTs evolve through gameplay rather than passive holding, while BlazBob NFTs add staking-based earning mechanics. Together, these elements link gaming, NFTs, and rewards into a unified experience aligned with the AI crypto presale narrative.\nBlazpay Utilities Supporting the AI Crypto Presale Model: Gamified Rewards And B2B API/SDK\nBlazpay integrates Gamified Rewards as a core engagement layer rather than a secondary feature. This system transforms DeFi interaction into an interactive experience where users earn rewards through participation, progression, and activity rather than simple asset holding.\nWithin the context of crypto presale platforms, gamified mechanics encourage sustained ecosystem engagement while aligning incentives across trading, staking, and NFT participation. This approach positions Blazpay as a presale cryptocurrency focused on user retention and long-term platform activity, reinforcing its relevance among the best crypto presales emerging in 2026.\nThe B2B API/SDK enables developers and enterprises to embed Blazpay's multi-chain DeFi functionality directly into their own applications. This utility expands the platform's reach beyond retail usage, allowing third-party platforms to integrate payments, DeFi access, and blockchain interactions without building infrastructure from scratch.\nAs AI crypto presale projects increasingly emphasize enterprise adoption, Blazpay's B2B integration capability strengthens its positioning as a presale cryptocurrency with scalable, real-world applicability.\n$2000 Investment Scenario: Evaluating Presale Cryptocurrency Exposure\nA hypothetical $2000 allocation during Phase 8 of the Blazpay crypto presale illustrates how early participation aligns with ecosystem-driven growth rather than market-wide price cycles. At current presale pricing, such an allocation reflects exposure to a platform actively rolling out utilities rather than awaiting post-launch development.\nUnlike mature assets whose price action is influenced primarily by macro liquidity, presale cryptocurrency valuations are closely tied to roadmap execution and adoption milestones. In the AI crypto presale segment, this dynamic continues to attract participants seeking early exposure to functional platforms.\n$2000 Price Projection Outlook\nFrom a forwar"

This subtle uptick, set against a backdrop of \"Extreme Fear\" in the market, might seem insignificant at first glance, but for Forward Industries, a company strategically aligned with Solana, it signals a transformative opportunity. Why does this matter to you? Whether you're a seasoned investor or just dipping your toes into crypto, Solana's unique technology and Forward Industries\u2019 bold moves could redefine market dynamics\u2014and your portfolio\u2014in the months ahead. Curious about what\u2019s driving this optimism and how it could impact Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory toward $150,000? Dive in and get AI-powered insights to stay ahead of the curve.\nThe cryptocurrency landscape, as of February 8, 2026, is a complex puzzle of fear, opportunity, and innovation. With Bitcoin dominance at 56.55% and Ethereum showing a 1.58% gain, altcoins like Solana are carving out their own narrative. Forward Industries, undeterred by market jitters, is doubling down on SOL, betting that its high-speed blockchain could be the key to unlocking massive returns. Stick with us as we unravel why this strategy might just be the hidden gem investors have been searching for.\nLet\u2019s set the stage with the latest market pulse. Solana\u2019s price of $87.79, reflecting a 0.85% uptick over the past 24 hours per CoinGecko, might not scream \u201cbull run,\u201d but it\u2019s a sign of resilience in a market gripped by fear. The Fear & Greed Index, sitting at a chilling 7 as reported by Alternative.me, indicates \"Extreme Fear\"\u2014a sentiment that often spooks investors into inaction. Yet, amidst this uncertainty, Solana stands out as a trending asset, ranked #7 on CoinGecko\u2019s charts.\nBitcoin, the market heavyweight, holds a dominance of 56.55% but saw a 1.64% dip to $69,334. Ethereum, on the other hand, gained 1.58%, hinting at renewed interest in altcoins. What\u2019s driving Solana\u2019s quiet strength? Its network growth and ecosystem expansion are catching eyes, even as broader market volatility persists. For Forward Industries, this isn\u2019t just noise\u2014it\u2019s a signal to act.\nThis isn\u2019t a random bet. Solana\u2019s high throughput and low transaction costs, powered by its proof-of-history consensus mechanism, make it a standout Layer-1 blockchain. As competitors like Ethereum grapple with scalability woes, Solana\u2019s technical edge could be a game-changer. Want to dig deeper into the data? Check the AI analysis for a detailed breakdown of Solana\u2019s metrics.\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway for your investment strategy? First, Solana\u2019s current stability amid market fear suggests it could be an undervalued asset poised for a breakout. For investors, this is a moment to watch closely\u2014extreme fear often precedes sharp reversals as contrarian players step in. Forward Industries\u2019 confidence in SOL, despite the market\u2019s mood, signals a belief in long-term value creation.\nIf you\u2019re holding or considering Solana, the key is patience. Market sentiment can shift quickly, and Solana\u2019s ecosystem\u2014boasting decentralized apps and developer activity\u2014could drive adoption. Forward Industries\u2019 growing SOL holdings also hint at insider optimism, which might inspire confidence in retail investors.\nBut it\u2019s not without risk. Volatility remains high, and regulatory clouds loom large. The actionable step? Stay informed on Solana\u2019s network upgrades and partnerships. And for a data-driven edge, view AI signals for SOL to guide your next move.

                "body": "New York, February 7, 2026, 12:04 EST \u2014 The session has ended.\n- The Dow wrapped up Friday at 50,115.67, climbing 1,206.95 points, or 2.47%\u2014marking its first finish above 50,000.\n- Chipmakers staged a late-week rebound, easing fresh jitters over AI-related spending and software disruption risks facing Big Tech.\n- Next week, investors are bracing for postponed U.S. jobs and inflation data, along with one last round of earnings from blue-chip companies.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through the 50,000 mark for the first time on Friday, ending the day at 50,115.67 after a surge of 1,206.95 points, or 2.47%. Caterpillar rallied 7.1%, handing the price-weighted index its biggest push as it continued to outperform Wall Street\u2019s broader benchmarks this year. \u201cThe Dow is kind of the people\u2019s index,\u201d said Chuck Carlson, CEO of Horizon Investment Services. 1\nThe milestone landing comes on the heels of a punishing run for software and data-services shares. Investors have been recalculating just how much rapidly advancing AI might eat into margins or even upend entire business models. The S&P 500 software and services index tumbled 4.6% Thursday, taking its loss since Jan. 28 to nearly $1 trillion in market cap. At last check, it was trading about 21% under its 200-day moving average \u2014 a key line on many charts. \u201cThere has not been dip-buying \u2026 but we are reaching a watershed moment,\u201d said Nick Giorgi, chief equity strategist at Alpine Macro. 2\nU.S. markets are quiet for the weekend, but eyes are already on a jam-packed slate that could determine if Friday\u2019s gains have legs. \u201cRotation is the dominant theme this year,\u201d said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones, though he flagged that tech faces a tough hurdle as investors look to lock in profits. Rate expectations haven\u2019t budged much, he noted\u2014and that steadiness gets put to the test with jobs numbers, inflation data, and earnings from Coca-Cola, Cisco Systems and McDonald\u2019s all coming up next week. 3\nIt was a strong showing across the board on Friday. The S&P 500 tacked on 1.97%, the Nasdaq put up a 2.18% gain, helped as chip names rallied and some of the \u201cold economy\u201d stocks kept pushing higher. Amazon dropped 5.6% after warning of a big jump in AI infrastructure costs, but Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom all surged more than 7%. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index finished 5.7% higher. On the week, the Dow booked a 2.5% rise, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.1% and the Nasdaq lost 1.9%. 4\nDay after day, that tug-of-war is what\u2019s shaping the market: investors are hungry for the revenue jolt from AI, but their patience for the mounting costs is wearing thin. Reuters puts total AI outlays by Big Tech in 2026 at around $600 billion; Amazon\u2019s got a $200 billion capex blueprint on the table, and Alphabet says its own capital spending could double this year. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the trade is over, but it got too pricey,\u201d said Andrew Wells, chief investment officer at SanJac Alpha. 5\nThe way the Dow is built plays a big role. Because it\u2019s price-weighted, stocks with bigger share prices\u2014think Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs\u2014move the needle more than cheaper ones, regardless of the company\u2019s market cap. That dynamic means a handful of high-priced names can prop up the Dow, especially when growth stocks are getting hammered elsewhere, like in the tech-skewed Nasdaq.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s messaging remains a moving target. On Friday, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d looking out to 2026, though he emphasized that \u201cthe extent and timing\u201d of future rate moves will depend on the data and risk calculus. Jefferson also flagged the possibility that AI-fueled investment could drive inflation higher for a period if there\u2019s no policy response. 6\nStill, there\u2019s a weak link in this rally. Should fresh U.S. numbers surprise to the upside\u2014or if investors turn skittish about profit margins getting squeezed as spending outpaces revenue\u2014the week\u2019s sector shift m"

Blue chips are swinging between cautious optimism and sudden selloffs as traders price in the next Fed move, shifting bond yields, and a global economy that looks fragile but not broken. This is classic Wall Street confusion \u2013 and confusion is exactly where big opportunities are born.\nWant to see what people are saying?

Not full-blown panic, not irrational euphoria \u2013 just a tense, nervous market trying to price in a new regime after years of ultra-cheap money.\nHere are the big drivers behind the Dow\u2019s recent swings:\n- Fed Policy & Rate Expectations: Jerome Powell and the Fed are in data-dependent mode. Markets are constantly trying to front-run the next pivot: will the Fed hold rates high for longer, or start cutting earlier if growth cools? Every press conference, every speech, every line in the FOMC statement is getting dissected by algos and traders. When the Fed sounds more hawkish than expected, the Dow often sees pressure, especially in rate-sensitive names like industrials and financials. When the tone softens even slightly, the index can snap into a sharp relief rally.\n- Inflation Data (CPI, PPI, PCE): Inflation is off its peak but still not completely tamed. A hotter-than-expected CPI or PPI print sparks fear that rates stay higher for longer, hurting valuations and compressing multiples. Softer inflation numbers, on the other hand, fuel the narrative of a potential soft landing where growth holds up while inflation cools. The Dow lives and dies by that narrative swings right now.\n- US Earnings Season: Blue-chip giants in the Dow \u2013 banks, industrials, consumer names, healthcare titans \u2013 are dropping earnings that look mixed. Some are surprising to the upside with resilient revenues and solid margins; others are warning about slower demand, higher wage costs, or global headwinds. The market is rewarding companies that show pricing power and cost discipline, while punishing any hint of weak forward guidance. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing those sudden gap-ups and gap-downs among individual Dow components around the Opening Bell.\n- Recession Fears vs Soft Landing: This is the tug-of-war shaping sentiment. One camp says the US economy holds up: strong labor market, decent consumer spending, stabilizing housing. The other camp warns that lagged effects of higher rates will eventually hit growth, earnings, and employment. The Dow, as a classic old-school index packed with industrials and mature blue chips, is a direct referendum on that debate.\nRight now, the tape feels like a grinding, indecisive phase \u2013 ugly for impatient traders, but powerful for those who can think a few months ahead.\nDeep Dive Analysis: Macro, Yields, Dollar \u2013 the stuff that really moves the Dow\nTo understand where the Dow might go next, you cannot just stare at the candles. You need to watch the macro trifecta: bond yields, the US dollar, and liquidity conditions.\n1. Bond Yields \u2013 the silent wrecking ball (or rocket fuel)\nUS Treasury yields are the invisible hand behind almost every big Dow move:\n- Rising yields "

                "body": "^DJI Today, February 07: Nvidia-Led Surge Lifts Dow Past 50,000\nDow Jones 50,000 became reality today as the index finished at 50,115.66, up 2.47%. A rebound in AI hardware sparked risk-taking, with blue chips leading and tech strength spilling across sectors. The S&P 500 rose 1.97% and the Nasdaq gained 2.18%. This milestone signals confidence in earnings and capex tied to AI, even as investors weigh durability. For Canadians, currency, hedging choices, and cross\u2011border diversification now matter more. See context from CNBC.\nWhat Drove the Record Close\nAn AI hardware rebound led sentiment, with NVDA seen as the bellwether for data centre spend and accelerated computing. Strong demand signals for GPUs and networking helped restore confidence that AI capex can support earnings this quarter. That narrative pulled cyclical and tech-adjacent names higher as investors rotated toward cash\u2011generative leaders and away from recent defensives.\nThe rally was broad. The S&P 500 advanced 1.97% while the Nasdaq added 2.18%, supporting the Dow\u2019s surge to Dow Jones 50,000. Advances outpaced declines, suggesting healthy participation and liquidity. Canadian and U.S. markets strengthened together, highlighting cross\u2011border sentiment support for risk assets, as reported by Toronto Star.\nWhy It Matters in Canada\nDow Jones 50,000 can lift confidence for Canadians holding U.S. equities in RRSPs and TFSAs. Gains priced in USD may amplify or soften once converted to CAD. We see more attention on hedged versus unhedged ETFs. Unhedged products benefit when USD rises, while hedged solutions reduce currency swings that can offset equity returns during CAD strength.\nThe move underscores demand for semis, networking, and cloud infrastructure, which supports suppliers and service firms that list or operate in Canada. Energy and materials can also benefit if AI-linked investment drives power needs and construction. We expect more interest in Canadian datacentre real estate, utilities, and industrials that enable capacity builds and grid upgrades.\nMomentum Check and Risks\nMomentum is hot as Dow Jones 50,000 clears a key psychological level. Short\u2011term gauges like RSI near 65 and CCI above 100 signal strong, possibly overbought, conditions. After large up days, pullbacks of 1% to 2% are common. We would watch follow\u2011through breadth, new 52\u2011week highs, and volatility trends to confirm trend quality in the days ahead.\nFebruary earnings are the next catalyst. Updates on AI spending plans and supply availability will shape expectations. Nvidia reports on February 25, which may reset views on demand, pricing, and margin durability. If guidance stays firm, leadership can persist. If supply chains or orders slip, equities tied to AI hardware could see fast swings around results.\nPortfolio Moves to Consider\nWe prefer building core positions with low-cost index funds and broad U.S. equity ETFs, using dollar\u2011cost averaging instead of chasing gaps after Dow Jones 50,000. Canadian investors can choose CAD\u2011hedged or unhedged exposure depending on views of CAD. A small cash buffer can help buy routine dips and rebalance as volatility normalizes.\nWe would reset target weights after the rally, trimming outsized winners and reinforcing underweights in a measured way. Keep position sizes clear, use alert levels, and avoid leverage creep. Hold quality cash alternatives in CAD for liquidity. Place U.S. equity exposure in RRSPs to reduce withholding tax, and use TFSAs for growth names.\nFinal Thoughts\nDow Jones 50,000 reflects strong earnings confidence and an AI investment cycle that continues to pull capital toward blue chips and growth leaders. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq gains show breadth, not just a single-stock move. For Canadians, the key is how USD exposure and hedging choices translate gains into CAD. We would keep core U.S. exposure, add on pullbacks, and rebalance to control risk. Watch February earnings for confirmation that AI capex remains healthy, with Nvidia\u2019s February "

                "body": "Among those currently scheduled to release results next week:\nAstraZeneca on track to meet 2025 numbers, assurance needed on future targets\nAstraZeneca headed into its final quarter with strong momentum, and while there was no upgrade following third-quarter results, we continue to see potential for results to land a little stronger than expected. The market forecasts to beat are for growth of 8.4% in revenue to $58.6bn, and 7.7% in operating profit to $18.3bn, although there can be no guarantees.\nWhen the company\u2019s shares were admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange this week, Astra reiterated its confidence in reaching its 2030 revenue target of $80bn. 2025 saw strong clinical progress on drugs whose peak annual revenue potential collectively exceeded $10bn. But analysts look like they still need some convincing that the 2030 target is achievable. Guidance for 2026 and beyond will be the key metrics to monitor.\nBarratt Redrow hoping to build towards full-year guidance\nBarratt Redrow\u2019s had a decent start to its financial year, with total completions up 7.9% to 3,665 new homes between July and October. Sales rates have only dipped slightly over the period, despite rising uncertainty ahead of the UK Budget back in November. With that hurdle now out of the way, we\u2019re eager to hear whether demand has shown any signs of picking back up when the group releases its half-year results next week.\nAffordability issues remain top of the agenda for buyers in 2026. With Barratt\u2019s diverse mix of geographical reach and price points, there\u2019s something for everyone. The group\u2019s hoping to build between 17,200-17,800 new homes this year, up 5.6% at the midpoint. Alongside cost-savings from the integration of Redrow into its business, that\u2019s underpinning expectations for full-year pre-tax profit growth of 17.2% to \u00a3572mn. But sales and profits could come under pressure if affordability issues show signs of weighing on demand next week, especially for some of its higher-priced homes.\nUnilever\u2019s sales growth outlook will be in focus following its Ice-Cream demerger\nUnilever\u2019s recent performance has been better than expected, with all business units in growth territory in the third quarter. Next week\u2019s full-year results will mark the first update since the demerger of its ice cream business. Due to this spin-off, markets are forecasting total sales to fall by around 11% to \u20ac54.2bn. A mammoth streamlining of the business is underway though, with the group hoping to have delivered around \u20ac650mn of cost savings over 2025. As a result, operating profits are expected to fall at a slower pace of around 7% to \u20ac10.4bn.\nMore important will be the outlook for 2026, and how that compares to the medium-term underlying sales growth target of 4-6%. Hitting this level will require its current high levels of advertising spending to drive an uplift in brand awareness and market share. We\u2019re cautiously optimistic that 2026 sales growth will come in at the lower end of this target range, before ramping up slowly in the following years.\nThis article is original Hargreaves Lansdown content, published by Hargreaves Lansdown.

Simply enter your email address and never miss a top opportunity again. Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic indecision mode right now: not a euphoric moonshot, not a panic crash, but a tense, nervous range where every ECB headline and every macro data point can flip the script within hours. German blue chips are grinding through a choppy phase where rallies keep getting sold, but deep dips quickly attract hungry dip-buyers. Translation: both Bulls and Bears are awake, and nobody is asleep at the wheel.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch deep-dive DAX breakdowns from real traders on YouTube\n- Scroll through the latest German stock market mood on Instagram\n- Catch fast-paced DAX trading setups going viral on TikTok\nThe Story: What is actually driving the DAX right now? It\u2019s not just one thing \u2013 it\u2019s a cocktail of ECB policy, a fragile German economy, sector rotations, and global risk appetite.\n1. ECB Policy: Christine Lagarde is basically the DJ for the DAX party\nThe European Central Bank sits at the core of the current DAX narrative. After a brutal rate hiking cycle to fight inflation, the ECB is now walking on a razor\u2019s edge: keep policy too tight and you strangle already weak German growth; cut too early and you risk a new inflation flare-up. This balancing act is exactly why the DAX is showing this twitchy, reactive behavior to every press conference and speech.\nWhenever the market senses that Christine Lagarde and the ECB are leaning toward future rate cuts, European equities \u2013 and the DAX especially \u2013 get a boost. Cheaper money means lower financing costs for highly capital-intensive German companies like automakers, industrials, and property-related names. It also supports higher valuations for growth stories like SAP and other tech-driven plays.\nOn the flip side, any hint of \"higher for longer\" or renewed inflation worries quickly triggers selling pressure. German exporters hate a too-strong euro, and the euro/dollar pair is a silent driver here. When the euro strengthens against the dollar, German exporters suddenly look less competitive on global markets. That can weigh on earnings expectations \u2013 and the DAX as a whole gets dragged down.\nECB + EUR/USD cheat sheet for DAX traders:\n- More dovish ECB tone + weaker euro = tailwind for DAX Bulls.\n- More hawkish ECB tone + stronger euro = headwind, Bears get louder.\n- Choppy ECB messaging + volatile euro = exactly the sideways chop and false breakouts we\u2019re seeing.\nRight now, the narrative is shifting from pure inflation fear toward \"recession vs. easing\". The market is starting to price in the idea that the ECB may need to support growth sooner rather than later, which keeps a subtle bid under the DAX \u2013 but the macro data is not strong enough to unlock a clean, unstoppable bull run.\n2. Sector Check: Autos under pressure, SAP and Siemens quietly carrying the index\nIf you want to understand the DAX, you cannot ignore the German auto giants \u2013 Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz \u2013 plus the industrial heavyweight Siemens and the software powerhouse SAP.\nThe Auto Crisis Vibe\nGerman automakers are stuck in a structural identity crisis. On one side, legacy combustion engine lines are under massive regulatory and consumer pressure. On the other, the EV transition is brutally competitive, with Chinese manufacturers offering aggressive pricing and U.S. players pushing strong branding and tech integration.\nKey problems for autos:\n- Margin squeeze: High input costs, expensive technology investments, and price competition in EVs are compressing profitability.\n- Demand uncertainty: With European consumers cautious, car purchase cycles are stretching"

After a stretch of nervous, choppy action, the index is hovering around an important decision zone where bulls and bears are basically trading punches bar for bar. No clean meltdown, no euphoric moon-shot \u2013 just tense, momentum-heavy price action that can flip fast if macro headlines hit.

Germany is still the heavyweight of Europe, but it is carrying some serious baggage: weak manufacturing, energy cost hangovers and a central bank that is trying to look tough while the real economy quietly begs for mercy.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) and its rate path are the main puppet masters here. As long as traders believe the ECB is close to peak rates or even preparing for a cautious pivot, equity markets \u2013 and especially the export-heavy DAX \u2013 can breathe. If the tone shifts back to aggressive anti-inflation talk, the air comes out of the balloon fast.\nChristine Lagarde and the Euro \u2013 why DAX traders care more than ever\nEvery time ECB President Christine Lagarde steps to the mic, DAX traders perk up. Her messaging around inflation, growth risks and future rate decisions directly feeds into three crucial DAX drivers:\n- Discount rate for earnings: Higher rates mean lower present value for future earnings. That hits growth and tech names hard, and weighs on the entire index multiple.\n- Euro vs. US Dollar (EUR/USD): A stronger Euro can hurt German exporters by making their products more expensive globally. A weaker Euro, on the other hand, often acts like a tailwind for DAX companies with big overseas revenues.\n- Risk appetite in Europe: If the ECB looks more supportive and less combative, global funds are more willing to rotate into Europe from US mega caps. Hawkish surprises do the exact opposite.\nRight now, markets are stuck in a tug-of-war between sticky inflation data and visibly slowing growth. That creates a nervous, headline-driven DAX where one speech from Lagarde or one surprise inflation print can flip intraday direction completely.\nEUR/USD as the stealth DAX indicator\nWatch the Euro. When EUR/USD drifts weaker, it often signals:\n- Lower confidence in European growth\n- But potentially better conditions for German exporters in dollar terms\nThat weird combo means you can sometimes see soft macro headlines in Germany but a surprisingly resilient DAX because big exporters and global champions get a currency tailwind. When EUR/USD rips higher, the story can invert: the macro narrative looks prettier, but export margins get squeezed, and the DAX can lag behind US indices.\nECB + EUR/USD + DAX = Trade Setup\nPut simply:\n- Dovish ECB tone + slightly weaker Euro = environment where DAX bulls love to hit the buy-the-dip button.\n- Hawkish ECB shock + stronger Euro = classic trap zone where late bulls can get slammed by profit-taking and sharp pullbacks.\nIf you are trading the DAX without watching ECB meetings, Lagarde speeches and the Euro chart, you are basically playing blindfolded.\nDeep Dive Analysis: Auto Crisis vs. Tech and Industrial Muscle\nThe DAX 40 is no longer just a car index, but the German auto giants still carry huge psychological weight.

                "body": "Earnings Update: Here's Why Analysts Just Lifted Their Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) Price Target To US$195\nShareholders of Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 15% to US$188 following its latest full-year results. Align Technology reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$4.0b and statutory earnings per share of US$5.65, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\nAfter the latest results, the 15 analysts covering Align Technology are now predicting revenues of US$4.19b in 2026. If met, this would reflect a satisfactory 3.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 40% to US$8.02. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$4.17b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.92 in 2026. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Align Technology\nThe consensus price target rose 6.2% to US$195despite there being no meaningful change to earnings estimates. It could be that the analystsare reflecting the predictability of Align Technology's earnings by assigning a price premium. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Align Technology analyst has a price target of US$225 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$150. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Align Technology'shistorical trends, as the 3.7% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 is roughly in line with the 4.4% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 7.8% per year. So although Align Technology is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's forecast to grow slower than the wider industry."

But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. To wit, the TriMas Corporation (NASDAQ:TRS) share price is 52% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 14% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Having said that, the longer term returns aren't so impressive, with stock gaining just 20% in three years.\nSince the stock has added US$54m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nTriMas was able to grow EPS by 67% in the last twelve months. It's fair to say that the share price gain of 52% did not keep pace with the EPS growth. So it seems like the market has cooled on TriMas, despite the growth. Interesting.\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of TriMas' earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nA Different Perspective\nWe're pleased to report that TriMas shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 53% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 1.4% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that TriMas is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is potentially serious...\nTriMas is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

Reported EPS is $0.71, expectations were $0.645.\nOperator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the TPG\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s call is being recorded. Please go to TPG\u2019s IR website to obtain the earnings materials. I will now turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations at TPG. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me today are Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Weingart, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Jim Coulter and our President, Todd Sisitsky, are here with us for the Q&A portion of this call. Nehal Raj is also joining us today for the Q&A session, given his role leading the Software Sector at TPG and as Co-Managing Partner of TPG Capital. I\u2019d like to remind you this call may include forward-looking statements that do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to TPG\u2019s earnings release and SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. TPG undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nWithin our discussion and earnings release, we\u2019re presenting GAAP and non-GAAP measures, and we believe certain non-GAAP measures that we discuss on this call are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the nearest GAAP figures in TPG\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any TPG fund. Looking briefly at our results for the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP net income attributable to TPG Inc. of $77 million and after-tax distributable earnings of $304 million or $0.71 per share of Class A common stock. We declared a dividend of $0.61 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on March 5, 2026, to holders of record as of February 19, 2026.\nWith that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Winkelried: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We look forward to discussing our strong results for the fourth quarter and full year. 2025 was a breakout year for TPG, and we entered 2026 with strong momentum. Before we turn to our results, I did want to briefly touch on a topic that has been top of mind for investors around the intersection of software and AI. This is an important question, but not a new one for us at TPG. As a firm who\u2019s been investing in AI solutions for over a decade, the question of where AI is an opportunity in technology and where it poses a risk is deeply embedded in our investment approach. Let me put our software investing activities in context and talk about our approach across our asset classes.\nToday, software represents 11% of our total AUM with the majority in private equity and minimal exposure in credit. Starting with credit, within our direct lending business, we focus on sponsor-backed companies with strong cash flow profiles, and lend at the top of the capital structure with strong financial covenants that give us a seat at the table. Given our approach, we have not invested heavily in the software sector and have not offered ARR-based loans. Today, software represents approximately 2% of our credit AUM. In private equity, you\u2019ve consistently heard from us on how important our sector-focused and theme-based approach is to our investment activities and we\u2019ve invested in software for more than 20 years. Today, software companies represent 18% of our private equity AUM.\nOur long-standing presence in the software space has enabled us to develop deep expertise and nuanced perspectives on the sector to the companies into which we ultimately invest.

Any sign of illegal activity would prompt formal investigations, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).\nBithumb vowed to co-operate with regulators. \"[We] will take this accident as a lesson and prioritise 'customer trust and peace of mind' rather than external growth,\" CEO Lee Jae-won said.\nThe company plans to pay 20,000 won ($13,66) in compensation to all customers who were using the platform at the time, and will waive trading fees, among other measures.\nBithumb said it would improve verification systems and introduce AI to detect abnormal transactions.\nThe incident is likely to spark discussion around tighter regulatory controls in finance.\nIn April 2024 Citigroup, a US bank, mistakenly credited $81 trillion, instead of $280, to a customer's account. Two employees failed to spot the error before it was processed, but the bank reversed the transaction within hours after a third employee caught the mistake, the Financial Times reported."

During a performance by the band at a Spotify-sponsored Super Bowl party Friday night, he implored ICE agents to resign, saying that they would be thrown under the bus by the Trump administration eventually anyway.\n\u201cTo all the ICE agents out there, wherever you are,\u201d said Armstrong from the stage, \u201cquit your shitty-ass job. Quit that shitty job you have. Because when this is over \u2014 and it will be over at some point in time \u2014 Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, JD Vance, Donald Trump, they\u2019re gonna drop you like a bad fucking habit. Come on this side of the line.\u201d\nArmstrong also changed some of the band\u2019s lyrics to reference topical issues. Singing \u201cHoliday,\u201d he changed the words from \u201cthe representative from California has the floor\u201d to \u201cthe representative from Epstein Island has the floor.\u201d He offered a dedication prior to that same song, saying, \u201cThis goes out to Minneapolis.\u201d Additionally, as he has for years now, Armstrong sang \u201cI\u2019m not part of the MAGA agenda\u201d instead of \u201c\u2026part of a redneck agenda\u201d in \u201cAmerican Idiot.\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nVideo clips of Armstrong\u2019s statements were widely shared from the party, a special invitation-only concert on San Francisco\u2019s Pier 29 on the Embarcadero that was sponsored by FanDuel and Spotify.\nGreen Day is set to perform in the pre-game ceremony at Super Bowl LX, when the group will \u201cusher generations of Super Bowl MVPs onto the field.\u201d An exact time for Green Day\u2019s performance has not been given, but the game itself starts at 6:30 p.m. ET/3:30 PT, with pre-game music likely to be seen in the hour before start time. The full day of pre-game coverage begins at noon ET on NBC.\nThe Seattle Seahawks will face off against the New England Patriots. Other musical performances set to immediately precede the game include Charlie Puth singing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d Brandi Carlile performing \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d and Coco Jones delivering \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing.\u201d\nBad Bunny will perform at the halftime show, with that booking being controversial in some right-leaning pockets of America. An alternative halftime show, due to be telecast from an undisclosed location, is being promoted by the conservative organization Turning Point USA, with Kid Rock headlining and country artists Brantley Gilbert, Gabby Barrett and Lee Brice also performing.\nGreen Day was picked to perform at the Super Bowl in part because of their long association with the Bay area, where this year\u2019s game is taking place, as well as the group\u2019s enduring popularity as a stadium-level act after 35 years of releasing music."

                "body": "As a long-standing member of the tribe known as Save the Manuals!\u2014some would say long-standing enough to be its elder statesman\u2014I'm always chuffed to learn of a car that offers a gearbox requiring you to stir your own cogs. There's something about coordinating the actions of your right arm and left leg with those of your throttle foot, all in the pursuit of smooth forward progress, that engages the mind and ratchets up involvement in the act of driving in a way that triggers small, steady doses of happiness.\nThat's likely why the part of my brain that anticipates pleasurable experiences clicked on when I pulled open the door of the Mazda 3 2.5 S Hatchback Premium and spied a stubby manual shifter sprouting from the center console. Eureka! We already like the funky little hatchback for its aggro looks and pleasant demeanor, but this is the one model in the 3 lineup that offers something our favorite hot hatch, the current 10Best-winning Volkswagen GTI, does not: a manual gearbox.\nFor Sale Near You\nSee all results for new 2026 Mazda Mazda 3 for sale near 50317\nCould the do-it-yourself six-speed transmission be the piquant arrabbiata sauce that transforms the pleasant Mazda 3 recipe into something mouthwatering\u2014a viable alternative to the spunky Vee-Dub? Time for a taste.\nWhile I admit that the presence of a DIY gearbox elicits a subtle Pavlovian response deep in my gut, it does nothing to guarantee that the driving experience is going to be out of the ordinary. Any gearbox, no matter how rewarding its shift action, has to work harmoniously with the engine, clutch, and throttle. The rest of the car that it lives in counts too: A slick gearbox can't make a bad car good, but a bad car can make a great manual transmission irrelevant.\nNo worries about any of that with the Mazda 3 2.5 S Premium Hatchback. Almost everything about it feels, well, premium, more like what you'd expect if it were wearing a BMW, Genesis, or Mercedes badge.\nThe feel-good starts the moment you slip inside. From the driver's seat, you survey an interior covered in soft materials: faux black leather on the dash and doors, with chocolate-brown inserts in the black leather seats. French seams in contrasting color abound\u2014on the doors, dash, center console, and center armrest. Harder materials are largely kept below eye level. Touches of metal trim brighten the cabin. The instrument cluster is home to round tach and speedo gauges in traditional white-on-black.\nThe overall effect is tastefully restrained and unexpectedly rich; photos have a hard time doing it justice. There are plenty of standard features inside as well, including a Bose 12-speaker stereo, power driver's seat with power lumbar and memory, heated front seats, leather-covered steering wheel, and a moonroof. (Our test car was jazzed up with the show-car-like Soul Red Crystal Metallic paint for $595, silly illuminated door-sill plates for $575, and $190 worth of all-weather floor mats.)\nThe premium vibe continues when you fire up and drive off. The naturally aspirated 2.5-liter inline-four emits a quiet, buttered-rum hum that sounds expensive. And the central focus of this model, the six-speed manual gearbox, is a sweet complement to the 3's four-cylinder. Clutch action is effortless and easy to modulate for smooth getaways and shifts. The shifter slides through the gears much like those on BMWs of the recent past; it's well isolated from vibration, and each throw lands softly at the end of the lever's travel. It feels like money.\nOf course, with just 186 horsepower, the Mazda can't match the 241-hp VW's performance. The GTI lost its manual as of the 2025 model year, and with its standard dual-clutch automatic, the current GTI charges to 60 mph in just 5.6 seconds; for the record, our 2022 long-term GTI with the six-speed manual did the deed in 5.8. The stick-shift 3 takes 7.0 seconds to get to the mile-a-minute mark. The gap widens further in the quarter-mile, with the current GTI zipping through in 14"
