                "body": "Gold Price News Today, Nov 15: Impact of US Dollar Fluctuation on Gold\nGold prices have always been a key focus for investors, and today, November 15, they\u2019re once again in the spotlight due to recent fluctuations in the US dollar. The relationship between gold and the dollar is a crucial part of the gold market. When the dollar strengthens, gold prices often fall, and vice versa. For investors, understanding these currency dynamics can be essential in making informed decisions about their portfolios.\nUnderstanding the Inverse Relationship\nGold has a historically inverse relationship with the US dollar. When the dollar appreciates, gold tends to become more expensive for buyers with other currencies, often leading to a decrease in demand and price. On the other hand, a weaker dollar can make gold more affordable globally, driving up demand and prices.\nThis shows why traders keep a close eye on US dollar movements to anticipate gold price directions. Recent data highlights this trend quite well. As the dollar index saw fluctuations, these shifts were reflected in gold market analysis, proving their interconnected nature.\nRecent Trends in Gold Prices\nRecent weeks have shown variable movements in gold prices, mainly due to US dollar fluctuations. For example, today\u2019s gold price ranged around $1,950 per ounce, reflecting ongoing currency volatility.\nInvestors need to consider other factors too, such as geopolitical tensions and inflation expectations. These additional elements can drive gold prices independently of the US dollar impact. Keeping updated with such trends is crucial for effective gold investment plans.\nMarket Reaction and Investor Sentiment\nCurrent investor sentiment reflects a mix of caution and opportunity. Amidst dollar volatility, some investors see a buying opportunity in gold, positioning it as a hedge against further currency devaluation. Others remain cautious, fearing over-dependence on uncertain currency trends.\nOn a popular Reddit forum, discussions emphasize diverse strategies, with some users actively reshaping their portfolios around anticipated dollar moves. Here\u2019s a reflection of the ongoing debate: Reddit Investing Discussions. Such insights can offer valuable perspectives for independent decision-making.\nKey Considerations for Gold Investors\nFor investors, understanding the broader economic landscape is vital. Watching economic indicators that affect the US dollar can help anticipate gold price shifts. Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, inflation reports, and global trade balances are key factors worth monitoring.\nGold market analysis shows that aligned strategies with these economic signals can help in making more informed portfolio adjustments. Careful timing and diversified investment options can offer resilience against unforeseen economic changes.\nFinal Thoughts\nFluctuations in the US dollar offer both challenges and opportunities for gold investors. Staying informed about how these currency shifts impact gold prices is vital for making smart investment choices. By tracking economic indicators and keeping abreast of market analyses, investors can better navigate the complexities of the gold market.\nFor those leveraging technology, platforms like Meyka provide real-time financial insights, helping investors predict trends more accurately. As gold continues to serve as a hedge and a valuable asset, understanding its connection to the US dollar remains crucial for any savvy investor moving forward.\nFAQs\nA strong US dollar typically leads to lower gold prices. Since gold is priced in dollars, it becomes more expensive for foreign buyers when the dollar strengthens, reducing demand and lowering prices.\nInvestors often turn to gold during dollar fluctuations as a hedge against currency risk. Gold\u2019s stability can protect against depreciation in the dollar, providing a safe asset during economic uncertainty.\nTo stay updated, monitor financial news platforms and economic reports.

                "url": "https://www.vtmarkets.com/live-updates/gold-retreats-from-recent-highs-as-the-us-dollar-stabilises-amidst-uncertain-market-conditions/",
                "body": "Gold has slightly retreated from its three-week highs as market sentiment remains mixed. The price of Gold (XAU/USD) is approximately $4,100, down nearly 1.5% after an earlier dip to $4,032.\nThe US Dollar has stabilised due to cautious remarks from Federal Reserve officials regarding monetary easing. Relief from the end of the US government shutdown has reduced some of Gold\u2019s safe-haven appeal, while the possibility of a December rate cut appears less likely, helping the Dollar recover.\nUS Economic Data Insights\nAn upcoming release of US economic data is anticipated, which will provide insights into the Fed\u2019s policy outlook. Although global equity markets are affected by concerns over AI valuations, Gold is still poised for a weekly gain.\nThe US Dollar Index has experienced a mild rebound, currently around 99.37, up nearly 0.20% on the day. Short-term funding for the US government is in place until September 30, 2026, but concerns remain, with another potential shutdown looming.\nFed officials express caution on rate cuts, with recent comments suggesting a high threshold for additional easing. Traders currently see a 49% probability of a December rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nXAU/USD lost momentum after recent gains, facing resistance around the $4,250 mark. A decisive move is required for further bullish momentum, with support seen around $4,050.\nGold remains a popular store of value and hedge against inflation, with central banks notably increasing their reserves. It exhibits an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and risk assets, often rising when the Dollar weakens. External factors such as geopolitical instability can influence Gold prices significantly.\nGold Market Strategies\nThe market is adjusting to the Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious tone, which is pulling gold back from its recent highs. With the chance of a December rate cut now below 50%, the US Dollar is finding its footing and creating a headwind for us. We are watching the $4,100 level closely, as a sustained break lower could trigger a quick move toward the $4,000 support.\nFor those with a bearish outlook, the Fed\u2019s stance is the primary signal. The latest inflation report for October 2025 showed a stubborn 3.5% reading, giving officials reason to delay any easing. This suggests buying puts with a strike near $4,050 or shorting futures could be a viable strategy, especially if upcoming Fed speeches echo this same cautious sentiment.\nHowever, significant downside seems limited because of underlying economic and political risks. We must remember the government funding deal is only temporary until January 2026, and looking back at the 2018-2019 shutdown, gold performed well during that period of political uncertainty. Furthermore, recent Q3 2025 data from the World Gold Council confirmed central banks remained aggressive buyers, providing a strong fundamental floor under the market.\nGiven these conflicting signals, we see an opportunity in options to play the expected volatility. Establishing a long straddle, which involves buying both a call and a put option, could pay off if we get a sharp breakout past the $4,000 support or $4,250 resistance. This is a way to position for a decisive move once the market digests the delayed economic data.\nThis situation feels similar to early 2023, when we saw the market get ahead of itself pricing in rate cuts that the Fed was not yet ready to deliver. That period led to a temporary pullback in gold before its next major leg up, a pattern that could repeat itself now. The key will be watching the delayed jobs data and any signs of weakness in the AI-driven equity markets, which could quickly shift sentiment back in favor of gold."

It follows a ramping-up of Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil refineries since August, part of an attempt by Kyiv to degrade Moscow\u2019s ability to finance its war.\nGlobal oil prices rallied by more than 2% on supply fears after the attack.\nLong-range Ukrainian air and sea drone strikes have repeatedly disrupted Russian oil infrastructure this year, targeting Baltic and Black Sea ports, a trunk pipeline system, and a number of oil refineries.\nUKRAINE ALSO FIRES CRUISE MISSILES, ZELENSKIY SAYS\nUkraine\u2019s General Staff said its forces had fired Neptune cruise missiles and used various types of strike drones in the attack on Novorossiysk \u201cas part of efforts to reduce the military and economic potential of the Russian aggressor.\u201d\nUkraine said it separately struck an oil refinery in Russia\u2019s Saratov region and a fuel storage facility in nearby Engels overnight.\nRussian pipeline oil monopoly Transneft TRNF_p.MM has also been forced to suspend supplies to the port of Novorossiysk, the sources told Reuters. The company declined to comment.\nThe Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which exports oil from Kazakhstan through the neighboring Yuzhnaya Ozereevka terminal, suspended oil loadings for a few hours and then resumed them when the air alert was lifted, sources said.\nIt plans to export 1.45 million barrels per day this month from the Yuzhnaya Ozereevka terminal, around 15 kilometers (9 miles) southwest of Novorossiysk.\nDebris from the drones fell on the terrain of Russian grain terminal NKHP, which was working normally, Interfax news agency reported, citing director general Yury Medvedev.\nRussian officials said Friday\u2019s attack had also damaged a docked ship, apartment buildings and an oil depot in Novorossiysk, injuring three of the vessel\u2019s crew members.\nDelo, a transport and logistics group, said drone debris had fallen onto a container terminal in Novorossiysk, but that its operations continued as usual.\nBritish maritime security company Ambrey said a crane sustained damage, and so did several containers. It said a non-sanctioned container ship alongside the terminal suffered some collateral damage, while no crew members were injured as they sheltered in a safe muster point within the vessel.\n\u2018NOVOROSSIYSK SUFFERED MOST\u2019\nRussian crude oil shipments via Novorossiysk\u2019s Sheskharis terminal totalled 3.22 million tonnes, or 761,000 barrels a day, in October, according to industry sources. For the first 10 months of the year, the figure was 24.716 million tonnes.\nThe sources told Reuters that a total of 1.794 million tonnes of oil products had been exported through Novorossiysk in October and oil product exports for January-October totalled 16.783 million tonnes.\nAccording to three industry sources, the Ukrainian attack hit two oil berths at Sheskharis. The damage was inflicted on berth 1 and berth 1A, which handle 40,000-deadweight-ton and 140,000-deadweight-ton tankers respectively.\nTwo of the sources said the Sierra Leone-flagged Arlan oil tanker was also hit during the attack.\n\u201cNovorossiysk suffered the most,\u201d Veniamin Kondratyev, the governor of the Krasnodar region, where Novorossiysk is located, said on social media.\n\u201cOvernight, more than 170 people and 50 pieces of equipment dealt with the aftermath of the attack, quickly extinguishing fires and assisting residents,\u201d he said.\nThree injured crew members of the damaged boat were being treated in hospital, Kondratyev said.\nLocal officials later said that a fire at an oil depot at the Sheskharis terminal, which handles crude oil and oil product exports, had been extinguished.\nCoastal structures had also been damaged, they said, without providing details"

It follows a ramping-up of Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil refineries since August, part of an attempt by Kyiv to degrade Moscow\u2019s ability to finance its war.\nGlobal oil prices rallied by more than 2% on supply fears after the attack.\nLong-range Ukrainian air and sea drone strikes have repeatedly disrupted Russian oil infrastructure this year, targeting Baltic and Black Sea ports, a trunk pipeline system, and a number of oil refineries.\nUKRAINE ALSO FIRES CRUISE MISSILES, ZELENSKIY SAYS\nUkraine\u2019s General Staff said its forces had fired Neptune cruise missiles and used various types of strike drones in the attack on Novorossiysk \u201cas part of efforts to reduce the military and economic potential of the Russian aggressor.\u201d\nUkraine said it separately struck an oil refinery in Russia\u2019s Saratov region and a fuel storage facility in nearby Engels overnight.\nRussian pipeline oil monopoly Transneft TRNF_p.MM has also been forced to suspend supplies to the port of Novorossiysk, the sources told Reuters. The company declined to comment.\nThe Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which exports oil from Kazakhstan through the neighboring Yuzhnaya Ozereevka terminal, suspended oil loadings for a few hours and then resumed them when the air alert was lifted, sources said.\nIt plans to export 1.45 million barrels per day this month from the Yuzhnaya Ozereevka terminal, around 15 kilometers (9 miles) southwest of Novorossiysk.\nDebris from the drones fell on the terrain of Russian grain terminal NKHP, which was working normally, Interfax news agency reported, citing director general Yury Medvedev.\nRussian officials said Friday\u2019s attack had also damaged a docked ship, apartment buildings and an oil depot in Novorossiysk, injuring three of the vessel\u2019s crew members.\nDelo, a transport and logistics group, said drone debris had fallen onto a container terminal in Novorossiysk, but that its operations continued as usual.\nBritish maritime security company Ambrey said a crane sustained damage, and so did several containers. It said a non-sanctioned container ship alongside the terminal suffered some collateral damage, while no crew members were injured as they sheltered in a safe muster point within the vessel.\n\u2018NOVOROSSIYSK SUFFERED MOST\u2019\nRussian crude oil shipments via Novorossiysk\u2019s Sheskharis terminal totalled 3.22 million tonnes, or 761,000 barrels a day, in October, according to industry sources. For the first 10 months of the year, the figure was 24.716 million tonnes.\nThe sources told Reuters that a total of 1.794 million tonnes of oil products had been exported through Novorossiysk in October and oil product exports for January-October totalled 16.783 million tonnes.\nAccording to three industry sources, the Ukrainian attack hit two oil berths at Sheskharis. The damage was inflicted on berth 1 and berth 1A, which handle 40,000-deadweight-ton and 140,000-deadweight-ton tankers respectively.\nTwo of the sources said the Sierra Leone-flagged Arlan oil tanker was also hit during the attack.\n\u201cNovorossiysk suffered the most,\u201d Veniamin Kondratyev, the governor of the Krasnodar region, where Novorossiysk is located, said on social media.\n\u201cOvernight, more than 170 people and 50 pieces of equipment dealt with the aftermath of the attack, quickly extinguishing fires and assisting residents,\u201d he said.\nThree injured crew members of the damaged boat were being treated in hospital, Kondratyev said.\nLocal officials later said that a fire at an oil depot at the Sheskharis terminal, which handles crude oil and oil product exports, had been extinguished.\nCoastal structures had also been damaged, they said, without providing details"

The break above 1.1610, which previously capped every rally through October, now defines the pivot separating short-term momentum from medium-term trend. The pair has spent eight straight sessions climbing, but it has not yet cleared the weekly barrier at 1.1641, the level that determines whether the rebound becomes a broader trend continuation or stalls into compression.\nEurozone Growth, Trade Surplus Expansion And Mixed Industrial Output Create A Stable But Uneven Fundamental Base For Eur/Usd\nEurozone GDP held at 0.2%, confirming the region avoided contraction in the latest quarter, while year-on-year growth ticked up to 1.4% from 1.3%. The most material upside surprise came from the trade surplus, which surged to \u20ac19.4 billion from \u20ac1.9 billion, a massive swing that normally strengthens EUR across the board. Industrial production softened at 0.2% vs 0.7% expected, and French labor data weakened, but the market showed no meaningful reaction. EUR/USD is being driven by USD uncertainty, not European performance, and the muted reaction to Eurozone misses proves that traders are not valuing the pair through local fundamentals.\nUsd Weakness Stems From Data Absence And Market Reluctance Rather Than Fundamental Deterioration As The 43-Day Macroeconomic Blackout Leaves Traders Blind\nThe shutdown erased more than a month of U.S. data releases. Missing CPI, NFP, PCE, retail sales, JOLTS and sector indicators left markets operating without the anchors required to price the Fed\u2019s December decision. Fed officials attempted to guide sentiment with speeches: Mussalem flagged persistent inflation risks, Hammack argued policy is \u201cbarely restrictive,\u201d and Kashkari refused to endorse a cut. Under normal conditions, this collective hawkish tone would lift the Dollar. Instead, EUR/USD stayed above 1.1600 because traders refuse to build long-USD positions without hard numbers. The Dollar is not weak; conviction around it is frozen.\nCross-Currency Divergence Shows That Eur/Usd Strength Is Dollar-Specific As Euro Performance Against Chf And Jpy Confirms Selective Demand\nEUR gained 0.25% against GBP and 0.24% against AUD, yet lost 0.20% versus JPY and 0.45% versus CHF. This pattern signals that EUR/USD is rising solely because of USD hesitation. EUR is not being bought broadly. Safe-haven currencies outperform the Euro, while growth-sensitive currencies trade in line with EUR as risk appetite improves. The result is a pair driven not by Eurozone data, but by global sentiment and the absence of USD catalysts.\nTechnical Structure Shows A Broken Descending Channel, A Developing Ascending Micro-Trend And Building Pressure Against 1.1641 And 1.1670 As Momentum Stretches Toward Overbought\nEUR/USD broke above the October descending channel and shifted into a rising micro-channel anchored at 1.1610. RSI on the 4-hour chart flirts with overbought territory after eight consecutive bullish sessions, a rare streak for EUR/USD. MACD begins to flatten, suggesting momentum may slow before the next leg. Resistance stands at 1.1670, the dual top from October 28\u201329, followed by 1.1730, the October 17 high. Weekly resistance at 1.1641 remains the near-term decision point. Higher levels at 1.1747\u20131.1775, defined by the yearly high-close range and a major Fibonacci cluster, determine whether EUR/USD transitions into a broad upward cycle toward 1.1917\u20131.2019.\nSupport Levels At 1.1610 1.1575 And 1.1537 Define The Euro\u2019S Safety Net While 1.1497 Remains The Structural Line That Separates"

That price has so far held the low for the past two days, and a bounce has formed as we move into the weekly close.\nLast week an evening star formation formed on the daily chart of DXY, and until this morning, there was a very real risk of a similar formation building on the weekly chart. But so far there\u2019s been a bounce from a key Fibonacci level at 98.98 and that\u2019s put the weekly formation into question following a consistent slide that gook a few days to grind through the \u2018s1\u2019 support at 99.40.\nAt this point it\u2019s still early, but 98.98 has put up a fight and we have matched lows on the daily chart with the prior support of 99.40 coming in as short-term resistance.\nFrom the daily chart, we still have the higher-high and low structuring that began from the Fed\u2019s first rate cut this year, and as I\u2019ve been talking about in webinars even since before the turn began, the 98.98 level stood as my \u2018s2\u2019 support as this could constitute a higher-low. A hold here would be a clean showing from buyers and that would keep USD-strength scenarios in favor, particularly in pairs like USD/JPY and USD/CAD, as discussed below.\nUS Dollar Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUS Dollar Shorter-Term\nGiven how quickly price pushed down this week, there does remain items for bearish structure on short-term charts. We\u2019re already up for a test of the 99.40 level, which is my \u2018s1\u2019 from the daily, and I have the next resistance level up at 99.74.\nIf bulls can power through that, then the next zone on the radar is the key resistance at 100-100.22, which is the area that ultimately built the pullback two weeks ago. We had fresh four month highs in DXY but that 100.22 level, which set the lows last year when the Fed cut rates for the first time in that cycle, came in as harsh resistance.\nIf price can get back up for a re-test of that zone, the second test isn\u2019t often like the first as some of the standing sell orders at that price, whether profit targets from longs or reversal entries from shorts, have already been triggered.\nUS Dollar Four-Hour Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nI still have EUR/USD on the USD-weakness side of the ledger and from the daily there can be an argument pushed in either direction. On the bullish side, price broke out of a falling wedge formation this week, opening the door for buyers to make a greater push.\nBut \u2013 from the daily chart we\u2019re still within the bearish sequencing of lower-lows and lower-highs, and as I talked about in the webinar the week before last, that 1.1500 level is a major spot, and the type of psychological level that often doesn\u2019t just give way on the first shot.\nFor next week, I\u2019m tracking a support level at 1.1593 and then 1.1542, with overhead resistance at 1.1686, 1.1717 and then 1.1748.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/USD\nThe reversal setup from deep oversold conditions on the daily chart played out through the bulk of this week after the pair bottomed just above the 1.3000 handle in the week prior \u2013 and there does remain a big spot of support in-play around the 1.3100 handle with today showing yet another higher-low; but comparably the above setup in EUR/USD seems a bit more bullish given that continued stretch up to fresh higher-highs.\nNonetheless I still think there\u2019s more amenable pastures elsewhere for USD-strength and there is still a key spot of support in-play on Cable, so I\u2019m going to keep this one on the USD-weakness side of the ledger for now, while looking to that 1.3100 zone as key support.\nIf that support gives way next week, the door opens for short-term breakout strategies towards 1.3050 and then 1.3010; I\u2019d be careful staying aggressive for a "

But hearing Fed speakers, the move seems a bit premature, even if it looks like we could get September payrolls data soon. In the UK, the government is scrapping its income tax hike plans. GBP downside risks have suddenly increased\nUSD: Dollar Pricing in Soft Data\nIt\u2019s not unusual for the highly efficient FX market to be more forward-looking than other asset classes. In this case, it appears that the US dollar is embedding the narrative that the US reopening will lead to softer data and a dovish Fed repricing.\nThis has been our view for a while, but we must admit that the bar for a December cut has risen when hearing Fed officials. Yesterday, Neel Kashkari stressed evidence of \u201cresilience in economic activity, more than I had expected\u201d, and kept his options open for December. Hammack and Musalem (who are generally hawkish) suggested we are close to neutral, and the room for more cuts is limited.\nOne important development yesterday was the announcement by Kevin Hasset (Director of the National Economic Council and Fed Chair candidate) that September\u2019s jobs numbers should be released \u2013 potentially next week \u2013 but without the unemployment rate. In our view, this suggests that the Administration doesn\u2019t want the Fed to use a lack of data as an excuse not to cut rates in December.\nWhile the move in the dollar fits our bearish view, it feels a bit premature and at risk of rapid reversal should the initial batch of US data prove not as bad as seemingly priced in.\nEUR: Decent Momentum May Fade\nEUR/USD bullishness has continued to rise both in spot and via the options markets, with 1-month 25 delta risk reversals (cost of a call minus cost of a put) having moved from -0.2 to +0.3 in the past 10 days. There is still some room before reaching the September 0.7 or April\u2019s 1.3 peaks, but the shift is clear.\nThe EUR/USD move has been primarily, but not entirely, driven by the dollar. European currencies are generally in demand, and while NOK, SEK and CHF have been the preferred currencies, the rest of the G10 has underperformed the euro since the start of the week.\nToday\u2019s second release of CPI and GDP data in the eurozone shouldn\u2019t move the market, and the only ECB speaker on the calendar is Isabel Schnabel.\nEUR/USD has now entirely erased its undervaluation gap, and we now feel less confident about short-term upside unless US data come in soft. We see some correction risks today, with a return below 1.160 surely possible.\nGBP: Downside Risks Suddenly Increasing on Fiscal Risk\nReports of UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves scrapping plans for income tax hikes are pressuring the pound. As discussed in our UK Budget preview, the gilt rally was being backed by expectations that income tax increases would have delivered the necessary fiscal tightening without stoking up inflation, ultimately allowing the Bank of England to cut rates in December and beyond. So, a double positive for UK bonds: less fiscal risk plus central bank easing.\nIt\u2019s not clear how Reeves plans to fill the \u00a330bn fiscal hole without touching income tax. We discussed here which areas markets will be sensitive to. For example, should she target VAT increases \u2013 an inflationary measure \u2013 a hawkish BoE repricing would hit gilts.\nMedia reports are currently suggesting a number of options being considered. One appears to be freezing the threshold for income tax brackets, which would have a similar fiscal effect as raising the rate on one bracket and could be well received by markets.\nEUR/GBP is trading at 0.887 at the time of writing: if gilt markets open with some meaningful losses, the risk premium on GBP can rise further and bring the pair above 0.890. Ultimately, this does not look like enough of an indication that Reeves is willing to radically change her fiscal prudence commitment. And we saw in the past how unwanted"

During the week, several Fed policymakers remained increasingly divided on how to balance inflation risks against a cooling labor market.\nThe Fed caution helped markets scale back bets for another 25 basis points (bps) rate cut next month, with the odds of such a move dropping to 51% on Friday versus about 70% seen at the start of the week.\nOn the other hand, the global market sell-off in the latter part of the week, induced by receding Fed easing bets, dented investors\u2019 sentiment and the risk-sensitive Pound Sterling, capping the GBP/USD pair\u2019s upside.\nWhile the Pound Sterling also suffered from a slowing pay growth and hiring in the United Kingdom (UK). The UK Unemployment Rate rose to 5% in the three months to September, coming in above the 4.9% projected.\nMeanwhile, average wage growth was 4.6% in the third quarter, down from 4.7% over the three months to August.\nLiz McKeown, Director of Economic Statistics for the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: \"Taken together, these figures point to a weakening labour market.\u201d Weak employment report reinforced hopes of a rate cut by the BoE in December.\nThe preliminary data published by ONS on Thursday showed that the UK economy grew a meager 0.1% in the third quarter, against a 0.2% increase expected.\nToward the end of the week, the British Pound received another blow after the Financial Times (FT) reported that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Finance Minister Rachel Reeves scrapped plans to raise income tax rates in a massive U-turn less than two weeks from the budget.\nWeek ahead: High impact UK CPI and Fed Minutes in focus\nWith the US government shutdown finally ended, markets are eagerly anticipating the release of the missed September economic data in the upcoming week.\nAs of now, there is no certainty when the data backlog will be cleared. However, if the US Labor Department confirms the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report to be published, it will hog the limelight.\nAlso in focus will be the Minutes of the Fed\u2019s October meeting and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the United Kingdom (UK). Both these events are due on Wednesday.\nHeading into the weekend, the UK Retail Sales and the S&P Global preliminary PMI data from both sides of the Atlantic will grab attention on Friday.\nApart from statistics, speeches from the Fed and BoE officials will be closely scrutinized to gauge the path forward on rates from these major central b"

                "body": "The AUD/USD pair experiences a downturn, falling by 0.3% to around 0.6500 during Friday\u2019s European trading session as the US Dollar makes a strong comeback. This shift takes place amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December, while the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to maintain current rates for the year.\nAt present, the US Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against six major currencies, has risen to nearly 99.40. The possibility of the Fed reducing rates by 25 basis points in December has decreased to 50.7% from 63%.\nFactors Influencing The Australian Dollar\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) faces pressure despite a broadly positive outlook due to strong employment data and a higher-than-expected third-quarter Consumer Price Index. However, changes to interest rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia and fluctuations in demand from China, its largest trading partner, influence the AUD significantly.\nIron Ore, Australia\u2019s largest export, also plays a key role in determining the AUD\u2019s value. A positive Trade Balance, indicating that the country earns more from exports than it spends on imports, can strengthen the AUD. Similarly, economic health in China, impacting demand for exports, also affects the currency\u2019s value.\nWe\u2019re seeing the US Dollar strengthen as doubts grow over a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. The probability for a cut has fallen to just over 50%, reflecting recent hawkish comments from Fed officials. This shift is the primary force pushing the AUD/USD pair down towards the 0.6500 level.\nThis hesitancy from the Fed is understandable given that the latest US Consumer Price Index for October 2025 came in at 3.1% year-over-year. While this is a significant improvement from the highs we saw back in 2022 and 2023, it remains stubbornly above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. This persistent inflation supports the case for holding rates steady through the end of the year.\nPolicy Divergence Between US and Australia\nOn the other side, the Reserve Bank of Australia has little reason to consider cutting rates. Recent data showed the Australian unemployment rate holding firm at a low 3.9% in October 2025, suggesting a tight labor market. This, combined with the hotter-than-expected Q3 inflation figures, reinforces the view that the RBA will maintain its current policy.\nThis policy divergence creates significant uncertainty, which suggests volatility in AUD/USD could increase as we approach the December Fed meeting. We can see this reflected in the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which, while not extreme, is holding steady around 14, indicating a baseline of market caution. Traders might consider strategies like straddles or strangles to profit from a large price swing in either direction, without betting on the specific outcome.\nLooking at secondary drivers for the Aussie dollar, the picture is mixed, which could limit its downside. China\u2019s recent Caixin Manufacturing PMI nudged up to 50.7, indicating slight expansion in the manufacturing sector of Australia\u2019s largest trading partner. Iron ore prices have also shown resilience, trading near $130 per tonne, providing some support for the Australian currency.\nGiven the stronger momentum behind the US Dollar, traders might lean towards bearish positions on AUD/USD in the short term. Buying put options with a strike price below 0.6500 could be a viable strategy to capitalize on further downside if the Fed confirms its hawkish stance. This approach offers a defined risk if the supportive factors for the Aussie dollar, like commodity prices, cause the pair to rebound unexpectedly."

The Aussie pair slumps as the US Dollar (USD) bounces back strongly.\nAt the time of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, recovers its intraday losses and rises to near 99.40.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the strongest against the British Pound.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote).\nThe US Dollar gains as traders doubt over whether the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates again this year. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75% in the December meeting has diminished to 50.7% from 63% seen on Thursday.\nFed dovish bets have receded as a slew of policymakers have stressed the need to bring inflation down, which is well above the central bank\u2019s target of 2%. \u201cThe Fed needs to maintain some amount of policy restriction to cool inflation,\u201d Cleveland Fed Bank President Beth Hammack said on Thursday.\nAlthough investors have underpinned the US Dollar against the Australian Dollar (AUD), the latter has been broadly upbeat as speculation for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut interest rates again this year has eased, following strong Australian employment data for October and hotter-than-projected Q3 Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China"

                "body": "AUD/USD Price Forecast: Bulls seem reluctant amid China\u2019s economic woes, reduced Fed rate cut bets\n- AUD/USD struggles to build on a modest intraday uptick amid China\u2019s economic woes.\n- A softer risk tone further seems to weigh on the Aussie amid a modest USD uptick.\n- Economic concerns keep the USD bulls on the defensive and lend support to the pair.\nThe AUD/USD pair attracts some sellers following an intraday uptick to mid-0.6500s on Friday, though it lacks follow-through and remains close to a two-week high, touched the previous day. A generally weaker tone around the equity markets, along with concerns over China's economy, turns out to be a key factor undermining the Australian Dollar (AUD). Moreover, the emergence of some US Dollar (USD) buying is seen exerting downward pressure on the currency pair, though the downside potential seems limited.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics reported that China\u2019s industrial output grew 4.9% year-on-year in October, compared to a 6.5% rise in the previous month and marking the weakest annual pace since August 2024. Adding to this, Retail Sales cooled from a 3.0% rise in September and expanded 2.9% last month, also representing the worst pace since August last year. Moreover, Fixed Asset Investment shrank 1.7% in the first 10 months of the year, steepening from a 0.5% decline in the January-to-September period.\nThis adds to worries about weak domestic demand and risks to growth in the world's second largest economy, and, in turn, is seen weighing on the China-proxy Aussie. The USD, on the other hand, draws support from reviving safe-haven demand and reduced bets for a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in December. A senior White House official said that key economic reports for October \u2013 employment and inflation data \u2013 may not be released at all, prompting several Fed officials to signal caution on further easing.\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said the economic outlook is mixed as inflation continues to run higher. Separately, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said that given the limited information on inflation due to the government shutdown, she would be hesitant to ease policy further. Investors, however, remain concerned about weakening economic momentum on the back of the longest-ever US government shutdown and are still pricing in around a 50% chance that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs next month.\nAdding to this, hopes for further stimulus from China and the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish tilt might hold back traders from placing aggressive bearish bets around the AUD/USD pair. Moving ahead, traders might continue to scrutinize comments from influential FOMC members for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. This, in turn, will drive the USD and provide some impetus to spot prices. Nevertheless, the pair seems poised to register modest weekly gains, though it remains confined in a familiar range.\nAUD/USD daily chart\nTechnical Outlook\nNeutral oscillators on the daily chart warrant some caution before placing aggressive directional bets around the AUD/USD pair. Hence, any subsequent slide might continue to find some support near the 0.6515 horizontal zone. This is closely followed by the 0.6500 psychological mark, which, if broken, might prompt some technical selling and drag spot prices further below the 0.6480-0.6475 horizontal support, towards testing the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), around the 0.6445 region. The latter nears October swing lows and should act as a key pivotal point for short-term traders.\nOn the flip side, the daily swing high, around the 0.6550 region, now seems to act as an immediate hurdle ahead of the overnight swing high, around the 0.6580 zone. Some follow-through buying, leading to a subsequent strength beyond the 0.6600 mark, would negate any near-term negative outlook and allow the AUD/USD pair to climb further to the 0.6660-0.6665 zone. The momentum could extend further towards the year-to-date peak"

This rebound forms in a moment where the U.S. Dollar rebuilds composure after the government reopening, even though the economic picture remains distorted by the shutdown, delayed releases, and the admission from U.S. officials that October CPI data may never be finalized. The Japanese side faces its own pressures, with a new administration signaling aggressive fiscal expansion while the Bank of Japan avoids tightening commitments and warns of cooling inflation. Together, these forces pull USD/JPY into one of the most unstable zones of the year, where political signals, inflation uncertainty, and intervention risk collide with the market\u2019s preference to reward the Dollar\u2019s relative strength.\nUsd/Jpy Reacts To A Data Vacuum In The U.S. As Officials Confirm October Cpi Breakdown And Leave Traders Without A Critical Inflation Anchor\nThe U.S. economy has entered an unusual period where traders must position without the single most influential data point for short-term monetary policy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed that the October CPI dataset was not fully collected, introducing the possibility the reading may never be released. The September employment report is still being processed and may arrive next week, leaving USD/JPY without the macro heartbeat that normally shapes its volatility. This uncertainty did not weaken the Dollar; instead, USD/JPY advanced as traders began pricing a world where the Fed\u2019s stance becomes more dependent on commentary than data. The combination of an incomplete CPI cycle and a reopening government created a brief risk window for speculators to re-accumulate Dollars, especially with USD/JPY already riding a four-session winning streak.\nUsd/Jpy Strengthens As Fed Officials Push Back Against Early Rate-Cut Bets And December Cut Odds Collapse From 94% To 49%\nFederal Reserve commentary has become the central force cushioning USD/JPY. A month ago, markets priced a 94% probability of a December rate cut; today those odds sit near 49%, reflecting hesitation from policymakers who repeatedly highlight inflation risks despite softening labor indicators. Kansas City Fed President Jeffery Schmid reinforced the stance that monetary policy should continue leaning against demand, calling existing rates \u201cmodestly restrictive\u201d and dismissing the notion that structural labor shifts justify early easing. The market interpreted this combination as an argument for a longer plateau in U.S. rates. With yield spreads still tilted toward the Dollar, USD/JPY regained traction toward the 155.00 line and held weekly gains even as broader USD moves softened against European currencies.\nUsd/Jpy Faces A Weakening Yen As The New Japanese Administration Prioritizes Expansionary Fiscal Support While Leaving Boj Policy Ambiguous\nJapan\u2019s political and monetary backdrop intensifies downward pressure on the Yen.

Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Wednesday expressed her administration's preference for interest rates to stay low and asked for close coordination on policy with the Bank of Japan (BoJ). This further cooled market expectations that an interest-rate hike is coming soon and has been a key factor behind the JPY's relative underperformance.\nTraders, however, still see a 24% chance of a BoJ rate hike move in December and around 46% odds for an increase by January. Furthermore, the recent decline in the JPY prompted Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama and Economy Minister Minoru Kiuchi to issue a warning on currency movements, fueling intervention fears. This, along with the risk-off impulse, could support the JPY. The USD, on the other hand, languishes near a two-week low amid economic concerns and might contribute to capping the USD/JPY pair.\nJapanese Yen remains vulnerable amid Takaichi preference for lower interest rates\n- Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said this Friday that the government is not in a position to set a new numerical target for the nationwide minimum wage. Takaichi argued that the government's role is to create conditions that allow companies to lift pay faster than inflation.\n- Earlier this week, Takaichi said that appropriate monetary policy management should be conducted to achieve both strong economic growth and stable price increases. The remarks were seen as a signal of Takaichi's preference for interest rates to stay low and undermined the Japanese Yen.\n- Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama issued a verbal warning on Wednesday, saying that she will be watching FX moves with a sense of urgency. Moreover, Japan's Economy Minister Minoru Kiuchi said on Friday that a weak JPY can push up CPI through import costs.\n- BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda pointed to resilient consumption driven by stronger household incomes and improving labour-market conditions, also noting that underlying inflation is gradually moving toward the BoJ\u2019s 2% goal. This leaves doors open for an imminent rate hike.\n- US President Donald Trump signed a bill to unlock funding and end the longest government shutdown late on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a senior White House official said that key economic reports for October \u2013 employment details and inflation data \u2013 may not be released at all.\n- A growing number of Federal Reserve policymakers signaled caution on further easing amid the lack of economic data. In fact, financial market-based odds of a rate reduction in December have now fallen to 50%. This, however, does little to provide any respite to the US Dollar.\n- In fact, the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, dived to a fresh two-week trough on Thursday amid economic concerns on the back of a prolonged US government shutdown. This could act as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair.\nUSD/JPY fall towards 154.00 could be seen as buying opportunity and remain limited\nThis week's breakout through the 154.45-154.50 horizontal barrier was seen as a key trigger for the USD/JPY bulls. Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart are holding comfortably in positive territory and are still away from being in the overbought zone. However, repeated failures to find acceptance above the 155.00 psychological mark warrant some caution before positioning for any further appreciating move. Spot prices might then climb to the 155.60-155.65 intermediate hurdle and eventually aim to reclaim the 156.00 ro"

That gap has pushed Canadian assets out of favor, sending the loonie lower and driving usd/cad past 1.37 in early November. Trade friction with the US and jittery markets haven\u2019t helped matters either. That said, Scotiabank highlights a few silver linings\u2014fiscal support from Ottawa and easier money conditions are helping growth at home. Policymakers now say more rate cuts may not do much, and deeper trade issues aren\u2019t easily solved by monetary policy. Looking ahead, Scotiabank expects that when the Fed eventually begins to ease and Canada\u2019s central bank gets more hawkish by late 2026, the rate gap could narrow\u2014and the Canadian dollar could stage a stronger comeback.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate realignment could turn the loonie\u2019s luck.\nThe loonie\u2019s slide has been a defining currency story this year, driven by shifting policy and persistent trade uncertainty. Scotiabank now expects usd/cad to hit 1.40 by late 2025, before narrowing to 1.33 by late 2026 and 1.30 by 2027 as US and Canadian interest rates move closer together. That shift could set Canadian stocks and bonds up for a brighter outlook once currency pressures start to ease.\nThe bigger picture: Cross-border dynamics hold all the cards.\nThe Canadian dollar\u2019s fate is closely tied to decisions made in Washington as much as Ottawa, and lingering trade risks keep policymakers on edge. Even with a rosier forecast, open US\u2013Canada disputes could limit gains.

                "body": "USD/CAD fell to around 1.4020 during Asian trading on Friday, affected by rising Oil prices and US economic concerns. Canada\u2019s position as the largest crude exporter to the US bolstered the CAD.\nWTI Oil surged to $59.50, an increase of over 1.5%, following a Ukrainian drone strike at a Russian Oil depot. Damage included three apartments, an Oil facility, and multiple coastal structures.\nUs Economic Concerns Linger\nUSD/CAD also faced downward pressure due to US economic warnings despite the end of the government shutdown. Economic caution was raised by Kevin Hassett, noting potential gaps in October data as some agencies couldn\u2019t gather information.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar might strengthen due to recent cautious Fedspeak, reducing chances of a December Federal Reserve rate cut. The CME FedWatch Tool records a nearly 50% probability of a 25-basis-point December cut, down from 69% earlier.\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem recommended caution, citing limited easing capacity. Inflation, still high at 3%, was emphasized by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari. Initial October reports indicate a cooling US labour market and weakening consumer confidence.\nWe are seeing USD/CAD struggle below the 1.4050 resistance level as we head into the middle of November 2025. The Canadian dollar is finding solid support from high oil prices, a key factor given Canada\u2019s position as a top crude supplier to the US. This dynamic suggests that any strength in the US dollar might be capped against the loonie.\nImpact On Usd Cad Trading Strategies\nThe price of West Texas Intermediate crude is a major driver, currently holding firm around $82 a barrel. This strength is fueled by ongoing geopolitical tensions, including recent Ukrainian drone attacks in early November 2025 that targeted Russian oil facilities, echoing similar events we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For derivatives traders, this persistent upward pressure on oil supports strategies that favour a stronger Canadian dollar.\nOn the other side of the pair, the US dollar is facing its own challenges from mixed economic signals. The latest October jobs report showed a cooling labor market, and recent CPI data indicates core inflation remains stubbornly above 3%, complicating the Federal Reserve\u2019s path forward. This uncertainty is weighing on the greenback and making a decisive break higher in USD/CAD difficult.\nThe Fed has made it clear that it needs more evidence of a sustainable return to 2% inflation before considering policy changes. As we saw in the last FOMC meeting, the \u201chigher for longer\u201d narrative is firmly in place, and the CME FedWatch Tool now shows the market is barely pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut before the second quarter of 2026. This pushes back expectations and creates a more cautious environment for the US dollar.\nThis situation suggests that selling call options on USD/CAD with a strike price above 1.4050 could be a viable strategy in the coming weeks. The strong resistance at that level, combined with supportive oil prices for the CAD, creates a ceiling that may hold. Traders will be closely watching for any signs of a shift in Fed rhetoric or a significant change in the energy market.\nLooking back, we can see that the 1.4000 level has often served as a significant psychological battleground for this pair, especially during periods of high uncertainty like the 2020 global shutdown. Given the conflicting forces at play today, establishing option strangles could also be prudent for those betting on an eventual breakout from this tight range. This approach would profit from a spike in volatility, regardless of whether the pair moves sharply up or down."

                "body": "The British Pound is losing ground against the Japanese Yen, dipping to 202.65, affected by fiscal worries and potential rate cuts by the Bank of England. Recent reports suggest possible changes to UK fiscal plans, which could alleviate economic concerns but still leave deficits unresolved.\nEconomic data from the UK shows a sluggish third quarter, with GDP growth almost stagnating and a decline in production sectors. This raises expectations for further monetary easing by the Bank of England during its December meeting, exerting pressure on the Pound.\nJapanese Yen Response\nThe Japanese Yen is not fully benefitting from the Pound\u2019s weakness due to domestic influences. Japanese government pressures on the Bank of Japan to maintain low rates have dulled prospects of a rate increase, limiting gains for the Yen.\nThe Pound Sterling, founded in 886 AD, is the official currency of the UK, being the fourth most traded globally with key pairs like GBP/USD and GBP/JPY. The value of GBP is influenced by Bank of England\u2019s monetary policies and various economic indicators such as GDP and trade balance. Strong economic data boosts the Pound by attracting foreign investments and prompting potential interest rate hikes.\nThe GBP/JPY cross is showing clear signs of weakness after failing to hold above the 204.00 level. This downturn is fueled by concerns over the UK government\u2019s upcoming budget and grim economic data pointing towards a slowdown. We see this creating a bearish environment for the Pound Sterling in the short term.\nThe latest figures support this view, with UK Q3 GDP growth at just 0.1% and the Office for National Statistics confirming this week that October\u2019s headline inflation fell to 2.1%. This slowdown puts significant pressure on the Bank of England to consider easing policy, something we haven\u2019t seen since the post-pandemic recovery period of the early 2020s. Overnight Index Swaps are now pricing in a 75% probability of a 25-basis-point cut at the Bank of England\u2019s December 19th meeting.\nDerivatives Market Strategy\nOn the other side, the Japanese Yen\u2019s potential for gains is capped by political pressure on the Bank of Japan to maintain its ultra-low interest rate policy. With Japan\u2019s core inflation still hovering around 1.8% and failing to sustainably meet the 2% target, the BoJ has little reason to hike rates and strengthen the currency. This suggests the GBP/JPY pair might see a controlled decline rather than a sharp collapse.\nFor derivative traders, this environment favors strategies that profit from a decline or stagnation in the Pound. Buying GBP/JPY put options offers a clear way to position for further downside, especially heading into the UK\u2019s November 26 budget announcement. This event will be a major catalyst and could confirm the market\u2019s fears about the UK\u2019s fiscal path.\nGiven the Yen\u2019s own weakness, a more cautious approach could involve using option spreads to lower costs and define risk. A bear put spread, for example, would benefit from a modest drop towards the 200.00-201.00 range. This strategy protects against a sudden reversal should the UK government surprise with a more fiscally conservative plan."

A combination of concerns about the UK\u2019s fiscal health and weak macroeconomic data, which heightened hopes of a BoE rate cut, is weighing on the Sterling, which has dropped to session lows at 202.65 so far.\nPound crosses are trading lower on Friday, hit by a Financial Times report suggesting that Prime Minister Keir Starmer and finance minister Rachel Reeves would be considering ditching their plans to raise the income tax at the November 26 budget report. This move would be positive for the economy, but it might leave doubts about the UK's government debt unresolved.\nUK economy slowed down in Q3\nBeyond that, a raft of grim UK data releases on Thursday failed to improve confidence in the economic outlook. Preliminary Gross Domestic Product figures showed that growth slowed down to levels right above stagnation in the third quarter, with industrial and manufacturing production contracting sharply in September.\nThese figures have boosted expectations that the Bank of England will be forced to ease monetary policy further at its December meeting, which is weighing heavily on the Pound.\nThe Yen, on the other hand, is failing to fully capitalize on the Pound\u2019s weakness as pressures from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on the Bank of Japan to keep interest rates at low levels have curbed hopes of a December rate hike and are keeping JPY\u2019s upside attempts limited.\n(This story was corrected on November 14 at 08:55 GMT to say that the GBP/JPY has dropped to session lows at 202.65, and not session highs, as previously stated.)\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns fro"

                "body": "Gbpjpy Price Analysis\nGBP/JPY experiences a decline as the British Pound weakens following UK political developments before the November 26 budget. The technical setup for GBP/JPY remains positive above key moving averages, with the 21-day SMA providing immediate support. Momentum indicators suggest a potential consolidation prior to the next breakout.\nCurrently, GBP/JPY is trading around 203.00, down 0.30%, after rebounding from an intraday low of 202.34. The daily chart indicates an uptrend, with prices well above short-term and long-term moving averages. The 21-day SMA at 202.49 acts as immediate support, while further decline could lead to the 50-day SMA near 201.43 and the 100-day SMA around 199.97.\nIf GBP/JPY holds above these levels, the outlook remains positive, whereas a drop below 200.00 could signal a deeper retracement. On the upside, breaking the 204.00 resistance might push GBP/JPY toward year-to-date highs above 205.33. Momentum indicators like RSI and ADX suggest a pause, indicating a possible brief consolidation before the next move.\nThe Influence Of The Pound Sterling\nThe Pound Sterling is the world\u2019s oldest currency and crucial in the FX market, holding 12% of transactions. Its value is influenced by the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy, economic data, and the Trade Balance. A strong economy and positive Trade Balance can strengthen Sterling.\nGiven the current pause in GBP/JPY around the 203.00 level, we see an opportunity setting up ahead of the UK budget on November 26. The technical structure remains bullish, with the price holding firmly above key moving averages. This suggests that the recent dip is a temporary reaction to political news rather than a change in the underlying trend.\nThe primary strategy for the coming weeks should be to position for a move higher, taking advantage of the underlying uptrend. Buying call options with strike prices above the 204.00 resistance level would allow us to profit from a potential breakout toward new highs above 205.33. This approach limits our risk to the premium paid, which is prudent given the potential for volatility around the budget announcement.\nOur bullish view is strongly supported by the massive interest rate difference between the UK and Japan. With the Bank of England holding rates firm to combat the recent October inflation figure of 2.7%, and the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy rate still near zero, the carry trade appeal remains immense. This fundamental backdrop continues to attract flows into the pound against the yen.\nHowever, we must respect the downside risks, particularly if the price breaks below the 21-day SMA at 202.49. A decisive fall below the critical 200.00 psychological level would signal a shift in momentum and invalidate our bullish thesis. In this scenario, purchasing put options with a strike price around 199.50 could serve as an effective hedge or a new bearish position.\nThe flattening momentum indicators suggest a period of consolidation, which often leads to a decrease in implied volatility. We\u2019ve seen the CBOE British Pound Volatility Index hovering near 7.5, a stark contrast to the highs over 20 we saw during the political turmoil back in 2022. This relatively cheap volatility makes buying options an attractive strategy right now, as a breakout could lead to an expansion in option prices."

(BTCS) has delivered its strongest quarter on record, reporting a sharp revenue surge and a major swing to profitability as the company continues to scale its Ethereum-first treasury and infrastructure strategy.\nRevenue for the third quarter reached $4.94 million, up 568% from a year earlier and 78% from the previous quarter, the company reported on Friday. Net income came in at $65.59 million, primarily driven by $73.7 million in unrealized gains on its growing Ethereum position.\nScaling an Ethereum-first model\nBTCS \u2014 short for Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions \u2014 operates an Ethereum-native infrastructure business built around three verticals: Builder+ for block-building, NodeOps for staking, and Imperium for DeFi-based onchain revenue generation. The company positions this architecture as a \u201cDeFi/TradFi Flywheel\u201d that blends decentralized financing tools with traditional capital markets to accumulate ETH at scale.\nBuilder+ remained the largest contributor to Q3 revenue at roughly 68%, supported by rising transaction activity and infrastructure optimizations. Also, margins improved to 22% from negative territory in Q2 as scaling effects from block-building and DeFi operations kicked in. Imperium, launched earlier this year, reported its first full quarter of revenue, accounting for around 15% of total revenue.\nBTCS also became the first public company to integrate Aave directly into its balance-sheet operations, using the DeFi protocol for ETH-backed liquidity and yield generation without divesting assets.\nThe company ended Q3 with $56.5 million in Aave borrowings, part of a broader effort to expand ETH exposure through a mix of at-the-market sales, convertible notes, and DeFi leverage.\nETH treasury play\nThe earnings come as BTCS has dramatically accelerated its accumulation of ether over the past few months. In June, The Block reported that the company established an initial $1 million ETH reserve, setting the foundation for a strategy that has since evolved into one of the largest public-company ETH treasuries.\nBy July, BTCS had acquired another $55 million worth of ETH, pushing holdings above 70,000 ETH. As of Sept. 30, the company reportedly held 70,322 ETH, making it one of the largest ETH treasuries, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard tracking ETH stockpiles.\nBTCS has paired this accumulation with a shareholder-oriented capital strategy. The company announced an Ethereum dividend and a long-term loyalty reward in August \u2014 the first public company to do so \u2014 a move intended to drive a steep drop in short interest.\nIt also launched a $50 million share repurchase program, buying back roughly $4 million in stock at prices below those of shares issued through its ATM program.\nPositioning for the broader ETH economy\nThe company says its multi-pillar model is designed to position BTCS as a foundational operator in Ethereum\u2019s validator, block-building, and DeFi stack. And with ETH reaching all-time highs near $4,946 in late August, the firm\u2019s leveraged exposure and integrated operations produced its most profitable quarter to date.\nBTCS also expanded partnerships with firms such as Figment, WonderFi, Angstrom, and MetaMask, and added integrations with ETHGas and NuConstruct to open new revenue streams.\n\u201cOur results underscore the scalability of our Ethereum-first strategy,\u201d CEO Charles Allen said, adding that the firm plans to continue its participation in the ETH-native DeFi ecosystem.\nBTCS shares h"

This growth was primarily driven by a 65.37% increase in the price of ether and a net increase in shares outstanding.\n- Net Increase in Net Assets from Operations: For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the net increase was $16.96 million, attributed to changes in unrealized appreciation on investment in ether and net realized gains on ether sold for redemptions.\n- Net Increase in Net Assets from Operations: For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the net increase was $13.55 million, resulting from changes in unrealized appreciation on investment in ether and net realized gains on ether sold for redemptions.\n- Sponsor Fee: The Sponsor fee was $22,761 for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and $38,251 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting the cost of services performed under the Trust Agreement.\nBusiness Highlights\n- Trust Overview: The 21Shares Ethereum ETF, formed on September 5, 2023, operates as an ETF issuing units of beneficial interest representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The shares trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker symbol 'TETH'.\n- Investment Objective: The Trust aims to track the performance of ether, as measured by the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate \u2014 New York Variant, adjusted for the Trust\u2019s expenses and other liabilities.

The Sponsor waived this fee for the first six months after the Trust's shares were listed or until the Trust's assets reached $500 million, whichever came first. The waiver period ended on January 23, 2025.\n- Creation and Redemption of Shares: Shares are created and redeemed in Creation Baskets of 10,000 shares or multiples thereof. Only Authorized Participants, who are registered broker-dealers, can place orders for creation and redemption.\n- Staking Services Agreement: On October 7, 2025, the Trust entered into a Master Infrastructure-As-A-Service Agreement with Coinbase Crypto Services, LLC to allow for staking of the Trust\u2019s ether. The Trust will receive a portion of the gross staking consideration.\n- Future Outlook: The Trust plans to continue tracking the performance of ether and may engage in staking activities to enhance returns, provided it does not pose undue legal or regulatory risks.\nSEC Filing: 21Shares Ethereum ETF [ TETH ] - 10-Q - Nov. 14, 2025"

Its highest valuation of the day so far was US$103,019, while its lowest was US$94,613.84.\nBitcoin price performance, November 14, 2025.\nChart via TradingView\nBitcoin's tumbled on Friday, which saw it break below US$95,000 has deepened concerns that the cryptocurrency is now entrenched in a bear market.\nThe drop, down 8 percent on the day and over 24 percent from its recent peak of US$126,200, has been fueled by a combination of expiring derivatives, whale selling, and declining institutional and retail demand. Over the past 24 hours, more than US$1.24 billion in crypto longs were liquidated, according to CoinGlass data.\nThus, analysts are framing Q4 as potentially \u201cthe worst fourth quarter on record\u201d for Bitcoin. Technical indicators support this sentiment. CryptoQuant\u2019s Bull Score Index highlights that 8 out of 10 key metrics are bearish, pointing to declining stablecoin liquidity, waning network activity, and capital exiting derivatives markets.\nMarket structure in perpetual futures also favors sellers. While open interest has risen since the October 10 liquidation event, cumulative volume delta data shows sellers dominating, with US demand declining as the Coinbase premium dips into negative territory.\nWith risk sentiment nearing multi-month lows, the coming weeks and the quarter's tail end may define whether the crypto market stabilizes or continues its downward spiral.\nMeanwhile, Ether (ETH) was priced at US$3,204.59, a 6.7 percent decrease in the last 24 hours. Its highest valuation of the day was US$3,440.53, while its lowest was US$3,078.56.\nAltcoin price update\n- Solana (SOL) was priced at US$142.35, down by 8.6 percent over the last 24 hours. Its highest valuation of the day was US$155.17, while its lowest was US$136.26.\n- XRP was trading for US$2.29, down by 7.8 percent over the last 24 hours. Its highest valuation of the day was US$2.49, while its lowest was US$2.23.\nFear and Greed Index snapshot\nChart via CoinMarketCap\nBitcoin\u2019s bearish trajectory has pushed market sentiment into extreme fear. As of today, CMC's Crypto Fear & Greed Index continues to trend in extreme fear territory with the indicator sitting at 22, marking the lowest levels of investor confidence since March and signaling that traders are highly cautious about entering the market.\nToday's crypto news to know\nBitcoin ETFs face US$870 million outflow\nBitcoin fell below US$95,000 for the first time in six months as investors withdrew US$870 million from Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds.\nThe retreat follows a broader market correction that has erased more than US$1 trillion from total crypto capitalization since mid-October, including US$19 billion in liquidations on October 10. Leveraged crypto positions continue to unwind, with over US$1.3 billion wiped out in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.\nAnalysts expect volatility to persist until broader participation beyond Bitcoin and Ether improves market stability.\nAlibaba builds tokenized payment system\nAlibaba is developing a stablecoin-like system to streamline cross-border payments for its US$35 billion e-commerce network, aiming for a year-end launch.\nThe tokenized platform will initially support USD and EUR and will include further plans to expand to additional currencies using JPMorgan\u2019s tokenization technology.\nUnder the system, AI-driven smart contracts will automate settlements, dispute resolution, and co"

These features are why this looks like the next evolution of meme economics. According to cryptoDoc, this is not just another meme, but it\u2019s a meme with a business behind it, and BIT is setting the new standard for sustainable meme tokens.\nStrategic Deployment Of The Bitdealer App Chain\nAn X analyst, BCBlueSkyVC, has also mentioned that Bitdealer may still be in its early stages, but the vision it is building toward is undeniably massive. While Bitdealernet is currently laying its foundational pieces, the roadmap reveals a bold, structured direction with important steps.\nThe rollout of the Bitdealer App Chain is creating its own dedicated infrastructure for the ecosystem and expanding the iGaming catalog to diversify the iGaming experience. This launching of NFT-based Player Profiles innovation transforms user identity into valuable digital assets, increasing transparency in token management and strengthening community trust.\nIf executed with precision, Bitdealer could evolve into a segment-defining platform where meme culture meets iGaming utility and DeFi incentives to create a unified Web3 experience. The project\u2019s vision is bold, and its direction is clear, which will make crypto a fun and transparent space to be in that truly rewards real users, not just speculators.\nBitdealer is not simply building another launchpad, but it\u2019s creating a cultural-financial hub on Solana, where digital culture, gaming, and decentralized finance resonate in oneness to reward real users.\nSolana Core Evolution: Here\u2019s The Underrated Impact Of The BIT Narrative\n\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f:\nSolana is evolving faster than most market participants realize, and it has been celebrated for its blistering speed and low transaction costs.

                "body": "The crypto sector is experiencing significant changes as investors weigh the differing prospects of established coins versus up-and-coming projects. While Binance Coin (BNB) and\nTRON\n(TRX) mirror the overall market\u2019s turbulence, BullZilla ($BZIL) has captured attention, touted as a possible 100x opportunity for 2025. This contrast underscores the ongoing debate between blue-chip digital assets and high-risk, high-reward ventures in a market still shaped by global economic headwinds.\nSolana (SOL) maintains its leadership in decentralized finance, recently seeing DEX trading volumes surpass $5 billion,\noutstripping Ethereum and BNB Chain\n. SOL\u2019s price rose above $165 on November 9, fueled by growing DeFi participation and increased staking. Despite this, technical signals point to near-term caution, with\na 62% likelihood of a retracement\ntoward $150 and a 29% possibility of moving past $180. Experts credit Solana\u2019s\nstrong performance\nto institutional interest and minimal transaction costs, though questions remain about its long-term momentum without broader economic drivers.\nOn the other hand,\nTRX Gold\nCorp (TRX:CA), a Canadian gold mining company, tells a different tale. Although it gained 69% over three months,\nthe stock dropped 22.86%\nin the past month, reflecting mixed fundamentals.\nMarket analysts have projected a 12-month target price\nof $1.27, suggesting a potential 93.55% increase from current prices. With a low beta of 0.36, TRX Gold could serve as a buffer during crypto market slumps, but its lack of direct ties to digital assets may limit its attractiveness to crypto-centric investors.\nMeanwhile,\nBNB\nand TRON have moved in opposite directions. BNB slipped 2.63% over the last day, affected by liquidations in derivatives, while\nTRX rose 0.90%\n, supported by $760 million in daily trading activity. TRON\u2019s cost-effective structure continues to draw developers, especially in DeFi and gaming, whereas Binance\u2019s ongoing growth and token burns highlight BNB\u2019s ecosystem strength. Both coins are grounded in utility, but their recent price action reflects the market\u2019s divided outlook.\nAs investors weigh risk against potential returns, the future remains unpredictable. Solana\u2019s institutional traction and\nTRX\nGold\u2019s reputation as a traditional safe haven exist alongside BullZilla\u2019s disruptive ambitions. The key challenge for market participants is to determine which stories will translate into lasting gains and which will be lost to the sector\u2019s inherent volatility."

                "body": "London, 14 November 2025 \u2014 The UK stock market closed lower on Friday as investors dumped British government bonds and marked down banks, property stocks and other domestic names after reports that Chancellor Rachel Reeves has abandoned plans to raise income tax in this month\u2019s high\u2011stakes Autumn Budget. A global sell\u2011off in technology shares and fresh worries about China\u2019s economy added to the pressure on the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250. [1]\nMarket snapshot: FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 retreat from record territory\nThe FTSE 100 closed down 109 points, or 1.1%, at 9,698.37, having traded as low as around 9,610 earlier in the session. [2]\n- Earlier in the week, the blue\u2011chip index had been flirting with the landmark 10,000 level, setting fresh record highs on Wednesday before two consecutive sessions of declines. [3]\n- By midday today, the FTSE 100 was off as much as 1.7%, underscoring how jittery sentiment became once tax and gilt headlines hit the tape. [4]\nThe pain was felt further down the market:\n- The FTSE 250 mid\u2011cap index fell 0.8% to 21,819.56, after being down about 1.5% at lunchtime. [5]\n- The more growth\u2011 and small\u2011cap\u2011focused AIM All\u2011Share slid 1.2% to 746.51. [6]\nDespite today\u2019s sell\u2011off, both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 still ended the week marginally higher, up about 0.2% each, reflecting how strong the rally has been in recent weeks. [7]\nTax U\u2011turn rattles gilts and the pound \u2013 and spills into equities\nThe main domestic story driving the UK stock market today was political and fiscal rather than purely economic.\nOvernight and morning reports suggested that Rachel Reeves has dropped plans to raise income tax rates in the 26 November Autumn Budget, in order to avoid breaking Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge not to increase taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d. [8]\nMarkets had already been pricing in sizeable tax rises to help close an estimated fiscal gap of \u00a320\u201330 billion. The apparent U\u2011turn left investors guessing how Reeves now intends to plug that hole \u2014 and whether the government is backsliding on fiscal discipline just as borrowing costs have been coming under control. [9]\nThe reaction in gilts and sterling was sharp:\n- The 10\u2011year gilt yield jumped from about 4.44% on Thursday to around 4.57%, a move of roughly 13 basis points, its biggest one\u2011day rise since early July. [10]\n- 30\u2011year gilt yields climbed to around 5.39%, also up notably on the day, as traders demanded higher compensation to hold long\u2011dated UK debt. [11]\n- The pound fell about 0.3\u20130.4% to around $1.31\u20131.32, giving back gains made after yesterday\u2019s Q3 GDP release and adding another layer of uncertainty for international investors. [12]\nEconomists and strategists quoted across the City warned that repeated shifts in tax signalling risk undermining the UK\u2019s hard\u2011won credibility after the turmoil of recent years. Some, including analysts at Peel Hunt and Goldman Sachs, argued that if income tax is off the table, the government may resort to a more piecemeal mix of other tax rises that could prove more growth\u2011unfriendly and harder for markets to digest. [13]\nAll of this fed directly into equity prices: higher gilt yields typically hit bank valuations, weigh on interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sectors such as property and housebuilders, and can drag on broader UK stocks via higher discount rates and a perception of increased political risk.\nGlobal backdrop: tech rout, AI bubble worries and China slowdown\nDomestic politics weren\u2019t the only story. The FTSE 100 today was also caught up in a global risk\u2011off move.\n- A hawkish tone from US Federal Reserve officials has reduced the perceived odds of a December interest\u2011rate cut, even after two cuts earlier this year. That pushed global bond yields higher and rattled equity investors. [14]\n- Wall Street suffered its worst day in over a month on Thursday as high\u2011flying artificial intelligence and tech names sold off sharply; Nvidia, Tesla and other leaders of the AI trade have come under renewed scrutiny over stretched valuations.

Still, Siemens Energy grabbed the spotlight with an upbeat outlook, while Allianz kept its record profit streak alive.\nWhat does this mean?\nInvestors across Europe kept a watchful eye on the US Federal Reserve, after rate-setters stuck with plans for just two cuts in 2025 and talked up a cautious stance. That hesitancy filtered through to German markets, freezing risk appetite even as eurozone GDP grew 0.2% last quarter and employment ticked higher. Siemens Energy was the clear winner on the DAX, surging over 10% after lifting its 2028 revenue growth target to the low teens percentage-wise\u2014a move powered by strength in Gas & Grid as well as improved pricing on project backlogs. Allianz also delivered, posting the best nine-month operating profit in its history and aiming to finish the year with up to \u20ac17.5 billion, demonstrating how well-run firms stand tall despite economic headwinds.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Cautious sentiment guides European investors.\nThe DAX\u2019s slide shows how investor mood is hanging on the Fed\u2019s every word. With just a hint of US rate cut reluctance, risk appetite has waned across Europe, even with steady growth in sight. For now, the global monetary backdrop is setting the tone for European shares, as investors weigh whether to hold tight or spot new opportunities.\nThe bigger picture: Resilient players shine when uncertainty looms.\nSiemens Energy and Allianz are clear examples of how strong firms can outpace sluggish peers. Their standout results show that company fundamentals\u2014like profitability and growth prospects\u2014matter even more when broader market conditions are unsettled. As economic and policy uncertainty lingers, more companies might rise above the noise heading into next year.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 17 hours ago\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 7 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

That includes crypto, gold and stocks. This is what partially explains why even gold is down in this risk off environment, something which of course doesn\u2019t come as surprise to us as we had highlighted the downside risks yesterday. But European markets, which had until now, remain buoyant, they too are feeling the pressure after the tumble on Wall Street yesterday trigged a risk-off tone across financial markets.\nThe UK\u2019s FTSE has now relinquished its entire weekly gains to turn lower with commodities also under pressure, while the tech-heavy German DAX leads the markets lows here in Europe. US stock index futures slipped again on Friday morning, down by another 1% or so, following the lead of a downbeat European and Asian session.\nAfter an extraordinary run that began in April, the tech sector has finally started to wobble, with valuations looking overstretched in recent weeks. A lack of fresh data, growing unease over how far prices have run, and the absence of any compelling new catalysts have all contributed to a risk-off mood. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if markets stayed a bit jumpy for a while yet, though it\u2019s still premature to call the top of this cycle.\nWhat other factors are causing the risk off tone?\nSource: TradingView.com\nApart from valuation concerns and profit-taking, you have to consider the fact that the Fed is essentially flying blind after the US government shutdown left them without crucial economic data, and that uncertainty is beginning to unsettle investors too. Policymakers at the Fed are confronting the awkward mix of sticky inflation and a softening labour market at a time when the shutdown has disrupted the release of vital economic indicators. That leaves investors and policymakers alike guessing.\nHigh-momentum and retail-favourite stocks bore the brunt of Thursday\u2019s shakeout. Many of those winners this year have been AI-linked names, where valuations have ballooned on waves of enthusiasm. Investors\u2019 willingness to overlook lofty valuations was tied to the expectation of lower interest rates. With that narrative now losing some of its shine, traders are trimming exposure to the pricier corners of the market.\nThe sheer pace of the rise of AI related stocks had left some investors wondering whether enthusiasm has overtaken reality. Recent trading sessions suggest people have taken profit on those names. Whether this signals waning risk appetite or simply the usual ebb and flow of a bull market remain to be seen, but either way, it\u2019s a moment to stay sharp rather than complacent.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) came back from being deeply in the red, with the S&P falling below the flatline, and the Nasdaq gaining 0.1%.\nWall Street's previous bruising session saw the major indexes log their sharpest one-day declines in over a month. Tech stocks saw their earlier losses shrink mid-morning Friday after AI concerns drove an exodus from riskier assets to less hotly valued sectors. Still, Tesla (TSLA) shares remained under pressure and broke below $400 before going green. Nvidia (NVDA) shares also rebounded to turn positive.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also continued to suffer, falling below $96,000 for the first time in over six months. The cryptocurrency is down over 20% from its peak in October.\nThe mood is unsettled as worries grow that the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of policy easing, given the increasingly hawkish tone taken by its officials. Traders now see less than 50% odds of a quarter-point rate cut next month, down from about 95% a month ago. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari became the latest to lose appetite for rate cuts as he flagged \"resilience\" in the US economy and continued concerns over inflation.\nIn a nod to price pressures, President Trump is preparing to make substantial cuts to tariffs to bring down high food costs, a concern for voters in recent state and local elections.

                "body": "Tech Weekly: Stock Valuation Fears Persist as US Government Reopens\nExplore this week\u2019s top tech news and market movers, plus key catalysts to watch next week.\nWelcome to the Investing News Network's weekly brief on tech news and tech stocks driving the markets.\nWe also break down next week's catalysts to watch to help you prepare for the week ahead.\nIn this article:\nThis week's tech sector performance\nThis past week highlighted the balancing act between fiscal policy progress, macroeconomic uncertainties and sector-specific pressures, setting the stage for cautious navigation as markets brace for more data and policy signals ahead.\nMarket action started with notable optimism as US futures jumped on Monday (November 10) in anticipation of the Senate\u2019s passage of a new spending bill, ending the government shutdown and reopening the door for delayed economic data releases. The relief rally saw major indexes close higher; however, Tuesday\u2019s (November 11) weaker-than-expected ADP employment report reignited concerns over labor market softness.\nWednesday (November 12) brought further clarity as the House approved the spending legislation, solidifying government funding. This helped global markets rally, though comments from Federal Reserve officials underscored ongoing vigilance against inflation, tempering exuberance and keeping gains in check.\nMeanwhile, news of SoftBank\u2019s (OTC Pink:SOBKY) sizable sale of its NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) holdings and Michael Burry\u2019s US$1.1 billion \u201cbig short\u201d bet against artificial intelligence (AI) stocks via put options on NVIDIA and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) added pressure on AI-driven tech stocks.\nMixed earnings reports midweek also set the tone for an uneven performance in the tech sector.\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) both reported disappointing results relative to expectations, with CoreWeave\u2019s revenue guidance trimmed due to data center delays and Applied Materials seeing year-over-year revenue declines despite an earnings beat.\nDespite posting record revenues fueled by AI chip demand, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) saw some profit taking amid cautious outlook commentary. Analysts also noted that the company\u2019s revenue growth rate slowed in Q3 compared to previous quarters, tempering enthusiasm.\nConversely, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (NASDAQ:AMD) delivered a strong beat with robust revenue and earnings, which was met with enthusiasm from investors in extended trading on Tuesday and into Wednesday\u2019s open.\nOn Thursday (November 13), Canada unveiled its next tranche of major infrastructure projects, signaling long-term investment potential, but the market reaction was mixed amid incomplete detail and broader investor caution.\nFutures dipped ahead of the session, and a pronounced selloff in big tech names weighed heavily on equity benchmarks, which led to a premarket decline on Friday (November 14).\nHowever, early losses gave way to a rebound, led by strong gains in NVIDIA shares. Investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity for expensive names, despite earlier concerns over stretched AI stock valuations. NVIDIA, which initially fell 3.4 percent, surged back in afternoon trading, pulling the broader market upward.\n3 tech stocks moving markets this week\n1. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\nAMD reported strong quarterly results on Tuesday, exceeding revenue and earnings expectations driven by robust demand for its next-generation chips across data centers and gaming segments.\nRevenue rose 12 percent year-over-year, supported by growth in AI-related processors and expansion into new enterprise markets. AMD also raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum amid increased adoption of AI and advanced computing technologies.\nThe market reacted positively, with AMD shares pushing the Nasdaq higher on Wednesday morning. Its share price climbed over 2.40 this week to close at US$247.96.\n2. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:C"

                "body": "US stocks recovered from earlier losses on Friday, battling back from Wall Street's steepest sell-off in over a month as investors await more economic data in the coming days ahead of the Federal Reserve's next rate decision in December.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped around 0.6%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) came back from being deeply in the red, with the S&P falling below the flatline, and the Nasdaq gaining 0.1%.\nWall Street's previous bruising session saw the major indexes log their sharpest one-day declines in over a month. Tech stocks saw their earlier losses shrink mid-morning Friday after AI concerns drove an exodus from riskier assets to less hotly valued sectors. Still, Tesla (TSLA) shares remained under pressure and broke below $400 before going green. Nvidia (NVDA) shares also rebounded to turn positive.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also continued to suffer, falling below $96,000 for the first time in over six months. The cryptocurrency is down over 20% from its peak in October.\nThe mood is unsettled as worries grow that the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of policy easing, given the increasingly hawkish tone taken by its officials. Traders now see less than 50% odds of a quarter-point rate cut next month, down from about 95% a month ago. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari became the latest to lose appetite for rate cuts as he flagged \"resilience\" in the US economy and continued concerns over inflation.\nIn a nod to price pressures, President Trump is preparing to make substantial cuts to tariffs to bring down high food costs, a concern for voters in recent state and local elections. Several trade deals with Argentina, Brazil, and other Latin American countries also aim to make the likes of bananas and coffee more affordable.\nStocks close mixed in volatile week, jobs report due next Thursday\nStocks closed out a volatile week on Friday following the worst one-day decline in over a month.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell below the flat line, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by approximately 0.6%.

Health officials say they're still investigating the source of the infection, including contact with wild or domestic birds.\nThe patient is an older adult with underlying health conditions, state health officials said. They developed a high fever, confusion, and respiratory distress and were hospitalized in early November. The person's treatment is ongoing.\nThere have been 26 human infections of bird flu confirmed so far this year around the world through Aug. 4, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of them, 23, were found outside the U.S., and 11 people died. The nine-month gap in new cases in the U.S. has stumped health experts tracking the virus' spread.\nIn 2024 and early 2025, infections were reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.\nWhile the U.S. hadn\u2019t seen a human infection in months, bird flu cases have been happening recently in poultry flocks and livestock.\nIn the past month, nearly 70 U.S. poultry flocks \u2014 either commercial or backyard \u2014 were found to have bird flu infections, with more than 1.7 million birds affected, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. The last confirmed livestock detection was about a month ago in Idaho dairy cows, according to USDA.\nThe CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

                "body": "Robert Frost once wrote that good fences make good neighbors\u2014but if you ask Jim and Christine Payne, adjacent windows make for even better ones. Ever since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became their next-door neighbor in Georgetown, the couple have been using some pretty creating window dressing to send not-so-subtle messages to the Trump administration\u2019s Secretary of Health and Human Services.\nFirst was a copy of the book We\u2019re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation. In response to Kennedy\u2019s scientifically-unsupported claims that autism is a preventable disease caused by \u201cenvironmental toxins\u201d\u2014including Tylenol\u2014the Paynes displayed six copies in their window, along with a sign announcing a live book signing by author Eric Garcia. \u201cTwenty people showed up,\u201d says Jim, not without pride.\nThe couple\u2019s 39-year-old son, Alexander, is autistic. As Jim remembers it, \u201cAfter the Kennedy\u2019s moved in, he went right over there and introduced himself to Kick (Kennedy\u2019s eldest daughter, Kathleen \u201cKick\u201d Kennedy) saying, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Alex and I have autism.\u2019\u201d\nMore recently, the Paynes\u2019 18-inch-deep window featured Halloween-themed d\u00e9cor: a skeleton sitting in a chair, holding a sign reading, \u201cWish I had taken my vaccine!\u201d Next to its feet was a small bottle of Tylenol.\nA professional interior decorator who once dressed the front windows of Georgetown\u2019s Christ Child Opportunity Shop, Christine doesn\u2019t mind working on a smaller scale. In fact, her husband says, \u201cChristine got really into it.\u201d\nDoes Kennedy feel the same? Contacted by Washingtonian, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard offered a written statement: \u201cSecretary Kennedy is focused on doing his job, improving the health and well-being of the American people.\u201d\nThe Paynes\u2019 house, otherwise known as \u201cThe Napoleon House\u201d thanks to a 500-pound bust of the French general that resides on the couple\u2019s front lawn, has become a regular stop for neighbors and tourists alike. Not quite the attraction of, say, the Macy\u2019s Christmas window displays, but, according to Christine, people do make pilgrimages to see it. \u201cSomehow it fulfills people,\u201d she says, mentioning a man who makes the daily walk from his home at the Watergate. \u201cWhy do we do it? It\u2019s about kindness, community, and fun.\u201d (When weather permits, the Paynes provide cookies for passersby on Sundays at 7 PM).\nKennedy isn\u2019t the only member of the Trump regime to experience neighborly displays of resistance. When then-Republican Ohio Senator and now-Vice President JD Vance became Trump\u2019s running mate last year, people chalked pro-Kamala Harris messages on the Jersey barriers put up for security reasons around a park that adjoined Vance\u2019s home in Alexandria. More recently, protesters wrote chalk messages on a sidewalk near the Arlington home of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, challenging Trump\u2019s immigration policies and declaring that Miller is \u201cdestroying democracy.\u201d (Miller has since moved his family into military housing, and the Arlington house was put up for sale).\nFor her Thanksgiving window, Christine also might be taking aim at the Trump administration\u2019s hardline immigration stance. Although still under construction, she says the window\u2019s focal point will be a poster board sign reading, \u201cLet\u2019s Learn From The Piscataway Tribe. They WELCOMED Immigrants To Georgetown 1765.\u201d\nDespite the neighborly trolling, Jim says, he doesn\u2019t \u201cwant Kennedy to think I have a campaign against him.\u201d As it turns out, Jim is actually cousin of Kennedy\u2019s, through the Shriver side of the family. \u201cHe calls me Cuz,\u201d Jim says. And even though they disagree with his politics, the couple says that Kennedy has been a wonderful neighbor, particularly in one way. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Georgetown off and on for 50 years,\u201d Jim says, \u201cand I\u2019ve never had better parking.\u201d"
