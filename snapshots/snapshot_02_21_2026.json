                "body": "Softer GDP but firmer PCE kept March rate-cut hopes in check, supporting gold even as Treasury yields edged higher.\n1 min\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nGold surged and held above $5,000 an ounce after new US data showed slower growth but still-sticky inflation.\nWhat does this mean?\nFresh numbers painted a Goldilocks-not-quite picture for the Federal Reserve. US Q4 GDP growth slowed to 1.4% from 4.4% in Q3, hinting demand is cooling. But inflation was hotter than expected: headline PCE rose 0.4% month over month in December, and core PCE ran at a 3.0% annualized pace. That mix supports gold\u2019s appeal as an inflation hedge, even as higher bond yields can compete with it. After the release, Treasury yields nudged up, suggesting markets think rate cuts aren\u2019t imminent.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets:..\nRate cuts look less urgent.\nInvestors have been dialing back hopes for near-term easing, and pricing in a longer \u201cwait and see\u201d period from the Fed. That backdrop usually props up the dollar and yields \u2013 headwinds for gold \u2013 but gold can still do well when inflation surprises keep hedging demand alive. The tug-of-war matters beyond metals: higher-for-longer expectations tend to favor value stocks and banks over long-duration growth names that rely on lower discount rates.\nZooming out: Stagflation fears keep hedges in play.\nSlower growth alongside sticky prices is the combo that keeps policymakers cautious and markets jumpy. If inflation proves stubborn, the Fed may hold rates higher for longer, raising recession risk later while keeping real yields volatile. In that kind of regime, investors often spread risk across inflation hedges like gold and defensive assets, rather than betting on a clean return to the low-rate world of the 2010s.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "The prior week\u2019s USD weakness was largely erased over the past week as the DXY basket returned to a massive spot of long-term interest on the chart. The 97.94 Fibonacci level came into play back in April of last year and led to a bounce in the USD after a decisive sell-off had hit in the early part of 2025. Sellers were eventually able to get below that price but for the rest of the year they weren\u2019t able to do much below it, with that level coming in as resistance and then support in December.\nEarly-2026 trade brought another breakdown test but, again, sellers couldn\u2019t do much below even with an open door after a fresh multi-year low. But the pullback from those oversold conditions have led to a rally and re-test of this key level on the chart.\nUS Dollar Weekly Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD Daily\nFrom the daily chart there\u2019s an ascending triangle formation in-play with the multiple tests of resistance at prior support, along with the higher-lows from that oversold reading in late-January.\nThis provides some bullish scope although as I\u2019ve been writing, I think the question behind drivers goes right back to the Japanese Yen and the built-in long position for the carry trade. If we do see signs of unwind, whether that drive is exogenous from intervention or organic via positioning paring back, I think the DXY basket will follow the trajectory of USD/JPY regardless.\nThis is one reason, after all, that USD went as oversold as it did on the daily chart in late-January, which was the most oversold for the currency in more than five years as I shared on the webinar as it was happening.\nUS Dollar Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/JPY\nI remain of the mind that USD/JPY is the most important driver for the DXY basket at the moment, and a chart I shared in the Thursday article explains why. The Japanese Yen remains remarkably weak on a five-year horizon against the USD, Euro and British Pound and if it weren\u2019t for that JPY weakness, the DXY basket would probably be a lot lower at this point.\nAnd one of the driving factors to the USD sell-off we saw in late-January was the sizable sell-off in USD/JPY, which many were attributing to intervention. I remain skeptical of that cause for that incident although what we saw in the previous week seems more suspect to me. The Sanae Takaichi election win was widely believed to be a USD/JPY bullish driver which initially showed, only for the pair to be slammed lower shortly after. And then the NFP print on the following Wednesday was strong by all accounts and, again, this would be expected to be a bullish driver in USD/JPY.\nInstead we saw a brisk bearish reaction when price tested resistance and sellers pushed all the way down to 152.50.\nSince then, however, and over the past week, bulls have been recovering. As we wind into the end of the week there\u2019s another test at 155.00 and as I\u2019ve been saying for a while now, I remain cautious of chasing upside momentum here. But pullbacks and holds of support can remain a constructive way to establish bullish exposure, even if only for short-term setups.\nBut if we are to see a larger USD-recovery I think we\u2019re going to need to see USD/JPY grind closer towards the 160.00 handle that it\u2019s been reticent to test ever since the intervention saga of July 2024.\nUSD/JPY Four-Hour Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nIt\u2019s strange to think that the 57.6% component of the DXY basket might just be along for the ride with larger Yen themes but, again, history and charts spell it out. We saw this in July of 2024, around that intervention episode that sent the USD/JPY pair spiraling lower. At the time there really wasn\u2019t much great in the Eurozone, but the pair rallied up to a fresh high, eventually finding resistance at 1.1212 anyways. This was clear illustration of the USD-weakness emanating from carry unwind also showing in EUR/USD an"

XAU/USD trades at $5,065 after bouncing off daily lows of $4,981.\nBullion jumps as US growth slows and core PCE tops 3%, stagflation looming?\nBreaking news revealed that the US Supreme Court ruled against Trump\u2019s tariffs, imposed under a law intended for national emergencies. This improved risk appetite, as US equities pared earlier losses and turned positive in the day. In the meantime, the US Dollar is on the backfoot, down 0.11% according to the US Dollar Index (DXY).\nThe DXY, which measures the performance of the American currency against six peers, hovers at around 97.70.\nIn the meantime, US President Donald Trump said that the Supreme Court decision is disappointing. Nevertheless, he announced that all national security tariffs under sections 232 and 301 remain in place. In the meantime, he added that he will impose 10% global tariffs on top of other duties, under section 122.\nAside from this, economic data in the US showed that the economy is decelerating, according to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures for Q4 of last year, while the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index in December increased in the advanced estimates for Q4 of 2025, easing from 4.4% to 1.4% YoY.\nGDP decreased from 4.4% to 1.4% YoY, blamed on the 43-day US government shutdown.\nLater, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey dipped from 57.3 to 56.6 as American households mentioned that \u201chigher prices are eroding their personal finances.\u201d Nevertheless, inflation expectations for one-year dipped from 4% to 3.4%, while for a five-year period remained steady at 3.3%.\nIn the meantime, US Treasury yields erased their earlier losses and are rising, a headwind for the yellow metal. The US 10-year Treasury note yield is up one basis point at 4.081%.\nAs of writing, money markets had grown skeptical about a rate cut before June 2026, in which Trump\u2019s nominee Kevin Warsh, if confirmed by the US Congress to become the new Fed Chair, could opt to reduce interest rates.\nIn the Middle East, the US is weighing whether to target Iranian individuals or pursue regime change, according to the Wall Street Journal. Nevertheless, the reports said that he is considering a limited strike on Iran, though he favors diplomacy.\nMoney markets are still expecting two 25 basis points rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, according to Prime Market Terminal data.\nUS economic schedule for next week\nOn the data front, traders will eye the ADP Employment Change 4-week average, Initial Jobless Claims data and the Producer Price Index (PPI) report for January. Aside from this, investors will eye speeches by Federal Reserve officials and unscheduled press conferences by US President Donald Trump.\nTechnical outlook: Gold buyers reclaim $5,000 eyes on $5,100 for further gains\nThe technical picture shifted neutral to bullish biased, but buyers need to clear the $5,100 milestone to have the chance of driving the yellow metal to retest higher prices. If cleared, the next resistance area will be $5,200, followed by the $5,451 January 30 high. Overhead lies the record high near $5,598.\nConversely, if Gold stays around $5,000-$5,050, it could remain range-bound as traders wait for further catalysts. However, a dip beneath the bottom of the range would expose the February 17 daily low at $4,841, followed by the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $4,681.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key"

                "body": "Why are gold and silver prices fluctuating so often, and is it complete manipulation? Gold and silver prices change based on global economic events, inflation data, bond yields, Federal Reserve policy, and geopolitical tensions. Investors follow these signals to decide whether to buy or sell bullion. When bond yields decline or inflation rises, gold and silver demand often increases. When interest rate expectations change, prices move again. Recent tensions between the United States and Iran, along with falling European bond yields and upcoming inflation data, have caused new movements in gold and silver prices. These market forces explain frequent price fluctuations.\nWhy are gold and silver prices fluctuating so often, and is it complete manipulation?\nGold and silver prices fluctuate due to global economic factors, not just manipulation. Inflation expectations, Federal Reserve policy decisions, bond yields, geopolitical tensions, and investor demand influence bullion prices. When bond yields decline, gold becomes more attractive because it does not pay interest but holds value. When inflation increases, investors buy gold and silver to protect wealth. Geopolitical tensions such as the United States and Iran situation increase safe-haven demand. Central bank buying and global trading activity also affect prices. These combined factors cause frequent movements in gold and silver markets.\nWhy are gold and silver prices fluctuating so often?\nGold and silver prices fluctuate often because they respond quickly to economic signals. Inflation data from the Federal Reserve affects investor decisions. If inflation rises, investors buy gold and silver. Bond yields in Europe and the United States also influence prices. When yields decline, gold demand increases. Interest rate expectations also affect bullion demand. Lower interest rates support gold prices, while higher rates reduce demand. Currency movements, global trade activity, and investor buying and selling also contribute. Market closures in countries like China during holidays reduce trading and cause temporary fluctuations. These factors cause regular price changes.\nGold and silver rise explained\nThis question is important as gold and silver prices changed again on Friday. Gold prices increased due to tensions between the United States and Iran, lower European bond yields, and inflation expectations. Investors watched inflation data to understand future decisions by the Federal Reserve. These factors affect gold, silver, platinum, and palladium prices and explain why prices fluctuate often.\nImpact of geopolitical tensions and global risks\nGold prices increased after tensions between the United States and Iran increased. Donald Trump warned Iran to sign a nuclear agreement within 10 to 15 days. Such geopolitical tensions increase investor demand for gold. Investors buy gold as protection during global uncertainty. This increases gold prices.\nSpot gold increased 0.7% to $5,032.49 per ounce at 0941 GMT. US gold futures for April delivery increased 1.1% to $5,052.70. However, gold was still set for a weekly decline of 0.2%. This shows that prices fluctuate based on daily events.\nRole of bond yields and opportunity cost\nEuropean government bond yields declined for a second straight week. This happened due to expectations about leadership changes at the European Central Bank and global tensions. When bond yields fall, gold becomes more attractive. Gold does not pay interest, so lower bond yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold.\nAnalyst Peter Fertig said interest rate markets showed higher prices in longer-term bonds. This caused yields to decline. This supported gold prices. This explains why gold prices move often with bond yields.\nFederal Reserve policy and inflation expectations\nInvestors waited for US personal consumption expenditure data, which is the preferred inflation measure of the Federal Reserve. Economists expected core PCE inflation to increase by 0.3%. This "

In 2024, consumption was 484K tons ($2.4B), led by Turkey (54% volume share). The region is a net exporter, with Turkey and Syria as the largest producers and exporters. Import prices surged 32% in 2024, while Turkey's import volume grew at a remarkable 65.2% CAGR from 2013-2024, indicating robust domestic demand alongside its export strength.\nKey Findings\n- Middle East virgin olive oil market is forecast to reach 660K tons by 2035, growing at a CAGR of +2.9%\n- Turkey dominates the market, accounting for 54% of regional consumption and 58% of export value\n- The region is a net exporter, with 2024 exports (161K tons) significantly exceeding imports (97K tons)\n- Import prices jumped 32% in 2024, with Israel paying the highest price per ton at $9,542\n- Turkey's imports grew at a staggering +65.2% CAGR from 2013-2024, signaling strong internal demand\nMarket Forecast\nDriven by increasing demand for virgin olive oil in the Middle East, the market is expected to continue an upward consumption trend over the next decade. Market performance is forecast to accelerate, expanding with an anticipated CAGR of +2.9% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market volume to 660K tons by the end of 2035.\nIn value terms, the market is forecast to increase with an anticipated CAGR of +3.2% for the period from 2024 to 2035, which is projected to bring the market value to $3.4B (in nominal wholesale prices) by the end of 2035.\nConsumption\nMiddle East's Consumption of Virgin Olive Oil\nIn 2024, approx. 484K tons of virgin olive oil were consumed in the Middle East; with an increase of 22% compared with the previous year. The total consumption volume increased at an average annual rate of +1.9% over the period from 2013 to 2024; however, the trend pattern indicated some noticeable fluctuations being recorded in certain years. As a result, consumption reached the peak volume of 558K tons. From 2023 to 2024, the growth of the consumption remained at a somewhat lower figure.\nThe revenue of the virgin olive oil market in the Middle East skyrocketed to $2.4B in 2024, increasing by 38% against the previous year. This figure reflects the total revenues of producers and importers (excluding logistics costs, retail marketing costs, and retailers' margins, which will be included in the final consumer price). The total consumption indicated strong growth from 2013 to 2024: its value increased at an average annual rate of +5.3% over the last eleven-year period. The trend pattern, however, indicated some noticeable fluctuations being recorded throughout the analyzed period. Based on 2024 figures, consumption increased by +80.2% against 2021 indices. The level of consumption peaked in 2024 and is likely to see gradual growth in years to come.\nConsumption By Country\nTurkey (264K tons) constituted the country with the largest volume of virgin olive oil consumption, comprising approx. 54% of total volume. Moreover, virgin olive oil consumption in Turkey exceeded the figures recorded by the second-largest consumer, Syrian Arab Republic (100K tons), threefold. The third position in this ranking was held by Israel (23K tons), with a 4.8% share.\nFrom 2013 to 2024, the average annual rate of growth in terms of volume in Turkey stood at +5.5%. In the other countries, the average annual rates were as follows: Syrian Arab Republic (-3.1% per year) and Israel (+3.2% per year).\nIn value terms, Turkey ($1.5B) led the market,"

                "body": "The OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for December 2025 was published recently. The last month reported in most of the OPEC charts that follow is November 2025 and output reported for OPEC nations is crude oil output in thousands of barrels per day (kb/d). In the OPEC charts below the blue line with markers is monthly output and the thin red line is the centered twelve month average (CTMA) output.\nOPEC 12 output decreased by 135 kb/d with the largest increases from Iraq (38 kb/d), UAE (14 kb/d), and Saudi Arabia (13 kb/d). Venezuela (-87 kb/d), Iran (-81 kb/d), and Nigeria (-19 kb/d) saw decreased crude output. All other OPEC members had small increases or decreases of 9 kb/d or less.\nThe chart above shows output from the Big 4 OPEC producers that are subject to output quotas and where most of OPEC spare capacity currently exists (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, and Kuwait.) After the pandemic, Big 4 average output peaked in 2022 at a centered 12 month average (CTMA) of 20849 kb/d, crude output has been cut by 636 kb/d relative to the 2022 CTMA peak to 202213 kb/d in January 2026. The Big 4 may have about 636 kb/d of spare capacity when World demand calls for an increase in output. Since April 2025 the OPEC Big 4 have increased output from 18346 kb/d to 20213 kb/d, an increase of 1867 kb/d in 9 months. The rate of increase in Big 4 output seems to be slowing lately. Note that there may be some added spare capacity from UAE, but there may have been reduced spare capacity in Kuwait and Iraq. My definition of spare capacity is the recent (past 48 months) 12 month peak of OPEC Big 4 output, claims of higher capacity remain unproven until we see sustained (12 month average) output at capacity.\nThe chart above shows output from the Other 8 OPEC producers excluding the Big 4. Clearly gains in output from these nations have been stagnant since early 2025. This is the reason I focus on the Big 4 OPEC producers.\nRefinery crude throughput is a measure of World demand for C+C (though imperfect because some crude is burned directly in power plants in the Middle East.) OPEC data shows the previous peak was 81.68 Mb/d in 2018. For the most recent 4 quarters (ending 2025Q1) the average World refinery throughput was 82.48 Mb/d, a new annual average peak which is higher than the 2025 average of 82.12 Mb/d by 360 kb/d and higher than the 2018 peak by 800 kb/d (roughly a 110 kb/d annual rate of increase over 7.25 years)\nOECD commercial oil stocks rose above the 5 year average in December 2025 for the first tome in the past 36 months.\nOPEC expects demand for petroleum liquids to rise by 1.4 Mb/d in 2026 and by 1.3 Mb/d in 2027 and expects demand for OPEC crude to rise by 600 kb/d in both 2026 and 2027. If the OPEC demand estimates and non-DOC liquids production estimates and my estimate for OPEC spare capacity are all correct we could see a very tight oil market in 2027. My guess is that demand will be less robust than the OPEC estimate.\nOPEC expects US tight oil output will fall in 2026 and 2027. This seems correct especially if oil prices follow the current futures market curve (with December 2027 WTI futures at $61.50/b as I write this.)"

Crude oil in the SPR stood at 415.4 million barrels on February 13, 415.2 million barrels on February 6, and 395.3 million barrels on February 14, 2025, the EIA report revealed.\nTotal petroleum stocks - including crude oil, total motor gasoline, fuel ethanol, kerosene type jet fuel, distillate fuel oil, residual fuel oil, propane/propylene, and other oils - stood at 1.670 billion barrels on February 13, the report highlighted. Total petroleum stocks were down 18.9 million barrels week on week and up 62.9 million barrels year on year, the report pointed out.\n\u201cAt 419.8 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are about five percent below the five year average for this time of year,\u201d the EIA said in its latest weekly petroleum status report.\n\u201cTotal motor gasoline inventories decreased by 3.2 million barrels from last week and are about three percent above the five year average for this time of year.

At the time of writing, EUR/USD hovers near 1.1763, recovering modestly from an intraday low of 1.1743, but remains on track for a weekly loss.\nThe pair struggles for clear direction as a weaker-than-expected US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Q4 contrasts with firmer-than-anticipated Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data.\nAdvance estimates showed the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.4% in Q4 2025, slowing sharply from 4.4% in the previous quarter and missing the 3.0% consensus forecast. However, the GDP Price Index held steady at 3.7%.\nMeanwhile, inflation data reinforced the view that price pressure remains sticky. Core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.4% MoM in December, accelerating from 0.2% previously and beating expectations of 0.3%. On an annual basis, Core PCE climbed 3.0%, above the 2.8% prior reading and exceeding the 2.9% forecast.\nHeadline PCE inflation also firmed in December. The PCE Price Index rose 0.4% MoM, accelerating from 0.2% in November and exceeding the 0.3% consensus. The annual rate ticked higher to 2.9% from 2.8%.\nThe data briefly stirred short-term volatility in the US Dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback\u2019s value against a basket of six major currencies, is hovering around the 98.00 mark after dipping to an intraday low near 97.80.\nThe soft growth print points to slowing economic momentum, while sticky inflation keeps the Fed\u2019s cautious policy stance intact. Minutes from the Fed\u2019s January monetary policy meeting, released earlier this week, showed policymakers remain concerned about persistent inflationary pressure, limiting the scope for near-term easing. Officials also noted that further rate hikes could be warranted if inflation fails to move sustainably toward the 2% target.\nHowever, the data did little to materially shift market expectations, with traders continuing to price in two rate cuts later this year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the first reduction in borrowing costs is still largely anticipated in June.\nSeparately, preliminary S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data showed the Composite PMI edged down to 52.3 in February from 53.0 previously, while the Manufacturing PMI slipped to 51.2 from 52.4 and the Services PMI eased to 52.3 from 52.7.\nTraders now await the University of Michigan (UoM) Consumer Sentiment Index and inflation expectations data due later in the American session.\nInflation FAQs\nInflation measures the rise in the price of a representative basket of goods and services. Headline inflation is usually expressed as a percentage change on a month-on-month (MoM) and year-on-year (YoY) basis. Core inflation excludes more volatile elements such as food and fuel which can fluctuate because of geopolitical and seasonal factors. Core inflation is the figure economists focus on and is the level targeted by central banks, which are mandated to keep inflation at a manageable level, usually around 2%.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices of a basket of goods and services over a period of time. It is usually expressed as a percentage change on a month-on-month (MoM) and year-on-year (YoY) basis. Core CPI is the figure targeted by central banks as it excludes volatile food and fuel inputs. When Core CPI rises above 2% it usually results in higher interest rates and vice versa when it falls below 2%. Since higher interest rates are positive for a currency, higher inflation usually results in a stronger currency. The opposite is true when inflation falls.\nAlthough i"

It looks like we did pull back a bit from the 4.1% level over the last couple of days. If we can break above the high reading of Thursday at 4.107% then I think you see a huge rush to the US dollar.\nIt will be interesting to see how this plays out because we\u2019ve gotten the advanced GDP quarter-over-quarter at 1.4% instead of the expected 2.8%. But you have to take that with a grain of salt because the US government is partially shut down and it\u2019s just distorted numbers.\nWe also had the core PCE price index number come out and the reading was 0.4% instead of the expected 0.3%. So that suggests that maybe the US economy is going to force the Federal Reserve to stay higher for longer. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see. With this, I\u2019m paying close attention to this because if yields start rising, that could make the dollar attractive.\nLooking at the Euro, we have seen a bit of a double bottom near the 1.1740 level. I\u2019m watching that closely. If we break down below there, then I suspect we get a move down to the 1.16 level.\nOn the other hand, if we turn around and rally, then I think we are just going to end up consolidating a bit as we have seen more of the same grind and nothing much going on in the market as of late. It is one that I think is primed to try to make a move, but it just hasn\u2019t been able to.\nThe US dollar has been rising against the Canadian dollar during the trading session on Friday as we continue to threaten the 50-day EMA. But I do think there\u2019s a bit of a barrier at the 1.3750 level.\nIf we can break above there, which is about 50 pips above where we are now, then I think the dollar gets very bullish. This W pattern probably kicks off a move back to the 1.3920 level. If we fall from here, then you\u2019re looking at sideways choppiness more than anything else as we continue to at least attempt to build a base.\nThe Russell 2000 is an index I\u2019m watching because I watch it a lot to see what\u2019s going on with the rest of the US stock market. This one will get worse than the other ones quite quickly, but if it does start to turn around, that typically will put upward pressure on the NASDAQ 100, the S&P 500, the Dow Jones 30, etc.\nSo, I use this as a significant tertiary indicator. 2600 has been massively supported in the past. I expect it to continue to be so. We have the 50-day EMA below and it would not surprise me at all to see this thing turn around during the day, thereby lifting some of the other indices.\nChris is a proprietary trader with more than 20 years of experience across various markets, including currencies, indices and commodities.

This stability emerged from a direct confrontation between two powerful economic forces: surprisingly weak US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data and persistently firm inflation indicators. Consequently, traders and analysts face a complex puzzle, weighing growth concerns against price pressure realities. This clash of data creates significant uncertainty for the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming policy path and, by extension, the future trajectory of the world\u2019s most traded currency pair.\nEUR/USD Stability Amid Conflicting Economic Signals\nThe US Commerce Department\u2019s advance estimate for Q1 2025 GDP growth arrived significantly below consensus forecasts. Specifically, the report showed an annualized growth rate of just 1.2%, missing the expected 2.0% by a wide margin. This slowdown marks a notable deceleration from the previous quarter\u2019s 2.5% pace. Simultaneously, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, remained elevated at 2.8% year-over-year. Therefore, the market received a dual message of economic fragility coupled with enduring price pressures. This contradictory data package effectively neutralized immediate directional momentum for the Euro-Dollar exchange rate.\nMarket participants digested the reports with caution. Initially, the weak GDP figure triggered a sell-off in the US Dollar, as traders anticipated a more dovish Fed stance. However, the firm inflation component quickly tempered those expectations, providing underlying support for the greenback. The resulting equilibrium kept EUR/USD within a tight 30-pip range for the session. Furthermore, comparable economic data from the Eurozone provided little impetus for change. Recent Euro area figures showed modest growth and inflation trending toward the European Central Bank\u2019s target, offering no catalyst for a unilateral Euro surge.\nDeciphering the US Economic Conundrum\nThe US economic landscape presents a classic policy dilemma for the Federal Reserve. On one hand, slowing growth typically warrants stimulative measures like interest rate cuts to bolster economic activity. On the other hand, inflation persisting above the 2% target constrains the central bank\u2019s ability to ease policy without risking a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. This scenario, often termed \u2018stagflation-lite,\u2019 places the Fed in a precarious position. Analysts from major institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have highlighted the complexity of this environment in recent client notes.\nA deeper analysis of the GDP report reveals the sources of weakness. Consumer spending, which drives over two-thirds of US economic activity, grew at its slowest pace in three quarters. Business investment also softened, particularly in equipment and software. Conversely, the inflation data\u2019s stickiness appears concentrated in services sectors like housing, healthcare, and insurance, which are less sensitive to interest rate changes. The table below summarizes the key data points from the latest releases:\nExpert Analysis on Central Bank Policy Pathways\nMonetary policy experts emphasize the data-dependent nature of the current cycle. \u201cThe Fed is truly data-locked,\u201d stated Dr. Anya Petrova, Chief Economist at the Global Monetary Institute. \u201cThe GDP miss argues for patience on rates, but the inflation print demands vigilance. Their communications will likely stress maximum flexibility.\u201d This view is widely shared across trading desks, where expectations for the timing of the first Fed rate cut have been pushed further into late 2025. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank maintains a clearer, albeit cautio"

                "body": "GBP/USD: How Fed Rate Expectations Impact The Pound\nGBP/USD: How Fed Rate Expectations Impact the Pound\nUnderstanding the Fed\u2019s Influence on GBP/USD\nHey guys! Let\u2019s dive into how the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) interest rate decisions can really shake things up for the GBP/USD exchange rate. It\u2019s a wild ride, but once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll be trading like a pro. So, what\u2019s the deal? Well, the Fed, being the central bank of the United States, holds immense power over the U.S. dollar. Their monetary policy decisions, especially those concerning interest rates, send ripples throughout the global financial markets. When the Fed hints at raising interest rates, it typically makes the U.S. dollar more attractive to investors. Why? Because higher interest rates mean better returns on investments in dollar-denominated assets. This increased demand for the dollar can strengthen it against other currencies, including the British pound (GBP). Conversely, if the Fed signals a dovish stance \u2013 meaning they\u2019re likely to keep rates low or even cut them \u2013 investors might look elsewhere for better yields, weakening the dollar. The GBP/USD, being a direct currency pair, is highly sensitive to these shifts. Imagine the seesaw effect: as the dollar rises, the pound tends to fall, and vice versa. This is because currency values are relative; it\u2019s all about comparing one against the other. Keep your eyes peeled on Fed announcements and speeches; they\u2019re like breadcrumbs leading to where the market might head next. Don\u2019t just look at the headlines, dig into the details and try to understand the underlying sentiment. Is the Fed worried about inflation? Are they more concerned about economic growth? These nuances can give you an edge.\nDecoding Fed Rate Hikes and GBP/USD\nOkay, let\u2019s break down specifically how Fed rate hikes affect the GBP/USD. When the Fed increases interest rates, it\u2019s like putting the dollar on steroids. Investors flock to the U.S., converting their pounds (or other currencies) into dollars to buy U.S. government bonds or other dollar-denominated assets. This increased demand for the dollar naturally pushes its value up. Now, here\u2019s where it gets interesting for the GBP/USD pair. As the dollar strengthens, the pound weakens in comparison. This is because the exchange rate reflects the relative value of the two currencies. So, if it previously took, say, \\(1.30 to buy one pound, it might now take only \\)1.25. That\u2019s a significant move, and it can happen pretty quickly following a Fed rate hike announcement. But it\u2019s not just about the immediate reaction. The anticipation leading up to the rate hike is crucial too. Traders and investors try to predict what the Fed will do, and these expectations are often priced into the market well in advance. This means that the GBP/USD might start to decline even before the actual rate hike occurs, as market participants position themselves for a stronger dollar. Also, the magnitude of the rate hike matters. A larger-than-expected rate hike will likely have a more significant impact than a smaller, widely anticipated one. The Fed\u2019s communication is also key. They often provide forward guidance, indicating their future policy intentions. If the Fed signals that further rate hikes are on the horizon, the dollar could continue to strengthen, putting further downward pressure on the GBP/USD. Remember, the currency market is forward-looking. It\u2019s not just about what\u2019s happening now, but what\u2019s expected to happen in the future. So, stay informed, analyze the data, and be prepared to adjust your trading strategy accordingly.\nThe Impact of Dovish Fed Policies on GBP/USD\nNow, let\u2019s flip the script and consider what happens when the Fed adopts a dovish stance. A dovish Fed is one that favors lower interest rates or quantitative easing to stimulate economic growth, even if it means tolerating higher inflation. This is essentially the opposite of a hawkish Fed, which prioritizes controlling inflation, even"

This and a softer-than-expected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report in the US weighed on the US Dollar (USD). The pair trades at 1.3494 at the time of writing.\nSterling gains after US court ruling dents the Dollar, while softer GDP offsets hotter core PCE\nUS economic data on Friday revealed a stagflationary picture as GDP in Q4 2025 decelerated from 4.4% to 1.4% YoY, sponsored by the disruptions from the 43-day government shutdown. At the same time, the US Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, jumped to 3% YoY in December, exceeding estimates of 2.9% and the prior print of 2.8%.\nFollowing the data release, US equity markets edged lower but recovered on news that the US Supreme Court ruled that tariffs were illegal under the IEEPA without the approval of the US Congress. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other White House officials commented that the US would invoke other legal justifications to maintain as many of Trump\u2019s duties as possible.\nFollowing the SCOUT ruling, the Greenback edges lower as depicted by the US Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY, which measures the buck\u2019s performance versus six major currencies, is down 0.14% at 97.67.\nAcross the pond, UK Retail Sales exceeded estimates of 2.8%, rising by 4.5% in January according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Business activity is also gathering pace as the S&P Flash PMIs in February expanded in both services and manufacturing.\nNevertheless, weaker-than-expected employment figures warrant further easing by the Bank of England, as the unemployment rate picked up in Q4 2025.\nMoney markets had priced in an 80% chance of a rate cut by the BoE in March. Meanwhile, traders pushed back the Federal Reserve\u2019s first rate cut to June. Hence, the divergence of monetary policies between the US and UK central banks could pave the way for a pullback in GBP/USD before the ongoing uptrend resumes.\nGBP/USD Price Forecast: Technical outlook\nIn the daily chart, GBP/USD trades at 1.3498. The Moving Average Triple slopes higher, maintaining a supportive backdrop. Price holds beneath the latest simple average near 1.3530, which caps immediate upside. The FXS Fed Sentiment Index has eased to 114.93, tempering follow-through momentum.\nThe rising trend line from 1.3035 underpins the bullish setup, with support tracked around 1.3528. A decisive close above that level would reinforce the advance, whereas failure to reclaim it would leave the pair confined to consolidation. With trend support nearby, a break would shift risk lower and expose a corrective phase.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nPound Sterling Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies this week.

                "body": "The US dollar continues to push on up \u2013 staying well above the 98.00 level as it keeps its bullish trend going and that\u2019s not about to change anytime soon . The reasons behind the dollar\u2019s upward momentum are multifaceted, starting with key economic indicators. Firstly, a look at recent data from the US Department of Labor showed that Initial Jobless Claims had plummeted to 206,000 for the week ending February 14.\nThis is an enormous drop from the previous week\u2019s revised figure of 229,000 and even better than the 225,000 that analysts had forecasted. What this tells us is that the US labour market is in pretty good shape, which generally bodes well for the US dollar.\nAnd it gets better \u2013 the FOMC minutes from their January meeting revealed that there\u2019s no rush for the Fed to start lowering interest rates anytime soon. With inflation still sitting above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%, the central bank is keen to keep things steady for now \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what the US dollar needs .\nTraders are now pretty much just waiting for the preliminary US Q4 GDP and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) numbers to drop on Friday to get a better idea of the state of the US economy and what\u2019s happening with inflation.\nBy the way, the FOMC minutes also highlighted that most Fed policymakers are in favour of keeping interest rates where they are, while a small minority are starting to consider a cut. And what this shows us is that the Federal Reserve is being mighty cautious. Which means, effectively, that they won\u2019t be lowering interest rates unless inflation really starts to come down.\nThe US Dollar Index is hovering around 97.90-98.00 on the 4-hour chart, approaching 98.08 resistance after bouncing back from the 95.54 low. Price has reclaimed the 0.618 Fib at 97.61, which should be a good sign, indicating its real momentum is starting to strengthen.\nThere are those higher lows happening along a rising trendline and they\u2019re actually supporting the overall short-term outlook. The 50-period EMA that sits around 97.20 is basically underpinning the whole move, while that 200-period EMA at 98.47 is still looming large as key resistance.\nThe RSI at 60 is showing steady, bullish momentum. If DXY can somehow break above that barrier at 98.08, then 98.47 might be the target, but if price gets rejected \u2013 we could see it heading back down to 97.21.\nTrade idea: Looking to buy above 98.10 and set a target of 98.50, stop-loss below 97.20.\nGBP/USD is trading around 1.3470 on the 4-hour chart after breaking below key support at 1.3516. Price has also slipped under the trendline from mid-Jan that was previously supporting the bulls \u2013 and that tells us the current trend is starting to reverse.\nThe 50-period EMA is now turning lower around 1.3600, while the 200-period EMA at 1.3580 is now proving to be a bit of a bugbear for the bulls. Looking at the candlesticks \u2013 we can see that those lower highs are now looking more frequent, and the selling pressure is quite firm. That RSI is below 50, and it continues to reflect the bearish bias.\nImmediate support is sitting pretty at 1.3435, with a subsequent stop at 1.3391. If we can get back above 1.3516 then maybe that bearish pressure will start to ease a bit.\nTrade idea: Looking to sell below 1.3460 targeting 1.3390, with a stop-loss above 1.3520.\nThings aren\u2019t looking so great for EUR/USD right now, which is trading around 1.1760 on the 4-hour chart, having broken below that key 1.1806 support zone. The 50-period EMA is now turning lower around 1.1850, while the 200-period EMA at 1.1800 has just become a bit of a hurdle for the bulls.\nThat RSI is indeed looking a bit below 50, which just goes to show that bearish momentum is possible here \u2013 even without things getting too crazy.\nImmediate support is lurking at 1.1742, with a subsequent stop at 1.1672. If the price can somehow get back above 1.1806 then we might start to see that bearish pressure ease up.\nTrade idea: Looking to sell below 1.1755 targeting 1.1675, wit"

This period of consolidation reflects broader market uncertainty, as investors seek clearer signals on the trajectory of US monetary policy and its profound impact on global capital flows. Consequently, the AUD/USD pair remains a key barometer of risk sentiment and relative economic strength in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAustralian Dollar Faces Sustained Pressure Against Firmer Greenback\nThe AUD/USD pair has exhibited notable weakness in recent sessions. Market data from major trading platforms shows the currency pair hovering near the 0.6550 support level, a zone not tested since mid-month. This decline represents a significant retreat from recent highs, primarily driven by a broad-based recovery in the US Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY, which measures the USD against a basket of six major currencies, has climbed for three consecutive sessions, buoyed by shifting expectations for Federal Reserve policy. Meanwhile, domestic factors in Australia have provided little counterweight. The Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) recent communications have been interpreted as cautiously dovish, failing to offer the hawkish surprise some traders anticipated to bolster the local currency.\nMarket Awaits Key US Macroeconomic Releases\nAll eyes are now firmly fixed on a slate of high-impact economic data scheduled for release from the United States. These reports will critically inform the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming policy decisions. The most significant releases include the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, and the latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth figures. Additionally, durable goods orders and weekly jobless claims data will provide further insight into the health of the US economy. Analysts universally agree that stronger-than-expected data, particularly on inflation, would likely reinforce the USD\u2019s strength by bolstering the case for the Fed to maintain higher interest rates for longer. Conversely, softer data could trigger a USD sell-off, offering the embattled Australian Dollar a potential lifeline.\nExpert Analysis on Currency Dynamics\nFinancial market strategists emphasize the interconnected nature of this currency movement. \u201cThe Australian Dollar\u2019s sensitivity to US data has intensified,\u201d notes a senior currency analyst at a major Sydney-based bank. \u201cWhile commodity prices, particularly iron ore, provide a fundamental floor for the AUD, the dominant short-term driver is the interest rate differential. Strong US data widens that differential, pulling capital toward dollar-denominated assets.\u201d Historical data supports this view. Periods of synchronized global monetary tightening have historically led to USD strength, while expectations of policy divergence often see the AUD outperform. The current environment suggests markets are pricing in a more patient Fed compared to other central banks, including the RBA.\nComparative Analysis of Central Bank Policies\nThe divergent policy paths of the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia form the core narrative for the AUD/USD pair. The following table outlines the current market perceptions of each bank\u2019s stance:\nThis policy gap directly influences the carry trade, where investors borrow in a low-yielding currency to invest in a higher-yielding one. A narrowing yield advantage for the AUD diminishes its appeal in such strategies.\nBroader Impacts on Trade and Investment\nThe currency\u2019s level has immediate real-world con"

According to a Wall Street Journal insider, Donald Trump is weighing a military strike on Iran to force it to sign a nuclear deal. If that doesn\u2019t work, the US will launch a large-scale regime change campaign.\nFears of an escalation of the Middle East conflict have pushed Brent prices to six-month highs. Investors are rushing to buy safe havens. Suddenly, on Forex, one cannot find a better option than the US dollar. The yen and the euro are unable to compete with the greenback. The rise in oil prices will hit Japan and the eurozone, which are heavily dependent on energy imports.\nMeanwhile, the drop in jobless claims has become another argument in favour of stabilisation in the US labour market. According to Stephen Mirman, the economy looks better than he had expected, so the Fed might lower rates by 100 bp this year to 2.75%, not by 150 basis points. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly believes that the Fed should not hold back the economy with high interest rates. However, it should not lower them too much due to still high inflation.\nThe fall in consumer prices in Japan to 1.5%, the lowest level since March 2022, added fuel to the USDJPY rally. The slowdown in inflation allows the central bank to take its time with raising rates. At the same time, this gives Sanae Takaichi a free hand in expanding fiscal stimulus. The prime minister intends to address parliament and outline her economic policy. Investors fear that excessive stimulus will revive the \u201cTakaichi trade\u201d and sink the yen.\nGold is behaving unusually. It rose on the back of the hawkish surprise in the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, the strengthening of the dollar and the fall in US Treasury bond yields.

This pivotal shift in Tokyo and Washington, D.C. on October 26, 2025, signals potential recalibrations for global monetary policy and investor risk appetite. Consequently, traders are reassessing their positions amid these dual economic pressures.\nUSD/JPY Decline Driven by Dual Economic Forces\nMarket analysts observed a sharp downward movement in the USD/JPY exchange rate. The pair breached several key technical support levels. This movement reflects a complex interplay between two major economies. Specifically, Japanese consumer price data showed a clear cooling trend. Simultaneously, political deadlock in the U.S. Congress raised concerns about future government spending and debt management. Therefore, the typical safe-haven flows into the U.S. dollar have moderated. Meanwhile, the yen found some relief from reduced expectations of aggressive Bank of Japan tightening.\nRecent trading sessions saw volatility increase substantially. The 150.00 psychological level for USD/JPY, once a firm barrier, now acts as a distant resistance point. Market participants are closely watching the 147.50 support zone. A break below this level could trigger further automated selling. Historical data indicates that such moves often precede periods of extended range-bound trading for the currency pair.\nJapanese Inflation Moderates: Data and Implications\nJapan\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs released its latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The data revealed a continued moderation in price pressures. Core CPI, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 2.1% year-over-year. This figure marks a deceleration from the previous month\u2019s 2.3% reading. Importantly, it represents the third consecutive month of cooling inflation. The so-called \u201ccore-core\u201d CPI, which also excludes energy costs, eased to 1.9%. This metric is closely monitored by the Bank of Japan (BoJ).\nSeveral factors contributed to this inflationary cooldown. Government subsidies on utility bills played a significant role. Furthermore, base effects from last year\u2019s sharp price surges are now fading. Additionally, a stronger yen in recent months has lowered import costs. The following table summarizes the key inflation metrics:\nThis data has immediate implications for monetary policy. The Bank of Japan has long targeted a sustainable 2% inflation rate. Recent comments from Governor Kazuo Ueda suggest a patient approach. The central bank may delay further interest rate hikes. Market expectations for a policy shift in December have now diminished significantly. Consequently, the yield differential between U.S. and Japanese government bonds has narrowed slightly, reducing one pillar of support for the USD/JPY pair.\nExpert Analysis on Bank of Japan\u2019s Path Forward\nEconomists from major financial institutions are interpreting the data cautiously. \u201cThe moderation in inflation is not entirely surprising,\u201d noted a senior strategist at Nomura Securities. \u201cHowever, the pace of deceleration warrants attention. The BoJ will likely emphasize that trend inflation remains near its target. Therefore, policymakers will maintain a data-dependent stance.\u201d The central bank\u2019s next meeting is scheduled for late November. Most analysts now predict the BoJ will keep its policy rate unchanged. They will, however, scrutinize any changes to the quarterly outlook report.\nFurthermore, wage growth remains a critical watchpoint. The annual \u201cshunto\u201d spring wage negotiations resulted in robust pay increases. Sustained wage growth is essential for achieving a virtuous cycle of demand-driven inflation.

                "body": "USD/JPY falls as Japanese inflation moderates, US fiscal uncertainty weighs\n- USD/JPY trades lower on Friday following softer inflation figures in Japan and a fiscal uncertainty surge in the US.\n- The easing in price pressures may temper expectations of tightening by the Bank of Japan.\n- The US Dollar remains fragile amid fiscal uncertainty and mixed US data.\nUSD/JPY is trading around 154.90 on Friday at the time of writing, down 0.13% on the day. The Japanese Yen (JPY) gains modest support after inflation data showed a clear moderation in price pressures at the start of the year, while the US Dollar (USD) tumbles after the Supreme Court rules Trump's national security tariffs unlawful.\nIn Japan, the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 1.5% YoY in January, down from 2.1% in December, marking the slowest pace since March 2022. The index excluding fresh food eased to 2%, from 2.4% previously, in line with expectations. The so-called core-core measure, which excludes both fresh food and energy, also slowed to 2.6%, compared with 2.9% in the prior month.\nThis cooling in inflation could temper expectations of a swift monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Investors are now reassessing the timing and magnitude of any further policy normalization, after months of speculation about a gradual exit from ultra-accommodative settings. A sustained slowdown in price growth would complicate the central bank\u2019s ability to justify additional rate hikes in the near term.\nHowever, some economists argue that underlying price dynamics remain relatively solid. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts note that the recent disinflation is partly driven by temporary factors, including lower energy prices and certain fiscal measures, while services inflation remains firm. According to the bank, the intensity of service-sector price revisions in January suggests that the April adjustments could continue to support the inflation path, keeping the prospect of gradual BoJ normalization alive.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar is trading in a more uncertain environment. The US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that broadly invalidated the application of certain tariffs on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds has weighed on the Greenback, fueling uncertainty around trade policy. In addition, fourth-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at an annualized rate of 1.4%, below expectations, while S&P Global\u2019s business activity indicators pointed to a slight slowdown in February. The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 56.6 in February from 57.3 in January, and was below expectations.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

Sentiment around the US dollar turned bearish over the past year, fueled by fears of dedollarization\u2014a process whereby countries, central banks, and global markets pare their exposure to the currency.\nWhile US dollar weakness could support continued gains in the value of the Canadian dollar, risks to that outlook range from the outcome of US-Canada free trade discussions to monetary policy divergence between the United States and Canada. There are also possible geopolitical developments, such as armed conflicts that stoke uncertainty and strengthen the US dollar. Additionally, the Canadian dollar is closely tied to the health of the domestic economy.\nThe US Supreme Court quashed the bulk of President Donald Trump\u2019s steep reciprocal tariffs in its Friday ruling. However, economists aren\u2019t expecting the decision to offer much reprieve, saying the US could use other means to tariff Canadians exports. Indeed, soon after the Supreme Court ruling, Trump announced a 10% global tariff on top of existing duties.\nThe push and pull of these dynamics implies the loonie\u2019s path \u201dis unlikely to be linear,\u201d according to Shirley Huang, senior analyst, global fixed income and currencies at RBC Global Asset Management. \u201cTrade policy and CUSMA [Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement] negotiations introduce material risks that could cause the Loonie to experience higher-than-average volatility for the first half of the year,\u201d she says.\nThe US Dollar Retreat Drove Up the Loonie\nThe Canadian dollar started the year at C$1.37 against the US dollar, and was trading at C$1.36 as of Feb. 20, having gained about 0.25% since the start of the year. Analysts generally agree on US dollar weakness being the primary driver of the Canadian dollar.\n\u201cNone of the decline in USD/CAD was driven by made in Canada events,\u201d says Sarah Ying, head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. \u201cThe greenback materially weakened into the end of January as Wall Street\u2019s most favorite trades were unwound. This includes gold, silver, tech stocks, and bitcoin.\u201d Unwinding of trades occur when investors sharply pare or fully eliminate their exposure to certain types of assets during a particularly volatile period.\nThe US currency continues to bear the brunt of the damage from unpredictable US policymaking, says Ying, who adds that the so-called \u201csell America\u201d trade caused a spike in market volatility. This sparked heavy hedging, meaning investors are aggressively using financial instruments like forward contracts or\nUS President Donald Trump saying he supported a weaker dollar further reinforced the investor flight, according to RBC\u2019s Huang.\nPhilip Petursson, chief investment strategist at IG Wealth Management, points out that the traditional drivers of the USD/CAD exchange rate\u2014the interest rate differential between the US and Canada, as well as oil prices\u2014appear to have taken a backseat.\nHistorically, when the US Federal Reserve raises or maintains higher interest rates than the Bank of Canada, the US dollar typically strengthens against the Canadian dollar. Conversely, when the rate gap narrows, the Canadian dollar appreciates. However, this year, the exchange rate is primarily driven by \u201ca broader negative "

The geopolitical tensions have relegated economic data to the back burner as traders have reduced risk into the weekend.\nThe Canadian dollar is also suffering because Canada and US 10-year interest rate spreads have widened in favour of the US.\nOil prices are chopping and trading with a bullish bias. Traders fear a price spike if US and Iran hostilities disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz. WTI got an added boost after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) announced a 9.0 million barrel plunge in US crude inventories in the week ending February 13.\nCanadian Retail sales are forecast at -0.5% m/m compared to 1.3% in November. The Industrial Product Price Index and Raw Material Price Index figures are also due.\nThe US dollar is closing the week on firm ground, having posted broad-based gains since last Friday, although it is still below where it was trading a month ago. Economic releases from Japan, the Eurozone, and the UK generated little follow-through in FX markets, which implies that today\u2019s US Q4 GDP report, expected at 3.0% versus 4.4% in Q2, may also struggle to leave a lasting imprint.\nMarkets will also scrutinize January inflation data. The Fed\u2019s preferred Core PCE gauge for Q4 is anticipated to moderate to 2.6% from 2.9% q/q.

The pair failed to sustain gains from stronger Eurozone and German PMI releases. Manufacturing PMI improved from 49.5 to 50.8, moving back into expansion territory for the first time in four years, but the bounce faded as geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran resurfaced. A decisive move below 1.1720 would expose downside risk toward 1.1570.\nGBPUSD is defensive in a 1.3435\u20131.3483 range. Sentiment is weighed down by concerns that US-Iran negotiations could deteriorate into a broader conflict. UK Manufacturing PMI printed at 53.9 compared with February\u2019s 51.8, while Services PMI came in at 53.9 versus 54 previously. Expectations that the Bank of England will trim rates by 25 bps to 3.5% in March continue to limit upside momentum.\nUSDJPY firmed in a 154.89\u2013155.64 range after Japanese inflation slowed to 1.5% in January from 2.1% in December, complicating the case for additional BoJ tightening. The pair also drew support from the prospect of higher oil prices should US-Iran hostilities disrupt supply flows.\nAUDUSD dipped then climbed in a 0.7015\u20130.7067 range. Prices dropped on weaker Australian PMI data after February Composite PMI fell to 52.0 from 55.7 in January, Services eased to 52.2 from 56.3, and Manufacturing declined to 51.5 from 52.3."

In January, the loonie slumped against its U.S. counterpart as surprisingly robust U.S. economic data raised bets that the Fed could remain on hold for longer. Then, U.S. President Donald Trump rattled this trajectory with his threats against Greenland, and open challenges to the Fed\u2019s independence.\n\u201cThe currency moved to where we thought it would by mid-year a lot faster than we thought we\u2019d get there,\u201d TD Bank economist Andrew Hencic told Yahoo Finance Canada in a recent interview.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still of the view that our 74-to-75 cent target by year-end is reasonable.\u201d\nAt its January meeting, the Bank of Canada held its overnight interest rate at 2.25 per cent, marking the second consecutive pause since December 2025. The central bank\u2019s governing council referenced \u201can unpredictable environment with little historical precedent,\u201d in its summary of deliberations released earlier this month, adding \u201cit was difficult to predict the timing and direction of the next change in the policy rate.\u201d\nThe Fed cut U.S. interest rates three times in 2025. Major American investment banks are divided on what comes next. JPMorgan analysts see rates on hold through 2026. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley see two cuts this year.\n\u201cThe Bank of Canada is on hold. The Fed is expected to deliver more interest rate cuts,\u201d Hencic said. \u201cThe narrowing of the differential between U.S. and Canadian interest rates, particularly at the shorter end of the curve, is going to help the Canadian dollar appreciate.\u201d\nHis view is premised on \u201cstatus-quo\u201d trade ties enduring between Canada and the U.S., meaning current levies on items like steel and aluminum remain in place, while a huge swath of goods are exempted under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement free trade pact.\n\u201cOur forecast just assumes that kind of holds into the future,\u201d Hencic said.\n\u201cThings will gradually improve towards the tail-end of the year as those interest-rate differentials start to tighten up a little bit, and the economy continues to gain a little steam after 2025.\u201d\nOn Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key pillar of Trump\u2019s protectionist trade agenda. In a widely expected decision, it ruled the president\u2019s interpretation of emergency powers, and related \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, were unconstitutional."

                "body": "- Yen crosses sending mixed technical signals\n- AUD/JPY remains the cleaner bullish setup\n- EUR/JPY stabilising, GBP/JPY heavy despite holding uptrend\n- Left tail risks loom large\nSummary\nThe technical picture across the yen crosses remains uneven. AUD/JPY continues to look constructive, EUR/JPY is stabilising, while GBP/JPY still looks heavy despite holding key support. With risk appetite again playing an influential role alongside looming event risks, conviction behind the dip-buying mindset may soon be tested.\nUptrends intact, conviction uneven\nWhile last week\u2019s bearish weekly reversals warned that directional risks may be shifting across the yen crosses, but those risks have yet to materialise. When tested, bulls stepped back in to defend the long-running uptrends, clearly visible in EUR/JPY, AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY charts below.\nThe rebound has been particularly notable in GBP/JPY, with the pair pushing higher despite growing risks the Bank of England may be forced to cut rates next month following soft jobs and inflation data. Under normal circumstances, that shift in expectations would matter more.\nMore broadly, the recovery has coincided with a revival in risk appetite, reinforcing the view that volatility, risk sentiment and broader asset price performance are exerting greater influence on yen behaviour than interest rate differentials.\nWhen that backdrop is overlaid against the daily technical picture for these pairs, it becomes easier to see why buying the dip remains the preferred approach. Until there is a definitive breakdown to challenge the broader bullish trend, the path of least resistance still appears skewed to the upside.\nHowever, while AUD/JPY continues to look constructive for longs, particularly following another strong Australian jobs report released earlier today, the picture is not quite as convincing for the European crosses. Despite bullish trends remaining intact, recent price action has been far less convincing.\nGBP/JPY: Bounce lacks conviction\nSource: TradingView\nGBP/JPY has struggled to produce a meaningful bounce after testing the intersection of horizontal and uptrend support at 207.35 earlier this week. While the support zone held, price has so far been unable to reclaim the 209.65 low set on January 26.\nThat remains the key near-term level for bulls to overcome to restore confidence in the sustainability of the broader trend, opening the door for a run towards the 50DMA and 212 resistance initially.\nWhile RSI (14) has produced two higher lows, it continues to track below the neutral 50 level, with the overall slope suggesting only a gradual dissipation of downside pressure. MACD also continues to generate a bearish signal, even if it is beginning to show tentative signs of curling back towards the signal line.\nTaken together, the broader message does not scream buy dips. Quite the opposite. Price action still carries a heavy tone, pointing to the risk of another retest of uptrend support before long. Should that level give way, particularly on a closing basis, there is little standing in the way of a deeper unwind towards the 200DMA.\nEUR/JPY: Outlook brightening\nSource: TradingView\nEUR/JPY looks far better than GBP/JPY, that\u2019s for sure. The bounce off uptrend support has been far more convincing, with price recovering 182.00, a level that had capped rallies frequently up until the last two days.\nTo start thinking about a potential retest of the early January high of 186.91, the pair needs to reclaim the 50DMA and 184.00, the latter a level that has acted as both support and resistance lately. With a string of lower highs and lower lows recorded over the past six weeks, a break above 184 may help to snap that sequence, putting a retest of the February high on the table.\nWith RSI (14) now trending higher and back in neutral territory, immediate downside risks appear to be ebbing, particularly with MACD clearly curling back towards the signal line. It feels like directional risks may be in the ear"

                "body": "GBP/JPY edges higher on strong UK data, softer Japan CPI caps Yen\n- GBP/JPY edges higher as upbeat UK Retail Sales and PMI data lift the Pound.\n- Softer Japan inflation dampens expectations of near-term BoJ tightening.\n- GBP/JPY remains largely range-bound between 207.50 and 209.50.\nGBP/JPY advances on Friday, as stronger-than-expected UK economic data boosts the British Pound (GBP), while softer inflation figures from Japan weigh on the Japanese Yen (JPY). At the time of writing, the cross is hovering around 209.23, remaining confined within a little over one-week range.\nUK Retail Sales surged 1.8% MoM in January, far exceeding expectations for a modest 0.2% rise and accelerating sharply from December\u2019s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, Retail Sales rose 4.5% from a downwardly revised 1.9% (previously 2.5%), comfortably above the 2.8% forecast.\nRetail Sales ex-fuel increased 2% MoM in January, marking a sharp pickup from the prior month\u2019s 0.3% gain. On an annual basis, sales climbed 5.5%, up from 2.5% in December.\nPreliminary Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data from S&P Global also surprised to the upside. The Composite PMI climbed to 53.9, marking a 22-month high, while the Manufacturing PMI rose to 52, its strongest reading in 18 months. The Services PMI remained firmly in expansion territory at 53.9.\nThe stronger Retail Sales and PMI figures contrast with softer UK employment and inflation data released earlier this week and could influence the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) monetary policy outlook, as firmer growth data may reduce the urgency for aggressive easing.\nMarkets currently expect the BoE to resume rate cuts as soon as its March meeting, with nearly two additional reductions priced in later this year.\nIn Japan, inflation data released earlier in the day showed price pressures easing at the start of the year. The National Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 1.5% YoY in January, slowing from 2.1% in December.\nCore measures also softened, with CPI excluding food and energy easing to 2.6% from 2.9%, while CPI excluding fresh food slowed to 2% from 2.4%.\nThe softer inflation readings may temper expectations of near-term tightening by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), adding pressure on the Yen as markets reassess the pace of further rate normalization.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling.

Market participants now exhibit heightened caution, eagerly awaiting the release of key UK economic indicators. Consequently, the upcoming UK Retail Sales and Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) data will likely determine the pair\u2019s next directional move, injecting substantial volatility into the forex market.\nGBP/JPY Technical Analysis and Current Market Position\nThe GBP/JPY cross currently trades in a consolidation pattern after a recent decline from yearly highs. Technical analysts highlight the 208.50 level as a crucial support zone, a region that has historically prompted both buying and selling pressure. Moreover, the 50-day simple moving average converges near this price, adding to its technical significance. A decisive break below this support could trigger further selling toward the 206.00 handle. Conversely, a rebound from this level might target resistance near 210.80.\nMarket sentiment toward the pair remains mixed, reflecting divergent economic outlooks. On one hand, the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy trajectory influences the British pound. On the other hand, the Bank of Japan\u2019s persistent ultra-accommodative stance continues to pressure the yen. This fundamental divergence creates the core dynamic for the GBP/JPY pair, often making it a barometer for global risk appetite and interest rate differentials.\nExpert Insight: The Support Zone\u2019s Importance\nFinancial strategists frequently monitor such key technical levels. \u201cThe 208.50 region isn\u2019t just a number on a chart,\u201d explains a senior analyst from a major London forex brokerage. \u201cIt represents a confluence of previous swing highs and Fibonacci retracement levels. A sustained hold here suggests the underlying bullish trend for GBP/JPY may remain intact, but the upcoming data is the true catalyst.\u201d This perspective underscores how technical and fundamental analysis must merge for accurate forecasting.\nAnticipating UK Retail Sales Data Impact\nThe UK Retail Sales report, scheduled for release this Friday, serves as a direct gauge of British consumer health. Strong sales figures typically bolster the pound, as they suggest resilient domestic demand and potential inflationary pressures. This scenario could encourage the Bank of England to maintain a relatively hawkish policy stance. Conversely, weak retail data often weakens sterling by signaling economic softness, potentially delaying interest rate hikes or even prompting discussions of cuts.\nForecasts from leading economic institutions point to a modest monthly increase. However, the market\u2019s reaction will hinge on the deviation from expectations. A significant beat could propel GBP/JPY above immediate resistance levels. A miss could force a test and potential breach of the 208.50 support. Traders will also scrutinize the underlying details, such as fuel sales and online shopping metrics, for a complete picture of consumer behavior.\n- Core Retail Sales: Excludes volatile automotive fuel sales, providing a clearer view of underlying trends.\n- Year-over-Year Growth: Offers a longer-term perspective on consumer spending strength.\n- Volume vs. Value: Sales volume adjusts for inflation, showing real consumption changes.\nThe Role of Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) Data\nFollowing retail sales, the flash PMI data for May will offer a timely snapshot of UK business activity. The survey covers both the manufacturing and services sectors, which together represent the vast majority of the UK economy. A composite PMI reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, while a reading below signals contraction. The services PMI often carries more weight for the sterling due to the UK\u2019s service-dominated economy.\nRecent tr"

                "body": "Bitcoin ETFs are facing a massive round of selling that refuses to let up. In the last five weeks alone, investors have pulled nearly $4 billion out of these funds, with $166 million leaving in just a single day this Thursday. This marks the third day in a row that more money has left the funds than entered. Despite this exit by big-money players, the actual price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has stayed surprisingly strong, holding steady around $67,800.\nPresident's Day Sale - 70% Off\n- Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\n- Stay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nExperts Predict a Reset for Bitcoin\nNot everyone is worried about the billions of dollars leaving the market. Enmanuel Cardozo, an analyst at Brickken, believes this isn\u2019t a sign that big banks are giving up on Bitcoin. Instead, he sees it as a natural recalibration after a very successful 2025. He explained that many short-term traders are simply taking their profits while the global economy remains uncertain. He told Decrypt: \u201cThis does not resemble institutional capitulation.\u201d\nCardozo pointed out that the money leaving is still just a small fraction of the total assets held in these ETFs. In his view, once the \u201cweak hands\u201d finish selling, the market will stabilize and find its footing again.\nBitcoin Struggles Against the Rise of AI and Gold\nWhile some are optimistic, other analysts are sounding a note of caution. Illia Otychenko from CEX.IO noted that Bitcoin is currently fighting two big battles at once. First, the recent \u201crally in gold\u201d has made the traditional metal look more attractive than digital gold to safe-haven investors. Second, the massive boom in AI technology has pulled speculative money away from crypto and into tech stocks.\nOtychenko warned that these ETF outflows are acting like an amplifier of market weakness. He believes that unless Bitcoin can show a confident shift back into a bullish trend, the outflows could continue for a while longer.\nMarkets Signal a Possible 44% Jump in BTC Price to $84,000\nDespite the red numbers in the ETF reports, the on-chain mood is starting to improve. On prediction markets like Myriad, users are becoming more hopeful, giving Bitcoin a 44% chance of rallying to $84,000 in the near future. This suggests that while institutional paper funds are selling, the actual users and believers in the crypto space are starting to look for a bottom. If Bitcoin can hold its current levels while the bleeding from ETFs stops, it could set the scene for a massive spring recovery."

According to data from SoSoValue, shows that around $1.6 billion left the ETF products in January. This is a continuation of a series of outflows that began in late 2025.

The trend of outflows reflected a sense of caution among institutional and retail investors. It was noted that higher fear and lower risk appetite were linked to larger ETF outflows.\nThe average entry price for spot Bitcoin ETF investors was roughly $83,980 per BTC, leading to unrealized losses for the majority of investors. Extended redemptions were not only seen in Bitcoin ETFs but also in other digital asset funds. It was noticed that digital asset investment products saw total outflows of nearly $3.7 billion in the past weeks. Notwithstanding this, cumulative ETF inflows since inception continued to be of historical significance.\nInstitutional Trends and Market Cycles\nThe U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs started with considerable institutional investment, which led to early adoption and integration with the traditional financial system. This led to total cumulative investments reaching close to $53 billion. However, high volatility and price corrections led to a rotation out of risk assets. Analysts have indicated that periodic outflows are a normal market cycle and not indicative of institutional withdrawal.\nETF balances\u2019 inflows and subsequent redemptions show the dynamic nature of capital inflows. The drawdown of the ETF balances also reflects the weakness in the digital asset markets. The flow of funds into spot ETFs is also linked to market sentiment and risk appetite. The persistent outflow of funds is also linked to risk-off periods.

                "body": "The Factors that Affect Ethereum Value\nThe Ethereum network now works differently, with a proof-of-stake mechanism in place.\nEthereum\u2019s value, or Ethereum price as can be seen on crypto exchanges like Binance, is influenced by network fundamentals, supply and demand, technological adoption, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, and macroeconomic factors. Its value is also changing as it migrates to Ethereum 2.0, undergoes network upgrades, and as more institutions express interest in it.\nSupply, Staking, and Ethereum 2.0\nWith Ethereum 2.0, called the Merge, Ethereum changed from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. This added staking, which effectively locks coins out of circulation, reduces the coin supply, and supports Ethereum\u2019s price. EIP-1559 and other network upgrades introduced fee-burning mechanisms that gradually reduce Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply, supporting long-term price appreciation.\nThe Ethereum network now works differently, with a proof-of-stake mechanism in place. Following the Merge, validators are required to stake their ETH rather than rely on energy-intensive mining, which improved network performance and reduced the rate at which new tokens are released. Staking rewards motivate network participants to lock up their ETH, decreasing the circulating supply. This can create what some analysts refer to as a \u201csupply shock,\u201d which may support price stability or appreciation when demand remains steady or increases.\nDemand from DeFi, NFTs, and Business Acceptance\nMost DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces are built on Ethereum. When more people use them, it increases network demand, which can affect the price of Ethereum. As more institutional capital, treasury allocations, and ETFs begin to adopt ETH, it can exert upward pressure on the price over time, particularly as it becomes part of a broader range of investment portfolios.\nThe Ethereum DeFi ecosystem has grown significantly. Lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and yield-generating platforms all require ETH for transaction fees and collateral. This demand stems from actual use and economic activity, not speculation. NFT marketplaces also rely on Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. Previously, when interest in digital collectibles was higher, the demand for ETH also rose.\nInstitutional participation has shifted from passive observation to active involvement. The introduction of Ethereum ETFs and the incorporation of ETH into corporate treasury strategies indicate a wider acceptance beyond retail investors. These institutional inflows may help stabilize prices over longer periods of time.\nMetrics of Usage and Network Activity\nMetrics such as the number of daily transactions, active addresses, and smart contract deployments indicate a network\u2019s usefulness and popularity. More activity on the network usually means a higher Ethereum price.\nThe amount of ETH staked or locked in DeFi also limits the amount available for trading, thereby indirectly affecting the price of Ethereum. Experts have said that \u201cnetwork usage and smart contract activity are key drivers for Ethereum\u2019s valuation, reflecting real demand beyond speculation.\u201d\nCrypto Culture\nThere are many similarities between the crypto market and the stock market, which is best observed on Wall Street. When they first emerged, both were met with skepticism and disapproval from mainstream audiences. Over time, they became well known and part of popular culture. Both markets offer investment opportunities that involve varying levels of risk, but they attract investors with different financial goals. Most importantly, both the crypto and stock markets have built up very dedicated groups of participants and observers.\nFor a long time, Wall Street has been home to a community of people who make a living by buying and selling stocks. Today, there is a similar group of people around cryptocurrency, who are often referred to as \u201ccrypto bros.\u201d Like Wall Street brokers, crypto bros spend their time watching the value of th"

                "body": "Understanding the Relationship Between Ethereum Price and DeFi/NFT Adoption\nUnlike Bitcoin, which is often seen as a store of value, Ethereum primarily acts as a platform for supporting DeFi and NFT systems.\nEthereum (ETH) is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies today. Most people familiar with the crypto world know its name. Unlike Bitcoin, which is often seen as a store of value, Ethereum primarily acts as a platform for supporting DeFi and NFT systems. These systems come in different shapes and sizes, but many play a role in influencing the Ethereum price. This is because transactions, collateral, and smart contracts on the network require ETH.\nBy establishing a basic understanding of the relationship between DeFi/NFT adoption and Ethereum price, prospective users can approach decentralized markets with the knowledge needed to recognize how and why real network utility affects short-term price movements and long-term valuation.\nDefining Terms: DeFi and NFTs\nAs a brief reminder, DeFi, short for decentralized finance, pertains to a financial system that operates via blockchain technology. An article notes that, unlike traditional finance, \u201cDeFi is entirely decentralized. This means that it is not controlled by a central entity or government. Instead, it relies on open protocols and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\u201d\nBecause DeFi applications are not tied to any one entity, they can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, by anyone, all without needing a standard bank account. Additionally, by using blockchain technology, DeFi programs are able to offer complete transparency and substantial security.\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs), meanwhile, are assets like digital content, videos, or artworks that have been tokenized by way of a blockchain. These tokens can be traded and exchanged on platforms in networks like Ethereum for money, cryptocurrencies, or even other NFTs. Not every exchange platform accepts NFTs, but some DeFi applications do. This opens up new opportunities for financial transactions and investments on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe Role of Ethereum Price in DeFi Protocols\nETH, the native token of Ethereum, is often used as collateral in decentralized lending, borrowing, and yield protocols. In these cases, this means that the value of your collateral goes up or down with the price of Ethereum. It is important to note that more DeFi activity often makes it harder to get liquid ETH. This puts upward pressure on the price of Ethereum because of demand.\nDifferent DeFi protocols always react to these changes in different ways. For instance, decentralized exchange protocols like Uniswap let people trade ETH and ERC-20 tokens, while protocols like DAI make decentralized stablecoins that are worth the same as the US dollar. The protocol that interacts more directly with ETH will probably have a stronger connection to changes in price than protocols that are less connected to ETH.\nImportant Shifts in NFT Market Activity\nWith NFTs gradually gaining recurring popularity, possibly thanks to the increasing number of DeFi protocols and platforms on Ethereum, their value in relation to changes in ETH pricing has become more notable over time. This development is largely due to the fact that NFT minting, trading, and royalty-sharing are primarily executed in ETH. As a result, a surge in NFT adoption can coincide with short-term spikes in Ethereum price due to higher transactional demand.\nAs it so happens, these short-term spikes also provide traders with useful information that can be used to inform short-term price indicators. By monitoring NFT and DeFi market cycles, traders can sometimes gauge how current trends line up with past ones, thereby providing them with some means of predicting price changes for the near future.\nHow Real-World Utility Signals Adoption\nMuch of the trading done on crypto markets is speculative since cryptocurrencies (outside of stablecoins) may have little inherent value. This speculation pl"

                "body": "The Little Ethereum That Could: Why Use Drives Ethereum\u2019s Price\nFor something unique like Ethereum (ETH), which is designed to be a decentralized utility, you have to look beyond the simple charts.\nThe price on any asset always comes down to something simple: its supply and demand. But for something unique like Ethereum (ETH), which is designed to be a decentralized utility, you have to look beyond the simple charts to see what\u2019s really generating that demand and moving the Ethereum price.\nOf course, the general state of the economy and market sentiment matter, but typically, the price of ETH moves largely due to the actual work occurring on its blockchain. Real-world adoption, usage, and general utility, all tracked by on-chain data, affect the ebb and flow of ETH, showing it\u2019s not just a coin to trade but the essential fuel needed for a growing and decentralized digital world.\nHow to Measure Real Demand\nA good way to check the health and usefulness of the Ethereum network is by looking at its daily transaction volume. Every single action that\u2019s taken, whether it\u2019s a simple transfer, a complicated interaction in decentralized finance (DeFi), or creating a new non-fungible token (NFT), requires a small amount of ETH to pay for the computing power, which is generally referred to as the \u201cgas fees.\u201d\nDaily on-chain transactions are a direct measure of how much the network is being used. High transaction volumes mean a lot of people are actively taking advantage of what the network can do. Greater usage indicates stronger utility and oftentimes, demand for the network, which naturally makes ETH more valuable and useful. This increase in activity often pushes the ETH price higher, highlighting a link between network activity and market value.\nHow Many People Are Using It?\nThe number of unique active addresses is a good way to tell how widely the network is being used, not just how many transactions are happening. The count of different addresses making transactions on any given day reflects the engagement from individual people, large organizations, and the many smart contracts that power the decentralized web.\n\u201cEthereum is entering one of its most powerful phases yet, combining deep institutional interest with unprecedented levels of on-chain activity,\u201d an article states. When the number of active addresses keeps going up, it\u2019s a strong sign of genuine network adoption. It means that more participants are entering the Ethereum world for whatever reason, be that to buy ETH to hold, use applications, mint NFTs, or build their own smart contracts. Since everyone needs ETH to pay for their activity, this growth can raise the ETH price because, as demand for the network\u2019s native currency increases, it becomes harder to distinguish organic growth from price movements driven by short-term speculation.\nThe Power of Smart Contracts\nProbably Ethereum\u2019s greatest innovation is its ability to run self-executing programs called smart contracts, which you might think of as the engine for decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum's long-term value depends on how quickly new smart contracts are created and used, as well as how often people use the ones already there.\nSmart contracts are the building blocks for everything, from NFT marketplaces and DeFi platforms to tokenized asset projects. The rising number of new contracts and high interaction volume highlight Ethereum\u2019s usefulness as the world\u2019s leading smart contract platform. As its usefulness grows, so does demand for ETH, the asset needed to run and maintain these apps. This, in turn, drives up the price of ETH.\nDeFi and NFT Activity\nEthereum plays a significant role in the DeFi and NFT space. These activities greatly influence its price movement. Smart contracts create a constant need for ETH, both for collateral and transaction fees. The minting, trading, and selling of new NFTs also require ETH for each fee.\nAs DeFi protocols grow and NFT trading volumes rise, the demand for ETH goes u"

                "body": "How NFTs and the Blockchain May Be Positioned to Impact the Gaming Industry\nWith Solana and other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is transforming modern financial markets. At the same time, the technology has opened new doors for digital assets. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a prime example of this. They provide unique ownership options online and impact the Solana price, which is sitting at $103.5 at the time of writing Binance among other platforms. As such, NFTs promise to drive their own trends, which may be seen in the gaming industry.\nWhat Are the Applications of NFTs Today?\nThe adoption of NFTs reached its height in 2021, largely due to high-profile sales and celebrity endorsement. Most of these token projects had to do with limited-release digital artworks, but these digital assets have since found new implementations. Though the NFT market has since gone through a significant correction period, it has newfound potential in several industries.\n\"NFTs go beyond mere collectibles,\" Nikita Sachdev wrote for the Forbes Business Council. \"Their unique digital certificates can prove ownership of real or virtual items, like art, music, or even your car. Stored on a blockchain, they're like one-of-a-kind digital keys that can make buying, selling, and trading more efficient and secure, and reduce the possibility of counterfeits or fraud.\"\nRather than a focus on a distinctive art asset market, innovators and business leaders have leaned into the ownership and utility elements of NFT technology. This trend is especially true for the gaming industry, which has begun to use NFTs to promote true digital ownership of in-game assets. Not only does this empower the playerbase, but allows for the development of new revenue models.\nNFTs and In-Game Digital Ownership\nWhile NFT and crypto-based games have yet to take off, these Web3 initiatives promise a new form of ownership in online spaces. By no longer confining assets to centralized servers or allowing game publishers to restrict them, players can truly say that a skin, item, or in-game currency is their own. This is the ownership that NFT technology aims for, ultimately giving players greater control over their digital possessions.\nThere are already prominent games where skins, items, or in-game currencies are important to players. That said, players must always consider the possibility that these assets could be reclaimed by a publisher or otherwise influenced by a decision to change the system itself. One prominent example of such a decision recently took place on October 23, with an impactful change to Counter-Strike 2.\n\"Counter-Strike 2's October 23 update sent shockwaves through the skin trading community,\" Calum Patterson explained for Dexerto, \"with significant impacts in the aftermath of a major change to how players can obtain knives and gloves.\"\nPlay-to-Earn and Tokenized Incentives\nRather than focusing strictly on NFT assets, certain blockchain-based games will reward players with tokens that can be used in-game. These tokens may be used to acquire NFT assets or unlock features and content. This approach shifts some control over the gaming ecosystem from developers, such as the team behind Counter-Strike 2, to the player community.\n\"Companies can use NFTs to offer unique rewards to their customers,\" Allie Grace Garnett wrote for Britannica Money. \"An NFT can grant special access privileges, transfer ownership of a rare digital collectible, or create a personalized digital experience. Rewards that are tokenized into NFTs may also be transferred between users.\"\nIn this vein, there is a possibility that rewards tokens and full NFTs could function across multiple games and platforms. As such, interoperable systems may enable players to transfer their progress, identity, or in-game assets from one digital world to another. Lacking an NFT's capability to track ownership by means of the blockchain, this kind of advancement may not have otherwise been feasible.\nHow Scalable Bloc"

                "body": "How the SOL to USD Rate Influences Web3 Developer Adoption on Solana\nAs Web3 solutions grow in popularity, leading platforms like Solana (SOL) are attracting community developers and tech startups alike. By relying on its native cryptocurrency, these innovators benefit from faster speeds and lower transaction costs from SOL to USD. While more established players like Ethereum still hold the majority of attention in Web3, more developers than ever are considering Solana.\n\u201cSolana\u2019s startup ecosystem has made significant gains in recent years,\u201d Samuel Haig wrote for The Defiant, \u201cnow accounting for 18% of projects after dipping to 8% amid the aftermath of FTX\u2019s collapse in late 2022.\u201d\nSOL to USD and Web3 Startups\nAccording to 2024 data from the Alliance crypto accelerator program, about 80% of Web3 startups are building on either Ethereum or Solana. Between these two projects, Ethereum attracts 62% of ventures and Solana attracts 18%. Since 2022, however, Solana has begun to gradually close the gap. This momentum reflects significant potential for the platform, as well as any projects developed with it.\nSOL to USD Versus ETH to USD\nUltimately, the differences between Solana and Ethereum come down to technical limitations and recency. As a market leader, Bitcoin\u2019s prominence is tied solely to the valuation of its cryptocurrency; very few developers rely on its blockchain due to its inefficiency. Solana and Ethereum, on the other hand, are platforms dedicated to supporting Web3 development in realms like decentralized finance (DeFi).\nTo achieve greater efficiency, Solana and Ethereum adopted a different \u201cproof of\u201d model than Bitcoin\u2019s original proof-of-work (PoW) solution. Today, Ethereum uses a proof of stake (PoS) model while Solana relies on a hybrid proof of history (PoH) and PoS solution. While the PoS system is faster and more efficient than PoW, Solana\u2019s hybrid PoH and PoS is designed to outpace both.\n\u201cMuch of the buzz surrounding Solana in 2021 was due to its distinct advantage over Ethereum in terms of transaction speed and processing costs,\u201d Elvis Picardo wrote for Investopedia. \u201cAs of Sept. 18, 2024, Solana processed over 2,400 transactions per second, each costing $0.00026 on average. In contrast, Ethereum can handle fewer than 15 TPS, while average transaction fees are around $0.30.\u201d\nA Platform Built for Solana-Powered Web3\nWith processing times and low fees that outdo the competition by significant margins, many developers favor Solana for Web3 innovation. While its native cryptocurrency may not compare to leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of strict valuation, the utility of Sol in on-platform cases is notable. In the end, what makes Solana different is that developers and startups like it.\nFor these reasons, it is perhaps unsurprising that Solana\u2019s market share has grown significantly since 2022, suggesting developer interest, though Ethereum still attracts a significant volume of projects. While the platform\u2019s status as a more established player has given it an advantage, Solana\u2019s performance advantages will be hard to ignore moving forward. If Solana can continue to distinguish itself as an innovative solution, innovators are likely to continue this shift in direction.\n\u201cSolana is one of those cryptocurrencies that\u2019s been buzzing for its speed and low fees,\u201d a blog post for OneSafe explained. \u201cBut with great power comes great responsibility, or in this case, risk\u2026 Startups will need to pull out all the stops to manage the risks. Think about diversifying your assets, using stablecoins when you can, and not going all in on crypto. It\u2019s a balancing act, but one that might pay off.\u201d\nCommunity Apps on Solana\nDecentralized apps (dApps) have also gained significant attention recently, especially those with blockchain-based use cases. Applications in ticketing, local event management, and loyalty programs can be built using Solana\u2019s native systems, and these startup tools serve to expand the platform beyond crypto "

                "body": "Supreme Court Tariffs Ruling Jolts Dow Jones Index\nInvestors react to a pivotal Supreme Court decision on tariffs as economic data and big corporate moves add volatility to the trading day.\nShare\nAs the sun rose over New York City on February 20, 2026, all eyes turned to the New York Stock Exchange, where the opening bell signaled the start of a trading day charged with anticipation. The reason? A much-awaited Supreme Court ruling on tariffs\u2014often referred to as the Trump tariffs\u2014was set to reverberate through financial markets, and investors were bracing for impact.\nAccording to live coverage from the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones Index became a focal point for traders and analysts alike, as they tried to gauge the immediate fallout from the high-stakes decision. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, which had been keenly anticipated by market participants, was expected to set the tone for not just the day, but potentially the weeks ahead.\nEarly in the trading day, Dow Jones futures dipped slightly, mirroring a cautious sentiment that was also reflected in S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures. As reported by Investors Business Daily, the futures market signaled a sense of uncertainty, with investors digesting both the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and a slate of big economic data scheduled for release before the market opened. The twin forces of legal and economic news created a complex backdrop, one that traders had to navigate with care.\n\u201cBig economic data is due before the open while the Supreme Court could issue a Trump tariffs ruling,\u201d Investors Business Daily noted, highlighting the double whammy facing investors. The timing couldn\u2019t have been tighter; the economic data, combined with the legal outcome, meant that the first minutes of trading would be anything but routine.\nAgainst this backdrop, certain stocks made notable moves in after-hours trading on February 19. AI infrastructure leader Comfort Systems (FIX) saw its shares rise late on strong earnings, a rare bright spot in a market otherwise characterized by caution. Meanwhile, Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Grail (GRAL) were among the session\u2019s biggest losers, underscoring the volatility that has become a hallmark of earnings season.\nBut the drama wasn\u2019t confined to the courtroom or the macroeconomic stage. On the corporate front, Tesla (TSLA) managed to grab headlines of its own by introducing a new $59,990 Cybertruck variant on February 19. While not directly tied to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the move added another layer of intrigue to a week already packed with market-moving events. Tesla\u2019s new offering was seen as a strategic play, aimed at broadening the appeal of its much-hyped electric truck and capturing a wider swath of the market.\nFor those watching the broader market, the interplay between legal decisions, economic indicators, and corporate news created a sense of whiplash. As the Dow Jones Index flickered on the big board at the New York Stock Exchange, traders scrambled to interpret what the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling would mean for tariffs, international trade, and the broader economy. Would the decision offer clarity and stability, or would it inject fresh uncertainty into an already jittery market?\nOne thing was clear: the Supreme Court\u2019s involvement in tariff policy\u2014particularly measures put in place during the Trump administration\u2014was no small matter. Tariffs have long been a flashpoint in debates over trade, economic growth, and America\u2019s role in the global economy. By weighing in, the Court was not only shaping the legal landscape but also sending ripples through boardrooms and trading floors alike.\nMeanwhile, the economic data released before the open added another layer of complexity. While the details of the data were eagerly awaited, market watchers understood that any surprises\u2014positive or negative\u2014could amplify the day\u2019s volatility. For investors, it was a day to keep one eye on the ticker and the other on the headlines.\nIn the corporate arena, the afte"

                "body": "FTSE 100 Gains as Retail Sales Beat Expectations and Surplus Hits Record\nThe FTSE 100 has shown strong upward momentum recently as the UK economy delivered surprisingly robust data on consumer spending and government finances. Retail sales in January 2026 rose much more than economists expected, and the UK recorded its largest monthly budget surplus on record, boosting investor confidence in the stock market. These developments contributed to rising share prices across major components of the FTSE 100 and offered investors renewed optimism about economic growth prospects in the UK.\nLatest Economic Data Supporting the FTSE 100 Rally\nRetail Sales Surge Beyond Forecasts\nRecent official data confirmed that UK retail sales volumes rose by 1.8% month-on-month in January 2026, far surpassing the modest 0.2% increase expected by economists. This represented the strongest monthly rise since May 2024. On an annual basis, retail sales climbed 4.5% compared with a year earlier, well above consensus estimates. This strong performance was driven by robust demand in non-food retailers, including technology, automotive fuel, and speciality goods.\nThe unexpected strength in retail activity signals consumer resilience early in 2026, and this trend helped lift sentiment on the FTSE 100 as investors reacted to improved spending data. Higher retail sales imply stronger corporate earnings for major consumer brands and retailers listed on the index.\nHistoric Budget Surplus Boosts Market Confidence\nAround the same time, the UK government reported a record budget surplus of \u00a330.4 billion in January 2026, the highest monthly surplus since records began in 1993. This figure exceeded the forecast of around \u00a324 billion and largely reflected strong tax receipts and reduced borrowing costs. Corporate tax payments, income tax contributions, and capital gains taxes all contributed to the increase.\nA larger surplus suggests stronger public finances and may help ease concerns about government debt levels and future taxation. For investors, this signals an improving macro backdrop, which can support higher valuations on the FTSE 100.\nFTSE 100 at Record Levels\nThe combined effects of retail data and fiscal strength helped send the FTSE 100 index to new record highs, reaching more than 10,686 points recently. This marked the index\u2019s second consecutive all-time peak, propelled by strength in commodity and defence stocks as well as renewed support for domestically sensitive companies.\nSector Trends Within the Rally\nMiners and Commodities\n- Mining stocks such as Antofagasta and Anglo American saw gains of around 10.5% and 4.6% respectively in recent sessions.\n- Companies like Glencore also boosted the index after reporting strong earnings and shareholder payouts.\nDefence and Export-oriented Firms\n- Defence giant BAE Systems climbed nearly 4% on strong earnings and a record order backlog exceeding \u00a383.6 billion.\nCommodity price strength and global demand for metals and defence equipment helped support these sectors, which carry significant weight within the FTSE 100.\nRetail Sector\u2019s Influence on Market Sentiment\nThe unexpected January rise in retail figures reflects regained spending momentum after weaker consumer activity in late 2025. Prior data showed a bounce back in retail sales volumes after years of more modest growth or even small declines in some months. For example, retail sales rose by 0.4% in December 2025, exceeding expectations after a fall in November.\nConsumer confidence appeared bolstered by lower inflation pressures, and technology retailers and non-food sectors contributed strongly to the gains. Boosted retail demand can improve earnings projections for those companies contributing to FTSE 100 returns, further strengthening investor confidence.\nRole of Global and UK Interest Rate Outlook\nMarket expectations of future central bank action have also influenced the FTSE 100\u2019s performance. Cooling inflation in the UK has increased bets on interest rate c"

FY27 expectations have softened across most sectors, according to Datastream data cited by UBS.\nUBS economists forecast UK GDP growth of 1.1% in 2026 and 1.4% in 2027, following 1.3% growth in 2025. CPI inflation fell to 3% year-on-year in January 2026 and is forecast to average 2% in 2026, with a sharp step-down expected in April when household energy bills are cut.\nThe Bank of England is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points each in March and June 2026 to a terminal rate of 3.25%, though UBS said risks are skewed toward further cuts below that level, citing BoE data.\nOptions markets have shifted from \"conditional calm\" to early risk hedging, while domestic outflows persist across active and passive UK equity fund categories.\nAlternative long/short equity UK was the only UK equity fund type to record positive active inflows in the four weeks to Feb. 18, according to LSEG Lipper data cited in the report.\nUBS identified two screening frameworks for investors: a quality yield and cash discipline screen targeting FTSE 350 companies with forward dividend yields above 3.5%, positive buyback yields and forward free cash flow yields above 5%; and a SMID alpha disloc"

                "body": "DAX Today, February 21: 25,000 Support Wobbles on Iran Tensions\nDAX today opened on the back foot as Iran tensions, an oil price surge, and rate uncertainty weighed on risk appetite. After a brief push higher, the index faded to close 0.9% lower at 25,043, keeping the 25,000 support in focus. The ^GDAXI has tested this line repeatedly, while a stronger dollar pressures exporters. With geopolitical risks elevated and US rate-cut hopes cooling, we expect choppy sessions and tight ranges to define near-term trading for German investors.\nMarket Drivers: Geopolitics, Oil, and Rates\nDAX today reflects rising risk aversion as Middle East tensions support crude and the US dollar. Higher oil lifts energy names but squeezes margins for transport and chemicals, while a firm dollar dampens exporters\u2019 earnings translation. Local sentiment mirrors this push-pull setup, with investors rotating intra-day rather than adding broad exposure. See coverage from Handelsblatt and Tagesschau.\nDAX today also faces rate uncertainty. Softer odds of early Fed cuts and a cautious ECB stance keep real yields firm, limiting multiple expansion. A stronger dollar tightens financial conditions for Germany\u2019s export-heavy index, while earnings sensitivity remains high. With 25,000 support tested several times, buyers defend the floor, but conviction stays low given headline risk and a less generous rates backdrop.\nLevels to Watch: 25,000 Support and Nearby Resistance\nDAX today sits on a critical area. The index touched a day low at 24,983 and settled near 25,043, underscoring defense of 25,000 support. Average True Range near 283 points signals brisk swings, while ADX at 15.8 implies no strong trend. In this setup, failed breaks are common, favouring tactical entries over directional bets until a decisive close clears key levels.\nDAX today shows mixed momentum: RSI at 59.66 is constructive, MACD remains positive, and CCI near 137 flashes short-term overbought. The upper Bollinger Band around 25,309 and today\u2019s high near 25,229 outline resistance. We see a working range near 24,800 to 25,300. A daily close above 25,300 would open 25,500, while a close below 24,900 risks a deeper pullback.\nSector Moves: Winners and Laggards in Frankfurt\nDAX today tends to favour energy-adjacent, defense suppliers, and selected materials when oil and geopolitical risks rise. Higher crude can also buoy upstream services and logistics pricing. Staples and healthcare often provide ballast in drawdowns. Chemicals may split, with feedstock costs weighing but pricing power helping better-positioned names. Short-squeeze action can appear late in the session as dealers hedge exposure.\nDAX today often sees autos, airlines, and discretionary underperform when oil rises and the dollar firms. Rate-sensitive plays, including real estate and growth-heavy tech, can also soften if yields tick higher. Exporters face currency translation headwinds, so investors may prefer companies with strong EUR cost bases or natural hedges. Positioning remains light, keeping reversals sharp on any softening headline flow.\nStrategy for German Investors This Week\nDAX today argues for disciplined tactics. Consider scaling entries near 25,000 support and 24,800 on deeper dips, using tight stops just under 24,900 to manage gap risk. With ATR near 283 points, position sizing should reflect wider intraday ranges. Options or inverse ETFs can hedge overnight risk while keeping core exposure intact. Avoid chasing early spikes during headline-driven moves.\nDAX today will track oil moves, Middle East headlines, and any guidance on Fed and ECB paths. Watch Germany and eurozone PMIs, ECB commentary, US inflation prints, and crude inventory data. Dollar direction remains crucial for exporters. A sustained break and close above 25,300 would argue for momentum follow-through, while a close below 24,900 would shift bias to defense and cash.\nFinal Thoughts\nDAX today sits at a crossroads: 25,000 support keeps attracting buyers, but "

                "body": "This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\nA post on X claimed to be a simple message from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Stay active; eat well. But the 90-second video it shared, called \u201cSecretary Kennedy and Kid Rock\u2019s Rock Out Work Out,\u201d seems designed to be bewildering. Here was Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eating steak and doing preacher curls in his belted blue jeans and a pair of hiking shoes; and here he was again, stripping off his T-shirt to ride an exercise bike inside a sauna; and here he was a little later, strutting over to a cold-plunge tub (still in his blue jeans but with the belt removed); and here he went into the tub, sliding underwater in his dungarees.\nWhy was the HHS secretary bathing in a pair of pants? The video never provides an answer for this question, even as Kennedy plays pickleball, then mugs for the camera, then soaks in a Jacuzzi with a glass of milk, all while still in jeans. It\u2019s just bizarre\u2014a PSA that presumably has been dialed in by his staff to maximize its WTF effect. (The video has been viewed more than 13 million times and produced some 11,000 replies; HHS did not respond to a request for comment about the video or the jeans.) However his peculiar gymwear habit started, its present state is very clear: The secretary\u2019s jeans are self-aware.\nKennedy\u2019s proclivity for working out in belted denim long predates the knowing wink with which it\u2019s now displayed. Take the summer\u2019s \u201cDOD-HHS Fitness Challenge,\u201d for which Kennedy donned his favorite workout gear and did a bunch of pull-ups with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Or the viral clip of him from 2023, wearing jeans and boots and nothing else, squeezing out a final set on Venice Beach. I don\u2019t believe that these show a man who lifts in jeans to maximize his clicks. I believe that they show instead a man who fits a waning archetype in fitness culture, a species that has for decades been endemic to the gym: Kennedy is a jeans guy.\nI\u2019ve worked out, off and on, for more than 30 years\u2014and for all of that time, the jeans guys have remained a steady presence on the rubber floors. They are sometimes taciturn, sometimes chatty. They often pair their jeans with boots, as Kennedy will do, and with a T-shirt or a tank top or a hoodie. But lest you think he simply has no truck with any gym-specific gear, the jeans guy is sometimes spotted wearing padded lifting gloves, or a leather lifting belt across his Levi\u2019s. At times, his social role will overlap with that of other weight-room regulars, not least of which is the gym grandpa, who hangs around and shoots the breeze and doles out tips on how to lift. However he appears, and however much he gabs, the jeans guy\u2019s social status is the same: He\u2019s an outsider. Rarely does one find a jeans guy paired up with a workout partner. \u201cIt\u2019s usually like, \u2018The jeans guy rides alone,\u2019\u201d Tolga Ozyurtcu, a historian of physical culture at the University of Texas at Austin, told me when I called him up to talk about this phenomenon.\nNot everyone enjoys the company of the jeans guy. Some see him as a threat. Planet Fitness once made a point of banning denim in the gym, along with grunting, dropping dumbbells, and judging others. (Those who broke these rules could be punished with a \u201clunk alarm\u201d and summarily kicked out.) But this discrimination feels as ill-considered as it is unfair: In my experience, jeans guys are harmless at the very worst, and at best, they add some needed color to a dreary landscape. In this way, the jeans guys are akin to other gentle curiosities, such as the shorts guys who alight on college campuses in wintertime, and the black chipmunks that scamper by from time to time in city parks.\nWhat motivates the jeans guy? No one knows. He is, if nothing else, as inscrutable as a four-leaf clover. Ask him why he isn\u2019t wearing shorts, and he will likely tell you that he chooses denim for efficiency.

                "body": "Real Effective Exchange Rate at 67.73 in January\nLowest Level Since Adoption of Floating Exchange Rate System in 1973\nIn January, Japan's real effective exchange rate for the yen was recorded at 67.73, marking the lowest level since 1973, when the country adopted a floating exchange rate system.\nNihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei) reported on the 21st that the yen has significantly depreciated in value against global currencies. Compared with the peak of 193.95 in April 1995, the current value of the yen is only about one-third of that level.\nThe real effective exchange rate is an indicator that shows how much actual purchasing power a country's currency has compared with the currencies of other countries. When the figure is lower than in the base year, it means that the currency is relatively weak in international trade. Nikkei cited Japan's prolonged economic stagnation and its low interest rate policy as the background to the yen's weakness.\nIn the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the value of the yen has recently plunged against the dollar, with the dollar-yen exchange rate at one point rising to the low 155-yen range. Some speculative investors who had been driving yen buying have incurred unexpected losses and have begun unwinding their positions. Analysts say that long positions built in anticipation of possible Japanese government intervention in the foreign exchange market are being reduced due to the burden of mounting losses.\nThe interest rate gap between the United States and Japan is also a factor fueling the yen's weakness. While the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate stands at around 3.5% to 3.75% per year, Japan's rate is as low as 0.75%, leading to analysis that the attractiveness of holding yen is diminished in terms of real interest rates. As a result, international investors are shifting their funds into currencies such as the dollar, the euro, and the yuan, which offer higher operational efficiency.\nMarket experts predict that the yen's weak trend is unlikely to reverse in the near term unless the Bank of Japan further raises its benchmark interest rate or strengthens its hawkish monetary policy stance. They point out that for the yen to regain its status as a \"safe-haven currency,\" a clear policy shift by Japan's financial authorities is necessary.\n\u00a9 The Asia Business Daily(www.asiae.co.kr).
