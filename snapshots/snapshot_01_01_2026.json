                "body": "Gold and silver see rollercoaster end to blockbuster year\nGold and silver have seen a rollercoaster end to a year in which their prices are on track to record their biggest annual gains since 1979.\nThe price of gold soared by more than 60% this year to hit a record high of more than $4,549 (\u00a33,378) an ounce before falling after Christmas to stand at about $4,330 on New Year's Eve.\nAt the same time, silver was trading at about $71 an ounce after hitting an all-time high of $83.62 on Monday.\nThis year's gains were driven by several factors including expectations of more interest rate cuts, but experts warned sharp increases over the year could lead to a drop in gold and silver prices in 2026.\n\"Gold and silver prices are experiencing a notable rise due to the interplay of several economic, investment, and geopolitical factors,\" said Rania Gule from trading platform XS.com.\nThe main driver of the price rises of precious metals, she added, are expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in 2026. Prices of gold and silver were also buoyed by gold purchases by central banks and investors buying so-called \"safe haven\" assets due to concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.\nDan Coatsworth, head of markets at investment platform AJ Bell, said soaring gold and silver prices had been driven by investors \"latching onto precious metals in response to concerns over inflation\" as well as volatile stock markets.\n\"The market backdrop looks unchanged as we move into 2026,\" he added.\nMr Coatsworth said high government debt in the UK and US, as well as Donald Trump's tariffs and nerves over a potential AI bubble, would encourage investors to \"stay bullish on gold and silver\".\nBut he warned sharp gains for the assets in 2025 make them vulnerable to a sharp pullback next year.\nHe said: \"If financial markets go through a difficult patch, investors looking to liquidate positions might first reach for assets that have delivered strong gains in the past year or so, or ones that are easy to sell. Gold ticks both boxes.\"\nMs Gule said she expects gold to continue to rise in 2026 but \"at a more stable pace compared to the record highs observed in 2025\".\nAlso this year, central banks around the world added hundreds of tons of gold to their reserves, according to the World Gold Council trade association.\nDaniel Takieddine, co-founder of investment firm Sky Links Capital Group, points to \"supply tightness and industrial demand\" for helping to push up the price of silver.\nChina, which is the world's second biggest producer of silver, has said it would restrict the export of the precious metal.\nIn October, China's Ministry of Commerce announced new restrictions on exports of silver as well as the metals tungsten and antimony to \"to step up the protection of resources and the environment\".\nResponding to a post on social media about Chinese government restrictions on silver exports, Tesla boss Elon Musk said: \"This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes.\"\nMr Takieddine also highlighted the large amounts of money that have flowed into the precious metals market through investments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nETFs are baskets of investments that trade on a stock exchange like a single stock. They can be seen as a convenient way to trade precious metals as investors do not have to take possession of physical bullion.\nSilver also has the potential to rise again in the coming year, said Mr Takieddine. But he warns \"rallies may be followed by sharper corrections.\""

Certainly, it seems like the sort of catalysts animating gold, especially over the course of the past year, have become self-sustaining,\u201d Spivak said.\nThe gold price is set for its strongest annual rise in more than four decades with spot gold up 65% in the year-to-date \u2013 see below. It has also helped golden ETFs like the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) do well this year.\nIt has been driven higher by investors seeing it as a safe haven during economic and geopolitical unrest.\nThere has been plenty of that in 2025 with President Trump\u2019s tariffs leading to trade spats around the globe and wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. Central banks scooping up the precious metal, especially China, to bolster their financial security has also helped.\nInterest Rate Damper\nAnother strong driver has been the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. Gold tends to do well in times of lower rates.\nIn December, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. That is the lowest since 2022 and marked the third cut of 2025.\nInvestors had been hoping that another cut could be upcoming in January but minutes from that December meeting released yesterday have put a damper on those expectations.\nThe move was approved by a close 9-3 vote. Two Fed officials supported keeping the rate unchanged, while one wanted a larger, half-point reduction. The main concerns were persistent inflation and an uncertain job market.\nThis means that the Fed is likely to pursue a \u201chigher for longer\u201d policy, pushing the next potential cut to April at the earliest.\nIt left the spot gold price today down 0.6% at $4,306. But expectations for a stronger 2026 remain high.\nBank of America (BAC) expects gold to trade at an average price of $4,538 per troy ounce in 2026 and sees a path to $5,000. The World Gold Council also sees the metal hitting that milestone driven by \u201celevated geopolitical stress and a pronounced flight-to-safety.\u201d\nWhat are the Best Gold ETFs to Buy Now?\nWe have rounded up the best gold ETFs to buy now through our TipRanks comparison tool."

(Angel Garcia/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nGold and silver are having their best year since the Bee Gees were topping music charts in the late 1970s.\nSuggested Reading\nInvestors are snapping up the precious metals as uncertainty grips global markets, ranging from President Donald Trump's tariffs to his blistering attacks on the Federal Reserve. Now gold and silver are on track to post their best annual performances since 1979, when high inflation and crises in the Middle East similarly unnerved investors seeking safe havens to park their cash.\nRelated Content\nPart of the demand for gold has been powered by central banks in China and Brazil, according to senior analyst Krishan Gopaul of the World Gold Council.\nGold is treated as a safe investment to hedge against risks to dominant currencies like the U.S. dollar. Its value tends to increase when the U.S. dollar weakens. That's been the case in 2025, with the dollar shedding about 10% of its value while the price of gold futures soared 64% so far this year. Gold prices, though, fell sharply on Monday after exchange operator CME raised margin requirements to ensure traders hand over more cash to support their bets.\nAs of Tuesday, gold futures were trading at $4,400 per ounce, still near record highs.\nSilver recorded a banner year as well, experiencing a 136% boost in value since January. Silver was trading at roughly $76 per ounce as of Tuesday. These days, one ounce of silver is worth more than a barrel of crude oil, per The Wall Street Journal. Investors and money managers view it as a cheaper alternative to gold and expensive stocks, rendering it a more attractive metal.\nStill, silver prices dropped 5% on Monday, its worst daily trading session in four years. It prompted concern from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, since silver serves as a critical element in industry and manufacturing.\nThe Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates next year, which has served to further spike prices for gold and silver as well."

                "body": "(Oil Price)\u2013 The latest flare-up between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen looks dramatic on the surface, but OPEC cohesion, not missiles or militias, is what ultimately matters to the oil markets, which is why the latest public spat between Saudi Arabia and the UAE over Yemen created just a temporary blip in crude prices.\nSaudi forces intercepted this week what they said was an unauthorized UAE-linked shipment of weapons and military equipment destined for southern Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition dished out an airstrike on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla after Riyadh framed it as a security breach. Abu Dhabi claimed that the equipment was intended for its own counterterrorism forces and denied that it was arming separatist groups.\nIn the end, the UAE said it would pull out its remaining forces out of Yemen, according to Reuters.\nIt is messy, public, and awkward \u2014 especially given that Saudi Arabia and the UAE sit at the core of OPEC\u2019s decision-making. Yet for oil markets, the immediate impact is close to zero. And that is precisely because OPEC is not a club held together by shared values, shared foreign policy, or shared views on Yemen.\nOPEC works because its members can disagree (even loudly) on politics while still coordinating production plans.\nWe have seen this before, although perhaps not on this scale. Saudi-Emirati tensions over Yemen are not new. Both countries entered the conflict together in 2015, then gradually diverged as their interests in southern Yemen split. Riyadh prioritizes territorial unity and border security. Abu Dhabi has backed southern factions it sees as better aligned with its maritime and security goals. Those differences have simmered for years, and yet they haven\u2019t blown up OPEC policy.\nThere is precedent to draw on for the oil market. In 2021, the UAE openly threatened to block an OPEC+ deal over production baselines, arguing that its rapidly expanding capacity was being unfairly constrained. A compromise eventually resolved the dispute, but exposed OPEC\u2019s real sticking point: capacity growth versus quota discipline.\nThat dynamic is far more relevant heading into 2026 than any Yemen-related spat. Next year is already looking like it will be a tense one for OPEC, with forecasts warning of oversupply and softer prices, even as OPEC itself has avoided endorsing the glut narrative. But managing production targets in that environment will require cohesion\u2014harmony over Yemen is not required.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s challenge is not that its partners occasionally clash outside the oil market. It is ensuring that those clashes do not bleed into production policy when restraint matters most. Yemen noise may test diplomatic bandwidth, but history suggests that OPEC can function perfectly well without everyone holding hands, as long as they still agree on the math.\nBy Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com"

                "body": "(Oil Price)\u2013 Argentina, in a surprise development, overtook Colombia to become South America\u2019s fourth-largest oil producer. The country is undergoing a once-in-a-generation unconventional hydrocarbon boom, which began with Buenos Aires nationalizing integrated energy major YPF in 2012. Since then, Argentina\u2019s oil and natural gas output has kept soaring higher, regularly hitting new monthly highs as volumes of shale oil and gas production grow. It is Argentina\u2019s national oil company, YPF, which is at the forefront of the boom with it responsible for this strong production growth.\nFor November 2025, Argentina\u2019s crude oil production, despite falling from the October 2025 record of 849,646 barrels per day to 844,386 barrels per day, was still an impressive 12.5% higher than a year earlier. This was the first month out of the last six where output did not rise to a new record high. Rapidly growing shale oil production in the Vaca Muerta shale, Spanish for Dead Cow, is driving Argentina\u2019s stunning production growth. For November 2025, shale oil output hit a new monthly record of 578,461 barrels per day, a 30.68% year over year increase, which saw it responsible for 68.51% Argentina\u2019s total production.\nNatural gas production, however, continues to decline. Output dropped 7% year over year to 4.2 billion cubic feet per day, the lowest level since December 2023. This represents a sharp drop from the record 5.7 billion cubic feet per day pumped for July 2025. It is rising shale gas output from the Vaca Muerta which is responsible for the solid growth of Argentina\u2019s natural gas production over the last five years. For November 2025, shale gas production fell 1% year over year to 2.7 billion cubic feet daily, which despite being significantly less than the record 3.8 billion cubic feet per day reported for July 2025, still comprised 65% of Argentina\u2019s total gas production.\nSince July 2025, a combination of well maintenance, reduced drilling activity due to weaker spot prices, and a lack of infrastructure, notably storage and pipeline facilities, which is impacting takeaway capacity, are weighing on output. Indeed, the lack of pipeline and other transportation infrastructure has long been viewed as a key constraint with the potential to impact production in the Vaca Muerta. Although the increasingly prolific shale formation and Argentina\u2019s national oil company YPF will be responsible for further production growth.\nThe 8.6-million-acre Vaca Muerta is a massive shale formation, roughly the size of Switzerland, located in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin in northern Patagonia. It is among the world\u2019s largest unconventional hydrocarbon resources and is frequently compared to the prolific Eagle Ford and Permian shales. The Vaca Muerta is estimated to contain 16 billion barrels of light tight oil and 308 trillion cubic feet of tight gas, making it the world\u2019s fourth-largest unconventional oil and second-largest unconventional gas reserve. According to analysts, characteristics such as superior shale thickness, greater quantities of biological material, higher reservoir pressures, and increased well productivity make the Vaca Muerta superior to major U.S. shale plays.\nAfter a decade of development, the Vaca Muerta is responsible for 69% of Argentina\u2019s oil production and 65% of the country\u2019s natural gas output. With less than a tenth of the formation under development, there is tremendous production growth ahead. By the end of the decade, Argentina\u2019s crude oil output is expected to hit at least 1 million barrels per day, with some analysts forecasting 1.5 million barrels per day by 2030. This is a massive increase over the 787,395 barrels per day lifted for the first 11 months of 2025. Natural gas output is expected to surpass 6 billion cubic feet per day by 2030, driven by the Vaca Muerta\u2019s rising shale gas production.\nIt is national oil company YPF and its unconventional hydrocarbon acreage in the Vaca Muerta that will be responsible for most of the expansion "

Price has been coiling just below, and the focus is on a breakout into the yearly cross with the broader outlook still constructive into 2026.\nFederal Reserve in the Spotlight\nFOMC Interest Rate Dot Plot\nIn December, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for a third time in 2025 with benchmark rate closing the year at 3.50%-3.75%. The updated Summary of Economic Projections shows the committee remains deeply divided on the path of monetary policy with the interest rate dot-plot distribution widening out. Despite an improved growth outlook and softening inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggests the next move will likely be lower with rates now \u2018generally in the range of neutral\u2019. Fed fund futures are pricing a 60% probability the next rate-cut will be at the March 26 meeting.\nFOMC Summary of Economic Projections\nSource: FOMC\nWhile the Committee acknowledged tensions on both sides of the dual mandate, labor market data will be critical in shaping the interest rate outlook for next year. Notably, Chair Powell suggested in the latest press conference that monthly jobs figures may be overstated by nearly 60K, increasing the likelihood that policymakers will place greater weight on labor trends. With the central bank showing a willingness to tolerate a longer period of above-target inflation, the real threat to the 2026 outlook would be unexpected strength in the jobs market. Ultimately, it may take better-than-expected labor data to slow the USD bears.\nFed Fund Futures- FedWatch Tool\nMarkets are now pricing a 77% probability the Fed will cut at least twice next year, with a 47% chance they will deliver three-cuts. Keep in mind Chair Powell will be ending his term in just a few months, and while his successor is likely to lean more dovish, the easing may still be limited in scope if the economy continues to outperform. Keep in mind the impact of President Trump\u2019s key legislative accomplishment, the Big Beautiful Bull, are going to be felt early in the year with estimates this could be the largest tax-refund season in history. Bottom line: the risks to the Fed outlook are stronger jobs, or hotter inflation. Aside from surprises in one of these two components, rates are heading lower next year. For the US Dollar, traders have largely priced two cuts\u2013 the focus is on a how far off the market is from what the Fed delivers. Stronger US data might start to be good for the US Dollar again.\nECB Outlook: Rates Likely on Hold in 2026\nSource: ECB\nThe ECB left interest rates unchanged in December, with updated staff projections showing a modest upward revision to the Euro area growth outlook. President Christine Lagarde emphasized that the Governing Council sees \u201cdomestic demand as the main engine of growth in the years ahead,\u201d noting that increased government spending on infrastructure and defense should continue to support activity. While the 2026 inflation forecast was revised 20 basis points higher, the broader projection continues to place inflation near the 2% target through 2028. Overall, the ECB appears comfortable with its current policy stance, and rates are likely to remain steady through next year.\nSource: ECB\nWith the ECB on hold and the Fed expected to ease further, the interest rate disparity is likely to be supportive for the Euro next year.

                "body": "The EUR/USD pair comes under mild selling pressure near the 1.1745 area during the early Asian session on Wednesday, as the US Dollar edges higher following the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting minutes. With the New Year holidays approaching, trading activity remains thin, which is contributing to modest and somewhat choppy price action. Later in the day, market participants will turn their attention to the US Initial Jobless Claims report for additional short-term direction.\nThe minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s December 9\u201310 meeting revealed that the Fed delivered a widely expected 25-basis-point interest rate cut, bringing the federal funds target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. Policymakers who supported the move pointed to rising downside risks to employment alongside easing inflation pressures. However, the decision highlighted notable divisions within the Committee. Governor Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a larger, \u201cjumbo\u201d cut, while Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid voted to keep rates unchanged, reflecting differing views on how best to balance growth and inflation risks.\nOverall, most Fed officials agreed that additional rate cuts could be appropriate over time, provided inflation continues to cool. That said, there was no clear consensus on the timing or total extent of future easing. This lack of clarity was reflected in market pricing, with the probability of a January rate cut slipping slightly to around 15%, according to the CME FedWatch tool, following the release of the minutes. Analysts noted that the absence of a strong directional signal from the Fed is leaving markets with limited guidance, contributing to range-bound moves in currencies and Treasury yields alike.\nOn the Euro side, losses in EUR/USD may be tempered by growing expectations that the European Central Bank is nearing the end of its easing cycle. The ECB left interest rates unchanged at its latest meeting and suggested that policy is likely to remain on hold for an extended period. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized that heightened uncertainty prevents the bank from offering firm forward guidance, reinforcing a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach. Reflecting this stance, money markets currently assign less than a 10% probability to a 25-basis-point ECB rate cut by February 2026.\nTaken together, a cautiously firmer US Dollar and a relatively steady ECB outlook suggest EUR/USD may remain confined within a narrow range in the near term, especially amid low holiday liquidity and limited fresh catalysts.\nTrade Idea:\nSell EUR/USD on rallies toward 1.1780, targeting 1.1650, with a stop above 1.1830, as Fed uncertainty supports the Dollar while ECB easing expectations remain limited."

                "body": "The EUR/USD experienced a decline to a new weekly low of around 1.1740 as the US Dollar remained steady. Despite the US Dollar index reaching a weekly high near 98.25, most Federal Open Market Committee members endorsed interest rate cuts if inflation drops as anticipated.\nThe FOMC\u2019s minutes indicated a need to return to a neutral policy to prevent job market decline. The CME FedWatch tool forecasts a 50 basis points cut in interest rates by the Fed in 2026. Meanwhile, the Euro\u2019s activity is muted with the ECB expected to maintain interest rates, as Eurozone inflation remains close to the 2% target.\nTechnical Analysis Overview\nThe technical analysis shows EUR/USD trading at 1.1744, above a rising 20-day EMA at 1.1724, with a positive near-term bias. RSI is at 58, indicating a supportive momentum. The decline from recent peaks has reduced but remains constructive if the price holds above the 20-day EMA.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee reviews economic conditions over eight meetings a year. The FOMC Minutes, released three weeks post-policy decision, can influence the US Dollar, with market reactions potentially delayed as outlets await publication access.\nWith the EUR/USD near 1.1740, we see a classic standoff between central banks as we head into 2026. The Federal Reserve is openly talking about cutting interest rates to support the US job market. This contrasts with the European Central Bank, which seems content to hold steady for now.\nThis policy difference is the main story for the coming weeks. We saw in the November 2025 jobs report that US payrolls grew by only 150,000, missing expectations and giving the Fed more reason to ease policy. With US inflation having cooled to 2.8% in the latest readings, there is little pressure on the Fed to stay aggressive.\nEurozone Stability and US Policy\nMeanwhile, the Eurozone\u2019s situation appears more stable, supporting the Euro. The latest Eurostat data showed headline inflation holding at 2.1%, right near the ECB\u2019s target. This removes any urgency for the ECB to consider rate cuts, creating a fundamental argument for a stronger Euro against the Dollar.\nFrom a derivatives standpoint, this suggests looking at bullish strategies on the EUR/USD. The technical level of 1.1724 is the key support to watch; as long as we hold above it, buying call options with strikes above the 1.1800 resistance could be a sound play. The low trading volume at the end of the year often means implied volatility is cheap, making options attractive.\nHistorically, after the aggressive rate hike cycle we saw in 2022 and 2023, a shift toward easing policy has weakened the dollar. The current market pricing, with the CME FedWatch tool indicating at least two rate cuts in 2026, confirms this expectation. Therefore, positioning for a potential break higher in EUR/USD in early January seems logical.\nTraders should be mindful that the pair is currently struggling to advance. A break below the 20-day average at 1.1724 would signal that this bullish outlook is premature and a period of consolidation is more likely. The first full trading week of January 2026 will be critical to see if buying interest returns with higher market participation."

                "body": "Pound Sterling trades higher against its major peers, buoyed by expectations of outperforming in 2026 due to fewer anticipated interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. GBP/USD remains subdued at 1.3460 during Asian hours, signalling a weakening bullish outlook as it sits below the ascending channel\u2019s lower boundary.\nDespite holding steady around 1.3465 early on Wednesday, Bank of England policy suggests a gradual downward trend that may support the Pound against the US Dollar. With financial markets expecting low trading volumes on the eve of the New Year holiday, investors prepare for year-end adjustments.\nMarket Indicators And Adjustments\nThe US Dollar Index dips below 98.30, while other major market indicators see varied adjustments. For example, the EUR/USD recovers to 1.1750, the Dow Jones softens, and Gold retreats around $4,300, each reflecting quiet year-end conditions.\nInvestment insights and forecasts hint at trends moving into 2026, including gold and cryptocurrency markets expecting rebounds, while economic stability remains tested. Brokers for foreign exchange and commodities trading provide various advantages and considerations as traders seek optimal platforms for the upcoming year.\nAs we enter the final hours of 2025, the Pound Sterling is showing some softness against the US Dollar, trading around the 1.3460 mark. Trading volumes are predictably thin for the holidays, but we expect liquidity and volatility to return sharply in the first weeks of January 2026. This quiet period offers a moment to position for what comes next.\nBank Of England Rate Decisions\nThe core belief is that the Bank of England will be slower to cut interest rates than other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve. We saw this expectation build after the latest UK inflation data for November 2025 came in stubbornly high at 3.1%, well above the 2% target. In contrast, recent US inflation has cooled, giving the Fed more room to ease policy.\nThis policy divergence is the key reason we anticipate the Pound will outperform in the new year. However, the GBP/USD chart currently shows a slight weakening of its bullish trend, which presents a tactical challenge. This near-term softness could be a buying opportunity for those who trust the fundamental outlook over the holiday-thinned technical picture.\nFor derivative traders, the subdued year-end volatility makes buying GBP/USD call options an attractive strategy for the coming weeks. This allows for positioning for a potential rally back above 1.3500 in January while defining and limiting downside risk. The cost of these options is likely lower now than it will be once full market participation resumes.\nHowever, we must also consider the risk of a stronger-than-expected US economy. The solid US jobs report for November 2025, which added 199,000 jobs, shows underlying resilience that could support the dollar. Therefore, a balanced approach might involve using spreads or purchasing some protective put options to guard against a surprise move lower in the GBP/USD pair.\nWe have seen similar scenarios before, such as the policy divergences that drove currency markets back in 2022. Those periods showed that once a trend based on central bank differences takes hold, it can be sustained for several quarters. The first few weeks of 2026 will be critical in confirming if this new trend has legs."

                "body": "GBP/USD remains under mild bearish pressure on Wednesday, hovering around the 1.3450 level amid subdued trading conditions ahead of the New Year. The pair is weighed down by renewed demand for the US Dollar, largely driven by end-of-year position adjustments and portfolio rebalancing. Thin liquidity during the holiday period is further exaggerating modest price moves, keeping Sterling on the defensive.\nMarkets are firmly expecting the US Federal Reserve to deliver a 25-basis-point interest rate cut at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday. Such a move would mark the third rate reduction this year, lowering the federal funds target range to 3.50%\u20133.75%. However, investors are increasingly focused on the tone of the accompanying statement and forward guidance rather than the cut itself.\nMany traders anticipate what is being described as a \u201chawkish cut,\u201d where the Fed lowers rates but signals caution about further easing. Persistent inflation risks and a still-resilient US labor market could prompt policymakers to hint at a pause in rate cuts in early 2026. Any indication of a more restrained easing path would likely underpin the US Dollar, reinforcing headwinds for GBP/USD in the near term.\nOn the UK side, the Pound continues to face its own set of challenges. Concerns surrounding higher overall tax burdens following the UK autumn budget have dampened sentiment toward Sterling. At the same time, easing inflation pressures and signs of a cooling labor market have strengthened expectations that the Bank of England may continue to loosen monetary policy.\nFinancial markets are now pricing in an approximately 88% probability that the BoE will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its December meeting. This growing conviction reflects recent data suggesting that inflation momentum is fading, reducing the need for restrictive policy. As a result, policy divergence risks and cautious risk sentiment are likely to keep GBP/USD capped in the near term.\nTrade Idea:\nSell GBP/USD on rebounds toward 1.3520, targeting 1.3350, with a stop above 1.3580, as USD strength and BoE rate-cut expectations continue to pressure the pair."

                "body": "AUD/USD has risen to near 0.6710 as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from December. The Fed signaled a single interest rate reduction in 2026. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is anticipated to implement tighter monetary policies next year.\nRBA Expectations\nThe Australian Dollar gained during the European trading session as expectations of RBA tightening in 2026 increased. In recent communications, RBA officials have expressed readiness to adjust policy if inflation doesn\u2019t diminish as expected.\nBefore the RBA\u2019s policy decision in February, November\u2019s CPI data, slated for January release, remains a focal point. Meanwhile, the US Dollar remains steady before the FOMC meeting outcomes; the Fed recently lowered interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.50%-3.75%.\nThe US Dollar\u2019s future influence will hinge on the Fed Chair\u2019s new appointment, expected around January. Donald Trump stated this announcement is imminent. The Federal Reserve is tasked with ensuring price stability and full employment by adjusting interest rates.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) evaluates economic conditions and monetary policies at eight annual meetings. During economic downturns, the Fed might employ Quantitative Easing (QE), which generally weakens the US Dollar. Quantitative Tightening (QT) typically bolsters the Dollar.\nStrategic Approaches\nWe are seeing a clear policy split between the RBA and the Fed, which creates a strong case for a higher AUD/USD in the coming weeks. The Fed has already cut rates three times in 2025 as the US economy slows, which was reflected in the recent November Non-Farm Payrolls report that showed a gain of only 95,000 jobs. This growing divergence supports derivative strategies that profit from a rising Australian dollar against the US dollar.\nOur focus in January will be squarely on Australia\u2019s November CPI data. Last month\u2019s October reading showed inflation at 4.1% year-over-year, which remains stubbornly above the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target band and justifies its hawkish stance. We believe buying AUD call options with February 2026 expirations is a prudent way to position for a potential surprise to the upside in inflation, which would strengthen the case for an RBA rate hike.\nWhile the Fed has signaled a slower pace of just one rate cut for 2026, the FOMC minutes released later today could reveal internal debate on that path. More importantly, the announcement of a new Fed Chair in January introduces significant uncertainty, with speculation on candidates ranging from known hawks to doves. This anticipated event risk suggests volatility in the USD could be underpriced, making long volatility strategies attractive.\nWe remember the persistent inflation battle of 2022 and 2023, which makes central banks cautious about easing policy too quickly. A surprise drop in Australian inflation or a more hawkish-than-expected Fed Chair appointment are the primary risks to this long AUD view. Therefore, using defined-risk strategies like call spreads on the AUD/USD, rather than outright long positions, can help manage potential downside."

It was trading at 0.6700, much higher than the year-to-date low of 0.5914.\nTop Regulated Brokers\nRBA and Fed Divergence\nThe AUD/USD pair has been in a bull run since November this year as the US dollar index retreated and the hopes of a divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rose.\nThese hopes escalated after the Federal Reserve delivered its last interest rate decision of the year. It slashed rates by 0.25%, bringing the official cash rate to between 3.50% and 3.75%. Officials hinted that the bank will cut interest rates by 0.25% in the coming year.\nOn the other hand, the RBA left interest rates unchanged at 3.6%, where they have been at in the past few months. Officials warned that they were not in a hurry to cut interest rates as inflation remained at an elevated level.\nA recent report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed that the headline and core inflation remained at an elevated level in November. As a result, some analysts believe that the bank will hike interest rates in 2026.\nLooking ahead, the pair will likely remain in a tight range on Wednesday as many investors remain in holiday mode. There will also be no macro data from Australia and the United States. The only data to watch will be the US mortgage rates and jobless claims numbers.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the AUD/USD exchange rate has been in a strong uptrend in the past few weeks. It has jumped from a low of 0.6420 to the current 0.6700.\nThe pair has remained above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It has moved above the key support level at 0.6617, its highest swing on October 30.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have continued rising. It has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a popular reversal sign.\nTherefore, the pair will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at 0.6800. A drop below the key support level at 0.6600 will invalidate the bullish outlook.\nReady to trade our daily Forex signals?

                "body": "AUD/USD Price Forecast: Sees fresh upside above 0.6730\n- AUD/USD drops to near 0.6680 as the US Dollar Index posts a fresh weekly high.\n- The FOMC minutes showed that policymakers support more interest rate hikes.\n- The RBA could tighten monetary conditions if inflation proves to be sticky.\nThe AUD/USD pair trades slightly lower to near 0.6680 during the European trading session on Wednesday. The Aussie pair faces mild pressure as the US Dollar (USD) rises, even as Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes of the December policy meeting showed that officials favor further interest rate cuts.\nDuring the day, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, posts a fresh weekly high near 98.35.\nOn Tuesday, FOMC minutes showed that policymakers supported further monetary easing to ease the burden on the job market, even after reducing interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75%.\nMost participants noted moving toward a more neutral policy stance would help forestall possible job market deterioration,\u201d FOMC minutes showed.\nMeanwhile, the Australian Dollar (AUD) trades lower with 2025 drawing close. In 2026, the major focus area for the antipodean will be the inflation data. In the monetary policy meeting earlier this month, the RBA stated that it could raise interest rates if inflation proves to be persistent.\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nAUD/USD trades mildly lower near 0.6685. Spot holds above a rising 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6651, which supports the advance. The 20-day EMA has been trending higher in recent sessions.\nThe 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 61 (positive) confirms bullish momentum without overbought conditions.\nBias stays upward while the pair sustains closes above the rising average, and dips would be viewed as corrective within the advance.

                "body": "USD/JPY approaches 156.70 high amid broad-based Dollar strength\n|- USD/JPY appreciates for the second consecutive day and nears weekly highs at 156.70.\n- The US Dollar appreciates across the board following the release of the FOMC Minutes.\n- The Yen loses ground as investors assess the real chances of a near-term BoJ rate hike.\nThe US Dollar appreciates against the Japanese Yen for the second consecutive day on Wednesday, reaching levels right below one-week highs at 156.70 during the European trading session. The wide divergence shown by the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting on Tuesday has provided some support to the Dollar in a thin pre-holiday trading session.\nFed policymakers agreed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at their December 9-10 meeting, although three committee members called for keeping moneary policy unchanged, the highest level of dissenters since 2019.\nThe minutes of the meeting also revealed that the Federal Open Market Committee leaned towards lowering borrowing costs, prioritising support for a deteriorating labour market despite the ongoing concerns about high inflationary pressures.\nFed inflation concerns remain alive\nLooking forward, a majority of the committee members condition further monetary easing to a steady unwind of inflationary pressures. The bank projects one further rate cut in 2026, although markets remain confident that they will be forced to lower interest rates at least twice in the next 12 months.\nIn Japan, the BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions, released earlier this week, reaffirmed the bank's commitment to higher interest rates, although they were vague about the timing of the next rate hike. The Yen ticked up following the release but has been losing ground gradually as investors weigh the likelihood of a further rate cut in the coming months.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "USD/CAD and USD/MXN 2026 Fundamental Outlook: Can the Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso Maintain Their Strength?\nAs 2026 begins, the currencies of the United States, Mexico, and Canada continue to be essential pillars of financial stability and sustained trade flows within the North American economic bloc. Heading into the first quarter of 2026, the USD/CAD and USD/MXN pairs face a landscape shaped by changes in interest rates, potential adjustments in trade relations, and ongoing uncertainty surrounding economic growth. Within this context, it is important to highlight that both the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso remained notably strong through most of 2025\u2014an outlook that could persist if the structural weakness of the U.S. dollar continues into early 2026.\nWhat Can Be Expected from Central Banks Now?\nAs of this writing, North American central banks are beginning to show clear divergence in their monetary policy paths: some maintain expectations of additional rate cuts, while others have shifted to a more neutral stance. The Bank of Mexico stands out, having lowered its benchmark rate from 10.00% to 7.25% since January 2025\u2014making it the only central bank in the region implementing a sustained easing cycle and the most accommodative monetary authority in North America over the past year.\nThe Bank of Canada, meanwhile, has followed a different path, alternating between rate cuts and periods of neutrality. Since January 2025, its policy rate has decreased from 3.00% to the current 2.25% (its latest decision of 2025), returning to a state of consistent neutrality, in line with the direction adopted through most of the year. This reflects a more modest rate-cut cycle, contrasting with the more flexible monetary paths observed in other regional economies.\nThe Federal Reserve, surprised markets with its September decision. Throughout most of 2025, it maintained a neutral rate posture at 4.5%, becoming the only central bank in the region that had not adjusted policy since the December 2024 cut. However, market expectations shifted toward a steady cutting cycle, and the policy rate ultimately fell to 3.75%.\nNorth American Interest Rates Table \u2013 2025\nColors: Green to red; green indicates higher rates and red indicates lower rates.\nSource: Data - Tradingeconomics\nNorth American Interest Rates Chart \u2013 2025\nSource: Tradingeconomics\nWith these shifts in mind, the key question is what monetary path North American central banks will take in 2026, as this will likely be decisive for the long-term behavior of their currencies:\n- On December 10, the Bank of Canada held its rate at 2.25%, highlighting Canada\u2019s economic resilience in 2025 after a 2.6% Q3 GDP reading. Stronger activity may increase inflationary pressures, leading the bank to maintain a neutral stance into year-end.\n- On November 6, the Bank of Mexico lowered its rate to 7.25%, noting that\u2014even after the cut\u2014it remains high relative to other central banks. The decision was influenced by global uncertainty stemming from trade tensions. However, the bank warned that an uptick in inflation may require a policy reassessment in 2026.\n- On December 10, the Federal Reserve reduced its rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, marking its third cut of 2025. The move was driven by labor-market weakness and subdued inflation, keeping the door open for further easing if employment conditions deteriorate.\nThus, inflation data behavior could be critical in shaping upcoming policy decisions. In Canada, inflation rose to 2.2% in October, up from 1.7% in July, slightly above the 2% target. In Mexico, inflation reached 3.8% in November, above both the 3.51% recorded in October and the 3% target.\nIn the United States, inflation data has been distorted by the recent government shutdown. The latest figure shows a 3% reading in September, higher than the 2.3% in April 2025 and still far from the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nNorth America Inflation Chart \u2013 2025\nSource: Tradingeconomics\nInflation\u2019s upward trajectory "

                "body": "USD/CAD remains range-bound around the 1.3700 handle during the Asian session on Wednesday, as markets head into the final trading day of 2025 under thin liquidity conditions. With many participants already stepping aside for the year-end holidays, price action across major currency pairs has turned subdued, encouraging consolidation rather than directional moves.\nThe US Dollar is showing mild strength, with the US Dollar Index (DXY) edging up toward 98.26, its highest level in about a week. The Greenback\u2019s recent bid comes despite the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from the December policy meeting, which broadly reinforced expectations for further easing down the road. According to the minutes, most Fed officials agreed that additional interest rate cuts would likely be appropriate if inflation continues to decline as projected.\nRecent inflation data appear to support that view. The latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed headline inflation slowing to 2.7% year-on-year in November, down from 3.0% in September. While inflation remains above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, the downtrend has strengthened confidence that price pressures are gradually easing. At the same time, markets have interpreted the Fed\u2019s cautious tone as signaling a measured, data-dependent easing path rather than aggressive near-term cuts, which has helped the Dollar stabilize.\nOn the Canadian side, the Loonie is trading calmly, with limited reaction to developments south of the border. The Canadian Dollar continues to draw support from expectations that the Bank of Canada (BoC) will keep interest rates unchanged for the foreseeable future. Canadian inflation has remained relatively stable around the BoC\u2019s 2% target in recent months, reducing the urgency for further monetary easing.\nThis policy outlook has helped anchor USD/CAD, offsetting some of the US Dollar\u2019s recent strength. In the absence of major domestic data releases or shifts in oil prices, the pair has little incentive to break out of its current range. Moreover, the thin year-end trading environment is discouraging large speculative positions, reinforcing sideways movement.\nLooking ahead, USD/CAD direction will likely depend on how markets reassess relative monetary policy paths once liquidity improves in early January. Until then, the pair is expected to remain confined, with traders focusing more on positioning and balance-sheet adjustments than on fresh macroeconomic drivers.\nTrade Idea:\nTrade USD/CAD in a range: buy near 1.3650 and sell near 1.3750, with tight stops, as thin liquidity and balanced Fed\u2013BoC expectations favor consolidation."

The Loonie pair gains as the US Dollar rises despite most Federal Reserve (Fed) officials stressing the need to loosen monetary conditions further to support deteriorating job market conditions.\nMost participants noted moving toward a more neutral policy stance would help forestall possible job market deterioration,\u201d FOMC minutes showed.\nIn 2025, the Fed has already reduced interest rates by 75 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75% and guided that there will be only one interest rate cut in 2026. On the contrary, the CME FedWatch tool shows that there will be at least 50 basis points (bps) reduction in interest rates by the end of 2026.\nMeanwhile, the Canadian Dollar (CAD) trades marginally lower ahead of the New Year eve, with investors remaining uncertain about when the Bank of Canada (BoC) will make any monetary policy adjustment in early 2026.\nUSD/CAD technical analysis\nIn the daily chart, USD/CAD trades at 1.3707. The 20-day EMA slopes lower at 1.3772 and caps rebounds, keeping the pair under pressure. Price holds below the average, preserving a bearish tone. RSI at 33.85 remains below the midline, signaling weak momentum after a rebound from oversold.\nDownside momentum has moderated as the oscillator lifts, but buyers lack control while the RSI stays sub-50. As long as the pair trades beneath the 20-day EMA, rallies could fade, and the risk would turn to a fresh leg lower. A daily close above the average could temper selling pressure and allow a corrective bounce.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process whereby the Federal Reserve st"

The currency cross showed limited movement amid holiday-thinned trading, while the Japanese yen (JPY) weakened as traders assessed the impact of the country\u2019s expansive fiscal policy.\nThe Japanese cabinet recently approved Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s record \u00a5122.3 trillion budget, aiming to strike a balance between aggressive fiscal spending and debt management by limiting new bond issuance. However, Japan\u2019s fiscal position remains a concern: public debt already exceeds twice the size of the economy, leaving the government with little room to deploy bold stimulus measures.\nThe JPY\u2019s decline was partly cushioned by expectations of a Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike at the July meeting, after the bank raised its policy rate to a 30-year high of 0.75%. Further support came from signals of possible intervention, as Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama stressed Japan\u2019s freedom to act against excessive currency moves.\nThe GBP/JPY cross may further gain ground as the Pound Sterling (GBP) receives support from the cautious tone surrounding the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) policy outlook. Governor Andrew Bailey said during the December post-meeting press conference that rates are likely to continue on a gradual downward path, but \"how much further we go becomes a closer call\" with each cut.\nReuters reported that money markets expect the BoE to deliver at least one rate reduction in the first half of the year and are pricing in nearly a 50% probability of a second cut before the end of the year.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies.

                "body": "GBP/JPY steadied near 210.70 during European hours on Wednesday after two days of losses, trading quietly due to holiday-thinned activity. The Japanese yen weakened as the impact of Japan\u2019s expansive fiscal policy was considered, following the approval of a \u00a5122.3 trillion budget that attempts to balance spending and debt management.\nJapan\u2019s fiscal concerns persist, with public debt exceeding twice its economic size, limiting bold stimulus options. The yen\u2019s decline was offset by expectations of a possible Bank of Japan rate hike, which had reached a 30-year high of 0.75%, alongside potential intervention signals from Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama.\nBank Of England Outlook\nGBP/JPY might advance further as the Pound gains support amid cautious Bank of England policy outlook, with Governor Andrew Bailey indicating a potential gradual rate reduction. Money markets predict at least one rate cut by the BoE in the year\u2019s first half, with a nearly 50% chance of a second before year-end.\nThe Japanese yen\u2019s value is influenced by Japan\u2019s economic performance, BoJ policies, bond yield differentials, and risk sentiment. BoJ\u2019s currency interventions, monetary policy shifts, and risk sentiment shifts affect the yen\u2019s strength as a safe-haven asset.\nWe see the GBP/JPY pair holding firm near the 211.00 level, largely because Japan\u2019s new expansive budget is putting pressure on the Yen. Japan\u2019s national debt, which we have seen climb above 260% of its GDP in recent official data, limits the government\u2019s ability to stimulate the economy without further weakening its currency. This fiscal strain suggests a path of least resistance for the Yen is downwards in the near term.\nWhile the Bank of Japan made a significant move by raising its policy rate to 0.75% earlier this year in July, their hands seem tied by the fiscal situation. In contrast, the Bank of England is signaling a very slow and cautious path for any further rate cuts, having only brought its main rate down to 4.5% over the past year. This growing policy divergence continues to favor the Pound over the Yen.\nInvestment Strategies\nGiven this environment, we should consider strategies that benefit from a continued, gradual rise in GBP/JPY into the first quarter of 2026. Bull call spreads could be an effective way to express a bullish view while managing costs and defining risk. This approach allows us to profit from a move higher, without being overly exposed to a sharp reversal caused by potential Bank of Japan intervention.\nWe must remain vigilant about warnings of currency intervention from Japanese officials, as these could trigger sharp, unpredictable drops in the pair. Any unexpected global risk event could also swiftly reverse the trend, as the Yen has historically strengthened during times of market stress. This lingering threat of volatility means we should be cautious about selling uncovered puts and prioritize strategies with limited downside."

Trading activity was subdued due to holiday conditions, while the Japanese yen (JPY) softened as investors evaluated the effects of Japan\u2019s expansive fiscal measures.\nJapan\u2019s cabinet has given the green light to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s unprecedented \u00a5122.3 trillion budget, which seeks to balance robust government spending with fiscal responsibility by restricting the issuance of new bonds. Despite these efforts, Japan\u2019s fiscal health remains under scrutiny, as the nation\u2019s public debt has already surpassed double the size of its economy, limiting the government\u2019s ability to introduce significant stimulus initiatives.\nThe yen\u2019s recent weakness has been partially offset by speculation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may raise interest rates at its July meeting, following a recent hike to a three-decade high of 0.75%. Additional support for the currency came after Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama emphasized Japan\u2019s willingness to intervene if currency movements become excessive.\nThe GBP/JPY pair could see further advances as the British Pound (GBP) benefits from the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) cautious approach to monetary policy. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey indicated in December that while interest rates are expected to gradually decline, the extent of future reductions remains uncertain with each subsequent cut.\nAccording to Reuters, market participants anticipate that the BoE will implement at least one rate cut in the first half of the year, with nearly a 50% chance of a second reduction before year-end."

With major catalysts exhausted and macroeconomic pressures mounting, the crypto market could face another challenging year ahead.\nSean Williams of Motley Fool warned that the crypto winter could return in 2026, following the pattern of significant downturns every four years seen in 2018 and 2022.\nSponsoredWinter Could Drag XRP Down to $1\nHe pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s halving event, Trump\u2019s election, and the passage of the Genius Act are all \u201cin the rearview mirror,\u201d leaving investors with nothing tangible to hold onto.\n\u201cBitcoin is already more than 30% below its 52-week high,\u201d Williams noted. \u201cThe prevailing issue for cryptocurrencies is that there aren\u2019t any major catalysts for the new year.\u201d\nWilliams also predicted that the Bitcoin treasury strategy trend, pioneered by Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), will \u201cturn into one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest duds in 2026.\u201d Most companies following Strategy\u2019s playbook are \u201cunproven and losing money,\u201d with limited purchasing power to sustain Bitcoin demand.\n\u201cAdditionally, companies embracing the Bitcoin treasury strategy have consistently traded at significant multiples to the net asset value of their digital assets,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201cPaying a double-digit or triple-digit percentage premium to NAV makes absolutely no sense when spot Bitcoin ETFs have made it easier than ever to invest.\u201d\nOn XRP, Williams made a particularly bearish call, predicting a plunge back to $1. He argued that the favorable catalysts\u2014Trump\u2019s election, the Ripple-SEC litigation resolution, and spot ETF approvals\u2014have already been priced in. He also noted that only about 300 financial institutions use XRP, compared to over 11,000 using SWIFT for cross-border payments.\nOne silver lining Williams acknowledged: a potential \u201cdeluge of spot crypto ETF approvals\u201d in 2026. With 125 cryptocurrency ETFs awaiting regulatory approval as of mid-December, he expects approvals for Avalanche, Cardano, Polkadot, and others, which could help some altcoins outperform Bitcoin.\nSponsored2025 Recap: Macro Pressures Drive First Annual Loss\nBitcoin\u2019s struggles in 2025 underscore the uncertainty heading into the new year. The cryptocurrency fell more than 6% for the year, ending at $87,474\u2014its first annual loss since 2022.\nThe year began strong, with Bitcoin soaring on Trump\u2019s election victory and reaching an all-time high above $126,000 in early October. But on October 10, the market plunged when Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports and threatened export controls on critical software, triggering more than $19 billion in liquidations\u2014the largest in crypto history.\nAnalysts say Bitcoin\u2019s gyrations in 2025 increasingly tracked stock market sentiment as traditional retail and institutional investors jumped into cryptocurrencies. This correlation may strengthen further in 2026, with crypto more closely tethered to factors driving stocks and other risk assets, such as monetary policy shifts and concerns over lofty valuations of AI-related stocks.\nOn the regulatory front, the crypto industry secured major wins under the Trump administration, including the SEC\u2019s dismissal of Biden-era lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, as well as the passage of the Genius Act establishing federal rules for stablecoins. However, market structure legislation and SEC rule carve-outs that would address core industry problems remain pending, threatening to dampen the industry\u2019s celebratory mood.\nBulls See a Different Picture\nNot everyone agrees with the bearish outlook. Some analysts argue that 2026 will deliver the bull run and alt season that failed to materialize in 2025, pointing to a crypto-friendly White House, continued institutional adoption, stablecoin growth, and potential rate cuts as key catalysts. Analysts predict blockchain technology will be deployed in more places throughout 2026.\nFor bullish perspectives on 2026, se"

On-chain trackers confirmed these moves suggested long-term holding behavior rather than short-term speculation.\nWith Ethereum consolidating, capital rotation appeared selective. DeFi tokens across Ethereum and Solana attracted renewed attention.\nSo why were whales reducing ETH exposure and reallocating into specific DeFi names instead?\nWhale Accumulation in DeFi altcoins\nOn-chain data showed sustained withdrawals of DeFi tokens from major exchanges over recent days. These transfers reduced the available exchange supply of these altcoins.\nThree large wallets alone withdrew nearly $15.9 million worth of DeFi tokens. Assets included the Pump.fun [PUMP], Cloud [CLOUD], Kamino [KMNO], Jito [JTO], and Drift Protocol [DRIFT].\nMost of these tokens belonged to Solana-based DeFi protocols. The consistent withdrawal pattern pointed toward strategic accumulation.\nSuch behavior is historically aligned with expectations of future price appreciation rather than immediate liquidity needs.\nArthur Hayes\u2019 altcoin rotation\nArthur Hayes publicly stated his intention to rotate out of Ethereum [ETH] and into high-quality DeFi assets. His on-chain activity aligned closely with that thesis.\nOver two weeks, Hayes sold 1,871 ETH worth approximately $5.53 million. He redirected capital into Pendle, Lido, Ethena, and EtherFi.\nHis largest allocation went into Pendle [PENDLE], followed by Lido Dao [LDO] and Ethena [ENA]. These protocols represented yield, staking, and synthetic asset exposure. Hayes\u2019 actions reinforced the idea that DeFi beta may outperform as liquidity conditions gradually improve.\nCross-chain altcoin positioning\nBeyond Ethereum, whales also increased exposure to Solana-based DeFi ecosystems. The capital flow suggested broader cross-chain conviction. Tokens such as JTO and DRIFT benefited from ecosystem-specific growth narratives. Reduced exchange balances further supported accumulation signals.\nImportantly, these positions were spread across protocols rather than concentrated in a single asset. That diversification reduced directional risk.\nThis pattern suggested calculated positioning ahead of broader market expansion rather than speculative chasing.\nAre DeFi altcoins first movers in the next bull run?\nHistorically, DeFi tokens reacted early to shifts in liquidity and risk appetite. Whales appeared to be acting on similar assumptions. ETH remained foundational, but upside asymmetry seemed greater in select DeFi names. Yield-driven narratives also strengthened this thesis.\nHowever, market conditions remained uncertain. Macro liquidity and Bitcoin dominance still influenced broader altcoin performance.\nWhether DeFi led the next rally depended on sustained capital inflows and improving market confidence.\nFinal Thoughts\n- Whale rotations suggested selective positioning rather than broad risk-on behavior across the altcoin market.\n- DeFi altcoins could lead early if liquidity improved, but sustained on-chain demand remained the key confirmation signal."

                "body": "As the year comes to a close, the Solana (SOL) ecosystem has recapped the key milestones reached in 2025. Meanwhile, SOL price is staging a late recovery, gaining nearly 3% in the last 24 hours.\n2025: A Terrific Year For Solana\nSolana\u2019s official X account has described \u201c2025 as a banger\u201d in a year that saw the network attract major institutional interest. The team shared a three-minute video on X, chronicling the high points of 2025, including key partnerships with global financial service providers and network upgrades.\nRight off the bat, the video highlighted Western Union\u2019s partnership with Solana to launch a stablecoin for global payments. Amid the flurry of institutional partnerships, the team underscored CME Group\u2019s decision to launch spot-quoted SOL futures.\nBack in May, enterprise blockchain firm R3 announced a collaboration with the Solana Foundation to link its permissioned Corda platform with the permissionless Solana blockchain. In one market-moving announcement, BlackRock confirmed the expansion of its tokenized money market fund BUIDL to Solana, a watershed moment for the fledgling blockchain.\nContinuing the streak of institutional interest, JPMorgan arranged for US commercial paper issuance on Solana to wrap up a stellar year for the network. All year long, an avalanche of corporate treasuries jostled to scoop sizable amounts of SOL with DeFi Development Corp and Upexi leading the way.\nOn the regulatory front, the Solana Policy Institute notched impressive milestones throughout 2025. The year marked the expansion of the Solana Economic Zone to Kazakhstan, the first in Central Asia, with the team seeking out new frontiers.\nIn line with the expansionist policy, the team hosted several Solana Apex events in 2025 to onboard new users. A wildly successful Accelerate event and the launch of Solana Spaces on Wall Street added steam to its aggressive expansionist goals.\nSOL Price Last-Minute Gasp\nAmid the recap, SOL price has indicated flashes of brilliance over the last day. CoinMarketCap data indicates that SOL is trading at $126.17, up nearly 3% from an intra-day low of $123.\nSOL ETF inflows on December 30 spiked to $5.2 million after a lengthy decline. While it pales in comparison to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the surge suggests that institutional investors are rotating into undervalued altcoins.\nLast week, an analyst described SOL as oversold, hinting at a near-term rally for the asset. Despite the uptick in SOL price, the asset has fallen by 57.13% from its all-time high of $294 that it set in early 2025."

                "body": "As the crypto ecosystem shifts into a new cycle, Solana stands out with a forward-looking playbook for 2026 \u2013 one that bridges technical upgrades, institutional interest, and real-world adoption narratives. The latest predictions, drawn from ecosystem insiders and market observers, suggest Solana is transitioning from experimental L1 to a high-performance base layer with diversified utility.\n1.) Stablecoins Set to Soar on Solana\nOne of the strongest narrative threads for 2026 is stablecoin expansion on Solana. Traditional finance players like Western Union are preparing to launch stablecoin products on the chain, underscoring how Solana\u2019s throughput and cost structure are attracting non-crypto incumbents. Solana co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, even forecasted the stablecoin ecosystem could be worth $1 trillion by 2026 \u2013 a bullish outlook for payment rails and liquidity layers across DeFi.\nTakeaway: Stablecoins acting as a payment and settlement medium may solidify Solana\u2019s status as a go-to chain for high-velocity transactions.\nPRESS RELEASE | Western Union Announces USDPT Stablecoin on Solana and Digital Asset Network\n2.) Internet Capital Markets Could Reshape Value Transfer\nSolana\u2019s Firedancer upgrade \u2013 set to deliver over 1 million transactions per second (TPS) and sub-150 ms finality \u2013 is expected to be a transformative milestone. By dramatically enhancing throughput and latency, Solana aims to support complex use cases beyond simple transfers, including high-frequency trading, tokenized securities platforms, and decentralized clearing systems.\nTakeaway: As throughput becomes less of a constraint, developers and institutions may build applications that were previously impractical on other blockchains.\n3.) Institutional Momentum Doesn\u2019t Stop\nInstitutional interest \u2013 from digital asset treasuries to potential Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) \u2013 is set to expand in the near future. With regulatory clarity improving in jurisdictions like the United States (e.g., the CLARITY Act movement), Solana could benefit from broader ETF approvals and deeper institutional liquidity. Such inflows may help SOL capture revenue growth that rivals larger ecosystems.\nTakeaway: As regulated capital enters Solana, the chain\u2019s legitimacy and market depth could strengthen \u2013 especially in the mid-cap to enterprise stack.\nBITCOIN | Institutions Now Hold ~12% of the Total Bitcoin Supply \u2013 a 5% Increase in Just One Year\n4.) Prediction Markets Drive User Growth\nPrediction markets \u2013 decentralized platforms where users can trade on outcomes \u2013 are fast emerging as a use case where Solana holds a competitive edge. Already dominant in network revenue rankings in 2025, Solana\u2019s ecosystem is poised to attract users seeking novel financial primitives and efficient execution structures.\nTakeaway: Alternative DeFi verticals like prediction markets may contribute to sustained user engagement and network fee generation.\nMARKET ANALYSIS | Why Solana\u2019s \u2018Crypto Casino\u2019 Shifted from Memecoins to Prediction Markets\n5.) Real-World Assets Take Center Stage\nTokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) \u2013 from treasuries to equities \u2013 is gaining traction on Solana, with firms like Gemini and Fidelity driving this trend. If Solana becomes a hub for RWAs, it could meaningfully expand the total addressable market (TAM) of assets represented on-chain, integrating traditional finance flows with digital rails.\nTakeaway: RWAs could be a strategic advantage for Solana, positioning it as a bridge between institutional finance and programmable money.\nWhat This Means for Solana Stakeholders\nWhile these predictions are not financial advice, they highlight the multi-faceted growth narrative for Solana in 2026 \u2013 one built on scalability, institutional alignment, and diversified use cases. The emphasis on throughput and real-world adoption suggests that Solana may be moving beyond the meme-coin-era reputation, laying foundation for sustained fundamental growth.\nFor developers, investors, and users, "

                "body": "In the current crypto market with ongoing volatility and rapid iteration of DeFi protocols, many lending and liquidity mechanisms still struggle to effectively handle extreme changes brought by market sentiment. This often leaves users facing liquidity issues or cost fluctuations during sharp market swings. PulseFi\u2019s PLS token, launched on the Solana chain, aims to provide users with a more adaptive participation method by integrating market sentiment indicators into the protocol\u2019s core. This article will introduce the PLS token from aspects such as project mechanics, economic design, team strength, and future plans, helping you understand the unique value of this emerging DeFi project.\nPulseFi PLS Token\u2019s Core Mechanism\nPulseFi\u2019s core lies in its independently developed Pulse Engine sentiment indicator engine. This system collects real-time data from multiple sources, including on-chain leverage ratios, liquidation volumes, and social media sentiment intensity. After cross-validation and dynamic weighting, it generates a Pulse Score (ranging from -100 to +100). This score directly drives dynamic adjustments in the protocol: during high market heat, lending rates moderately increase to control risks; in downturns, rates decrease and protective liquidity is released, providing users with counter-cyclical buffers.\nThe project is based on the Solana public chain, leveraging its high processing speed and low fee advantages to support second-level sentiment responses. Smart contracts use modular design in Rust language, including components for sentiment parameter calculation, lending pools, liquidity allocators, and protection pools. It plans to complete multiple rounds of top-tier security audits, with built-in multi-signature, emergency pause, and multi-source data validation mechanisms to ensure stability and security in high-load environments.\nPLS Token\u2019s Economic Model and Incentive Design\nPLS is issued through a fair launch on the Solana chain, combined with liquidity bootstrapping and community airdrops to ensure wide token distribution. The economic model emphasizes deflation and long-term incentives: a small fee is charged for protocol interactions, with part used for buyback and burn of PLS; additional burns are triggered during extreme sentiment; the vePLS locking mode encourages long-term holding, where longer locks grant higher voting rights and dividend shares, thereby gradually reducing circulating supply and enhancing scarcity.\nProtocol revenue mainly comes from lending fees, liquidity adjustment fees, and sentiment data API subscriptions, allocated as 50% for buyback and burn, 30% dividends to vePLS holders, 15% injected into the protection fund, and 5% into the DAO treasury. This design forms a positive cycle of user participation \u2192 value enhancement \u2192 ecosystem growth, with token appeal continuing to strengthen as TVL increases.\nPulseFi Team Strength\nThe PulseFi team consists of experienced DeFi experts. Founder and CEO Johnathan Reed has over a decade of experience in blockchain and fintech development, having led multiple DeFi projects to achieve significant TVL growth, with deep involvement in the Solana ecosystem. His insights in protocol design, economic modeling, and community governance are the core drivers of the project\u2019s strategy and execution.\nCo-founder and CTO Elena Vargas is a senior Solana developer, proficient in Rust and the Anchor framework, having handled core contract optimizations and security audits. She leads the complete technical architecture of the Pulse Engine, ensuring the real-time nature and anti-manipulation capabilities of sentiment signals. Product Director Marcus Hale and Chief Operating Officer Sophia Kline have accumulated rich practical experience in user experience design and community growth, respectively, with strong team complementarity providing solid support for project implementation.\nPLS Token\u2019s Ecosystem Participation and Future Plans\nThe PulseFi ecosystem centers on"

Both stock and bond markets will be closed tomorrow for New Year's Day but will operate normally on Friday.\nDespite tailing off following a five-session winning streak through Christmas Eve, the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow closed the year up roughly 20%, 16%, and 13%, respectively. The Dow finished higher for an eighth straight month and the Nasdaq ended up for the eighth time in nine months, but the S&P 500 narrowly had a seven-month winning streak snapped.\nThe indexes' gains in 2025 were powered by strong advances from several AI-tied firms, including Micron Technology (MU), up 239% this year; Palantir (PLTR), up 135%; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), up 77%; Alphabet (GOOGL), up 65%; and Nvidia (NVDA), the world's most valuable public company, up 39%.\nMicron was one of the worst-performing stocks in the Nasdaq on Wednesday, with shares down 2.5%. Nike (NKE) paced the S&P 500 and Dow with a 4.1% advance after it disclosed in a regulatory filing that CEO Elliott Hill bought roughly $1 million worth of shares on Monday.\nTraders digested the weekly jobless claims report Wednesday morning, which indicated 199,000 people filed for unemployment insurance last week, fewer than the 222,000 expected. The reading provided a fresh data point as the Fed keeps a close eye on jobs as it considers its next move on interest rates.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on a variety of commercial and consumer loans, rose to 4.17% from about 4.13% at Tuesday's close. Bond markets closed at 2 p.m. ET for New Year's Eve.\nSilver futures sank more than 9% to $70.40 an ounce and gold futures declined 1.3% to $4,330 an ounce at 4 p.m. ET after the CME Group hiked margin requirements for precious metals for a second time in less than a week amid volatile trading.\nBitcoin was trading around the day's low at $87,200. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, was little changed at 98.25.\nWest Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were down nearly 1% to $57.45 per barrel.\nThe Outlook for 2026\nInvestopedia has produced a series of articles on the outlook for financial markets and the economy.

Only one of them finished the year with eight straight months of gains.\nThe blue-chip Dow closed 0.7% in the green for December, its eighth consecutive winning month, but the S&P 500 had its seven-month winning streak snapped by less than 0.1%.\nThe Nasdaq concluded the month 0.5% higher for its eighth winning month in the final nine of the year.

The performance marked three straight years of double-digit gains.\nThe S&P 500 finished the year up 16%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 19%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out 2025 up 13%. A dip in each of the indexes on Wednesday left markets lower in the year\u2019s final trading session.\nThe major indexes each notched a record high in 2025, hurtling past tariffs, a government shutdown and fears of a bubble in artificial intelligence.\nAnalysts attributed the rise of share prices this year to overlapping trends: Resilient corporate earnings, a series of interest-rate cuts meant to boost hiring and near-inexhaustible enthusiasm for AI.\nChip giant Nvidia, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization, ended the year up 39%.\nTariffs, which threatened to derail markets in the spring, eased into an afterthought over the latter half of the year.\nA day after tariffs were announced on April 2, major stock indexes shed about $3.1 trillion in value. The selloff amounted to the biggest one-day decline in markets since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Days later, a major swathe of the tariffs were suspended, sending the market to one of its largest ever single-day increases.\n\"While tariffs remain a source of uncertainty, markets are pricing in limited disruption,\" JPMorgan Wealth Management said in an investor note last month.\nEven as markets proved resilient, the gains this year remained concentrated in a handful of tech giants, known as the magnificent seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia. In September, worries over AI threw cold water on those stocks, causing their prices to waver.\nIn November, blockbuster earnings from Nvidia helped rebuke AI fears and shake markets out of the doldrums. Still, some analysts have continued to voice concern about the market's dependence on AI, as tech firms face increased pressure to turn massive capital investment into profits."

This broad-market gauge, representing 500 leading U.S. companies, benefited immensely from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI) and resilient corporate earnings, despite early volatility tied to trade policy uncertainties.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.76% to 23,241.99, yet delivered the strongest performance of the trio with a 20.4% annual gain. AI-driven stocks, including storage-chip makers like Micron Technology (which more than tripled in value), propelled the index higher.\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 303.77 points, or 0.63%, finishing at 48,063.29. It advanced 13.0% for the year, lagging its peers due to lesser exposure to high-growth technology sectors.\nA Roller-Coaster Year Dominated by AI and Policy Shifts\n2025 was characterized by sharp swings. An early \"April Meltdown\" triggered by aggressive tariff announcements under President Trump's policies saw the S&P 500 drop nearly 19%. Markets rebounded strongly as some threats were moderated, fueled by Federal Reserve rate cuts and explosive growth in AI infrastructure.\nStandout performers included Alphabet (up 65%) and other \"Magnificent Seven\" components, alongside AI-related firms. Commodities also shone, with precious metals posting historic gains amid geopolitical tensions.\nThe absence of a traditional \"Santa Claus rally\" in the final days reflected profit-taking in thin trading, but the year's overall strength underscored the U.S. economy's resilience.\nAs traders donned \"2026\" glasses on the NYSE floor, optimism persists for the new year, though investors will watch Fed policy, earnings, and global trade closely. Wall Street bids farewell to a turbulent yet rewarding 2025, setting the stage for continued evolution in an AI-dominated landscape.\nComments\nTrending\n-\n1 S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Close the Year Lower but Post Strong Gains in 2025\nPatrick Tan -\n2 Anthony Joshua's Net Worth, Ethnicity, Parents, Boxing Career, and Favourite Football Team\nRayson Choo -\n3 Hugh Jackman's Net Worth, Ethnicity and Meteoric Rise to Fame as X-Men's Wolverine\nRayson Choo -\n4 Analyzing the True Economic Power of Private Giants vs. Publicly Traded Incumbents\nDaniel Hall -\n5 Best Property Search Platforms in the U.S. for 2025\nDaniel Hall"

                "body": "It was a bumper year for stock markets globally and the surprise, perhaps, is that the FTSE 100 index more than kept up. The London market has sometimes been derided as lacking dynamism \u2013 the hedge fund manager Paul Marshall called it the \u201cJurassic Park\u201d of exchanges a few years ago \u2013 but its main index enjoyed its best 12 months since 2009. The Footsie didn\u2019t quite make it to the round number of 10,000 but still improved by 21.5%, slightly outperforming the S&P 500 index in the US.\nHow did that happen amid weakening UK growth, pre-budget chaos and general gloom? The short answer is that a stock market index reflects only its constituent parts. It is not a symbol of national economic virility. That is especially true of the internationally flavoured Footsie, whose members make about three-quarters of their combined revenues overseas.\nThe tale of 2025 was one of helpful breezes blowing through many of the most important sectors. Defence stocks enjoyed commitments by Nato\u2019s western European members to spend more heavily on equipment. That assisted companies such as Rolls-Royce, whose remarkable run has taken the shares from sub-100p in 2022 to \u00a311-plus today. Banks have had near-perfect conditions of low defaults and falling interest rates. The bill (for some) from the car finance scandal was brushed off easily.\nGlobal mining companies, which are still a significant slice of the Footsie, enjoyed the gold-inspired rally in everything related to precious metals plus the demand for copper that comes with energy transition and electrification. The best-performing share in the index was Fresnillo, a Mexico-based silver miner, up almost fivefold. Over in pharmaceuticals, Donald Trump\u2019s bark on tariffs and prices proved worse than his bite. AstraZeneca, the most valuable component of a value-weighted index, rose almost 30%.\nMeanwhile, National Grid and SSE, two heavyweights in UK energy infrastructure, benefited from regulatory funding for the upgrade of the transmission network. Virtually the only \u201cproblem\u201d stock at the top end of the index was Diageo, the Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff drinks maker, which was mired in the related issues of a weak global spirits market and boardroom upheaval.\nSue Noffke, the head of UK equities at the fund manager Schroders, makes the point that the Footsie\u2019s rise should not be viewed purely as a one-year phenomenon. Go back three years and the average investment return including dividends has been 14% a year for a cumulative return of 48%.\nA cheap starting point is obviously one factor. Even as late as spring 2024, the Footsie was priced at just under 10 times its predicted earnings for the next year, extremely low by historical standards.\nNoffke also highlights corporate self-improvement \u2013 \u201ccompanies doing it for themselves\u201d \u2013 and the role of share buybacks. There is a long list of companies that can be seen as getting stricter in their capital allocation in pursuit of better returns, and being prodded by shareholders to do so.\nUnilever demerged its ice-cream division as Magnum in 2025, echoing GSK\u2019s separation of its consumer products division as Haleon in 2022. The industrial heavyweight Smiths Group is breaking itself up. BP, after years of flip-flopping, is \u201cpivoting\u201d away from its low-return renewables investments. Anglo American has engaged in a multiyear restructuring that ended in a well-received $50bn (\u00a337bn) merger with the Canadian rival Teck Resources. AB Foods is contemplating splitting the discount retail chain Primark from its food and ingredients businesses.\nThe buyback angle represents a shift in thinking in London. In the old days, dividends were a priority, which was why a core part of Marshall\u2019s dinosaur thesis was that London\u2019s fund managers are obsessed with income rather than growth. Now buybacks, which offer more bang for the same buck when \u2013 critically \u2013 the shares are cheap, are a greater part of the mix. In any case, the idea that UK investors set the tone is probably out of "

                "body": "American hot money piling into some foreign markets produced gigantic gains in 2025 (Spain +49%).\nBy Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET.\nThe S&P 500 Index soared by 16.4% in 2025. Since the Liberation Day bloodletting bottom on April 8, it soared by 38%. Over the past three years of 2023-2025, it soared by 79%. Since the March 2020 low, the index soared by 208%, despite two sell-offs in between. These are huge gains.\nIn March 2020, the Fed unleashed its mega-massive QE program, to outdo all prior QE programs, and cut short-term interest rates to near zero, and kept doing it even as inflation was beginning to rage in 2021 and heading toward 9% before they finally hiked rates and unwound part of the QE assets they\u2019d purchased.\nAfter the Dotcom bubble, which began to implode in March 2000, the S&P 500 spent 13 years in stock-market hell on a rollercoaster to nowhere with two 50%-crashes in between. But money-printing starting in 2009 fixed that. In May 2013, the S&P 500 surpassed its March 2000 high in a sustained manner. Today, it\u2019s up by 351% from the March 2000 high (index data via YCharts).\nAmerican hot money gushes into overseas markets.\nAs big as the gain was for the S&P 500 Index in 2025, it got beaten by a number of major stock markets around the world as American money gushed into them and pushed some to crypto-like gains.\nCanada\u2019s TSX Composite Index in CAD and USD:\nThe TSX soared by 28.2% in 2025, to 31,713, after having already soared by 18% in 2024.\nSince the April 8 low, it has exploded by 41%! US tariffs may be bad for Canada but good for Canadian stocks? Whatever. More likely, American hot money.\nSince the March 2008 high, it has risen by 111% (all stock-index and currency data below via Investing.com).\nThe TSX is denominated in Canadian dollars, which finally rose against the USD in 2025. So expressed in USD, as investors in the US would see it, the TSX did even better in 2025, soaring by 35.5% for the year, and by 47% since the April 8 low. These were huge gains for US-based investors.\nBut the prior years were tough. Since 2011, the CAD has zigzagged lower from over 1 USD per CAD, to 69 US cents per CAD in early 2025.\nSo the gain of 111% from the March 2008 high shrivels, when expressed in USD, to a gain of just 54%.\nAnd for US-based investors, there were no gains between 2007 and early 2021, just zig-zagging up and down for 14 years.\nThe chart shows the TSX index expressed in USD since 2005 (each day\u2019s TSX value is adjusted by the exchange rate at the time):\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 in YEN and USD:\nThe Nikkei 225 index soared by 26% in 2025, to 50,339, after having already gained 19% in 2024, when it edged past the 1989 Bubble high, and 28% in 2023.\nIn the 36 years since the Bubble peak in December 1989, the Nikkei 225 has risen by 29%. It was a wild ride down to 2012, and a wild ride up to 2025.\nSince January 2012, the Nikkei 225 has soared by 500%, from 8,390 to 50,339, as the Bank of Japan was going hog-wild with QE, that included equity ETFs and ended up putting over half of Japan\u2019s gigantic government debt on the BOJ\u2019s balance sheet, and triggering substantial inflation that it is now trying to contain.\nThe BOJ started shedding its bond holdings in 2024 and announced recently that it would very very very very slowly sell its equity ETF shares, as part of its accelerated QT program.\nBut the yen has plunged against the USD since 2012, when the BOJ set out to knock it down with its policies.\nIt now takes \u00a5157 to buy $1. Back in January 2012, it took \u00a577 to buy $1. In other words, since 2012, the yen has collapsed by 50% against the USD. A substantial portion of that collapse took place in the three years of 2022-2024.\nFor USD-based investors in Japanese stocks, that 500% gain of the Nikkei 225 in yen since January 2012 shriveled to a still substantial gain of 184% in USD.\nThe chart shows the Nikkei 225 index expressed in USD (each Nikkei 225 value is adjusted by the exchange rate at the time):\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Stock Exch"

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.28 per share was 72% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nRevenue: $4.65 billion vs analyst estimates of $4.68 billion (3.7% year-on-year decline, 0.7% miss)\nAdjusted EPS: $0.28 vs analyst estimates of $0.16 (72% beat)\nAdjusted EBITDA: $472 million vs analyst estimates of $439.6 million (10.2% margin, 7.4% beat)\nOperating Margin: 3.2%, down from 5.6% in the same quarter last year\nFree Cash Flow was -$181 million compared to -$351 million in the same quarter last year\nSales Volumes rose 5.2% year on year (-108% in the same quarter last year)\nMarket Capitalization: $2.56 billion\n\"We delivered a meaningful increase in segment operating income relative to the second quarter in an industry environment that continued to be marked by global trade disruption,\" said Mark Stewart, chief executive officer and president.\nCompany Overview\nWith its iconic blimp floating above major sporting events since 1925, Goodyear (NYSE:GT) is one of the world's largest tire manufacturers, producing and selling tires for automobiles, trucks, aircraft, and other vehicles, along with related services.\nRevenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Luckily, Goodyear\u2019s sales grew at a decent 8.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth was slightly above the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Goodyear\u2019s recent performance marks a sharp pivot from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 5.4% over the last two years.\nWe can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of units sold, which reached -0.1 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Goodyear\u2019s units sold averaged 38.9% year-on-year declines. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the company benefited from price increases.\nThis quarter, Goodyear missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 3.7% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $4.65 billion of revenue.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.5% over the next 12 months. While this projection indicates its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\nGoodyear was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 3.5% was weak for an industrials business. This result isn\u2019t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Goodyear\u2019s operating margin decreased by 3.3 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Goodyear\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nThis quarter, Goodyear generated an operating margin profit margin of 3.2%, down 2.4 percentage points year on year. Since Goodyear\u2019s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead increased.\nEarnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nGoodyear\u2019s full-year EPS flip"

                "url": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nasdaq-gdev/gdev/news/earnings-working-against-gdev-incs-nasdaqgdev-share-price-fo/amp",
                "body": "Unfortunately for some shareholders, the GDEV Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEV) share price has dived 39% in the last thirty days, prolonging recent pain. The drop over the last 30 days has capped off a tough year for shareholders, with the share price down 22% in that time.\nSince its price has dipped substantially, GDEV's price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 4.8x might make it look like a strong buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 20x and even P/E's above 34x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/E.\nGDEV certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on GDEV will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\nIs There Any Growth For GDEV?\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, GDEV would need to produce anemic growth that's substantially trailing the market.\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 49% gain to the company's bottom line. Still, incredibly EPS has fallen 45% in total from three years ago, which is quite disappointing. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\nShifting to the future, estimates from the dual analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 4.3% over the next year. With the market predicted to deliver 16% growth , the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.\nWith this information, we can see why GDEV is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.\nThe Bottom Line On GDEV's P/E\nGDEV's P/E looks about as weak as its stock price lately. Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\nAs we suspected, our examination of GDEV's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.\nAnd what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for GDEV you should know about.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if GDEV might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "The Trump administration has officially moved to seize control of the municipal golf courses in Washington, D.C.\nNational Links Trust, the nonprofit that holds a 50-year lease with the National Park Service to rehabilitate three historic public golf courses \u2014 East Potomac Golf Links, Langston Golf Course and Rock Creek Park Golf \u2014 received a formal notice of termination from the Department of the Interior (DOI) on Tuesday, according to a statement from the organization. The termination is effective immediately.\nAdvertisement\nIn the notice, obtained by The Athletic, the DOI cited National Links Trust\u2019s inability to comply with a renovation timeline and provide a plan to cure those violations as the reason for termination. The nonprofit organization said it \u201cfundamentally disagrees\u201d with the characterization in the termination notice, which follows an initial notice of default sent by William L. Doffermyre, a DOI solicitor, on Oct. 29.\n\u201cThe National Links Trust is devastated by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to terminate our 50-year lease with the National Park Service. Since taking over stewardship of Rock Creek, East Potomac, and Langston courses five years ago, NLT has consistently complied with all lease obligations as we work to ensure the brightest possible future for public golf in DC,\u201d the organization wrote.\nNational Links Trust officials say they have made significant short-term improvements to course facilities while complying with red-tape processes to secure renovation approvals. The organization points to language in its lease that states that timelines are \u201csubject to change due to compliance timeframes.\u201d National Links Trust is exploring the possibility of taking legal action.\nIn the notice of termination, the administration writes that National Links Trust has \u201cfailed to provide National Park Services with reasonable assurances that NLT has the necessary funding, ability, or plan to fulfill its capital-investment obligations.\u201d\nThe notice also states that National Links Trust may owe as much as $8.8 million in unpaid rent on the course properties. National Links Trust officials dispute the claim. The nonprofit\u2019s publicly available lease states that rent can be offset by capital improvements to the courses after a certain amount of rent has been paid. The National Park Service has approved those rent offsets, according to National Links Trust officials. The DOI and the National Park Service did not comment on National Links Trust\u2019s rent offsets.\nAdvertisement\nThe DOI said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThe Trump administration prides itself on getting the job done for the American people and partnering with others who share that same goal.\u201d\nNational Links Trust has managed East Potomac Golf Links, Langston Golf Course and Rock Creek Park Golf since it was awarded the lease in 2020. Rock Creek Park Golf closed for renovations on Nov. 17. Founded by golf industry professionals Mike McCartin and Will Smith, the organization seeks to provide affordable, accessible public golf to the city and improve community resources that have long needed attention.\nAccording to National Links Trust\u2019s statement, it has invested $8.5 million in \u201ccapital improvement projects\u201d and more than doubled rounds played and course revenue since being awarded the long-term lease. Work to date has involved fundraising, tree removal and reviving East Potomac\u2019s putting course. Top golf course architects Gil Hanse, Tom Doak and Beau Welling have committed pro bono hours to direct restoration efforts.\nBut the wide-ranging project has now ceased, the Rock Creek Park renovations are suspended, and the future of public golf in the D.C. area is uncertain, with a pathway cleared for the president to take charge.\nRather than walk away from the courses immediately, National Links Trust plans to agree to a transition period with the administration. The organization will continue to operate East Potomac Golf Links and Langston Golf Course, honoring its miss"

                "body": "American hot money piling into some foreign markets produced gigantic gains in 2025 (Spain +49%).\nBy Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET.\nThe S&P 500 Index soared by 16.4% in 2025. Since the Liberation Day bloodletting bottom on April 8, it soared by 38%. Over the past three years of 2023-2025, it soared by 79%. Since the March 2020 low, the index soared by 208%, despite two sell-offs in between. These are huge gains.\nIn March 2020, the Fed unleashed its mega-massive QE program, to outdo all prior QE programs, and cut short-term interest rates to near zero, and kept doing it even as inflation was beginning to rage in 2021 and heading toward 9% before they finally hiked rates and unwound part of the QE assets they\u2019d purchased.\nAfter the Dotcom bubble, which began to implode in March 2000, the S&P 500 spent 13 years in stock-market hell on a rollercoaster to nowhere with two 50%-crashes in between. But money-printing starting in 2009 fixed that. In May 2013, the S&P 500 surpassed its March 2000 high in a sustained manner. Today, it\u2019s up by 351% from the March 2000 high (index data via YCharts).\nAmerican hot money gushes into overseas markets.\nAs big as the gain was for the S&P 500 Index in 2025, it got beaten by a number of major stock markets around the world as American money gushed into them and pushed some to crypto-like gains.\nCanada\u2019s TSX Composite Index in CAD and USD:\nThe TSX soared by 28.2% in 2025, to 31,713, after having already soared by 18% in 2024.\nSince the April 8 low, it has exploded by 41%! US tariffs may be bad for Canada but good for Canadian stocks? Whatever. More likely, American hot money.\nSince the March 2008 high, it has risen by 111% (all stock-index and currency data below via Investing.com).\nThe TSX is denominated in Canadian dollars, which finally rose against the USD in 2025. So expressed in USD, as investors in the US would see it, the TSX did even better in 2025, soaring by 35.5% for the year, and by 47% since the April 8 low. These were huge gains for US-based investors.\nBut the prior years were tough. Since 2011, the CAD has zigzagged lower from over 1 USD per CAD, to 69 US cents per CAD in early 2025.\nSo the gain of 111% from the March 2008 high shrivels, when expressed in USD, to a gain of just 54%.\nAnd for US-based investors, there were no gains between 2007 and early 2021, just zig-zagging up and down for 14 years.\nThe chart shows the TSX index expressed in USD since 2005 (each day\u2019s TSX value is adjusted by the exchange rate at the time):\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 in YEN and USD:\nThe Nikkei 225 index soared by 26% in 2025, to 50,339, after having already gained 19% in 2024, when it edged past the 1989 Bubble high, and 28% in 2023.\nIn the 36 years since the Bubble peak in December 1989, the Nikkei 225 has risen by 29%. It was a wild ride down to 2012, and a wild ride up to 2025.\nSince January 2012, the Nikkei 225 has soared by 500%, from 8,390 to 50,339, as the Bank of Japan was going hog-wild with QE, that included equity ETFs and ended up putting over half of Japan\u2019s gigantic government debt on the BOJ\u2019s balance sheet, and triggering substantial inflation that it is now trying to contain.\nThe BOJ started shedding its bond holdings in 2024 and announced recently that it would very very very very slowly sell its equity ETF shares, as part of its accelerated QT program.\nBut the yen has plunged against the USD since 2012, when the BOJ set out to knock it down with its policies.\nIt now takes \u00a5157 to buy $1. Back in January 2012, it took \u00a577 to buy $1. In other words, since 2012, the yen has collapsed by 50% against the USD. A substantial portion of that collapse took place in the three years of 2022-2024.\nFor USD-based investors in Japanese stocks, that 500% gain of the Nikkei 225 in yen since January 2012 shriveled to a still substantial gain of 184% in USD.\nThe chart shows the Nikkei 225 index expressed in USD (each Nikkei 225 value is adjusted by the exchange rate at the time):\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Stock Exch"

                "body": "TOKYO - Tokyo stocks are likely to maintain their upward momentum to test new record highs next year on optimism that the government's expansionary stimulus measures will boost corporate earnings.\nWhile higher yields on the key 10-year government bond above 2.0 percent are expected to have only a limited impact on equities, excessive yen weakness against the U.S. dollar stemming from fears over Japan's deteriorating fiscal health is seen as a downside risk.\nThe benchmark Nikkei Stock Average could climb toward 55,000, surpassing the all-time closing high of 52,411.34 reached in October, driven by further growth in the artificial intelligence field and the easing impact of higher U.S. tariffs on the auto industry, experts said.\nHopes for economic growth under the aggressive fiscal policy of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office in October, are likely to remain one of the major drivers pushing up the market.\nAI and semiconductor shares that led stocks' advances this year as well as the shipbuilding sector are especially seen as likely to benefit from the government drive to boost investment in fields that are considered critical, brokers said.\n\"While policy effects are expected to drive economic growth and prices are likely to continue rising, a positive cycle accompanied by wage increases would support corporate earnings,\" said Maki Sawada, a strategist in the Investment Content Department of Nomura Securities Co.\nShares of automakers are also projected to rise, with their earnings seen improving as the negative impact of hefty U.S. levies imposed by President Donald Trump is likely to be smaller than previously expected following a bilateral accord in July to cut the tariff rate.\n\"Auto and other exporters were especially hit by the Trump tariffs this year, but those struggling with sluggish earnings can expect a rebound next year,\" said Masahiro Yamaguchi, head of investment research at SMBC Trust Bank.\n\"If auto shares perform well, it would support the overall market,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, a further depreciation of the yen past 160 versus the dollar is regarded as a downside risk to stocks, as it could accelerate inflation by pushing up import costs and dent the popularity of the Takaichi government, which currently enjoys high approval ratings.\nAfter hitting this year's high in the 139 level in April, the yen has remained weak mostly above 150 in the past three months despite interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan and monetary easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\"With the interest rate differential between Japan and the United States expected to narrow one or two steps further, it would not be surprising to see the yen firming against the dollar,\" said Takuya Kanda, senior researcher at the Gaitame.com Research Institute.\n\"But looking at the trend in recent months, the rate gap is unlikely to be the decisive factor for the exchange rate,\" Kanda added, noting the flow of yen selling for investment as well as non-investment purposes is likely to remain intact next year.\nConcerns about Japan's fiscal soundness under Takaichi are also seen as one of the factors driving down the yen, with rising long-term Japanese interest rates failing to prevent the currency's decline, dealers said.\n\"If there happens to be a general election next year and the Liberal Democratic Party under Takaichi scores a landslide victory, this could also be a yen-selling incentive,\" Kanda said.\nA sharp yen slide would raise the cost of living for households already struggling with higher prices of food and other daily necessities and possibly dampen consumer spending, analysts said.\n\"If inflation keeps rising, wages will not increase in real terms even if companies raise salaries,\" likely resulting in falling support for the government, said Chisa Kobayashi, strategist at UBS SuMi Trust Wealth Management Co.\n\"A drop in approval ratings would undermine the effectiveness of policies and erode expectations\" for economic growth under the Takaichi gov"
