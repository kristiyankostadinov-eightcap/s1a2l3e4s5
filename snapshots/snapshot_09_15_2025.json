        "market_summary": "Gold has reached record highs in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms, driven by unprecedented central bank buying, geopolitical tensions, and diversification away from dollar-based reserves. The metal has significantly outperformed equities like India's Sensex across multiple timeframes, with recent strength attributed to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts and trade uncertainties. While some analysts caution about potential overvaluation relative to equities, gold maintains its role as a strategic hedge in portfolios.\n\nSENTIMENT: Positive\n\n**Overall Market Sentiment:** Positive",

At these levels, gold has more purchasing power than it did at its January 1980 peak of $850 or $3,524 in current dollars.\nThere are two usual suspects when gold prices go up \u2014 fear of inflation and fear of financial repression such as sanctions and capital controls. Both were in full force in January 1980 when the Consumer Price Index rose 13.9% from a year earlier and after President Jimmy Carter had frozen Iranian assets the previous November."

                "body": "Gold vs Sensex: Gold has delivered superior returns compared to Sensex over a several year horizon. Gold has surpassed domestic equities in terms of returns, primarily due to unprecedented buying by global central banks and investors seeking protection against inflation.\nThe precious metal has yielded 50.1% returns in rupee terms during the last year, whilst the Sensex declined by 1.2%.\nThe significant uptick over the past year can be attributed mainly to central banks' acquisitions, as uncertainties related to trade disputes have increased the appeal of secure investments, according to an ET report.\n\"Central banks continue to buy gold with about 25% of purchases coming from them,\" says Sridhar Sivaram, investment director at Enam Holdings. \"They are buying gold because of the ongoing tariff wars and as a diversification against the US treasury,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\nGold outperforms Sensex\nGold has demonstrated superior performance compared to Sensex across multiple timeframes spanning three, five, ten and twenty years.\nIn the past three years, gold yielded an annual return of 29.7%, surpassing the Sensex's 10.7%. The five-year performance shows gold achieving 16.5% returns, slightly higher than the Sensex's 16.1%.\nLooking at longer periods, gold's performance remained robust with 15.4% returns over a decade, exceeding the Sensex's 12.2%. The two-decade analysis reveals gold maintaining 15.2% returns compared to the Sensex's 12.2%.\nWhy are gold prices rising?\nExperts indicate that countries are shifting away from dollar-based reserves towards gold holdings. They recognise gold as a reliable value repository and protection against currency deterioration.\n\"Gold extends beyond being only a hedge against inflation, as the US Federal Reserve is on the stage to start cutting interest rates with hotter inflation,\" says NS Ramaswamy, head-commodity desk, Ventura securities.\nGold 995 - Mumbai\nHe further notes that anticipated US Federal Reserve rate reductions this month and ongoing uncertainty regarding President Donald Trump's tariff decisions will sustain gold's strong position.\nRecently, gold prices on Comex reached an unprecedented $3,715.2 per troy ounce, whilst silver exceeded $43, achieving its highest value in 14 years.\nWhat is the outlook for gold prices?\nExperts indicate that with gold prices having already surged 38%, future increases might be more modest. Nevertheless, portfolio diversification should include gold allocation between 10-15%. \"Investors should continue to allocate 10% to gold in their portfolios as it is the only hedge against currency, but you should not expect returns to be as high as the previous year,\" said Sivaram.\nFor optimal investment strategy, Ramaswamy suggests maintaining 15% gold allocation, recommending purchases during price corrections.\nRecent significant price appreciation has led several market observers to favour equity investments over gold.\nAccording to research by Edelweiss Mutual Fund comparing Sensex to Gold ratios, gold currently appears overvalued relative to equities. Historical data suggests equity outperformance when the ratio dips below 1, whilst higher ratios typically indicate stronger gold performance.\n\"The current ratio is 0.76, which is below the long-term average of 0.96,\" Niranjan Avasthi, SVP and head- product, marketing & digital at Edelweiss Asset Management. \"In the past when this ratio had been below 0.8, the BSE Sensex has given an 3 year average forward return of 25.12% compared to gold that could return 7.21%.\"\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own.

Chinese factory output and retail sales reported the weakest growth since last year, raising doubts about China's ability to reach its 5% growth target without Beijing rolling out more stimulus.\nSainsbury's is topping the leader board, rising 4.5% to a four-year high after confirming that talks to sell Argos to JD.com have terminated amid unfavourable terms.\nWhilst the UK economic calendar is quiet today, this week is a busy week for data with UK jobs figures and inflation data on Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by the Bank of England rate decision on Thursday and retail sales data on Friday.\nExpectations are for inflation to tick higher to 3.9% YoY, which will keep the Bank of England from cutting interest rates anytime soon. With inflation almost double the central bank's target, the Bank of England is unable to support slowing growth. Data at the end of last week showed that GDP stalled at 0% in July.\nFTSE 100 forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nThe FTSE 100 continues to trade with a multi-month rising channel. The price has extended its recovery from the 9100 September low, rising above to a peak of 9340 last week, just shy of the 9360 record high.\nBuyers will need to extend gains above 9360 to head towards 9500 and fresh record highs.\nSupport is seen at 9200 and 9100, the August low. A break below 8900 negates the longer-term uptrend.\nEUR/USD probes 1.1750 despite French credit downgrade\n- Fitch downgraded France\u2019s sovereign credit rating\n- USD falls ahead of Wednesday\u2019s FOMC rate decision\n- EUR/USD trades in a tight range, probing 1.1750\nEUR/USD fluctuates in a tight range after ending last week marginally higher. Investors remain on the sidelines ahead of this week's Federal Reserve interest rate decision and despite France's sovereign credit downgrade.\nLate on Friday, the credit rating agency Fitch announced that it downgraded France's sovereign credit score to AA+ from AA-, citing concerns over upcoming budget negotiations, which are unlikely to produce a more diluted fiscal package than was initially proposed by the outgoing administration. While these developments are putting the euro lower, they could be limiting the upside.\nMeanwhile, ECB governing council member Martin Kocher noted concerns over the appreciation in the euro, which, if it continues, could be problematic for export-oriented industries.\nWhilst the eurozone economic calendar is quiet today, the ZEW economic sentiment figures are due tomorrow, along with the final inflation print on Wednesday. Last week, the ECB left interest rates unchanged for a second straight meeting as inflation hovers around the 2% target.\nThe US dollar is starting the new week on the back foot against its major pairs as investors await Wednesday's FOMC meeting, where the central bank is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points amid signs of the US labour market weakening and despite inflation ticking higher.\nEUR/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nEUR/USD is trading in a tight range above 1.17 as it attempts to break out of the falling trendline resistance.\nThe price trades above the 20 and 50 SMA, and the RSI is above 50, keeping buyers hopeful of further gains.\nBuyers will need to rise above 1.1750 to extend gains towards 1.1830.\nImmediate support is seen at 1.17 and the 50 SMA at 1.1650. A break below 1.1580, the August low, creates a lower low."

We currently see the 1.16 level underneath that significant support, and the 1.18 level above offering significant resistance. As we are trading right around the 1.17 level, we are buying definition right in the middle of the range. This tells me that this pair will remain neutral for a while, unless we get some type of impulsive momentum, but it\u2019s very possible that we could stay in this range between now and Thursday, when we get that information from the Federal Reserve.\nIf we do in fact see the global economy starts to slow down, it might have people running toward the US dollar for safety, and I think that\u2019s one of the big question right now that we need to pay attention to. I think the next week or 2 will be very important, and could set the tone for the next several months.\nReady to trade our daily Forex analysis?

According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets now assign a near 100% probability of a 25-basis-point reduction, with some even pricing in a larger move.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has reiterated that policy remains data-dependent, keeping attention fixed on Wednesday\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for clues on the path of future cuts. A dovish tone could further pressure the US Dollar, helping the Pound extend gains.\nUK data keeps pressure on GBP\nDespite near-term strength, the British Pound faces headwinds from weaker domestic data.

Annually, PPI inflation fell to 2.6% in August versus 3.1% (revised from 3.3%) in July.\nThe final data releases of the week from the US showed that the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to 55.4 in September's preliminary estimate from 58.2 in August. This reading came in worse than the market expectation of 58. Other details of the publication showed that the Consumer Current Conditions Index edged lower to 61.2 from 61.7, while the Consumer Expectations Index declined to 51.8 from 55.9. These readings limited the USD's gains heading into the weekend and helped GBP/USD hold its ground.\nMarkets continued to price in about a 92% chance of a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut at the Fed's September meeting and an 8% probability of a 50 bps rate cut, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nGrowing bets for aggressive Fed easing and global risk rally led by the optimism around Artificial Intelligence (AI) exacerbated USD\u2019s pain, lifting the pair to fresh four-week highs near 1.3600.\nHowever, the upside was capped on several occasions by renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and between Russia and Poland.\nLate Monday, Reuters reported suspected Russian drone incursions into Poland\u2019s airspace, putting the Polish air defenses on alert as Russia breached the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) airspace.\nTraders also briefly turned cautious after Israel attacked the Hamas leadership in Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital, restricting the risk-sensitive Pound Sterling.\nFriday\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Industrial Production data also helped limit the pair\u2019s bullish momentum.\nThe UK economy stagnated in July, in line with analysts' expectations, with the GDP arriving at 0%. Meanwhile, monthly Industrial and Manufacturing Production dropped by 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively, in July. Both readings undermined market expectations.\nFed and BoE policy announcements to lead the way\nFollowing a critical week, in terms of US data releases, GBP/USD traders prepare for another intense week, packed with top-tier US and UK statistics and central banks\u2019 policy announcements.\nMonday poses for a quiet start to the big week as the UK employ"

The deterioration in employment data may well justify such a move, but I suspect pride will prevail and the Fed will fall short with a 25bp cut. Given the political heat Powell has faced from the Trump administration, a 50bp cut could vindicate the President\u2019s stance that the Fed has been too slow to ease, while also risking unnecessary panic across markets. A 25bp cut, on the other hand, allows the Fed to toe the party line while still maintaining an appearance of independence.\nFutures Market Pricing: 25bp in September, More to Come\nFed Funds futures imply a 96.4% chance of a 25bp cut, and around 80% odds of further 25bp cuts in October and December. Expectations for additional cuts from March are all below 50%, making this week\u2019s meeting a key opportunity for the Fed to reshape the outlook via the updated Staff Economic Projections (SEP) and Powell\u2019s press conference.\nAUD/CAD Bulls Eye 0.94 on Dovish BoC Outlook\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) is also expected to cut by 25bp, with weak July and August employment figures reinforcing the case. Swaps currently imply an 84% probability of such a move. A dovish delivery could see AUD/CAD bulls extend their breakout toward the 0.94 handle.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson, data source: Investing.com\nWith the RBA having delivered its token rate cut while growth and inflation exceeded expectations, there is little reason to expect any major sentiment shift in Westpac\u2019s quarterly consumer sentiment report. A glance at city restaurants hardly suggests concerns of recession or a notable dip in employment, so another set of robust jobs figures is likely in Thursday\u2019s labour force report.\nAssuming the Fed delivers a 25bp cut without triggering panic, the Australian dollar could continue to thrive in a weak US dollar environment, supported further by rising risk appetite.\nAUD/USD Correlations\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson, data source: LSEG\nAUD/USD Futures Positioning \u2013 COT Report\nOnly minor adjustments were made to Australian dollar positioning last week.\n- Large speculators reduced their net-short exposure for a second week, by -3.5k contracts. This came as 2.5k long contracts were added (+8.5%) and 1k shorts were trimmed (-0.8%).\n- Asset managers increased their net-short exposure by 2.3k contracts, adding 398 longs (+1%) but also 2.7k shorts (+2.5%).\nAs the data only covers positioning up to last Tuesday, it does not capture the 1.3% AUD/USD rally on Wednesday and Thursday driven by US dollar weakness. Net-short exposure is therefore likely to have decreased further.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson, data source: LSEG\nAUD/USD Implied Volatility, Risk Reversals Support Australian Dollar Rally\nImplied volatility has been trending lower on AUD/USD for several months. While this could signal growing complacency and leave the Australian dollar vulnerable to a shock, for now it is laying the groundwork for a constr"

                "body": "- AUD/USD attracts fresh buyers on Monday and draws support from a combination of factors.\n- Rising Fed rate cut bets undermine the USD and benefit the Aussie amid a positive risk tone.\n- Diminishing odds for more RBA rate cuts also act as a tailwind for the pair amid US-China talks.\nThe AUD/USD pair regains positive traction at the start of a new week and climbs back closer to the year-to-date (YTD) peak during the early part of the European session. The Australian Dollar (AUD) continues with its relative outperformance amid diminishing odds of additional interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). This, along with a positive tone around the equity markets and the prevalent bearish sentiment surrounding the US Dollar (USD), offsets mostly disappointing Chinese macro data and benefits the risk-sensitive Aussie.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported earlier this Monday that China\u2019s Retail Sales rose 3.4% YoY in August vs. 3.8% expected and 3.7% previous. A separate report showed that China's Industrial Production increased 5.2% YoY, compared to the 5.8% forecast and 5.7% in July. Meanwhile, the Fixed Asset Investment came in at 0.5% year-to-date (YTD) in August, missing the 1.4% expected and the previous reading of 1.6%. The markets, however, react little to the data as the focus remains on the second day of trade talks in Spain between the US and China.\nThe negotiations, led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, are the latest attempt to end a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Bessent said earlier this Monday that the US has \u201cmade good progress on technical details with China.\u201d Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer noted, \u201cWe want to maintain a good relationship with our Chinese counterparts.\u201d Top trade delegations from the US and China last met in July, when they struck a deal to extend the tariff truce by another 90 days until 10 November.\nMeanwhile, the optimism remains supportive of the upbeat market mood and lends support to the China-proxy Australian Dollar (AUD). The USD, on the other hand, languishes near its lowest level since July 14 amid rising bets for a more aggressive policy easing by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Traders ramped up their bets for a Fed rate cut in September after the recent US macro data pointed to a softening labor market. Moreover, the Fed is expected to deliver two more rate cuts, in October and in December, which weighs on the USD and supports the AUD/USD pair.\nIt, however, remains to be seen if bulls can retain their dominant position or opt to lighten their bets ahead of this week's key central bank event risk. The Fed is scheduled to announce its decision at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday and is widely expected to lower borrowing costs by 25-basis-point (bps). Investors, however, will scrutinize the accompanying policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks during the post-meeting presser for cues about the future rate-cut path. This, in turn, will drive the USD and provide a fresh impetus to the AUD/USD pair.\nAUD/USD daily chart\nTechnical Outlook\nFrom a technical perspective, the emergence of some dip-buying on Monday validates the recent breakout through the 0.6600 barrier and favors the AUD/USD bulls. Moreover, positive oscillators on the daily chart suggest that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the upside. Some follow-through buying beyond the YTD peak, around the 0.6665-0.6670 region, should allow the pair to reclaim the 0.6700 round figure and climb further towards the next relevant hurdle near the 0.6730-0.6735 zone. The momentum could extend further towards reclaiming the 0.6800 mark for the first time since October 2024.\nOn the flip side, the 0.6635-0.6630 area now seems to have emerged as an immediate support. Any further slide is more likely to find decent support and attract fresh buyers near the 0.6600 resistance breakpoint. The latter should act as "

Iron ore, a cornerstone of Australia\u2019s export economy, rose approximately 1% last week to settle at $105.70, its highest close since February 2025. The gains in iron ore reflect resumed steel production in China following pollution-related curbs for a military parade, alongside tighter global supplies from major exporters like Australia and Brazil.\nLooking ahead, AUD/USD\u2019s upside progress will likely depend on this Thursday morning's Fed interest rate meeting and a labour force update in Australia later the same day.\nAU: Unemployment\nDate: Thursday, 18 September at 11.30am AEST\nFor July, employment in Australia rose by 24,500 jobs, in line with the 25,000 gain the market expected. The unemployment rate eased to 4.2% from 4.3% prior, as the participation rate held steady at 67%.\nSean Crick, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) head of labour statistics, said: \u2018With employment rising by 25,000 people and the number of unemployed decreasing by 10,000 people, the unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage points to 4.2 per cent in July.\u2019\nThe solid employment report validated the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) cautious approach to rate cuts and reinforced expectations that it will remain a cautious cutter, given concerns about a tight labour market and upward pressure on wages.\nThe preliminary expectation for August is that the Australian economy will add 20,000 jobs and the unemployment rate will remain at 4.2%. If the numbers align with these expectations, the RBA is likely to cut rates by 25 basis points (bp) in November, bringing the cash rate back to 3.35%.\nThe Australian interest rate market begins the week with 19 bp of a 25 bp rate cut priced for November. After that, another 25 bp rate cut from the RBA is priced for May 2026.\nAU unemployment rate chart\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nOur technical outlook over the past few months has been for AUD/USD to rally towards a cluster of strong technical resistance near 0.6700, which it has now done. This area includes:\n- The upward bound of the sloping flag pattern/trend channel on the daily chart, which has contained AUD/USD for over five months\n- The 200-week moving average at 0.6681\n- Downtrend resistance on the weekly chart, originating from the 0.8007 high of February 2021\nAUD/USD weekly chart\nLooking ahead, the 0.6680 \u2013 0.6700 resistance zone is expected to initially cap AUD/USD\u2019s advance.\nHowever, if and when AUD/USD sees a sustained break above this resistance band, it can then extend its gains toward the 0.6950 \u2013 0.6970 resistance area.\nAUD/USD daily chart\n- Source: TradingView.

Correlations show the pair is tracking Fed pricing almost exclusively, underscoring how dominant U.S. rate expectations have become while risk sentiment barely registers. Recent data surprises on both sides of the Pacific have limited the scope for Fed easing while keeping the door open for BOJ hikes, leaving markets priced for cuts in Washington and hikes in Tokyo. With the Fed and BOJ both in play, any deviation from expectations could be the catalyst that finally forces USD/JPY out of its well-worn 147\u2013149 range.\nU.S. Rates Grip Strengthens\nU.S. interest rates remain the key factor behind USD/JPY movements, especially at the front end of the curve most influenced by central bank expectations. That\u2019s demonstrated below, looking at the rolling 10-day correlation between the pair and known historic drivers.\nSource: TradingView\nWith market pricing for Fed rate cuts out to June 2026 (red line), the correlation coefficient has strengthened to -0.87, indicating USD/JPY has almost always moved in the opposite direction over the past fortnight. When pricing has increased, USD/JPY has typically fallen, and vice versa. That\u2019s seen on the left-hand side of the chart, with USD/JPY in the top pane and market pricing in the bottom, the latter currently sitting at 109 basis points \u2014 a little over four full 25-point cuts.\nUnsurprisingly, USD/JPY has also shown an increased positive correlation with U.S. yields further out the curve, with correlation coefficients against two (blue), 10 (grey) and 30-year yields (purple) all strengthening over the same period, as have two and 10-year yield spreads (green and black, respectively) between the U.S. and Japan.\nReinforcing the dominance of rates on the pair, the correlation with expected U.S. stock market volatility has been negligible over the past fortnight, indicating risk appetite is not a key driver right now.\nFed Meeting Tops Event Risk\nWith rate decisions from the Federal Reserve and BOJ due later this week, the correlation analysis above suggests that if the narrow range USD/JPY has been trading in since early August is to be broken, it may require a policy surprise. The economic calendar for both the U.S. and Japan is shown below, with U.S. retail sales and Japanese inflation the only major releases of note. Realistically, unless those reports provide a significant shock, the week will be all about central banks and what they communicate on the outlook for interest rates.\nSource: LSEG\nBefore looking at the Fed and BOJ individually, it\u2019s noteworthy that economic activity in both nations has been holding up recently, as indicated by Citi\u2019s economic surprise indices shown below.\nSource: LSEG\nThe positive readings indicate that a slim majority of data releases have surprised on the upside, limiting the degree of easing markets have priced in for the Fed while keeping the prospect of further rate increases from the BOJ alive. The graphic below shows market pricing for policy rates from the Fed and BOJ, as implied by swaps markets.\nSource: Bloomberg\nFed Dots in Focus\nIn regard to the Fed, a 25-basis point cut taking the funds rate to 4-4.25% is deemed a lock, with a slight chance of a 50 priced in. If the latter were to occur, it would likely spark a large downward move in USD/JPY given its low probability. Should the Fed deliver a smaller 25-point move, the market reaction will likely come down to what the median FOMC member forecast is for the funds rate this year and next, along with the estimated neutral rate indicated by the long-run forecast. \u201cNeutral\u201d is the estimated level for the funds rate where it neither con"

With resistance at 149.3\u2013150.9 and support at 145, USD/JPY volatility is set to rise | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY Weekly Price Structure and Market Behavior\nThe USD/JPY pair ended the week at 147.646, recovering from lows of 146.306 and failing to break through the 148.577 peak. The resilience comes after sharp political tremors in Japan, including Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s resignation, which initially pressured the yen on speculation that leadership changes could delay a Bank of Japan policy shift. Despite these swings, the pair remained directionally firm, signaling markets are still guided by U.S. and Japanese central bank divergence.\nFederal Reserve Expectations and Impact on USD/JPY\nMarkets are pricing a 25 bps rate cut on September 17, with Fed fund futures reflecting nearly 100% probability. The August U.S. CPI rose at the fastest pace in seven months, but the increase was in line with forecasts, keeping inflation fears contained. More critical was the surge in weekly jobless claims, the sharpest in four years, which tilted sentiment toward looser Fed policy. If the Fed signals two additional cuts in its projections, the U.S. dollar would face broad selling pressure. However, a softer easing path\u2014just one cut through Q4\u2014could revive greenback strength and push USD/JPY toward 150.\nBank of Japan Policy Trajectory and Yen Reaction\nJapan\u2019s Q2 GDP was revised upward to 0.5% growth quarter-on-quarter, supported by stronger household consumption at 0.4% and a rebound in external demand despite U.S. tariffs. Inflation remains above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target, with core-core inflation still at 3.4% in July. That keeps pressure on the BoJ to normalize. Markets are split: 36% of economists expect an October rate hike, while 88% see tightening before January 2026. If national inflation on September 19 softens to the expected 2.8%, dovish bets will gain traction, weakening the yen further. But a hotter print would strengthen rate hike odds and could drag USD/JPY back to 145.\nRead More\n-\nVOO ETF Analysis: Vanguard S&P 500 Faces Inflation, Tariffs, and Fed Cuts\n14.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBTC-USD Price $115K Rally Fueled by $2.34B Bitcoin ETF Inflows\n14.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price (HG=F) Forecast: $10,069 Rally Fueled by Supply Shocks and Fed Outlook\n14.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Forecast: Pound at 1.3559 Faces Fed Risk, Resistance at 1.3595\n14.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTrade Data and Machinery Orders as Key Indicators\nJapan\u2019s August trade report is expected to show exports falling 1.9% year-over-year, a modest improvement from July\u2019s -2.6%, while imports decline 4.2% after -7.4%. A steeper decline in exports would reinforce concerns about slowing momentum in Japan\u2019s trade-heavy economy, weakening yen demand. At the same time, machinery tool orders are projected to drop 1.7% after a 3% rise in June, a reversal that highlights cooling industrial demand. If confirmed, weaker orders and trade figures may prompt the BoJ to delay hikes. Conversely, any upside surprise in exports or capital orders could reset expectations toward an October tightening move.\nU.S. Economic Releases and Near-Term USD/JPY Drivers\nThe U.S. calendar includes retail sales on September 16, forecast to rise 0.3% month-on-month after a 0.5% gain in July, and initial jobless claims on September 18, expected at 240k compared to 263k previously. Stronger retail sales and falling claims would dampen the case for aggressive cuts, supporting the dollar. Weak consumption and stubborn unemployment claims, however, would enhance dovish Fed bets and pressure USD/JPY lower.\nTechnical Setup in USD/JPY\nOn the charts, USD/JPY trades above the 50-day EMA but below the 200-day EMA, signaling short-term weakness within a longer-term bullish framework."

And if the FOMC does deliver an outsized 50-basis-point cut, that could also push the dollar down quite significantly, unless he suggests that there is a limited chance of follow-up cuts,\u201d said Kong.\nOn the other hand, the BoC is also facing pressure to cut rates this week amid labor market weakness. However, the central bank has already done a lot in terms of easing. Therefore, traders will focus more on the Fed meeting.\nUSD/CAD key events today\nMarket participants do not expect any key economic releases today. Therefore, the pair could consolidate.\nUSD/CAD technical forecast: Bears reemerge near 1.3875 resistance\nOn the technical side, the USD/CAD price has paused at a solid support zone after a sharp decline from the 1.3875 key level. The drop came after the price made a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern. Meanwhile, it paused after meeting the 30-SMA and the channel support line.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about Canada forex brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nUSD/CAD has been trading in a bullish channel with clear support and resistance lines. At the same time, it has stayed above the 30-SMA, a sign that bulls have a strong lead. However, bears have shown strength by making an engulfing pattern. If this plays out, they could break below the SMA and the channel support.\nA channel breakout would allow bears to take charge and target the 1.3750 support level. On the other hand, if the channel support remains firm, bulls will return to push the price above the 1.3875 resistance level. Such a move would allow the bullish trend to continue.\nLooking to trade forex now? Invest at eToro!\n68% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

The pair faces challenges as the US Dollar (USD) struggles, as a weakening US labor market boosts the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) delivering its first rate cut of the year on Wednesday.\nTraders expect the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, though there remains a slight chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Markets have also factored in continued easing through 2026 to help stave off a potential recession.\nMorgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank now expect the US central bank to deliver three rate cuts this year, after recent data pointed to easing inflation pressures. In separate notes on Friday, the brokerages projected 25-basis-point reductions at each of the Fed\u2019s remaining meetings in September, October, and December, per Reuters.\nTraders are also keeping their eyes on whether Stephen Miran will be sworn in as a Fed governor before the policy meeting. According to Reuters, citing the Senate schedule set by Republican leaders, the full Senate vote on his confirmation is scheduled for Monday evening.\nFocus is on Canada\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) release due on Tuesday, ahead of the Bank of Canada\u2019s (BoC) policy decision on Wednesday. Expectations for BoC easing have increased after data showed a loss of roughly 65,500 jobs in August and a rise in the unemployment rate to 7.1%.\n(The story was corrected on September 15 at 7:15 GMT, to say in the first paragraph that the Fed will deliver a rate cut on Wednesday, and not on Thursday.)\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in C"

The downbeat US consumer confidence data released on Friday added bearish pressure on the USD, but investors are wary of shorting the Greenback ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Fed decision.\nThe Consumer Sentiment Index released by the University of Michigan revealed that US consumers have grown more cautious amid the higher prices, adding to evidence that the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs is starting to pinch the US economy.\nSeptember\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index fell to 55.4, its weakest reading since May, from 58.2 in August, and well below the 58.0 reading forecasted by market analysts. Beyond that, inflation expectations for the year remained steady while the long-term inflation outlook rose for the second straight month.\nThese figures add pressure on the Fed to ease interest rates on Wednesday and strengthen the case of a dovish turn at the bank\u2019s forward guidance. Such an outcome would have negative consequences for the US Dollar.\nThe Canadian Dollar, however, is failing to take a significant advantage from US Dollar weakness, as the Bank of Canada is also expected to cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. Before that, the Canadian CPI prices are expected to show further moderation in August, paving the path for BoC\u2019s rate cut.\nCentral banks FAQs\nCentral Banks have a key mandate which is making sure that there is price stability in a country or region. Economies are constantly facing inflation or deflation when prices for certain goods and services are fluctuating. Constant rising prices for the same goods means inflation, constant lowered prices for the same goods means deflation. It is the task of the central bank to keep the demand in line by tweaking its policy rate. For the biggest central banks like the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Bank of England (BoE), the mandate is to keep inflation close to 2%.\nA central bank has one important tool at its disposal to get inflation higher or lower, and that is by tweaking its benchmark policy rate, commonly known as interest rate. On pre-communicated moments, the central bank will issue a statement with its policy rate and provide additional reasoning on why it is either remaining or changing (cutting or hiking) it. Local banks will adjust their savings and lending rates accordingly, which in turn will make it either harder or easier for people to earn on their savings or for companies to take out loans and make investments in their businesses. When the central bank hikes interest rates substantially, this is called monetary tightening. When it is cutting its benchmark rate, it is called monetary easing.\nA central bank is often politically independent. Members of the central bank policy board are passing through a series of panels and hearings before being appointed to a policy board seat. Each member in that board often has a certain conviction on how the central bank should control inflation and the subsequent monetary policy. Members that want a very loose monetary policy, with low rates and cheap lending, to boost the economy substantially while being content to see inflation slightly above 2%, are called \u2018doves\u2019. Members that rather want to see higher rates to reward savings and want to keep a lit on inflation at all time are called \u2018hawks\u2019 and will not rest until inflation is at or just below 2%.\nNormally, there is a chairman or president who leads each meeting, needs to create a consensus between the hawks or doves and has his or her final say when it would come down to a vote split to avoid a 50-50 tie on whether the current policy should be adjusted. The chairman will deliver speeche"

                "body": "- GBP/JPY kicks off the new week on a softer note and eases from its highest level since July 2024.\n- The divergent BoE-BoJ policy expectations turn out to be a key factor capping gains for the cross.\n- The downside seems limited as traders keenly await the BoE and BoJ policy meetings this week.\nThe GBP/JPY cross struggles to capitalize on last Friday's closing above the 200.00 psychological mark for the first time since June 2024 and edges lower at the start of a new week. The downtick, however, lacks bearish conviction ahead of this week's key central bank event risks.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Thursday and is widely anticipated to leave the key benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4%. Moreover, the central bank is seen maintaining a cautious wait-and-see approach for the rest of 2025 amid the recent rises in inflation expectations. This continues to underpin the British Pound (GBP) and acts as a tailwind for the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, continues with its struggle to attract any meaningful buyers amid expectations that domestic political turmoil could give the Bank of Japan (BoJ) more reasons to delay raising interest rates. This might contribute to limiting any meaningful corrective slide for the GBP/JPY cross. That said, investors seem convinced that the BoJ will stick to its policy normalization path.\nThe recent US-Japan trade agreement has eliminated a key source of uncertainty. Moreover, an upward revision of Japan's Q2 GDP growth figures, along with a tight labor market and a rise in real wages for the first time in seven months, backs the case for another rate hike by the BoJ this year. This marks a divergence in comparison to relatively dovish BoE expectations and could cap the GBP/JPY cross.\nHence, the market focus will also be on the outcome of a two-day BoJ policy meeting on Friday. In the meantime, the UK monthly employment details on Tuesday, along with the latest UK consumer inflation figures on Wednesday, might influence the GBP and provide some impetus to the GBP/JPY cross. The market reaction, however, is likely to be muted heading into the key central bank event risks.\n(This story was corrected on September 15 at 07:09 to say that the GBP/JPY cross eases from its highest level since July 2024, not 2028 in the first bullet point, and that the pair closed on Friday above the 200.00 psychological mark for the first time since June 2024, not August 2008, in the first para.)\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling.

The Fed\u2019s meeting comes amid growing tension between Trump\u2019s repeated demands for cheaper borrowing and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s warnings about inflation tied to Trump\u2019s own tariff policies.\nBut recent job market data has given the Fed the green light. Most analysts expect a 25 basis point cut. Canada and Norway are also likely to move in lockstep, while others like South Africa, Brazil, and Indonesia are expected to sit still for now.\nCanada cuts, UK watches, Japan delays\nThe Bank of Canada is expected to cut its benchmark overnight rate to 2.5%, citing weak job numbers and a second-quarter economic slump. Despite a slight uptick in headline inflation to 2%, core inflation is stable at 3%.\nHousing data this week will confirm whether the ongoing easing cycle is having any effect on the stagnant real estate market. So far, there\u2019s been no boost.\nThe Bank of England is likely to hold its rate steady at 4%. UK inflation data, dropping one day before the BoE\u2019s decision, is expected to show the headline rate at 3.8%, with a minor decline in the services segment. The central bank had forecast a 4% peak in September.\nA split vote is expected again as some policymakers push for another immediate cut. The main shift may come from a slowdown in the BoE\u2019s asset sell-off program, which is currently unwinding \u00a3100 billion a year in government bonds. With recent volatility, officials are expected to ease up on that pace.\nOver in Japan, investors are looking ahead to Friday\u2019s policy call by the Bank of Japan, following CPI numbers that show continued inflation pressure. The central bank is not expected to move rates this time.\nGovernor Kazuo Ueda has stayed quiet on timing, though many expect a hike is coming if economic strength holds. Japan\u2019s trade balance and Singapore\u2019s non-oil exports, both due earlier in the week, will also shape investor sentiment in Asia.\nIndia\u2019s trade deficit likely narrowed in August, and Pakistan\u2019s central bank is set to hold rates again.\nChina is flooding the week with economic data (retail sales, industrial output, investment, and unemployment numbers), all of which will offer a read on whether recent government support is slowing the country\u2019s downturn.\nProperty stats will show how bad the real estate slump has gotten. China also launched two investigations into US chip companies, escalating tensions in the global tech war.\nWall Street prepares for rate decisions and AI-fueled rallies\nBefore the Federal Reserve meets, US retail sales numbers are expected on Tuesday. Economists forecast a 0.3% rise for August, smaller than in previous months.\nWith labor conditions weakening and inflation still high, there\u2019s concern that consumers may start pulling back. Weekly jobless claims data on Thursday will help confirm whether last week\u2019s increase was a blip or the beginning of a trend.\nWhile Main Street is showing nerves, just 28% of retail investors called themselves bullish in AAII\u2019s recent survey, Wall Street remains upbeat.\nOver the past month, Deutsche Bank\u2019s 2025 forecast for the S&P 500 was upgraded to 7,000, Wells Fargo sees 6,650 by year-end, and a rise to 7,200 by 2026.

A single day alone, September 12, brought in $642 million, underscoring the depth of interest from asset managers and hedge funds. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led with $1.04 billion weekly inflows, followed by Fidelity\u2019s FBTC at $849.6 million, while ARKB and BITB combined added $320.2 million.

On-chain accumulation data confirms this trend: whales holding between 10\u201310,000 BTC have added over 237,000 BTC in the last six months, even as smaller traders have taken profits.\nFederal Reserve Policy and Macro Tailwinds\nETF inflows are being accelerated by macro conditions. Softer inflation data has increased expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, with economists projecting at least three cuts by end of 2025. Historically, dovish pivots have fueled strong rallies in Bitcoin: following the Fed\u2019s first 25-basis-point cut last October, BTC surged 54% by year-end. Liquidity expansion reduces the appeal of cash and bonds while enhancing Bitcoin\u2019s role as a hedge against monetary debasement. Current sentiment suggests that any confirmation of policy easing could trigger a fresh wave of FOMO-driven inflows.\nRead More\n-\nVOO ETF Analysis: Vanguard S&P 500 Faces Inflation, Tariffs, and Fed Cuts\n14.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nSolana Price Prediction: SOL-USD. $247 Surge Fueled by $1.65B Treasury Bet and $12.9B DeFi Growth\n14.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nCopper Price (HG=F) Forecast: $10,069 Rally Fueled by Supply Shocks and Fed Outlook\n14.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - 147.6 Level Holds as Fed and BoJ Policies Collide\n14.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nEthereum (ETH-USD) ETF Participation Expands\nWhile Bitcoin dominates institutional flows, Ethereum ETFs also secured $624\u2013638 million in net inflows this week, reversing last week\u2019s $766 million outflows.

Investors are increasingly pairing BTC and ETH in allocation models, signaling a maturing view of digital assets as complementary exposures.\nLiquidity and On-Chain Indicators Confirm Bullish Setup\nBitcoin\u2019s on-chain transaction volumes surged to $62 billion daily, surpassing centralized exchange volumes of $41 billion, a sign of heightened network activity. Despite this, thin liquidity has made prices vulnerable to sharp swings.

                "body": "Bitcoin ETFs are surging again, with $1.2 billion in inflows pushing institutional adoption to new highs. Meanwhile, Ethereum and XRP continue to dominate analyst picks, as their on-chain and ETF-driven narratives show resilience. But beyond the majors, attention is also building around MAGACOIN FINANCE, a hidden gem altcoin that analysts say offers early adopter exclusivity, exchange speculation potential, and audit-backed security.\nBitcoin: ETF Flows Show Record Strength\nUS-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have recently seen a dramatic uptick in investor activity as the top cryptocurrency price reached a new all-time high of over $124,000, at least in US dollars. According to SoSoValue data, the 12 funds saw cumulative inflows of $1.2 billion, the second strongest daily performance since launch in 2024, and the best this year. Since mid-April, the funds have attracted more than $15 billion in fresh capital.\nIBIT is now just shy of $80 billion in assets under management and holds over 700,000 Bitcoin, a record high. For context, it took SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the largest gold ETF, more than 15 years to reach a similar level. Meanwhile, other Bitcoin ETF issuers like Fidelity\u2019s FBTC also recorded strong performance on the day, with $324.34 million in inflows, while Ark 21Shares\u2019 ARKB pulled in $268.7 million in fresh capital. The surge in Bitcoin ETF activity appears to be a clear sign of institutional interest, spurred by the broader market rally.\nEthereum: ETFs Dominate Institutional Flows\nSpot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their biggest day of net inflows ever on Monday, with flows across all funds totalling $1.01 billion. The development came as many key indicators had turned bullish and Ethereum gained 38% in the past 30 days. Inflows into Ether ETFs far exceeded those of their Bitcoin counterparts, which recently saw a net inflow of $178 million, according to Farside Investors.\nFor the Ethereum funds, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) attracted the lion\u2019s share of flows, with a record $640 million going into the fund. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) was the runner-up and also recorded its largest single-day inflow, taking in $277 million. NovaDius President Nate Geraci said on X that Ether ETFs were previously underestimated because institutional investors did not fully understand Ethereum.\nXRP: Market Consolidation but Structural Strength\nXRP price fell by nearly 20% over the past 45 days, continuing a correction that has pushed the price back toward a key support. On the daily chart, XRP is consolidating within a descending triangle pattern, raising the risk of another move below support at $2.70.\nXRP futures data underscores the cooling market. The open interest has dropped from $11 billion to $7.5 billion during the same period, reflecting reduced speculative exposure.\nHowever, one positive development is that the token\u2019s estimated leverage ratio on Binance has reset to its yearly average. The ratio of open interest relative to exchange reserves signals that traders are no longer overextended on high leverage. This reduces the likelihood of cascading liquidations and supports price stability during corrections.\nEarly Adopter Opportunity With Exchange Potential\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs surge and majors like Ethereum and XRP dominate institutional picks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering the conversation as a hidden gem altcoin with future exchange potential. Analysts note that speculative attention often rotates toward early-stage assets positioned for major listings, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that profile. For investors, the appeal lies in its exclusivity right now \u2014 only early adopters are positioned before wider exchange access.\nWhat makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand apart is its emphasis on safety and security. With a Hashex-audited smart contract, capped supply, and transparent governance free from VC control, the project has earned credibility that many speculative altcoins lack.

He also outlined the next steps:\n\u201cWe will then start with a testing phase for mints and redeems of up to $800 per transaction with an initial group, to be followed by the opening of the USDH/USDC spot order book, as well as uncapped mints and redeems.\u201d\nNative Markets will also launch a USDH ERC-20 token, the token standard for the Ethereum network, alongside the HIP, Fiege said.\nThe race drew mixed reactions and criticism from the crypto community and several crypto industry executives, some of whom called into question the trajectory of the entire stablecoin sector and how exchanges would handle stable tokens in the future.\nPakistan invites global crypto firms to apply for operating licenses: Report\nPakistan has opened the door to international crypto businesses, inviting leading exchanges and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to apply for licenses under a new federal regime.\nOn Saturday, the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA) called on major crypto firms to submit Expressions of Interest (EoIs) to enter the country\u2019s digital asset market, according to a report by local news outlet Dawn.\n\u201cThis EoI is our invitation to the world\u2019s leading VASPs to partner in building a transparent and inclusive digital financial future for Pakistan,\u201d said Bilal bin Saqib, PVARA chair and minister of state for crypto and blockchain.\nEligibility is limited to firms already licensed by recognized regulators, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the EU\u2019s VASP framework, the UAE\u2019s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore."

                "body": "On September 14, 2025, the digital asset landscape saw a flurry of pivotal announcements, surging investments, and innovative new products\u2014all pointing to a maturing crypto economy increasingly shaped by institutional adoption and inventive passive income models. From XRP\u2019s newfound regulatory clarity and the rise of cloud mining solutions like BAY Miner, to Ethereum\u2019s ascent as a corporate treasury asset and the launch of USD1Swap\u2019s ambitious \"Genesis Eagle Plan,\" the day underscored a rapidly evolving ecosystem where both individual and institutional investors are finding new ways to engage and profit.\nXRP\u2019s Regulatory Win Ignites Passive Income Boom\nArguably the biggest headline-grabber was the U.S. court\u2019s confirmation that XRP is not a security. This long-awaited clarity sent XRP\u2019s price briefly soaring above $3, according to reporting from Crypto Economy. Analysts now forecast that XRP could reach $5 by 2026, fueling bullish sentiment among both retail and institutional investors. But the story doesn\u2019t end with price speculation: with the regulatory fog lifted, many long-term XRP holders are turning their attention to stable passive income streams, seeking ways to earn without selling their tokens.\nUnlike Ethereum or other major cryptocurrencies, XRP lacks native staking options\u2014a fact that\u2019s sent investors searching for alternatives. Enter cloud mining, a service that transforms idle crypto assets into daily U.S. dollar payouts, regardless of market volatility. Among the emerging platforms, BAY Miner has quickly become a standout for XRP holders. Regulated and compliant with AML/KYC and EU MiCA standards, BAY Miner allows users to deposit XRP, BTC, ETH, or USDT and activate a mining contract via a simple app or web dashboard. The platform\u2019s contracts are USD-denominated, meaning payouts are fixed and shielded from crypto price swings. Security is top-notch, with multi-signature wallets and bank-grade encryption.\nBAY Miner\u2019s contract options range from a $100 Basic Plan (about $4 daily for 2 days) to the $50,000 Premium \"Max Yield\" contract, which can deliver as much as $6,777 daily over 45 days, with total returns exceeding $300,000 if reinvested. There are no lock-up periods\u2014users can withdraw or reinvest at any time, offering flexibility for both casual and institutional investors. According to user testimonials collected by Crypto Economy, the results are impressive: one California XRP holder reported, \"I\u2019ve held XRP for years\u2014now BAY Miner pays me about $500 a day without selling a single coin.\" Another user described earning over $5,000 daily in passive income, all while keeping their XRP intact. The platform\u2019s low entry threshold, $15 welcome bonus, and daily login rewards have made it especially attractive to newcomers. As one user put it, \"This is the easiest money I\u2019ve made in crypto\u2014the app works like online banking, and daily USD earnings appear automatically.\"\nFor those wary of the risks, BAY Miner emphasizes its compliance credentials and renewable-powered data centers, as well as 24/7 multilingual support. Still, Crypto Economy reminds readers that such platforms carry risks and due diligence is essential.\nEthereum\u2019s Corporate Treasury Revolution\nWhile XRP holders are exploring new income streams, Ethereum has quietly become the darling of corporate treasuries. As reported by ChainCatcher, publicly listed companies now hold more than 3 million ETH\u2014about $14 billion\u2014representing 3.06% of the total ETH supply. This trend accelerated after the U.S. SEC approved an ETH spot ETF in 2024, opening the floodgates for institutional capital.\nLeading this charge are BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, which together control over 2 million ETH (about $9 billion), or nearly 65% of all publicly listed company holdings. BitMine, once a Bitcoin mining firm, pivoted to Ethereum in early 2025 under the leadership of Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat. By August 17, 2025, BitMine had amassed 1,297,093 ETH (wor"

Ethereum's stablecoin ecosystem has exploded past $168 billion, marking not just a new all-time high, but a fundamental shift in how the world stores and moves value in the digital age.\nThe Stablecoin Takeover Is Real\nEthereum's stablecoin ecosystem just crossed into uncharted territory. The network now hosts $168 billion in dollar-pegged assets, according to data from Litest, representing more than a 100% surge since January 2024. This isn't just growth - it's a complete transformation of how the crypto world handles value storage and transfers.\nThe numbers tell a compelling story. After spending years stuck between $120-140 billion, Ethereum's stablecoin supply broke free in early 2024 and hasn't looked back. The chart shows a classic parabolic curve that would make any trader take notice, with the steepest acceleration happening in recent months.\nWhy This Explosion Matters\nStablecoins aren't just digital dollars - they're the lifeblood of crypto trading, DeFi protocols, and cross-border payments. When supply jumps this dramatically, it signals serious capital flowing into the ecosystem. People are parking more money in crypto-native dollars, which means they're either trading more actively, hedging their positions, or moving value across borders without traditional banking rails.\nThe timing couldn't be more interesting either. While traditional markets grapple with inflation concerns and policy uncertainty, crypto users are doubling down on stablecoins as their preferred store of value within the digital economy. Ethereum has essentially become the Federal Reserve of decentralized finance, and these numbers prove it.\nThis surge reinforces Ethereum's stranglehold on the stablecoin market and positions it as the undisputed infrastructure layer for digital dollars. With liquidity at record highs, we're likely seeing the foundation being laid for the next major bull run in DeFi and possibly ETH itself. The question isn't whether this trend continues - it's how high these numbers can climb before the end of 2025."

Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) continue to be established networks with strong adoption, whilst Ozak AI (OZ), an AI-powered presale project, is stealing the spotlight with bold 100\u00d7 forecasts. Together, they represent 3 distinct methods to shoot upside in the current market cycle.\nSolana: Path to a $500 Breakout\nSolana, trading near $222, has reasserted itself as a leading blockchain thanks to its scalability, low fees, and thriving ecosystem of DeFi apps and NFTs. Analysts argue SOL could push toward $500 if momentum continues. On the technical front, Solana faces resistance first at $230, a short-term barrier where sellers have capped gains.\nA more potent resistance seems to be at $250, and beyond that, the psychological resistance at $300 stands as a main test earlier than a larger breakout. On the downside, SOL keeps dropping by around $210, accompanied by a deeper cushion at $200 and more potent buying pressure near $180, which might be important in retaining its bullish shape. With those ranges in play, Solana offers a stability of near-term trading opportunities and long-term increase potential.\nPolygon: Steady Growth From $0.272\nPolygon remains Ethereum\u2019s leading scaling solution, priced at $0.272. Its role in enabling faster and cheaper transactions ensures strong relevance in the Web3 and DeFi ecosystem. If adoption increases, analysts believe MATIC could revisit the $5 mark in this cycle. In the short term, Polygon\u2019s price action shows resistance forming first at $0.285, followed by a tougher barrier at $0.300, with a more decisive test near $0.320.\nOn the support side, MATIC holds steady around $0.260, while a secondary floor sits at $0.250, and a deeper defense emerges near $0.230. These levels provide traders with a roadmap, while long-term holders eye Polygon\u2019s broader upside potential of 20\u00d7 or more.\nYoutube embed:\nOzak AI: The 100\u00d7 Presale Buzz\nWhile Solana and Polygon offer stability and proven ecosystems, Ozak AI (OZ) is drawing the loudest buzz in 2025. Currently in Stage 5 of its presale, Ozak AI has already raised more than $2.9 million, with tokens priced at just $0.01. What excites investors is the possibility of OZ climbing to $1 or even $10 in the future, which would represent 100\u00d7 to 1,000\u00d7 returns for early backers.\nPositioned on the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain, Ozak AI taps into two of the fastest-growing tech narratives, giving it both credibility and exponential upside potential. Unlike meme coins, OZ is building its attraction on innovation and real-world use cases, which strengthens its long-term outlook.\nSolana at $222 eyes a likely run closer to $500, with resistance at $230, $250, and $300 and support at $210, $200, and $180 defining its near-term path. Polygon at $0.272 keeps consolidating, with resistance at $0.285, $0.300, and $0.320 and support at $0.260, $0.250, and $0.230 guiding its shape as it aims for $5 within the long term. Yet, while each SOL and MATIC promises solid growth, Ozak AI\u2019s $0.01 presale entry and $2.9 million raised stand out as the boldest play in 2025. For traders in search of the joys of exponential returns, OZ is really stealing the spotlight with its 100\u00d7 presale upside.\nAbout Ozak AI\nOzak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.\nFor more, visit\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI\nTwitter: https://x.com/ozakagi\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

                "body": "What if I told you that we might be witnessing the birth of a new titan in the cryptocurrency arena? Institutional confidence in digital currencies is reaching unprecedented heights, and at the forefront stands Solana, its treasury holdings gathering serious momentum. Recent statistics show that 16 treasury firms are collectively holding an eye-popping 10.2 million SOL\u2014worth around $2.5 billion. This significant accumulation not only captures the mounting interest in Solana but also solidifies its stature as a central player in the forthcoming era of financial innovation. In this discussion, we\u2019ll peel back the layers of these investments and consider how they might reshape the landscape of the Solana ecosystem.\nThe Institutional Surge: A Game of Confidence\nExemplifying this newfound institutional fervor are high-profile entities such as BIT Mining Limited, Sharps Technology, and DeFi Development Corp. Together, they\u2019ve amassed notably significant stakes in SOL, signaling their deep-seated belief in its potential trajectory. With these stakes constituting roughly 1.79% of the entire SOL supply, it\u2019s evident that institutional players are carving a transformative path in the digital assets sphere.\nAs cash flows shift from established cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum toward Solana, we\u2019re observing a seismic shift in market dynamics. This isn\u2019t just a change in appetite\u2014it\u2019s a clear endorsement of Solana's viability as an investment, placing pressure on the legacy assets to re-evaluate their positions in an increasingly competitive digital ecosystem.\nMarket Winds: Solana's Ripple Effect\nThe capital that is now gravitating toward Solana treasuries threatens to stir the opportunities and risks within the cryptocurrency marketplace. History tells us that substantial treasury investments frequently incite short-term rallies, followed by necessary periods of adjustment as firms recalibrate their portfolios. These oscillations can impact liquidity and price stability, ultimately shifting how different market segments perceive digital currencies.\nInvestors are now keenly attuned to these market fluctuations, understanding that the interplay between institutional buying and selling can create both opportunities and pitfalls for crypto holders. With Solana's extensive ecosystem and flourishing DeFi platforms, SOL is fast becoming a coveted asset that will be a focal point for investors as the months unfold.\nStrengthening Through Validator Engagement\nBut institutional involvement with Solana isn't limited to mere investments; it also encompasses enhancing the network\u2019s security and infrastructure through an expansion of validator operations. This focus on strengthening validator frameworks is essential for sustaining SOL's performance and reliability in the marketplace. Companies like BIT Mining are stepping up their validator pursuits, fostering an environment ripe for increased staking rewards and engagement.\nCurrently, stakers in the Solana realm can expect yields around 8.05%, fueled by inflation incentives and transaction fees. This enticing yield underscores Solana's allure, fueling further institutional commitments. When institutions align their operational strategies with Solana's advanced framework, they bolster a more secure and robust network, potentially revolutionizing the ecosystem on a broader scale.\nThe Shift in Capital Dynamics: From Legacy to Future\nAs the Solana treasury landscape expands, significant questions loom regarding liquidity in established crypto markets. The movement of key financial players reallocating resources from Bitcoin to SOL hints at potential liquidity repercussions that could leave traditional assets shaking in their boots. This transition is more than a mere economic strategy; it serves as a loud declaration of institutional faith in Solana, pressuring older digital assets to reconsider their relevance.\nThese evolving dynamics create a complex tapestry of risks and rewards as institutional entiti"

However, Q2 2025 S&P 500 earnings season has exceeded expectations, with both earnings and revenues surprising to the upside. Earnings outperformance was led by Information Technology, Communication Services, and Healthcare, supported by AI adoption, a rebound in digital advertising, and steady underlying demand. By contrast, more rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate and Utilities underperformed, pressured by elevated financing costs and softer fundamentals. It was no surprise that these strong results led to positive surprises, however, revisions to full calendar year earnings were more mixed. A more cautious tone also emerged in earnings calls, where the use of positive language declined significantly compared to the previous quarter and fell below the long-term average\u2014signaling a more measured outlook from corporate leadership.\nContent Type\nProducts & Offerings\nSegment\nLanguage"

                "body": "Key Points\nNone of the five worst performers is an industrial company -- but they are all well-known names.\nNone did well as negative developments in the market and economy unfolded during the month.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose by over 3% in August. That was because of a generally good earnings season, tempered by lingering concerns about the effect of tariffs on U.S. businesses and consumers. Another minus was a sell-off in stocks associated with artificial intelligence (AI) due to fears that swollen valuations wouldn't be matched by the financial benefits promised by AI.\nAs in any month with any index, however, there were some laggards among the 30 DJIA component stocks. Let's take a brief look at the five worst performers in August, arranged in order from steepest decline to narrowest: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Caterpillar(NYSE: CAT), International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n1. Microsoft (down 5%)\nThe slumping sentiment on AI titles took a bite out of Microsoft. That wasn't random -- the company has directly invested billions of dollars in one of the technology's leading names, ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Some investors surely felt nervous about that level of commitment, although the software incumbent has massive financial resources and can absorb even a large loss from the OpenAI stake.\nThese worries feel overblown. A story published mid-month in The New York Times indicated that OpenAI was in discussions with unidentified buyers to sell $6 billion worth of employee shares. This would value the company at around $500 billion, a staggering amount for a business that's still privately held.\n2. Caterpillar (down 4.3%)\nThe summer earnings season was hot and uncomfortable for Caterpillar. Near the start of August, the storied industrial company unveiled its second-quarter results. Investors were unhappy that it missed on earnings, although its top-line beat was rather convincing.\nTariffs were a major worry for Caterpillar, as the company might continue to book significantly higher costs for materials used to manufacture its goods. Sure enough, toward the end of the month, it all but confirmed that it was expecting to eat more expenses this year because of the levies -- it revised its annual estimate for tariff impact to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. Previously, it had set this at $1.5 billion.\n3. IBM (down 3.8%)\nSince IBM has pushed hard into AI, it's little wonder that investors traded out of the veteran IT company during the great AI scare of the summer. IBM is neck deep in the segment, channeling big chunks of capital into building out data centers capable of supporting the technology. It's buttressing this with software, hardware, and services and is something of a pace-setter in enterprise AI.\nThe downside of this, of course, is that when AI is out of favor with the market, so is IBM. Personally, I like the company's clear focus on the technology, and I admire how it has managed to shape a thriving, corporate client-targeted business around it. The sell-off in this stock, then, feels unjustified.\n4. Amazon (down 2.2%)\nAmazon seemed to barrel into August on a high note. After market hours on the final trading day of July, the company published second-quarter figures that beat the consensus analyst estimates, particularly for net income.\nA big asterisk next to this, however, was the performance of the company's powerful growth engine, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Sure, the market-leading cloud services unit booked a nearly 18% year-over-year increase in revenue during the quarter, but that lagged well behind the 32% rise of Alphabet's Google Cloud and -- ahem -- Microsoft Azure's 39%.\n5. Nvidia (down 2.1%)\nGiven the August AI slump, it really wasn't the best month to be the company so readily identified as the top faci"

This article highlights some of the top catalysts that may drive the Footsie Index this week.\nUK jobs, inflation, and retail sales data\nCopy link to sectionThe first main catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming UK consumer jobs numbers on Tuesday. Economists expect the upcoming jobs report to show that the economy added 158k jobs in the three months to July, much lower than the previous 238k.\nThey expect the data to reveal that the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.7%, while the average earnings rose by 4.8%.\nThe other main catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming UK consumer inflation data on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the upcoming data to reveal that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 3.9% in August from 3.8%, while the core CPI slowed to 3.7%.\nThese numbers will confirm that the UK is in a period of stagflation, which is characterized by a high inflation rate and slow economic growth.

These numbers will provide more information about the health of the economy.\nBank of England interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index will be the upcoming Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision on Thursday.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the bank to take the UK inflation and jobs numbers into consideration when making these decisions.\nMost analysts see the bank leaving interest rates unchanged at 4% as cutting interest rates to boost the economy will likely have a negative effect on inflation.\nThere will be two key drivers for the FTSE 100 and sterling in this decision. First, they will react to a news on quantitative tightening in the UK, with analysts expecting the annual figure to be between \u00a3380 billion and \u00a3550 billion this year.\nSecond, the vote split will be watched closely as investors reflect on what to expect later this year. Market participants expect either one or no interest rate cuts this year.\nRead more: Bank of England cuts rates to 4% in historic split vote\nUK Gilt yields\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index is the performance of the UK bond market, commonly known as gilts.\nData shows that the 10-year yield has eased to 4.65%, while the 30-year one dropped to 5.48%, down from the year-to-date high of 5.75%.\nA hawkish Bank of England decision will likely lead to higher yields, which will likely impact the stock market. Historically, investors tend to move to the bond market when yields rise.\nFederal Reserve interest rate decision\nCopy link to sectionThe other important catalyst for the FTSE 100 Index is the upcoming Federal Reserve interest decision on Wednesday.\nThis will be an important decision as it will be the first time that the central bank slashes interest rates this year.\nA Fed cut may positively impact American and global equities. However, the risk is that the interest rate cuts have already been priced in."

If we break down from here, the 23,250 level gets targeted as it is support. And therefore, I think we are trying to build up a little bit of momentum, but we are still very much in the same range that we have been in for some time.\nTop Forex Brokers\nUltimately, if we break down below the 23,000 level, then that's a very negative sign, but right now, I don't see that quite yet. The ECB has decided to sit still with its interest rates, and it suggested that it was very data dependent. So, I think we've got a situation where traders are going to be paying close attention to all the German economic numbers to get an idea as to how the German economy is functioning as per usual, but they will also take everything into account around the continent to see what the ECB might do.\nWatch ALL of Europe\nSo really poor French numbers, for example, might be a backdoor way to get an idea as to how the DAX might move. Ultimately, this is a market that remains somewhat sideways overall, but I think you've got a situation where traders are likely to continue to see more of a buy on the dip attitude, unless of course we break down below the 200 day EMA and then from a longer term standpoint you are technically in a downtrend. That being said, it is worth noting the buyers step back in to at least somewhat pick up the market later in the day.\nReady to trade our stock market forecast and analysis?

In particular, the Nasdaq Composite closed at a record, rising 2% for its second winning week in a row. The S&P 500 gained 1.6%, posting its best weekly performance since early August. The Dow wrapped up its first positive week in three.\nThe strong gains come after the latest economic data showing a weakening labor market and tame inflation spurred hopes the Fed will cut interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday. The market was last pricing in a 96% certainty that the central bank will lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point, with a meager 3.6% likelihood of a steeper half percentage point cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\"All sorts of flags are leaning toward the Fed putting in a 25 basis point cut in here,\" said Mark Malek, investment chief at Siebert Financial.\nLower rates could continue to support the stock market, which has received a boost from investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence, and despite risks to the economic outlook.

                "body": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 September 15, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Oracle ORCL, Adobe ADBE and Alphabet GOOGL.\nQ3 Earnings Season Gets Underway: A Closer Look\nWe include the recent results from Oracle and Adobe for their respective fiscal quarters ending in August as part of the September-quarter tally. The Q3 reporting cycle will really get underway when the big banks release their results on October 14, but we will have already seen fiscal August-quarter results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members by then. We have five such companies on deck to report results this week, including FedEx, Lennar, and Darden.\nAdobe beat estimates and modestly raised guidance, but the results fail to challenge the prevailing bearish narrative on the stock. At the core of this bearish narrative is the view that Adobe will be unable to sustain its software niche in the coming AI-centric world.\nA similar narrative has partly been at play in the case of Alphabet, where skepticism centers on the sustainability of Google\u2019s search dominance. Unlike Adobe, however, Alphabet has a number of other businesses that it can lean on going forward, though any threat to the search cash cow is understandably a significant concern.\nAdobe shares have lost approximately one-third of their value over the past year, lagging behind the broader market and the Tech sector.\nAs you can see above, the above chart also includes Oracle (up +81.8% over the past year) and Alphabet (+53.4%). Oracle\u2019s quarterly results were off-the-charts good, with the company\u2019s backlog gains and management\u2019s outlook for the coming periods exceeding even the most bullish sell-side estimates by big margins.\nAdobe\u2019s fiscal year ends in November, so its next quarter will be its fiscal fourth quarter. With only one quarter to go, Adobe\u2019s earnings for the current year are on track to be up +12% on +9.6% higher revenues. For next year, the expectation is of +12.8% earnings growth on +9.2% revenue gains.\nThese growth numbers aren\u2019t terribly out of line with the company\u2019s recent history, but the stock\u2019s recent performance suggests that the bearish narrative now represents the prevailing view on the stock. As a result, ADBE shares currently trade at their lowest valuation multiple in more than 10 years.\nThe question at this stage is whether this software name has finally become a \u2018value\u2019 play or is it a \u2018value trap\u2019?\nThe expectation is for Q3 earnings to increase by +5.1% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues. This would follow earnings growth rates of +12.5% and +12.3% in 2025 Q2 and Q1, respectively.\nIn the unlikely event that actual Q3 earnings growth for the S&P 500 index turns out to be +5.1% as currently expected, this will be the lowest earnings growth pace for the index since the +4.4% growth rate in 2023 Q3.\nWe have been regularly flagging in recent weeks that the estimate revisions trend has been positive since late April, after remaining under pressure in the months leading up to that point.\nSince the start of July, Q3 earnings estimates have increased for 5 of the 16 Zacks sectors, which include the Tech, Finance, and Energy sectors.\nWhile Q3 estimates for the remaining 11 sectors have been under pressure, the favorable revisions trend for the Tech and Finance sectors is more than enough to offset their effect on the aggregate trends at the index level, as these two sectors alone account for more than 50% of the index\u2019s total earnings.\nOn the negative side, estimates for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors have been under pressure since the start of the quarter, with notable declines in the Medical, Transportation, Basic Materials, and Consumer Staples sectors, among others.\nThe Tech sector, which has been a standout growth driver in recent quarters, is expected to continue playing that role in 2025 Q3 as well, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +12% on +12.5% higher revenue"

To stand tall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here and we\u2019re going to continue fighting for our rights and for others who cannot fight for themselves,\u201d Samantha Robles, 21, said as she watched the parade roll by. \u201cI\u2019m happy that many people are here so they can raise their flags \u2014 just not the Mexican flag, but also the American flag, because we\u2019re both Mexican American.\u201d\nBut the parade was also a bittersweet moment for Robles. This year, her grandmother opted to stay home, given ongoing sweeping immigration raids across the region. A new Supreme Court ruling authorized U.S. immigration agents to stop and detain anyone they might suspect is in the U.S. illegally, even if based on little more than their job at a car wash, speaking Spanish or having brown skin. Immigration rights attorneys and local leaders have denounced that as discriminatory and dangerous, and it has stoked fears in Robles, who describes herself as an East L.A. native.\n\u201cI have my brown skin, I have my Indigenous features,\u201d Robles said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not just for myself, [but] for my friends who are also from Mexico and they came here for more opportunities, for a higher education. \u2026 I\u2019m afraid for those who are getting taken away from their families.\u201d\nLong Beach will not hold its annual D\u00eda de los Muertos parade this year because officials say they have heard \u201cgenuine fears raised by community members\u201d about federal immigration enforcement actions.\nThe Comit\u00e9 Mexicano Civico Patriotico Inc., which organized Sunday\u2019s parade and celebration, addressed those fears in a press conference on Friday, but decided to move ahead with its celebration of Mexican independence from Spain, as it has done so in September for decades.\nThat decision seemed to drive a sense of proud resistance on Sunday.\n\u201cAqui estamos y no nos vamos!\u201d (\u201cWe are here and we are not leaving!\u201d) yelled Rosario Mar\u00edn, the former mayor of Huntington Park and the parade\u2019s madrina, or godmother.\nWhen Mayor Karen Bass rode by the crowd, she read aloud a sign from the sidewalk that said: \u201cTrump Must Go!\u201d\nThe crowd cheered.\n\u201cI was just reading the sign,\u201d she said, with a smile on her face. But Bass reiterated her support for her Latino constituents, and her opposition to the ongoing immigration raids, calling them horrible.\n\u201cOur city stands united,\u201d Bass told the crowd. \u201cWe are a city of immigrants. We understand that 50% of our city is Latino, and the idea that Latinos would be targeted is abhorrent.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has insisted its immigration actions are merely an attempt to enforce the law, and has blasted Bass and other city leaders for stoking resistance. But many Latino leaders say the administration\u2019s use of force is an abuse of power, stoking fears that have hurt people and the region\u2019s economy.\nSuch concerns may have affected Sunday\u2019s parade, which seemed less attended than prior years. Anti-Trump and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE signs, lined the street. Organizations such as the United Teachers Los"

                "body": "SEATTLE, Wash. \u2014 Over 120 personnel responded to a brush fire that damaged several homes and a soccer field on Sunday in the Beacon Hill area, leaving two people with minor injuries.\nThe Seattle Fire Department reported heavy smoke in the 2500 block of S. Myrtle St just before 4 p.m. At it's peak, it was a 3-alarm response from SPD and other agencies.\nAn SPD spokesperson says that four homes were damaged in total, two of which had fire force its way inside the homes, the other two suffering exterior damage.\nSFD added that two people were treated on scene, and were sent to a hospital for further treatment but were in stable condition, with non-life threatening injuries. A firefighter was also treated for a minor injury, and was able to return to working the fire.\nDavid Widham was one of those residents, who says his wife spotted the fire and they quickly grabbed their cat and got out of the house. They did not know the extent of the damages until they were able to return nearly 2 hours later.\n\"Everything inside the house I fine. Smoky, gross. [The] shed next to it with some of our empty boxes and tools is destroyed \u2013 part of my car is melted.\u201d he explained.\nAnother group of residents, explained that the fire came up like a wall against their backyard from the interstate hillside. One man said he was in the shower, and was told through banging on the door to dry off and get out. He says he saw flames through the bathroom window outside.\nOne resident shared a cell phone video with KOMO News, as she sprayed burning patches of grass in her yard with her hose. The video shows heavy blankets of smoke in the air, as well as fire in her neighbors yard as well. Her home sat across South Myrtle Street, but she did not sustain any damage. It's not clear how the fire reached her.\nWSDOT traffic cameras on Sunday afternoon clearly showed heavy smoke and burning along the grassy hillside, which was just across from the Boeing Fields. Fire crews could be seen shooting water from a truck onto the smoke and flames.\nVideo provided by a viewer shows a raging fire burning along a fence at the Van Asselt Athletic Complex, which burnt part of the turf field there.\nBy 5:45 p.m., the SPD reported it was reducing the response to a few units. Firefighters remained in the area until as late as 10:00 p.m. monitoring for any flare ups near the homes."

The Nikkei 225 Index was trading at \u00a544,780, up by over 45% from its lowest level this year. Similarly, the Topix Index jumped to \u00a53,160. Here are the top catalysts for the index.\nBank of Japan interest rate decision\nThe Nikkei 225 and Topix indices will react to the upcoming Bank of Japan interest rate decision on Friday. That report will come a few day after the statistics agency publishes the latest consumer inflation data.\nEconomists expect the data to show that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) slowed from 3.1% in July to 2.8% in August. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, is expected to come in at 2.8%, lower than the previous 3.1%.\nEconomists expect that the Bank of Japan will leave interest rates unchanged as it continues to support the economy that is facing major challenges from Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nWhile the main interest rate decision will be important, the main driver for the index will be Kazuo Ueda\u2019s speech, which will provide more information on when the bank may hike interest rates. In a note, an analyst told Reuters:\n\u201cUeda probably won\u2019t give clear hints on whether the BOJ could hike in October, as it wants to do more checks on how deep the tariff impact could be.\u201d\nJapan bond yields have moved sideways ahead of this interest rate decision. The 10-year yield was trading 1.594%, a few points below the year-to-date high of 1.65%.\nFederal Reserve interest rate decision\nThe other main catalyst for the Nikkei and Topix will come from the United States, where the Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day meeting on Wednesday and deliver its interest rate decision.\nThe decision comes after the US published mixed economic data recently. On one hand, the labor market has softened, with the unemployment rate rising and the number of payrolls rising by just 22,000 in August.\nAt the same time, a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 2.9%, and the core CPI remained at 3.1%.\nA Federal Reserve interest rate cut normally has an impact on American and global indices by incentivizing risk-taking among investors. The risk, however, is whether this cut will be a sell-the-news event.\nTop Japanese macro data\nThe other minor catalysts for the Nikkei 225 and the Topix indices will be some minor economic data from Japan.\nThe first main data to watch will be the upcoming exports and imports data, which will come out on Wednesday. Economists expect the report to show that Japan\u2019s exports continued to fall because of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nPrecisely, economists see exports falling by 1.9% after falling by 2.6% in the previous month. Imports, on the other hand, are expected to drop by 4.2% after falling by 7.2% in the previous month.\nThe other important data will be machinery orders, which will come out on Thursday this week. Economists expect this report to show that orders rose by 5.4% in July from 7.6% in the previous month.\nWhile these numbers are important, they will be overshadowed by the upcoming Bank of Japan interest rate decision.\nThe post Top catalysts for the Nikkei 225 and Topix Indices this week appeared first on Invezz\nRead More\nThe FTSE 100 Index has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months\nTop catalysts for the Nikkei 225 and Topix Indices this week\nJapan stocks are in a strong uptrend, with the Nikkei 225 and Topix trading at their all-time highs.

It\u2019s perfect for cutting\u201d.\nStill, Pepperstone\u2019s Chris Weston wrote: \u201cThe market would be surprised if we saw any outcome other than a 25-basis-point cut from the Fed, even if several Fed governors do vote for a 50-basis-point cut.\n\u201cAttention will quickly turn to the tone of the (policy board) statement, the guidance from Powell\u2019s press conference.\u201d\nCentral banks\nThe central banks of Canada, Britain and Japan are due to meet this week.\nAfter a tepid Friday on Wall Street that saw the Nasdaq inch up to a new peak, Asia fluctuated.\nHong Kong, Singapore and Jakarta all rose in early trade, while Seoul hit another record after South Korean officials scrapped a plan to lower the capital gains tax threshold for stock investors.\nShanghai edged down after data showed further weakness in China\u2019s economy with growth in retail sales and industrial production much slower than forecasts.\nThere were losses in Sydney, where ANZ bank, one of Australia\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d lenders, retreated following news it had agreed to pay a record fine of Aus$240 million ($159.5 million) over \u201cwidespread misconduct\u201d.\nTaipei, Manila and Wellington also saw losses.\nTokyo was closed for a break.\nAlso in view are talks between China and the United States in Madrid that will cover a range of issues including trade, with an eye on a November deadline for their tariff pause.\nChinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and his team will also discuss their dispute over TikTok with the US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe negotiations come after China launched two investigations into the US semiconductor sector on Saturday."

Traders are less certain about Norway's Norges Bank, with a cut this week priced at a little more than a coin toss.\nMarkets are 100% priced for an easing of 25 basis points from the Fed, taking its funds rate to 4.0-4.25%, with futures implying just a 4% chance of 50 basis points. (0#USDIRPR)\nJust as important will be Fed members' \"dot plot\" projections for rates and guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on the extent and pace of any further easing.\nFutures already have 125 basis points of cuts priced in, so anything less than dovish will disappoint investors.\n\"After cutting policy rates 25bp, Chair Powell is likely to guide toward a series of further rate cuts, noting that downside risk to employment has increased further following recent softer jobs data,\" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citi, who sees reductions at each of the next five meetings.\n\"We expect median \"dots\" to signal 75bp of rate cuts this year and for Chair Powell to indicate that rate cuts at upcoming meetings are likely given the shifting balance of risks.\"\nPresident Donald Trump continued his attacks on the central bank on Sunday, saying Powell was incompetent and hurting the housing market.\nA holiday in Japan made for a slow start, with the euro showing scant reaction to Fitch's downgrade of France.\nThe single currency was holding steady at $1.1728 EURUSD, a short way from its recent top of $1.1780. The dollar was flat on the yen at 147.58 USDJPY, but well within the 146.22 to 149.13 range of the past month or so.\nThe euro has been underpinned by a steady outlook for EU rates with the European Central Bank signalling it was in a \"good place\" on policy.

Its industrial output expanded at 5.2%, slowing from the 5.7% pace of the previous month, while retail sales rose only 3.4% from a year ago.\nFalls in property investment deepened while home prices fell another 0.3% in August, extending a downward trend that has persisted since early 2023.\nU.S. and Chinese officials concluded a first day of talks in Madrid on Sunday on their strained trade ties, and will resume them later on Monday.\nTrump said he was still negotiating on the divestiture deadline for Chinese short-video app TikTok, while pressuring Washington's allies to place tariffs on imports from China over its purchases of Russian oil.\nThe threat of further sanctions on Russia offered some support to oil prices, though concerns about slowing U.S. demand and increased production from OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum"
