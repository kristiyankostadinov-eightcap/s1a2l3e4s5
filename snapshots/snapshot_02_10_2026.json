                "body": "Gold rallies above $5,070 as China treasury shift batters US Dollar\n- Gold surges as China urges institutions to reduce US Treasury exposure, weakening the US Dollar.\n- Bullion supported by steady PBoC buying, extending China\u2019s reserve diversification trend.\n- Focus shifts to NFP and CPI to assess a more or less dovish Fed outlook.\nGold price (XAU/USD) remains bid during the North American session on Monday following reports that Chinese authorities recommended institutions to reduce exposure to US Treasuries or pare down their positions due to increased volatility. At the time of writing, XAU/USD trades at $5.074, up 2.16%.\nXAU/USD surges as reports of reduced Chinese Treasury exposure\nMarkets\u2019 mood is mixed, with the Greenback extending its losses, pushing Bullion prices higher, due to be denominated in US Dollars. Also, US Treasury bond yields, which are inversely correlated to yields, remain unchanged after pairing previous gains.\nPhysical buying of the non-yielding metal is another factor pushing Gold higher, as the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) added Bullion to its reserves for the 15th month in January. The debasement trade continues with more central banks diversifying from Dollar reserves to other assets.\nFurther bullish reasons, like expectations for further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), are likely to weigh on the Dollar. This week\u2019s January Nonfarm Payrolls report and the revisions for the employment data would be crucial in setting the path for interest rates\nAn upbeat jobs report could trigger a leg down in Gold prices if the markets priced in a less-dovish Fed. On the other hand, XAU/USD could accelerate its uptrend, yet traders would need to deal with Friday\u2019s US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.\nDaily market movers: US Dollar weakness boosts Gold\u2019s haven appeal\n- The US Dollar Index, which measures the buck\u2019s performance against a basket of six peers, is down 0.76% at 96.94. Conversely, steady US Treasury yields are capping Gold\u2019s advance. The US 10-year T-note yield is flat at 4.208%.\n- The New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations revealed that inflation expectations for one year dipped from 3.4% to 3.1% in January. For three- and five-year periods, it was unchanged at 3%.\n- The Survey revealed that expectations for credit declined relative to December, while views of the labor market improved.\n- Eyes turn to Fed officials crossing the wires. Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran, most likely remain dovish. Atlanta\u2019s Fed President Raphael Bostic, who would be retiring this year, would stick to his hawkish stance as he said that inflation remains too high, closer to the 3% threshold.\n- Money markets had priced in nearly 57 basis points of easing towards the year\u2019s end, according to Prime Market Terminal data.\nTechnical outlook: Gold continues to consolidate, yet bulls are looming\nGold price is neutral to upward biased, with bulls remaining unable to clear the February 4 high near $5,100. However, it should be said that in the last six days, Bullion printed a higher low, an indication that prices seem to be at equilibrium and Gold to consolidate within the $4,800-$5,100 range.\nIf the top of the range is cleared, the next resistance would be $5,200, followed by the January 30 high at $5,451 and the record high near $5,600. On the flip side, a drop below $4,800 exposes the February 2 low of $4,402 ahead of the October 17 cycle high at $4,381.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn\u2019t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders.

                "body": "When most people think of silver, they picture jewelry or coins. But in today\u2019s technology economy, silver is far more than a shiny metal\u2014it\u2019s a critical component powering everything from smartphones and solar panels to electric vehicles. Its industrial demand is rising fast, and that makes silver not just a material, but a strategic investment opportunity.\nAs businesses race toward digital transformation and sustainability, silver\u2019s role in technology is expanding, creating ripple effects in both industrial demand and investment markets.\nSilver as a Foundational Metal in Modern Technology\nSilver\u2019s relevance to the technology sector is rooted in its exceptional physical properties, particularly its electrical and thermal conductivity, which are higher than those of any other metal. These characteristics make silver indispensable across a wide range of modern technologies, from consumer electronics and data infrastructure to medical devices and advanced manufacturing systems. Unlike substitute materials, silver performs reliably at micro scales and under sustained electrical loads, which is why it is routinely embedded in circuit boards, connectors, sensors, and high-performance components that underpin contemporary digital life.\nFor investors, this industrial dependence adds an additional layer of context to physical ownership. Holding silver coins allows exposure to a metal that is not only monetarily recognised but also structurally embedded in global technological supply chains. Coins offer recognisability and liquidity while still representing direct ownership of a material whose demand is increasingly shaped by innovation and infrastructure growth. Within a broader investment strategy, this dual role strengthens silver\u2019s position as an asset influenced by both financial sentiment and real-world technological consumption.\nFrom Industrial Utility to Strategic Asset: Long-Term Demand Dynamics\nSilver\u2019s transition from purely industrial input to strategic investment asset is shaped by the persistence and breadth of its end uses. As technologies mature and scale, silver is consumed in incremental but irreversible quantities across manufacturing processes, meaning a portion of the annual supply is permanently removed from circulation. This dynamic distinguishes silver from many financial assets, where capital can be reallocated without physical depletion, and reinforces the relevance of sustained industrial demand when assessing long-term market behaviour.\nFor investors assessing long-term silver investments, this structural demand profile introduces a compelling supply\u2013demand consideration. While prices may fluctuate over shorter cycles in response to monetary policy or market sentiment, the underlying requirement for silver within electronics, energy systems, and infrastructure creates an enduring baseline of consumption. Over extended time horizons, this blend of physical scarcity and technological dependence supports silver\u2019s role as a strategic asset that aligns real-world utility with long-term investment planning.\nTechnology-Driven Consumption: Electronics, Energy, and Infrastructure\nThe scale of silver consumption within the technology sector is closely tied to the expansion of digital infrastructure and electrification. From power distribution systems and telecommunications hardware to data centres and automation equipment, silver plays a functional role in ensuring reliability, efficiency, and longevity. Its conductive properties allow for precise signal transmission and reduced energy loss, attributes that are increasingly important as systems become more compact, interconnected, and performance-sensitive. As global economies continue to modernise infrastructure and expand digital capacity, silver remains embedded at a material level rather than as a discretionary input.\nThis demand profile is also shaped by the cumulative nature of technological adoption. Once deployed, silver-containing components are rarely recove"

                "body": "What is the price of silver today: February 9, 2026?\nIf you were looking for an asset that has experienced remarkable growth in a relatively short time but remains relatively affordable, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better option than silver right now. The price of silver has more than doubled from what it was in early 2025, and, in 2026, it's already broken the $100 per ounce record milestone. In early February, however, the price has come back down again, offering investors a timely opportunity to get started before the price of the metal inevitably reverses course.\nTo better understand the value of acting now \u2013 or waiting to invest in silver in the future \u2013 it helps to know where the price of the metal currently stands. While this constantly changes throughout the day based on market conditions, having a baseline understanding can better help you determine your next moves and potentially get invested before the price becomes fully out of reach. So, what is the price of silver today, as of February 9, 2026? That's what we'll break down below.\nGet invested in silver online today.\nWhat is the price of silver today?\nThe price of silver is $79.93 as of February 9, 2026, according to Priority Gold. That's a bit higher than it was at the end of last week, but considerably lower than the $100-plus per ounce it was selling for in January. And while silver prices can be more volatile than gold prices (one of the key differences between the two precious metals), the likelihood of it fully reversing back to the sub-$50 range is low now.\nLike gold, silver tends to only rise in price over time, meaning that today's price still represents an affordable opportunity. If you need the portfolio diversification and hedge against inflation that silver represents, then it may make sense to speak with a precious metal company representative who can help you determine your next steps.\nContact one of the top silver investing companies here now.\nAre precious metals worth investing in with inflation lower?\nGold investing has been extremely popular in recent years as investors looked to hedge against inflation. And silver got caught up in that surge, too, for the same reasons. But with inflation closing in on the Federal Reserve's target 2% goal, is it still worth investing in? Many would argue it is.\nInflation, after all, is cyclical, so having an added layer of protection now could be helpful the next time it spikes. And stock market performance, while strong currently, can easily change overnight, at which point gold and silver can help ease any declines. It's also important to remember that inflation is still increasing, it's just doing so at a lower pace. Dismissing the benefits of precious metals in this climate, then, could be both risky and counterproductive. Instead, try to find the right role in your portfolio and consider getting started with silver now, before the price surges once again.\nThe bottom line\nThe price of silver as of February 9, 2026, sits at $79.93 per ounce. That's around $30 cheaper than it was in late January after it broke the $100 per ounce record, but still more than double what it was a year ago. In other words, now can be a smart, more affordable time to get invested in the metal. Just don't overinvest during this period, either, as many experts recommend capping the precious metal portion of your portfolio to 10% to better allow other investments to perform as intended at the same time."

Here's what should investors do now\nSynopsis\nWhy is silver price rising fast by 6.3% and will it surpass $100 mark soon or drop sharply again? Silver climbed over 6% after strong gains last week. Market watchers cite a softer dollar, China\u2019s central bank gold purchases, U.S. economic data, and supply shortages as key drivers.\nWhy is silver price rising fast by 6.3% and will it surpass $100 mark soon or drop sharply again?\nSilver prices have risen sharply by 6.3%, following a nearly 10% gain last Friday. Investors are responding to a weaker U.S. dollar, continued gold purchases by China\u2019s central bank, and expectations of lower U.S. interest rates. Supply shortages are also contributing, as even small increases in demand can push prices higher. The market remains uncertain whether silver will surpass the $100 mark or face a sharp correction, depending on economic data, investor behavior, and central bank policies.Why is silver price rising fast by 6.3%?\nThe rapid rise in silver is mainly due to four factors. First, the U.S. dollar has weakened, making bullion cheaper for international buyers. Second, expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts lower the cost of holding non-yielding assets like silver. Third, China\u2019s central bank has continued buying gold for 15 consecutive months, supporting overall precious metal prices. Fourth, supply shortages in silver markets create higher volatility. Combined, these factors have driven silver prices upward in a short period.Will silver surpass $100 mark soon or drop sharply again?\nAnalysts say that silver could reach or even exceed $100 if demand remains strong and supply deficits continue. However, the market could also see a sharp pullback if economic data from the U.S., such as jobs or inflation figures, disappoints investors. Volatility remains high, and traders are advised to monitor global central bank activity and upcoming economic reports to assess the likely direction of silver prices.Silver prices\nSilver prices rose sharply on Monday after gaining nearly 10% last Friday. Spot silver climbed 6.3% to $82.86 per ounce. Investors are closely watching U.S. economic data and central bank activity. The question remains whether silver will surpass $100 soon or fall back sharply.Gold Rises as Dollar Slips\nGold prices increased 2% on Monday, supported by a weaker U.S. dollar. Spot gold rose 1.9% to $5,056.21 per ounce by 1:35 p.m. ET (18:35 GMT). U.S. gold futures for April delivery settled 2% higher at $5,079.40 per ounce.A weaker dollar makes bullion cheaper for overseas buyers. Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said the dollar is the main driver. Investors expect weak U.S. economic data, especially on jobs.\nImpact of U.S. Jobs and Inflation Data\nMarkets are awaiting U.S. nonfarm payrolls, consumer prices, and jobless claims. Analysts predict nonfarm payrolls rose by 70,000 in January. Lower interest rates typically support gold and silver because they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.At least two rate cuts of 25 basis points are priced in for 2026. Investors are watching the data for clues about Federal Reserve monetary policy.\nChina\u2019s Central Bank gold buying\nChina\u2019s central bank bought gold for the 15th consecutive month in January. Eugenia Mykuliak, founder of B2PRIME Group, said steady official buying is stabilizing the market. Central-bank demand, led by China, acts as a structural floor for prices.Silver market dynamics\nSilver faces supply shortages. Even modest investor demand can deepen deficits and drive volatility higher. Market watchers note that retail or institutional purchases could push prices above previous highs. Silver\u2019s all-time high was $121.64 on January 29.Other Precious Metals\nSpot platinum rose 0.8% to $2,112.56 per ounce. Palladium increased 1.3% "

                "body": "Canada\u2019s largest airline has said it is suspending flights to Cuba due to a shortage of aviation fuel on the island \u2013 a move that comes amid a US orchestrated squeeze on the country\u2019s oil supply that has also forced Havana to ration health, transport and school services.\nAir Canada said it stopped service to Cuba on Monday but would still carry out \u201cferry flights\u201d to pick up about 3,000 customers in the country and return them home, while some other airlines said they would continue flying to the Caribbean country but rethink their logistics.\n\u201cFor remaining flights, Air Canada will tanker in extra fuel and make technical stops as necessary to refuel on the return journey, if necessary,\u201d said Air Canada, which operates an average of 16 weekly flights to Cuba.\nThe Spanish airliners Iberia and Air Europa said their services to the island would continue, but flights from Madrid to Havana would need to land in the Dominican Republic to refuel. Meanwhile, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico told CNN they would continue their operations \u2013 with American saying their aircraft could carry enough fuel for the return flights.\nThe development comes as the US attempts to cut its long-time communist foe Havana off from receiving oil deliveries from its regional neighbors, a move that has exacerbated a long-standing fuel crisis on the Caribbean island. On Sunday, Cuba warned airlines that jet fuel would not be available from February 10 to March 11.\nIn 2025, Cuba welcomed more than 754,000 visitors from Canada, more than any other country, according to the Cuban National Office of Statistics and Information.

Meanwhile, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico told CNN they would continue their operations \u2013 with American saying their aircraft could carry enough fuel for the return flights.\nThe development comes as the US attempts to cut its long-time communist foe Havana off from receiving oil deliveries from its regional neighbors, a move that has exacerbated a long-standing fuel crisis on the Caribbean island. On Sunday, Cuba warned airlines that jet fuel would not be available from February 10 to March 11.\nIn 2025, Cuba welcomed more than 754,000 visitors from Canada, more than any other country, according to the Cuban National Office of Statistics and Information.

                "body": "EUR/USD weakens to near 1.1900 as traders eye US data\n- EUR/USD softens to near 1.1905 in Tuesday\u2019s early European session.\n- Traders remain cautious ahead of a US data-heavy week.\n- The ECB is anticipated to keep interest rates steady through the remainder of 2026.\nThe EUR/USD pair loses ground to around 1.1905, snapping the two-day winning streak during the early European trading hours on Tuesday. Markets might turn cautious ahead of the release of key US economic data, including US employment and inflation reports that were pushed back slightly due to the recently ended four-day government shutdown.\nWhite House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Monday that US job growth might stall in the coming months due to slower labor force growth and higher productivity.\nThe Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, which is due on Wednesday, is projected to show an increase of 70,000 jobs in January, while the Unemployment Rate is estimated to hold steady at 4.4% during the same period. In case of weaker-than-expected outcomes, this could weigh on the Greenback and act as a tailwind for the major pair. On the other hand, any signs of improvement in the US labor market could underpin the USD against the Euro.\nAcross the pond, the European Central Bank (ECB) held its benchmark interest rate at 2.0% for the fifth meeting in a row last week, as widely expected. During the press conference, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the central bank would maintain its data-dependent and \u201cmeeting-by-meeting approach\u201d and would not be \u201cprecommitting to a particular rate path.\u201d\nAround 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters in their January poll said the ECB would keep the interest rates steady over the rest of 2026.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone"

                "body": "EUR/USD forecast: Currency Pair of the Week | February 9, 2026\nThe dollar has continued to weaken following its reversal on Friday, when risk assets bounced back in style. Though some of that move has since lost momentum, we could well see renewed appetite for risk when US investors enter the fray. But we have already seen some big moves. It was Japan that stole the spotlight with the Nikkei surging on a decisive election win for the ruling LDP. The US dollar has also been heading lower across the board so far in today\u2019s session, with even the USD/JPY turning negative on the day after climbing well north of 157.00 handle initially. The only reason US dollar may find support later this week is if risk appetite turns sour again, or we see some super strong readings in incoming data, with non-farm payrolls to come in mid-week and CPI on Friday. But last week\u2019s weaker labour market data pointed to a soft labour market, causing investors to re-price US rates in favour of more cuts. Add to that renewed chatter around diversification away from the US, and the greenback has come under pressure from all sides. Against this backdrop, the EUR/USD forecast remains bullish.\nUS dollar remains under pressure\nLast week\u2019s labour market data surprised on the soft side, forcing markets to rethink how robust the US economy really is. The big focus now is Wednesday\u2019s January non-farm payrolls report, alongside benchmark revisions. Consensus expects a modest +70k print, but in this environment, a downside miss would be far more impactful than an upside surprise. Beyond that, we also have US retail sales and CPI later in the week. If those numbers reinforce the idea that growth and inflation are cooling, the Federal Reserve may find it harder to justify its current stance. In short, softer data equals a softer dollar.\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg reported earlier that Chinese regulators have encouraged private banks to rein in exposure to US Treasuries, citing concentration risk concerns. If Chinese banks continue to diversify away from US debt, this could keep the dollar under pressure in favour of gold and other assets, including the euro. Many see Europe representing the most credible alternative to US markets in terms of size and liquidity. That\u2019s not to say Europe is flawless \u2013 far from it \u2013 but when investors are thinking about diversification, there aren\u2019t many other realistic destinations right now. Last week, the ECB seemed okay with a higher EUR/USD exchange rate. Meanwhile, growing political pressure on UK PM Starmer and a dovish-leaning Bank of England should keep the EUR/GBP supported, which in turn would make the EUR/USD more favourable than GBP/USD.\nOn the euro side of things, there\u2019s not much to look forward to this week. But with the ECB seemingly comfortable with the EUR/USD exchange rate, we could well be heading back towards $1.20 in the event the US jobs report missing expectations or not being surprisingly strong this week.\nEUR/USD forecast: Technical analysis and levels to watch\nThe EUR/USD\u2019s technical trend is bullish, and key support in the 1.1770-1.1800 region has been defended for now. Adding support, speculative long positions in the euro remain high. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the EUR/USD will continue to rise, but unless something changes drastically for fund managers to reduce their leveraged long positions in the pair, there are fewer compelling reasons for the pair to go lower.\nSo, the short-term bias in this EUR/USD forecast remains to the upside. As long as US data continues to soften and global risk appetite holds up, the path of least resistance looks towards the 1.200 level, with interim resistance seen around the 1.1900 area. Ultimately, though, Wednesday\u2019s US jobs report is likely to decide how this week ends \u2013 and whether the euro\u2019s latest rally has real legs or not.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general pub"

After that, we think the BOE will deliver a prolonged pause before resuming policy normalization in early 2027 (we see a terminal rate of 3.00% by mid-2027),\u201d said Dani Stoilova, UK and Europe economist at BNP Paribas Markets 360.\nOn the USD\u2019s front, the Retail Sales reading for December is due later on Tuesday. All eyes will be on the delayed jobs report for January on Wednesday. Markets' consensus forecasts the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) to increase by 70,000 in January, with the Unemployment Rate holding at 4.4%. Any signs of weakening in the US labor market and softer inflation could undermine the Greenback and help limit the major pair\u2019s losses.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures th"

                "body": "Key Moments\n- GBP/USD trades around 1.3605 in early European session on Monday, easing as rate-cut expectations weigh on the Pound.\n- The pair keeps a medium-term bullish bias while staying above the 100-day EMA. Initial support is at 1.3580 and resistance at 1.3870.\n- BNP Paribas Markets 360 expects the next Bank of England rate cut in March, followed by a long pause before further normalization.\nGBP/USD Eases as BoE Expectations Pressure Sterling\nGBP/USD trades on the back foot near 1.3605 during the early European session on Monday. Renewed expectations for a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut put pressure on the Pound Sterling (GBP) against the US Dollar (USD).\nThe BoE was widely expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at 3.75%. However, fewer Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members voted to hold rates steady than the market had anticipated. This reinforced perceptions of a more dovish stance and contributed to GBP softness.\n\u201cWe continue to expect the next rate cut in March. After that, we think the BoE will deliver a long pause before resuming policy normalization in early 2027 (terminal rate of 3.00% by mid-2027),\u201d said Dani Stoilova, UK and Europe economist at BNP Paribas Markets 360.\nTechnical Landscape: Bullish Structure Intact Above 1.3580\nOn the daily chart, GBP/USD remains above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), preserving a medium-term bullish tone. As long as the pair stays above this trend indicator, downside moves may attract buying interest.\nBollinger Bands show the spot above the middle band while the bands widen, signaling strengthening momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52, a neutral reading, but it remains above the 50 threshold, maintaining a slight bullish tilt.\nThe 20-day middle Bollinger Band aligns with 1.3580 and acts as initial support. Trading above this level keeps focus on the upside, with the upper Bollinger Band offering resistance at 1.3870. A decisive break below 1.3580 would shift attention to 1.3290 at the lower band, which is the next significant support zone.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)\nPound Sterling: Background and Key Drivers\nWhat is the Pound Sterling?\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the oldest currency in the world, dating back to 886 AD. The Pound is the fourth most traded currency globally, representing 12% of all FX transactions, with an average daily turnover of $630 billion in 2022.\nMajor currency pairs involving GBP include GBP/USD, commonly called \u201cCable,\u201d which accounts for 11% of FX turnover; GBP/JPY, known as the \u201cDragon,\u201d with a 3% share; and EUR/GBP, which makes up 2%. The Bank of England (BoE) issues the Pound.\nBank of England Policy and Its Impact on GBP\nMonetary policy from the BoE is the main factor affecting GBP. The BoE targets \u201cprice stability,\u201d aiming to keep inflation close to 2%. Its primary tool is the adjustment of interest rates.\nWhen inflation exceeds the target, the BoE raises rates to curb it. Higher borrowing costs support GBP because UK assets become more attractive to international investors.\nConversely, if inflation falls too low, it signals slower growth. The BoE may then cut rates to lower borrowing costs and encourage investment, which can weigh on the currency.\nRole of Economic Data in Sterling Valuation\nEconomic indicators are key gauges of the UK economy and can significantly affect GBP. Data such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and labor market figures influence the Pound\u2019s direction.\nStrong readings support Sterling, as they attract foreign capital and may prompt the BoE to raise rates. Weak data usually exerts downward pressure on the currency.\nTrade Balance and Its Effect on the Pound\nThe Trade Balance is another important factor. It measures the difference between UK exports and imports over a period.\nWhen UK goods and services are in demand abroad, foreign buyers convert funds to GBP, supporting the curre"

                "body": "The Pound to US Dollar exchange rate (GBP/USD) found modest support at the start of the week, with the pair steadying as doubts over the outlook for US employment weighed on the Dollar.\nAt the time of writing, GBP/USD was trading close to $1.3652, up around 0.3% from Monday\u2019s opening levels as investors grew increasingly cautious ahead of key US labour market data.\nThe US Dollar struggled to find momentum as confidence in the resilience of the American jobs market continued to ebb.\nA run of softer-than-expected employment indicators released last week has left markets wary ahead of January\u2019s delayed non-farm payrolls report. Any disappointment could weigh heavily on the Greenback and further complicate expectations for Federal Reserve policy in the months ahead.\nAdding to the Dollar\u2019s woes was renewed strength in the Japanese Yen.\nThe Yen rallied after Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party secured a decisive election victory, fuelling expectations of fresh fiscal stimulus and pushing Japanese government bond yields higher. The move encouraged capital flows away from the US Dollar, further pressuring USD exchange rates.\nSterling, meanwhile, struggled to build on its early gains as political uncertainty in the UK resurfaced.\nSave on Your GBP/USD Transfer\nGet better rates and lower fees on your next international money transfer.\nCompare TorFX with top UK banks in seconds and see how much you could save.\nConfidence in the Pound took a knock following the resignation of Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, over the weekend. The departure has intensified scrutiny of Starmer\u2019s leadership and unsettled investors.\nThe episode has also revived attention on Starmer\u2019s decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as the UK\u2019s ambassador to Washington, with renewed focus on Mandelson\u2019s past links to Jeffrey Epstein adding to the unease.\nFor GBP investors, McSweeney\u2019s exit has heightened concerns over instability within the government, particularly at a time when divisions inside the Labour Party appear to be becoming more visible.\nGBP/USD Forecast: US Jobs Data to Drive Near-Term Direction\nLooking ahead, the next major test for the Pound to US Dollar exchange rate will be Wednesday\u2019s release of the US non-farm payrolls report.\nMarkets are forecasting job creation of around 70,000 in January, an improvement on December\u2019s 50,000 gain. A result in line with expectations could offer the US Dollar some support.\nHowever, another downside surprise would likely trigger renewed USD selling, especially given the recent run of underwhelming labour data.\nWith no significant UK economic releases scheduled, Sterling is likely to remain sensitive to domestic political developments. Any further pressure on Prime Minister Starmer\u2019s leadership could leave the Pound vulnerable through the remainder of the week.\nLike this piece?

The pair benefits from renewed demand for the Australian Dollar (AUD), a currency sensitive to the global cycle, as concerns about potential disruption caused by artificial intelligence fade, supporting an improvement in investor sentiment.\nThe Australian Dollar also finds notable support from recent comments by Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Michele Bullock. She stated that the board raised the policy rate because the Australian economy is more capacity-constrained than previously assessed, implying the need for a tighter monetary policy stance. She added that the central bank needs to dampen demand growth unless supply capacity can expand more rapidly, a message perceived as clearly hawkish by markets.\nOn the Australian macroeconomic front, household spending fell 0.4% MoM in December, following a 1% increase in the previous month, and missed market expectations for a modest rise. On a yearly basis, spending growth slowed to 5%, its weakest pace in four months, highlighting the impact of persistent cost-of-living pressures and elevated interest rates.\nThe international backdrop also supports the AUD/USD pair. According to Bloomberg, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian described the recent nuclear talks with the United States (US) as a step forward, despite ongoing differences. These signals, combined with news of another meeting planned later in the week, contribute to a mild easing of geopolitical tensions and support risk-sensitive assets.\nOn the US side, the US Dollar (USD) remains under pressure. Investors remain wary of the unpredictability of US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy, his repeated attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve (Fed), and growing concerns over the US fiscal outlook. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, trades around 97.00 at the time of press, extending its decline for a second consecutive day.\nExpectations of monetary easing by the Federal Reserve are reinforcing the weakness of the US Dollar. Markets are currently pricing in around two rate cuts this year, expectations that have been reinforced by recent indicators pointing to a cooling US labor market. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed a sharp decline in job openings in December, while private payroll growth came in below forecasts.\nAttention now turns to the delayed release of the US January employment report, due on Wednesday, as well as upcoming inflation data. These releases are likely to play a key role in shaping the near-term direction of the US Dollar and, by extension, the AUD/USD pair.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

The daily chart shows the pair in a well-defined uptrend, holding above both the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near 0.6970 and the 200-day EMA around 0.6700. Price hit a high of 0.7094 on January 29 before pulling back to the 0.6960 area late last week as risk-off flows and a tech-led equity sell-off pressured the commodity-linked Australian Dollar. Monday's session saw buyers step back in, pushing AUD/USD up roughly 1% to trade around 0.7070 to 0.7085 on renewed US Dollar weakness, as the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut narrative gained traction with markets pricing two more cuts in 2026. The broader structure favors buyers while the pair holds above the 0.7000 round number on a daily closing basis.\nOn the 1-hour chart, Monday's rally from the 0.7010 area produced a clean bullish impulse, with price breaking above the 50 EMA and the 200 EMA on the lower timeframe. An ascending channel from the February 2 low near 0.6958 is guiding the advance, with intraday resistance at the upper channel boundary near 0.7090 to 0.7100. The Stochastic Oscillator is pushing toward overbought territory on the 1H, suggesting the pair could consolidate before another leg higher. Near-term support sits at the channel floor around 0.7030, with the 0.7000 level acting as a stronger structural base. A daily close back above 0.7094 would clear the January 29 high and open the door toward 0.7128 and the 0.7200 handle.\nLooking ahead, Tuesday brings the Westpac Consumer Sentiment Index for February at 16:30 GMT and the NAB Business Confidence survey for January; both will provide further color on the domestic backdrop following the RBA's hawkish pivot, with markets pricing an 80% probability of another rate hike in May. On the US side, Tuesday's calendar is relatively light ahead of Wednesday's delayed Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) for January, though several Fed governor speeches are scheduled throughout the week and could inject volatility if they push back on rate cut expectations.\nEconomic data coming up on Tuesday:\nAUD/USD daily chart\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, li"

IG market analyst Tony Sycamore reported that the currency finished the week at US70.13\u00a2, a gain of 0.7 per cent compared with the prior week. This marked the third straight week of advances and the first weekly close above the 0.7000 threshold since January 2023.\nThe latest advance came despite a turbulent backdrop across global risk assets. Equities, cryptocurrencies and precious metals all suffered heavy midweek selling before staging a recovery into the weekend, yet the Australian dollar maintained its upward trajectory.\nRate Hike and Wider Differentials Support AUD/USD\nSycamore highlighted that the Reserve Bank of Australia played a central role in underpinning AUD/USD. While volatility in the currency market did not match the extremes seen in other asset classes, the policy stance of the central bank provided a clear tailwind.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia, serving as the country\u2019s central bank, implemented its first interest rate increase in more than two years and signaled a hawkish outlook. This policy move expanded the interest rate differential in favor of the Australian dollar against the US dollar, adding to its appeal.\nFocus Turns to Data, RBA Speeches and US Jobs\nMarket participants are now shifting their attention to upcoming domestic economic releases and central bank communication in the lead-up to the next RBA board meeting. On the data front, Westpac consumer confidence and NAB business confidence figures are in focus, alongside remarks from senior officials at the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nSycamore indicated that the path forward for the Australian dollar will also be influenced by whether volatility in global markets moderates and by the outcome of the forthcoming US non-farm payrolls report.\nTechnical Outlook: Support Zone and Upside Targets\nFrom a technical perspective, Sycamore characterizes the latest retreat from the US70.94\u00a2 high as a corrective move rather than the start of a broader downtrend. He notes that support has held in the US68\u00a2 to US69\u00a2 band, reinforcing that zone as a key area for buyers.\nWith that floor intact, Sycamore believes that \u201ca retest of the US70.94\u00a2 high is now possible.\u201d He further suggests that, if the Reserve Bank of Australia persists with its tightening cycle, the Australian dollar has room to appreciate toward the US71.50\u00a2 to US72\u00a2 region."

However, they also warn of the possibility that any move up might be short-lived as the Japanese finance ministry will feel more compelled to respond.\n\"The ruling coalition has reportedly achieved a \u201clandslide\u201d victory in Japan\u2019s snap lower house election, clearly signaling wide support for the direction of the new administration, including its focus on greater fiscal spending. While some initial polls had flagged this possibility, we view this as slightly stronger than expectations.\"\n\"We expect implied volatility to pick up again, with USD/JPY moving towards and through 160 as markets digest the full impact of the election results and the mandate for PM Sanae Takaichi. However, the move may be short-lived or even short-circuited if authorities push back through rate checks or actual intervention.\"\nThey're not alone with this call as ANZ is out offering the same outlook for USD/JPY after the snap election result:\n\"Markets are pricing in over 50 bps of BOJ rate hikes by the end of 2026. We think this is overdone, with April being the final 25 bps hike of the cycle in our view. Further inflation misses and cautious BOJ rhetoric may see this pricing reverse and likely drag the JPY lower.\"\n\"Overall, we see USD/JPY continuing its march higher in the absence of any new US policy volatility. We continue to see risks of a move over 160 in the near-term.\""

                "body": "USD/JPY softens after Takaichi electoral victory\nUSD/JPY Analysis\nIncumbent Prime Minister Takaichi and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) delivered a landslide victory in Sunday's election. NHK projected a supermajority of 274\u2013328 seats in the Lower House, well above the 233 needed for a majority. fn ref=\"1\"]\nDespite initial volatility, the yen strengthened after the elections, which is counterintuitive but also reasonable. The victory appears to have been largely priced in by markets, and the clear result reduces political uncertainty, supporting the currency. The yen is also underpinned by ongoing FX intervention risks and the Bank of Japan's tightening bias.\nUSD/JPY slips on a firmer yen and lingering USDOLLAR challenges arising from de-dollarisation and debasement trends. A break below the EMA200 and an RSI below 50 could open the door to a deeper decline below 154.33. However, a successful defence would reaffirm the upside bias and keep the path open to multi-year highs.\nThe resounding electoral victory of PM Takaichi may embolden her to pursue spending and tax-cutting measures, raising concerns over Japan's fiscal position. This is negative for the yen, which remains vulnerable to the same debasement pressures as the dollar amid mounting global deficits eroding confidence in major currencies. Meanwhile, the US dollar has shown resilience following the nomination of a Fed insider to succeed Chair Powell, easing independence concerns and limiting the scope for rate cuts.\nNikos Tzabouras\nSenior Financial Editorial Writer\nNikos Tzabouras is a graduate of the Department of International & European Economic Studies at the Athens University of Economics and Business.

The loonie also got help from abroad as the US dollar weakened, and from oil prices ticking up \u2013 a tailwind for an energy exporter like Canada.\n**..\nWhy should I care?**\nFor markets: Rate cut expectations are doing the driving.\nWhen traders push back the timing of Bank of Canada cuts, Canadian yields can look more attractive and the currency tends to firm up. Positioning has started to reflect that: CFTC data showed speculators flipping net-long Canadian dollars as of February 3. But bond yields didn\u2019t surge, which suggests investors still see a fine balance between cooling inflation and slowing growth \u2013 so the next few data prints could swing expectations quickly.\nThe bigger picture: The loonie is a bundle of global themes.\nCanada\u2019s currency often trades like a proxy for three forces at once \u2013 central-bank policy, commodity prices, and global risk appetite. So even a mixed domestic report can move FX if the US dollar softens or oil rises.

The GBP/JPY has given away nearly 200 pips from session highs at 214.41 to 212.61 at the time of writing.\nPrime Minister Takaichi has drawn support from her growing popularity to secure the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s largest win in its history. The LDP obtained 316 of the Lower House\u2019s 465 seats on Sunday's election, a result that paves the path to extend Takaichi's tax cuts and economic stimulus policies.\nThe prospects of a strong government have soothed the market, which has reacted by scaling down Yen short positions. The Yen, however, has a bumpy road to a sustained recovery, as Takaichi\u2019s policies will sooner or later face the reality of the country\u2019s fiscal strains.\nYen intervention looming\nJapan\u2019s top currency diplomat Atsushi Mimura has provided further support to the Yen, warning that the government is watching currency movements with \u201da high sense of urgency\u201d, meaning that Tokyo authorities are ready to intervene at any moment.\nIn the UK, in the absence of key data releases, a new government crisis is weighing on the Pound. The Downing Street Chief of Staff, Morgan McSweeney, has resigned, taking responsibility for advising Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the appointment of Jeffrey Epstein-linked Peter Mandelson as US ambassador.\nThe scandal has undermined an already damaged credibility of the Labour Cabinet, which will not be restored with McSweeney\u2019s departure. A criminal investigation into alleged leaks of government information by Mandelson might add pressure on Starmer, increasing political uncertainty, which would have a negative impact on the Pound.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\n,\nAuthor\nGuillermo Alcala\nFXStreet\nGraduated in Communication Sciences at the Universidad del Pais Vasco and Universiteit van Amsterdam, Guillermo has been working as financial news editor an"

                "body": "ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA:BITU) promises double the daily move of Bitcoin, and right now that means double the chaos. The fund collapsed through January and early February, with 44% losses over the past month as Bitcoin\u2019s selloff accelerated. This decline was roughly twice the magnitude of the underlying Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GBTC), which fell 23% in the same period, illustrating the core risk: BITU magnifies both gains and losses through its 2x leverage structure.\nThe fund launched April 1, 2024 and holds $538 million in assets. It achieves 2x exposure through regulated Bitcoin futures contracts, not direct coin ownership. That structure matters because futures carry roll costs and tracking error during extreme volatility.\nBitcoin\u2019s recent crash from its late January peak created a cascading effect for leveraged holders. The magnitude of this decline translated to catastrophic losses for BITU holders who experienced the move at double intensity. This reveals why the futures-based structure amplifies risk during liquidation cascades, as each percentage point of Bitcoin\u2019s decline hits twice as hard.\nThe Macro Factor: Leveraged Liquidations and Fear Cycles\nBitcoin volatility is being driven by forced selling from overleveraged positions. Hong Kong hedge funds with leveraged Bitcoin bets triggered the sharp month-long selloff, according to market analysis from traditional financial news sources. When prices fall, margin calls force liquidations, pushing prices lower and triggering more margin calls. Roughly $2 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated in a single day.\nThis matters for BITU because the fund itself is leveraged. When the underlying asset experiences liquidation cascades, 2x exposure means getting hit twice as hard. The key macro signal to watch is Bitcoin futures open interest and funding rates, published daily by exchanges like CME and major crypto platforms. Rising open interest with negative funding rates suggests new short positions building, which can reverse violently. Sustained positive funding with high open interest indicates overcrowded longs vulnerable to washouts.\nThe Micro Factor: Daily Reset Risk and Volatility Decay\nBITU resets its 2x leverage daily, creating path dependency. This means the fund\u2019s performance compounds in ways that diverge from simply doubling Bitcoin\u2019s move over multi-day periods. If Bitcoin falls 10% one day then rises 10% the next, you don\u2019t break even. You lose money due to the mathematical effect of percentage changes on different base values.\nDuring February 5-6, Bitcoin dropped 14% then rallied 12%, resulting in an 8.5% cumulative loss for BITU holders even though Bitcoin only fell slightly net. This example demonstrates why volatile, choppy markets destroy value in daily-reset leveraged products regardless of the eventual direction.\nCheck the fund\u2019s daily NAV versus Bitcoin\u2019s performance in ProShares\u2019 fact sheets. Extended periods of high volatility without a clear trend destroy value in leveraged ETFs through this compounding effect. BITU works for short-term directional bets when you have conviction on Bitcoin\u2019s next move, but holding through violent swings like we\u2019ve seen recently is a losing proposition regardless of where Bitcoin eventually settles.\nThe most important factor for the next 12 months is whether Bitcoin volatility subsides or remains elevated, and the most critical micro signal is monitoring daily NAV decay during choppy, trendless periods."

                "body": "Vitalik Buterin Slams \u2018Fake\u2019 DeFi, Backs ETH-Based Algo Stablecoins\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has questioned the legitimacy of popular USDC yield strategies, arguing they don\u2019t follow the principles of true decentralized finance (DeFi).\nHis critique was in response to crypto analyst C-node, who said that most modern DeFi focuses on speculative gains instead of building genuinely decentralized infrastructure.\nCritique of Modern DeFi\nC-node challenged the crypto industry on social media, saying there is little reason to use DeFi unless users hold long cryptocurrency positions and need financial services while keeping self-custody.\nButerin supported this perspective, arguing that depositing stablecoins such as USDC into lending protocols like Aave does not count as true DeFi. He dismissed such strategies, stating, \u201cinb4 \u2018muh USDC yield,\u2019 that\u2019s not DeFi.\u201d\nIn his view, the underlying asset remains controlled by Circle, meaning the arrangement is fundamentally centralized even if the protocol itself is decentralized.\nThe Ethereum developer suggested two frameworks for evaluating what should qualify as real DeFi. The first, which he described as the \u201ceasy mode,\u201d centers on ETH-backed algorithmic stablecoins. In this model, users can shift counterparty risk to market makers through collateralized debt positions (CDPs), where assets are locked to mint stablecoins.\nHe explained that even if 99% of the liquidity is backed by CDP holders who hold negative algorithmic dollars while holding positive ones elsewhere, the ability to offload counterparty risk to a market maker remains an important feature.\nYou may also like:\n- Vitalik Buterin Increases ETH Selling as Price Falls Below $2K\n- Crypto Industry Proposes Sharing Stablecoin Reserves with Community Banks: Report\n- Vitalik Buterin: Copy-Paste L2s Are Hurting Ethereum\u2019s Progress\nThe second, or \u201chard mode,\u201d framework allows for real-world asset (RWA) backing, but only under strict conditions. Buterin said an algorithmic stablecoin backed by RWAs could still qualify as DeFi if it is sufficiently overcollateralized and diversified to survive the failure of any single backing asset.\nUnder this structure, the overcollateralization ratio must be more than the maximum share of any individual asset, ensuring the system remains solvent even if one part collapses. This means that it would act as a buffer that distributes risk instead of concentrating it within centralized entities.\n\u201cI feel like that sort of thing is what we should be aiming more towards,\u201d Buterin said, adding that the long-term goal should be moving away from the dollar as the unit of account toward a more diversified index.\nCrypto Community Response\nThe remarks were widely supported within the X crypto community, with one user calling it a \u201cgreat take\u201d and noting that ETH-backed algorithmic stablecoins offer real risk reduction, while RWA diversification spreads it instead of eliminating it. Another commented that \u201cTrue DeFi needs real risk innovation, not just USDC parking.\u201d\nHowever, there were also some concerns. For instance, X user Kyle DH pointed out that algorithmic stablecoins have not updated their designs to address known issues, which makes them similar to money market funds that have the same \u201cbreaking the buck\u201d risks seen before with TerraUSD and LUNA. They added that RWA backing requires careful diversification, warning that highly correlated assets or black swan events could still cause a stablecoin to fail."

                "body": "Introduction\nAs in traditional finance, credit is the bedrock of DeFi. It functions as a liquidity hub, fueling growth across onchain economies. Yet much of the onchain discourse is hyper-focused on speed and trading, thinking in terms of throughput and execution efficiency, without recognizing what truly underpins real-world financial markets: credit.\nWithout robust credit applications, decentralized finance would be largely hollow, just as the traditional financial system would be far smaller without banks, credit unions, or other lending institutions. Crucially, liquid and scalable credit markets cannot be purely engineered. Unlike decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which work best on performant chains and can operate with thin liquidity, lending protocols generally require deep liquidity and high-quality assets to function best. No amount of throughput or block space capacity substitutes for this. This point is one Galaxy Research has stressed before, including in our discussion of newly launched bitcoin layer-2s (L2s) and stablecoin-centric chains bootstrapping DeFi ecosystems. Ethereum exemplifies this dynamic well: despite being one of the slowest and historically costliest blockchains to use, it hosts the largest and most resilient lending markets because it houses a spectrum of quality assets and sufficient liquidity.\nAn important, but underdiscussed, structural constraint in onchain lending markets emerges from native network staking. High staking rates reduce the available supply of networks\u2019 base assets, potentially limiting the depth of, and ability to bootstrap, onchain lending markets. This paper explores the subtle but powerful relationship between staking dynamics and credit layer development, and why it may present a harsher limitation for credit apps than for other DeFi verticals.\nThe Structural Tension Between Staking and Lending in L1 Economics\nThere are two main competing yield sources for proof of stake (PoS) layer-1 (L1) coins like ETH and SOL:\nCore protocol participation \u2013 staking\nFinancial market participation \u2013 DeFi\nOver-allocation to one may starve the other, but there are workarounds via liquid staking tokens (LSTs) that allow for staking and DeFi participation simultaneously. Historically, many users have favored staking, often at the expense of DeFi liquidity. This is natural given staking is immediately made available upon the launch of a chain, is not constrained by scalability (a coin\u2019s entire supply could be staked), is a more passive activity with less immediate risk, and offers steadier, more predictable yield. Meanwhile, DeFi ecosystems take time to achieve scale and carry risk at the market and application levels. As a result, staking often offers a preferable risk-adjusted source of yield for certain users and is typically the heavier side of the barbell in the DeFi\u2013staking relationship. The main issue with this dynamic in the context of credit markets is as follows:\nScalable and competitive lending markets require deep, cohesive liquidity built on a large and diverse base of quality assets. For L1 chains, these are primarily their native tokens, liquid staking derivatives (e.g., ETH and stETH for Ethereum, SOL and jitoSOL for Solana), and other synthetic assets built on top of them. When a large share of a chain\u2019s native asset is staked\u2014without enough of it represented through LSTs or other liquid synthetic assets\u2014the supply of accessible, high-quality collateral becomes constrained, choking off the liquidity and quality collateral that can underpin the chain\u2019s lending markets.\nThis shortage of quality assets can push lending applications to A) go down the risk curve of collateral assets (memecoins and DAO tokens to name a couple) to fuel their markets, B) import collateral from other chains (e.g. wrapped bitcoin) or offchain, and/or C) tighten market parameters, and in turn limit the efficiency or role of the chain\u2019s native asset and other asset types as collateral.

Sign up now!\nVibe Check: Ethereum is in one of its most critical phases ever. Price action has been wild, liquidity pockets are shifting fast, and the entire ecosystem is re-pricing around Layer-2 dominance, ETF narratives, and upcoming upgrades. We are seeing sharp moves, sudden squeezes, and brutal wicks that are shaking out overleveraged traders while long-term believers keep stacking. This is not a calm market \u2013 this is a battleground.\nWant to see what people are saying? Here are the real opinions:\n- Watch the boldest Ethereum price prediction videos on YouTube right now\n- Scroll the freshest Ethereum news drops and chart memes on Instagram\n- Go viral with TikTok strategies from Ethereum trading degenerates\nThe Narrative:\nEthereum is no longer just a coin; it is the settlement layer for an entire on-chain economy. DeFi, NFTs, gaming, RWAs (real-world assets), and institutional-grade infrastructure are all increasingly anchored to Ethereum Mainnet and its Layer-2 ecosystem.\nOn the news side, big themes are dominating:\n- Layer-2 Scaling Wars: Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync, StarkNet \u2013 the list keeps growing. Instead of cannibalizing Ethereum, they are routing more activity back to Mainnet while offloading execution. This means Ethereum becomes the high-value final settlement and data availability layer, not the place where every meme swap has to happen. Fees on L2s can be tiny, while Mainnet still captures serious value when rollups post their data and settle batches.\n- Vitalik and the Roadmap: Vitalik\u2019s recent posts and talks have doubled down on the idea of Ethereum as a lean, secure, credibly neutral base layer. The rollup-centric vision is playing out in real time. Developers are focused on Verkle Trees, Pectra, and continual improvements to data availability to make rollups cheaper and more scalable.\n- Regulation & ETFs: The regulatory climate is intense. ETH is constantly in the conversation: securities vs. commodities debates, staking regulation, and the push toward more transparent institutional products. ETF and ETP flows, especially from US and European products, are now a real macro driver that can flip liquidity from bearish to bullish very quickly or vice versa.\n- On-chain Whales & Smart Money: We are seeing classic crypto behavior: during sharp dumps, on-chain sleuths are tracking accumulation in large wallets, staking contracts, and L2 bridges. Whales are rotating between stablecoins, L2 tokens, and ETH itself, chasing yield in DeFi while trying not to get rekt by sudden volatility bursts.\nSocial sentiment is split. On YouTube and TikTok you will see two extremes: ultra-bullish moon calls talking about future supply squeezes and hyper-bearish warnings about ETH losing market share to faster L1s and new narratives. Instagram and X are packed with charts showing Ethereum battling crucial resistance while gas fees spike during hype events and then collapse during quiet periods.\nUnder the hood, though, the core narrative is this: Ethereum is slowly transforming into a scalable, institution-ready global settlement layer while retail traders get distracted by the daily noise.\nDeep Dive Analysis:\n1. Gas Fees & Layer-2: From Pain Point to Business Model\nFor years, gas fees were the FUD weapon against Ethereum. Every NFT mint, every bull-market DeFi rush, people were screaming about insane fees and Ethereum being unusable. That pressure forced Ethereum to lean fully into the rollup-centric roadmap.\nNow we have Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and others running as execution environments on top of Ethereum. They do the heavy lifting \u2013 quick trades, complex DeFi interactions, gaming \u2013 while Ethereum Mainnet is the final boss layer where data gets posted and settled.\nWhat does that mean economically?\n- Mainnet gas fee spikes are now driven more by rollups posting data and high-value"

This expansion signifies that institutional-grade tokenized gold is further entering high-performance public chain ecosystems, providing more scalable infrastructure support for trading, liquidity management, and DeFi use cases.\nXAUm is one of Asia\u2019s largest-scale tokenized gold projects. Each token represents one troy ounce of physical gold with 99.99% purity, fully compliant with London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) standards, and supports physical redemption. The underlying gold is held in institutional-grade vaults and subject to independent third-party audits.\nTokenized Gold Enters High-Performance Public Chains, Unlocking On-Chain Financial Use Cases\nAs on-chain financial systems mature, market discussions are increasingly focusing on the long-term usability of assets within these systems. Against this backdrop, tokenized gold is evolving from a static store-of-value asset into a foundational asset capable of participating in on-chain financial activities.\nSolana\u2014renowned for its high throughput, low latency, and minimal transaction costs\u2014provides a more suitable environment for the large-scale deployment of RWAs. Its near-instant settlement capability and high-frequency interaction features enable gold not only to serve as a store of value but also to function as both a liquidity and reserve asset within on-chain financial systems.\nEva Meng, Head of Matrixdock, stated: \u201cDeploying XAUm on Solana advances gold from passive holding toward programmable financial infrastructure. High-performance blockchains allow gold to circulate and be utilized more efficiently while maintaining full physical backing\u2014a critical step forward in modern asset issuance, verification, and application.\u201d\nNatively Integrated into Solana\u2019s DeFi Ecosystem, Balancing Physical Backing and On-Chain Liquidity\nXAUm will be natively integrated into Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, with initial liquidity deployed on Raydium for decentralized trading and liquidity provision. Further expansion into Solana-based lending markets is planned. Pyth will serve as the primary price oracle, supplying price references for on-chain applications.\nThis architecture enables XAUm holders to use tokenized gold as collateral, access on-chain liquidity, and participate in diverse DeFi use cases\u2014all while preserving full physical backing and asset integrity. From a security perspective, the Solana smart contracts supporting XAUm have undergone independent audits by Accretion and Sec3, reflecting Matrixdock\u2019s rigorous institutional-grade risk management and on-chain security standards.\nLu Yin, Head of Asia-Pacific at the Solana Foundation, remarked: \u201cFrom its inception, Solana was designed to support the large-scale application of real-world assets. With the launch of XAUm, Matrixdock brings fully physically backed, institutional-grade tokenized gold into the Solana ecosystem\u2014enabling instant settlement, seamless DeFi integration, and meeting institutional requirements for security and composability.\u201d\nNotably, this is not Matrixdock\u2019s first tokenized gold project deployed on Solana. At the end of 2025, Matrixdock served as the tokenization technology provider for the Kingdom of Bhutan\u2019s Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC), launching the sovereign gold-backed token TER, which is already live on Solana.

Market focus turned to the upcoming US economic data and the next wave of corporate earnings, leaving traders in a cautious mood.\nMeanwhile, the Nikkei 225, the Hang Seng Index, and Mainland China\u2019s indices posted strong gains. The contrasting trends underscored the significance of today\u2019s US session.\nDespite the morning pullback, rising bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut support a medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the technical levels traders should watch.\nOvernight, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett reportedly warned that US labor market data could be weaker in the near-term, testing sentiment ahead of this week\u2019s delayed US jobs report. While Hassett attributed the likelihood of softer data to increased productivity and immigration policy, last week\u2019s reaction to US labor market data underscored market sensitivity to jobs data.\nHassett\u2019s view would align with the US administration\u2019s positive economic outlook. Nevertheless, a weaker labor market may curb consumer spending and cool economic momentum, given that private consumption accounts for around 65% of US GDP.\nNotably, last week\u2019s JOLTs job openings indicated weaker labor demand. The drop in job openings challenged views that immigration policies could create labor market shortages, which typically lifts wages. Weaker labor demand could dampen wage growth, slow consumer spending, and dampen demand-driven inflation. These scenarios would indicate a more dovish Fed policy stance, affirming the bullish medium-term outlook for US stock futures.\nUS futures posted modest losses during the Asian session on February 10. The Dow Jones E-mini slipped 5 points, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini declined 57 points and 7 points, respectively.\nLater on Tuesday, US retail sales figures will reflect consumer sentiment. Economists forecast retail sales will rise 0.4% month-on-month in December after a 0.6% increase in November. Rising retail sales would support the positive economic outlook and ease concerns that a weaker labor market would impact domestic demand.\nWith retail sales in focus and uncertainty about the labor market, traders should closely monitor FOMC members\u2019 speeches. FOMC voting members Beth Hammack and Lorie Logan are slated to speak. Their views on inflation, the US economy, and rate cuts are also likely to influence sentiment.\nBeyond the US economic calendar, the earnings calendar also warrants consideration. Coca-Cola (KO) and Ford Motor Company (F) are among the big names to release earnings results. Given that these are retail-focused companies, their outlooks will give further clues on the demand backdrop. Upbeat earnings and positive outlooks would likely boost demand for risk assets.\nDespite a two-day winning streak, the morning pullback left the Nasdaq 100 E-mini trading below its 50-day EMA, while holding above its 200-day EMA. The EMA positions indicated a bearish near-term, but bullish longer-term outlook. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini remained above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs, signaling a bullish bias, aligning with positive fundamentals.\nNear-term trends will hinge on geopolitical risks, earnings, US economic indicators, and central bank chatter. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term price outlook is cautiously bullish. Meanwhile, bets on an H1 2026 Fed rate cut and positive sentiment toward broader Q4 earnings reinforce the bullish medium-term outlook. These positive fundamentals align with longer-term technicals for US index futures.\nHowever, several events would derail the bullish medium-term outlook, including:\nIn summary, rising bets on Fed rate cuts, robust earnings, and a cautiously hawkish BoJ reinforce the medium-term outlook for US s"

                "body": "S&P 500, Dow Jones futures tick lower ahead of key US data week\nUS equity futures edged lower early Monday as investors prepared for a week dominated by economic data, Federal Reserve commentary, and fresh corporate earnings.\nThe cautious tone followed a volatile period in which markets rebounded sharply at the end of last week, led by a surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nS&P 500 futures fell 0.22%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.44%.\nFutures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 42 points, or 0.08%, after the blue-chip index achieved a major milestone during Friday\u2019s session.\nFutures soften after Dow milestone\nFriday\u2019s rebound helped restore confidence after a tech-led selloff earlier in the week.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1,206 points, or about 2.47%, closing above 50,000 for the first time.\nThe S&P 500 rose about 2%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained more than 2%.\nThe earlier downturn had been driven by weakness in software stocks and broader concerns surrounding the technology sector.\nBitcoin also tumbled during the risk-off move before recovering, climbing back above $70,000 after briefly falling below $61,000 late Thursday.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading around $69,000, down 2.33% in the last 24 hours.\nTechnology shares showed signs of stabilization.\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF jumped 3.5% Friday, its first positive session since entering bear-market territory late last month.\nPremarket trading also indicated modest gains in software companies, including Datadog, CrowdStrike, and ServiceNow.\nEconomic data and Fed outlook in focus\nInvestors now turn their attention to macroeconomic releases and central-bank signals.\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials, including Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran, are scheduled to speak on Monday, with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic also expected to deliver remarks.\nThe key focus arrives midweek with the delayed January jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe release was postponed by the partial government shutdown.\nEconomists surveyed by Dow Jones expect payrolls to rise by 55,000 after ADP data showed private payroll growth of only 22,000.\nInflation data follows on Friday, with the January consumer price index expected to show a 2.5% annual rate.\nBoth reports are seen as critical for shaping expectations around interest-rate cuts, with markets currently pricing a potential reduction around June.\nEarnings and sector rotation ahead\nCorporate earnings will also help determine market direction.\nCoca-Cola and Ford Motor are scheduled to report on Tuesday, while companies including Kyndryl, Becton Dickinson, Apollo Global Management, and Loews are due before the bell on Monday.\nSoftware firms AppLovin and Datadog will report later in the week.\nThe rotation away from technology shares may continue depending on results and guidance, especially as investors assess heavy artificial-intelligence capital expenditure plans by large technology companies.\nNvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings later this month are expected to serve as another major test for AI-related valuations.\nMeanwhile, broader market breadth has improved. Small-cap stocks, represented by the Russell 2000, also benefited from the recent rotation into other sectors.\nFor now, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode.\nStrong earnings, encouraging economic data, and clearer signals from the Federal Reserve could support further gains \u2014 but without renewed leadership from technology stocks, investors remain cautious about the durability of the rally."

                "body": "UK markets digest political turmoil as Starmer faces pressure\nSterling weakens and gilts sell off as Westminster drama returns, but equities rally on global risk appetite and firmer commodity prices.\nPolitical uncertainty drives bond and currency moves\nUnited Kingdom (UK) government bonds sold off as investors reassessed political risk following the resignation of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's chief aide. Gilt yields rose around 2 basis points across the curve, reflecting renewed concerns about stability in Westminster.\nSterling bore the brunt of the political jitters, falling to its weakest level against the euro since January. The British pound dropped approximately 0.5% against the single currency, while also slipping modestly against the United States (US) dollar.\nThe moves extend recent losses for sterling, which had already weakened following a more dovish stance from the Bank of England (BoE). Combined with domestic political uncertainty, the currency faces multiple headwinds.\nBetting markets now assign a greater than 70% chance that Starmer leaves office by year-end. This speculation adds another layer of uncertainty for UK assets, though the reaction has been relatively measured compared to previous political crises.\nFTSE 100 rallies despite domestic headwinds\nUK equities shrugged off domestic concerns, with the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 both posting gains in line with broader European markets. The rally was driven by a risk-on global backdrop and firmer commodity prices.\nMiners led the advance as metal prices strengthened, providing support to the resource-heavy FTSE 100. Banks also contributed to the gains, while defence stocks benefited from continued geopolitical tensions and elevated spending commitments.\nThe disconnect between currency weakness and equity strength highlights the international nature of the FTSE 100. With around 75% of revenues earned overseas, a weaker British pound can actually boost profits for many constituents when translated back into sterling.\nThe FTSE 250, more exposed to the domestic economy, also rallied despite the political noise. This suggests investors are looking through near-term Westminster drama and focusing on broader market drivers including interest rate expectations and corporate earnings.\nNatWest deal sparks shareholder concerns\nNatWest shares fell sharply after the bank agreed to acquire wealth manager Evelyn Partners for \u00a32.7 billion. The deal represents NatWest's largest acquisition in over a decade and marks a significant strategic shift into wealth management.\nAnalysts flagged potential pressure on near-term share buybacks as the bank digests the acquisition. NatWest has been returning capital to shareholders through buybacks funded by the government's ongoing stake reduction, a programme that may now face disruption.\nDespite the strategic fit, the market reaction suggests concerns about execution risk and the premium paid. Wealth management deals have a mixed track record in banking, with integration challenges often proving more difficult than anticipated.\nThe acquisition adds approximately 186,000 clients with \u00a358 billion in assets under management. While this expands NatWest's footprint in the attractive wealth segment, investors will need convincing that the price tag represents value.\nLabour market shows tentative signs of stabilisation\nA hiring survey provided early signs that the UK labour market downturn may be easing, despite higher employment costs. Permanent recruitment continues to decline, but at the slowest pace in 18 months.\nThe data suggests employers are adapting to elevated wage bills following recent increases in employer National Insurance contributions. While hiring remains subdued, the pace of deterioration has slowed markedly from late 2024.\nThis tentative stabilisation matters for BoE policy. The central bank has expressed concern about wage growth and employment costs, viewing them as key determinants of inflation persistence.\nHowever, a single su"

Sign up for free now\nVibe Check: The DAX 40 is in classic European drama mode: no clean trend, but a tense, edgy phase where every ECB headline and macro print can flip the mood instantly. Think choppy swings, fake breakouts, and constant tug-of-war between cautious institutional money and aggressive dip buyers hunting opportunity. The index has been moving in a broad, volatile zone rather than a clear trend, with both rallies and pullbacks repeatedly fading. German bulls are trying to defend key zones, but bears are still very much alive and waiting for weak data to hit the tape.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh DAX breakdowns from real traders on YouTube\n- Scroll the latest German stock market mood on Instagram\n- Swipe through viral DAX trading setups on TikTok\nThe Story: What is actually driving this messy DAX environment right now? It all comes down to four big forces: the European Central Bank, the weak German macro picture, the sector rotation inside the index, and global risk sentiment.\n1. ECB Policy: Christine Lagarde is the DJ of this party\nThe ECB is still the main puppet master for the DAX 40. Every press conference, every hint about rates, every comment on inflation and growth hits European equities instantly. Traders are now obsessed with one question: how fast and how far can the ECB cut rates without completely losing control of inflation expectations?\nHere is the logic chain you need to watch:\n- Inflation vs. Growth: Eurozone inflation has cooled compared to the peak, but it is not fully tamed. At the same time, Germany is flirting with stagnation or shallow recession. That puts the ECB in a brutal dilemma: cut too slowly, and you crush growth further; cut too fast, and you risk reigniting inflation.\n- Impact on DAX valuations: Lower rates support higher equity valuations, especially for growth-heavy names like SAP and some industrial tech plays. But if rate cuts come in response to ugly growth data, the market can actually sell off on cuts because it screams: \\\"things are worse than we thought\\\".\n- Euro vs. US Dollar: The EUR/USD pair is a stealth driver of DAX performance. A weaker euro makes German exports more competitive globally, which is good for exporters like automakers and industrials. But it also signals weaker confidence in Europe and can scare off some international capital.\nSo the current setup: traders are betting on a gradual easing cycle from the ECB, but with huge uncertainty about timing and size. That uncertainty fuels exactly the kind of choppy, fake-out rich environment we see on the DAX: rallies on dovish headlines, then sharp reversals when data disappoints.\n2. Sector Check: Autos under pressure, Tech and Industrials carrying the flag\nThe DAX 40 is not a meme index; it is a heavy, old-school European benchmark with a big exposure to cyclical and export-driven sectors. Inside that, you have two completely different worlds right now:\n- German Autos (VW, BMW, Mercedes-Benz): This is where the pain is. The traditional German auto complex is fighting a multi-front war:\n- Global EV competition from China and the US.\n- Massive capex needs for electrification and software.\n- Regulatory pressure on emissions in Europe.\n- Margin pressure from discounts and tough pricing environments.\n- SAP and the Digital Backbone: SAP is the cool kid at the DAX party. Software, cloud, recurring revenues \u2013 this is what global investors want to hold in a world driven by data and AI. When global tech is strong, SAP often stabilizes the index. Any sign of better guidance, cloud growth, or margin expansion can spark "

The index has been swinging between important zones, with rallies getting faded and sell-offs getting bought. Translation: the market is undecided, but that indecision is exactly where the best risk-reward setups are born.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch deep-dive DAX 40 chart breakdowns on YouTube\n- Scroll through Instagram moodboards of German stock market trends\n- Swipe viral TikTok plays from DAX day traders\nThe Story: Right now, the DAX 40 is basically a live referendum on three things: ECB policy, German industrial strength, and global risk appetite for Europe. Forget the noise for a second and zoom out: this index is a mashup of old-economy exporters (autos, chemicals, industrials) and a smaller but powerful tech/soft-IT component (think SAP), all priced in euros and heavily influenced by what the European Central Bank does next.\n1. ECB Policy & the Euro/USD \u2013 Why Every DAX Trader Is Secretly a Central Bank Watcher\nThe European Central Bank sits at the core of the current DAX narrative. Whether Christine Lagarde sounds more hawkish or dovish in the next press conference can swing German blue chips hard, because it affects:\n- Financing costs for German corporates\n- The euro exchange rate versus the US dollar\n- Global risk sentiment toward Europe versus the US\nIf the ECB leans cautious and keeps rates elevated for longer to fight sticky inflation, that acts like a slow brake on the German economy. Higher borrowing costs pressure cyclicals, autos, and real estate. At the same time, a relatively firm euro can blunt the export advantage of German giants selling into dollar- or emerging-market economies.\nIf the ECB hints at more dovishness, the opposite dynamic kicks in: cheaper capital, more breathing room for heavily leveraged sectors, and a potentially softer euro that makes German exports more competitive. That combo is exactly what DAX bulls want: looser financial conditions plus a currency tailwind.\nThe euro/USD correlation matters because a weaker euro often supports DAX-listed exporters by boosting foreign revenues in euro terms. But it is not linear and not instant. Traders watch:\n- ECB press conferences and forward guidance\n- Inflation prints in the euro area\n- US Fed policy, because a more aggressive Fed versus a cautious ECB can slam the euro\nRight now, markets are in a tug-of-war about whether Europe is heading toward a softer landing or a drawn-out stagnation phase. This is why the DAX feels like it is repeatedly knocking on resistance zones, then getting slammed back by profit taking each time an ECB headline spooks traders.\n2. Sector Check: Autos Struggling While SAP and Siemens Try to Carry the Flag\nThe DAX is not a pure tech index like the Nasdaq. It is more like an old-school, export-heavy, industrial-flavored benchmark with a sprinkle of modern tech. That matters, because the internal rotation inside the index is huge right now.\nGerman Auto Industry: From Global Kings to Macro Punching Bag\nThe big auto names \u2013 Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz \u2013 are under structural and cyclical pressure at the same time:\n- EV Transition: Massive capex needs, margin pressure, and intense competition from Chinese EV makers.\n- Demand Uncertainty: Slowing global growth and high financing costs are not great for selling premium cars.\n- Regulation: Emiss"

No clean breakout, no full-on meltdown \u2013 just a choppy, emotional tug-of-war between stubborn bulls betting on a European recovery and cautious bears pointing at weak German data. Think edgy sideways action with fast swings, where every headline about the ECB, energy, or autos sparks another wave of aggressive buying and panic selling.\nWant to see what people are saying? Check out real opinions here:\n- Watch fresh DAX 40 breakdowns and live trade recaps on YouTube\n- Scroll Instagram reels to feel the hype around German blue chips\n- Binge viral TikToks from traders flipping DAX moves in real time\nThe Story: What is actually driving this German beast right now? Let\u2019s zoom out.\nAt the core of the DAX narrative stands the European Central Bank. After one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in its history, the ECB is now in a tricky transition phase. Rates are high enough to cool inflation, but they are also squeezing already fragile growth in Germany \u2013 the export powerhouse of Europe. Traders are obsessed with every single word from Christine Lagarde and the Governing Council, because the next steps in monetary policy could decide whether the DAX sees a renewed upside push or slips into a deeper correction.\nHere\u2019s the tension:\n- If the ECB stays tough and keeps rates elevated for too long, financing conditions for German companies remain tight. That\u2019s a direct headwind for highly cyclical and capital-intensive sectors like autos, chemicals, and traditional industry. In that environment, investors tend to punish economically sensitive stocks and hide in defensives or mega-cap quality like SAP and some healthcare names.\n- If the ECB clearly signals a softer stance and opens the door for future cuts, the market can flip into risk-on mode quickly. German and European blue chips, which have been stuck in hesitant sideways patterns, suddenly get permission to rally as global funds rotate back into \u201cunderdog\u201d markets trading at a discount versus U.S. tech-heavy indices.\nThe Euro / USD exchange rate adds another layer. A softer euro can be a secret weapon for the DAX: it makes German exports cheaper on the global stage, boosting revenue translation for multinational giants listed in the index. But a very weak euro at the same time screams concern about the European growth outlook, so there is a double-edged sentiment effect.\nRight now, the market is in this strange middle zone:\n- Not a euphoric bull market like early-stage rallies.\n- Not a full catastrophic meltdown either.\n- More like tactical positioning, short-term trading, and quick profit taking on every spike.\nECB press conferences have basically turned into live trading events for the DAX. One hawkish sentence, and you see a sharp intraday selloff. One dovish nuance, and suddenly futures squeeze higher as algos and day traders pile in. That\u2019s why for short-term players, the DAX is a paradise of volatility \u2013 but for investors without a clear plan, it can feel like a psychological pressure cooker.\nOn the ground, German macro data is far from inspiring. Manufacturing PMIs have been stuck in contraction territory for long stretches, painting a picture of weak incoming orders, hesitant global demand, and cautious investment. Germany, once the textbook export machine, now looks like a patient in rehab: not dead, but definitely not fully back on its feet.\nCombine that with elevated energy costs compared to pre-crisis years, and you get the dilemma: the macro story is gloomy, but the equity market refuses to fully collapse because"

                "body": "Investors were disappointed by Coffee Holding Co., Inc.'s (NASDAQ:JVA ) latest earnings release. We did some analysis, and found that there are some reasons to be cautious about the headline numbers.\nExamining Cashflow Against Coffee Holding's Earnings\nIn high finance, the key ratio used to measure how well a company converts reported profits into free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio (from cashflow). In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow.\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\nOver the twelve months to October 2025, Coffee Holding recorded an accrual ratio of 0.25. Unfortunately, that means its free cash flow fell significantly short of its reported profits. Over the last year it actually had negative free cash flow of US$5.9m, in contrast to the aforementioned profit of US$1.40m. We saw that FCF was US$5.1m a year ago though, so Coffee Holding has at least been able to generate positive FCF in the past. One positive for Coffee Holding shareholders is that it's accrual ratio was significantly better last year, providing reason to believe that it may return to stronger cash conversion in the future. Shareholders should look for improved cashflow relative to profit in the current year, if that is indeed the case.\nNote: we always recommend investors check balance sheet strength. Click here to be taken to our balance sheet analysis of Coffee Holding.\nOur Take On Coffee Holding's Profit Performance\nCoffee Holding didn't convert much of its profit to free cash flow in the last year, which some investors may consider rather suboptimal. Because of this, we think that it may be that Coffee Holding's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power. Sadly, its EPS was down over the last twelve months. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example, Coffee Holding has 3 warning signs (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) we think you should know about."

ALEX WROBLEWSKI | AFP via Getty Images\nThe leader of the political engine behind Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Make America Healthy Again movement plans to favor candidates endorsed by President Donald Trump in this year\u2019s elections.\nMAHA will work with candidates Trump supports to get \u201cthe best possible outcome for public health, for the issues that MAHA has been backing over the last year,\u201d said Tony Lyons, president of the political group MAHA Action, at an event held by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington Monday.\nLyons\u2019 commitment indicates that Kennedy and his movement don\u2019t plan to operate as an independent political force, but rather will seek to ensure Republican primary candidates championed by Trump have an easy path to nomination. Kennedy also spoke at the Heritage event.\nLyons pointed to MAHA Action endorsing Louisiana Republican Rep. Julia Letlow in her Senate race against Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.).\nThe group endorsed Letlow one day after Trump and committed to spending $1 million to support her campaign against Cassidy.\nA number of other Republicans are vying for the GOP nomination and seeking to appeal to Kennedy backers.\nLouisiana Republican state Sen. Blake Miguez has described himself as a \u201cMAHA leader\u201d and pushed policies favored by Kennedy\u2019s supporters, including a proposed ban on ultraprocessed food in the state\u2019s schools.\nFormer Trump White House aide and Republican Rep. John Fleming has criticized Cassidy for being \u201cresistant to the reforms that RFK Jr. wants to bring\u201d to the childhood vaccine schedule. Those changes included removing a recommendation that kids get annual shots to protect against Covid-19.\nCassidy has said that \u201cchanging the pediatric vaccine schedule based on no scientific input on safety risks and little transparency will cause unnecessary fear for patients and doctors, and will make America sicker.\u201d\nLetlow\u2019s preferences have deviated from Kennedy\u2019s in at least one important case.\nShe won her husband Luke\u2019s seat after he died of Covid at age 41 in December 2020, and then strongly endorsed Covid vaccination. Kennedy has sought to discourage people from getting the shot, claiming it can have dangerous side effects.\nLetlow\u2019s communications director, Matt Smith, said in a statement to POLITICO that the office doesn\u2019t comment on private conversations, \u201cbut Congresswoman Letlow is a huge supporter of the MAHA movement, especially ensuring children have access to healthy foods.\u201d\nLyons said he sees an ally in Letlow.\n\u201cThere really are points of contact with her that are really going to be impressive to the MAHA movement as they get to know her better,\u201d Lyons said.\nThese points include medical freedom, which MAHA advocates say allows people to make their own health decisions, like refusing vaccinations for themselves or their children; serving healthier lunches in schools; and strengthening food-ingredient regulations, according to Lyons.\nLyons said MAHA Action wants to support Trump and Kennedy\u2019s alliance throughout Trump\u2019s term.\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s a really great partnership that we can have with candidates all around the country to help them win, to help preserve this coalition, but also to make them more clear on what the MAHA issues are, what the science is behind them, what the propaganda and censorship in the past has obscured from the public so that they can then message that better and they can win in their races,\u201d Lyons said.\nMAHA activists are targeting Cassidy, a doctor and chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, because of his repeated criticism of Kennedy\u2019s vaccine policy changes.\nCassidy also ran afoul of Trum"

Instead of coming from the east, the winds will come from the ocean and provide a cooler air mass, he said.\n\u201cIt is very typical for us to have these pretty sharp swings,\u201d Kittell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that typical that we have had such a long \u2014 pretty much a full-month \u2014 period with no rain and pretty warm conditions.\u201d\nForecasters said Monday would be the last warm day of the pattern, with highs around 10 degrees above normal. The coastal and mountain areas will be in the high 60s, and downtown Los Angeles will have a high of 80.\nSeventeen people were arrested after police said a coffee shop in Garden Grove was operating as a \u2018bikini cafe.\u2019\nTemperatures are expected to drop into the 60s on Tuesday and remain there for the rest of the week. There might be a small warm-up Friday, but it will stay pretty cool compared with what Southern California has been experiencing the last few weeks, Kittell said.\nThe lower temperatures are expected to persist into next week, \u201cbecause we have a series of storms headed our way,\u201d he said.\nThe first one will reach the Los Angeles area late Tuesday night and into early Wednesday with light to moderate rain. Expected rain totals are predicted to be anywhere from half an inch to an inch, forecasters say.\n\u201cUsually, that type of rain just gives us issues on the roads, with some increased traffic and maybe some minor flooding on the roads,\u201d Kittell said.\nOn top of the wet conditions, some strong winds will accompany the storm, especially in the mountain areas, where gusts are expected to reach 30 to 50 mph.\nThe weather service issued a high-surf advisory for Ventura County beaches Monday morning because of large breaking waves of 4 to 7 feet with dangerous rip currents. The advisory will remain in effect until Wednesday night.\nA man surfing off Haskell\u2019s Beach in Goleta was found about a quarter-mile offshore after being taken out by rough waves.\nHigh waves have already rocked Santa Barbara County beaches, knocking a 26-year-old surfer off his board Saturday. The man was rescued after he held onto the top of a lobster trap buoy, which prevented him from drifting farther out to sea.\nThis storm also will produce snow for some mountain communities and major roads in elevations above 5,000 feet.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s probably good to avoid the roads traveling through the mountains, if you can, especially Tuesday night,\u201d Kittell said.\n\u201cOnce that storm moves through, we might still see lingering showers on Wednesday night but then we\u2019ll get a break through Saturday,\u201d Kittell said.\nOn Saturday night, a large-scale, slow-moving low-pressure trough will move into the West Coast, bringing rain throughout the area overnight and continuing through most of Sunday.\nTwo or three additional storms are predicted to roll in next week but forecasters have yet to estimate how much rain they will produce and how"

                "body": "A yen nearing 160 to the dollar, record Japanese equities and higher Japanese government bond yields could be on the table after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi romped to a landslide victory in the country's snap election Sunday.\nTakaichi led the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a supermajority in the Lower House, securing 316 seats in the party's largest election victory since World War Two.\nThe result gives her the power to override any legislative veto from the Upper House, strengthening her ability to push her agenda through Japan's legislature.\n'Takaichi Trade' returns\nAnalysts said that her victory will lead to a revival of the so-called \"Takaichi trade,\" which typically involves a weaker yen, rising equities, and higher long-dated Japanese government bond yields. The trend reflects Takaichi's dovish stance on monetary policy and expectations of expanded fiscal stimulus.\nSome early signs of these emerged Monday. The benchmark Nikkei 225 soared past the 57,000 mark to a record high, while the broader Topix rose to an all-time peak of 3,825.67, exceeding Citi analysts' pre-election expectations.\n\"The strong LDP win is warming the hearts of investors,\" said Frederic Neumann, Chief Asia Economist at HSBC. \"Equities, in particular, are celebrating the surprising election result, re-loading the 'Takaichi-trade.'\"\n\"The hope is that the strong majority will give the LDP more leeway in pursuing growth-friendly policies,\" Neumann added.\nThis is echoed by Adrian Wong, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, who said the victory would lead to proactive fiscal measures, such as the two-year consumption tax cut, to increased corporate investment and aggressive corporate reforms.\nDebt concerns linger\nHowever, while most analysts agree on the boost to equities, some warned that heavier spending could pressure bonds and raise bond yields. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose 4 basis points to 2.27% on Monday.\nBefore the election, Takaichi had announced a record 122 trillion yen budget for the financial year starting April 1, marking a second straight year of record spending.\nJapan is the most indebted nation in the world, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of almost 230% in 2025, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.\nTakaichi told national broadcaster NHK after the election that she was pursuing \"a shift in economic and fiscal policy and a 'responsible, proactive fiscal policy.''\n\"We will move forward with areas where we can, and will call for cooperation from the opposition parties in areas where we can gain their support,\" she added, according to a Google translation.\nCarlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at Swiss private bank UBP, expects the 10-year yield to reach 2.5%, with most of the pressure concentrated at the ultra-long end of the yield curve.\nOthers were more cautious. Sree Kochugovindan of Aberdeen Investments said the LDP landslide does not entitle Takaichi \"free rein to just spend.\"\n\"The LDP is fiscally conservative, and Takaichi has been very mindful of bond investors,\" the senior research economist noted.\nJapan's debt-to-GDP ratio has declined since the pandemic, he said, and Takaichi's latest fiscal and economic package will keep it on that downward trend.\nTakaichi said the amount of newly issued government bonds is expected to be 29.6 trillion yen, marking the second consecutive year that issuance remains below 30 trillion yen.\nYen headed the opposite way\nHowever, in an uncharacteristic move, the yen strengthened 0.4% to trade at 156.55 against the dollar after Takaichi's electoral victory.\nMichael Wan, senior currency analyst at MUFG, wrote in a note Monday that the move likely reflected continued commitment by Takaichi on fiscal sustainability in her post-election comments, as well as comments from Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama supporting yen stability, in coordination with U.S. authorities.\nKatayama reportedly said that she would communicate with financial markets "
