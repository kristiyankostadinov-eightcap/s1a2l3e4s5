The yellow metal is up nearly 40% year-to-date, securing its fifth straight weekly gain. The rally has been powered by aggressive central bank accumulation, renewed safe-haven flows, and a Federal Reserve pivot that reduced real yields while amplifying inflation risks. The market now watches whether bullion can clear resistance at $3,740\u2013$3,800 to confirm the next bullish leg.\nFed Rate Cuts and Inflation Concerns Define Trajectory\nThe Fed\u2019s 25 basis-point cut this week created a fresh bid for gold, though policymakers signaled caution. Futures markets price an additional quarter-point cut in October and another by December, with early 2026 also in play. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned of fragility in the labor market, but traders view extended easing against sticky inflation as fuel for higher bullion. This policy mix has revived investor demand for non-yielding assets, reinforcing gold\u2019s momentum above $3,600.\nTechnical Landscape: $3,630 Support and $3,740\u2013$3,800 Resistance\nAfter being rejected above $3,700, gold retreated to test $3,630, where buying interest surged. The 21-day moving average at $3,415, the 50-day at $3,376, and the 100-day at $3,349 all show the uptrend is firmly intact. Momentum indicators point to consolidation, with RSI cooling from overbought levels at 75.89 and MACD signaling a near-term bearish cross. Analysts argue that a decisive daily close above $3,710 would unlock a push toward $3,740 and potentially $3,800, while failure to defend $3,630 could spark a correction to $3,580 or deeper toward $3,500.\nDollar Rebound Creates Short-Term Volatility\nGold faced a $70 pullback after the U.S. dollar briefly rebounded on stronger-than-expected jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey. However, the recovery in the greenback remains capped, as markets are already pricing aggressive easing. Every dip toward $3,630 has been met with strong institutional demand, confirming gold\u2019s resilience as the preferred hedge in this policy cycle.\nCentral Bank Purchases and Supply-Side Moves Reshape the Market\nEmerging market central banks continue to diversify away from the U.S. dollar, purchasing bullion at an unprecedented pace. On the corporate side, Newmont divested its $439 million stake in Orla Mining, Minera Alamos raised $98 million for acquisitions, and Perpetua Resources secured federal approval for its Stibnite project, expected to supply 35% of U.S. antimony demand. These shifts highlight tightening supply dynamics across the mining sector that reinforce gold\u2019s structural bull case.\nRead More\n-\nPPA ETF Nears Record $152 as Defense Spending Soars Past $2.5 Trillion\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Surge to $2.8B as BlackRock Dominates Institutional Demand\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Hits $2.88 as Oversupply and Storage Surge Pressure Market\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - USD to JPY at 147.93 as Fed Cut, Rising U.S. Yields, and BOJ Dissent Drive Volatility\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nInstitutional Buy Zone Confirmed at $3,634\u2013$3,636\nTechnical studies including Gann cycles and Square of 9 harmonics place heavy institutional positioning around $3,634\u2013$3,636, aligning with Fibonacci retracements and long-term pivots.

                "body": "Gold IRA Tax Rules (Expert Guide Released)\nWith rising inflation and geo-economic uncertainty, gold IRAs are becoming increasingly popular. IRAEmpire has released their new guide on Gold IRA tax rules to help consumers understand them better.\nSALT LAKE CITY, September 20, 2025 (Newswire.com) - IRAEmpire has released a new guide on Gold IRA tax rules to help consumers.\nFor many Americans, planning for retirement has become more challenging in today's uncertain economic and political climate. Rising inflation, mounting federal debt, and the constant volatility of Wall Street have left conservative investors searching for a reliable way to protect their hard-earned savings. One option gaining popularity is the Gold IRA, a retirement account backed by physical precious metals like gold and silver.\nCheck Out the Best Gold IRA Companies List to Learn More\nRyan Paulson, Chief Editor at IRAEmpire, says, \"Unlike paper assets that can be shaken by market swings or government policies, gold has stood the test of time as a safe-haven asset. For those who value financial independence, limited government control, and protecting family wealth, a Gold IRA offers both peace of mind and potential tax advantages.\"\nFind the Best Gold IRA Company of Your State Here.\nWhat Is a Gold IRA?\nA Gold IRA is a type of self-directed individual retirement account (SDIRA) that allows you to hold physical precious metals-such as gold, silver, platinum, or palladium-inside your retirement portfolio. Unlike traditional IRAs or 401(k)s that focus on paper assets like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, a Gold IRA gives you the ability to own tangible, IRS-approved bullion or coins.\nWhat makes this especially appealing for conservative investors is the independence it provides. Instead of being tied entirely to Wall Street's ups and downs-or relying on the federal government to maintain the value of the U.S. dollar-a Gold IRA lets you diversify into a hard asset with intrinsic value.\nSome key features of a Gold IRA:\nSelf-Directed: You (with the help of a custodian) choose what assets to include.\nPrecious Metals Only: Not all metals or coins are allowed-only those meeting IRS standards.\nCustodian Required: Federal law requires that your metals be held by an IRS-approved custodian or depository-not stored in your home safe.\nBy adding physical gold to your retirement account, you're taking a step toward financial sovereignty, shielding your nest egg from inflation, reckless government spending, and market manipulation.\nAccess the Gold IRA Tax Rules Guide on IRAEmpire.\nIRS Rules for Gold IRAs\nWhile a Gold IRA can be a powerful tool for protecting retirement wealth, it comes with strict IRS rules that must be followed. Knowing these regulations up front will help you stay compliant and avoid costly mistakes.\nEligible Precious Metals\nThe IRS only allows certain types of metals inside a Gold IRA. These include:\nGold: Must be at least 99.5% pure.\nSilver: Must be at least 99.9% pure.\nPlatinum & Palladium: Must be at least 99.95% pure.\nThis means only specific bullion bars and coins (like American Gold Eagles or Canadian Maple Leafs) qualify. Collectible or numismatic coins are not permitted.\nStorage Requirements\nYou cannot store IRA-owned gold at home or in a personal safe. The IRS requires that all metals be held by an approved custodian or depository. This ensures security and compliance with federal tax law.\nCustodianship\nA Gold IRA must be opened and managed through a custodian-typically a bank, credit union, or specialized trust company. These custodians handle the administrative work, reporting, and coordination with the depository.\nProhibited Transactions\nThe IRS prohibits self-dealing with your IRA. That means you cannot:\nBuy gold from yourself or sell IRA gold to yourself.\nUse IRA-owned gold for personal benefit (e.g., displaying coins in your home).\nBreaking these rules could trigger immediate taxation and penalties on your entire account.\nBy following these IRS regu"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - EUR to Dollar Slips 1.1747 as Fed Cut, Rising Yields, and French Political Unrest Shake Euro\nWith U.S. Treasury yields above 4.14% and protests weighing on Macron, EUR/USD faces support at 1.1675\u20131.1686 while upside hinges on 1.1850\u20131.1918 resistance | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Faces Pressure as Dollar Rebounds on Fed Cut and Rising Yields\nThe EUR/USD pair trades around 1.1747, slipping 0.32%, as the U.S. dollar staged a rebound following the Federal Reserve\u2019s 25 basis-point cut. Despite easing policy, Treasury yields surged, with the 10-year benchmark moving above 4.14%, reviving dollar strength. This resembles the late-2023 pattern, where the Fed\u2019s cuts initially pushed the dollar down, only for longer-term yields to trigger a recovery. The euro\u2019s failure to sustain highs above 1.1800 reflects a market reassessment that the U.S. remains relatively stronger than the eurozone in terms of growth and yield advantage.\nEuropean Political Risk Adds to EUR/USD Volatility\nThe euro faced additional downside as French protests over fiscal tightening pressured investor confidence. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s new prime minister faces resistance to spending cuts, complicating fiscal stability just as the ECB signaled an end to its disinflationary phase. Political unrest in the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy is reinforcing the narrative that euro strength may be capped, especially against a U.S. dollar backed by higher yields.\nFed Officials Mixed, Market Bets Lean Toward More Cuts\nComments from Fed officials highlighted divergence. Mary Daly stressed the need to support a softening labor market, while Neel Kashkari warned that inflation could return toward 3% if tariffs persist. Governor Stephen Miran stood apart, opposing deeper cuts and signaling comfort with a neutral policy rate. Futures markets, however, price nearly a 90% chance of another 25 bps cut in October and an 80% probability of another by December, a backdrop that leaves EUR/USD traders weighing short-term downside against longer-term dollar weakness.\nTechnical Structure: EUR/USD Support and Resistance Levels\nThe euro-dollar pair is anchored by critical supports. The 1.1748 level has held multiple tests, while deeper cushions lie at 1.1675\u20131.1686, aligned with the 100-day moving average. Failure to defend those levels could expose 1.1560\u20131.1574, a confluence of August swing lows and the 200-day SMA. On the upside, EUR/USD must reclaim 1.1800\u20131.1850 to restore momentum, with the year-to-date high at 1.1918 serving as the next bullish objective. The recent \u201cevening star\u201d formation on daily charts suggests bears are probing, but RSI remains clear of overbought territory, showing room for a rebound if macro drivers align.\nMacro Divergence Between Fed and ECB Defines Trend\nThe Fed\u2019s \u201crisk management cut\u201d contrasts sharply with Christine Lagarde\u2019s tone at the last ECB meeting, where she declared the disinflationary process largely over and projected confidence in eurozone stability. That divergence sets up a tug-of-war: U.S. easing weakens the dollar structurally, but Europe\u2019s political unrest and slower growth undercut the euro. The eurozone\u2019s producer prices, falling -2.2% YoY versus expectations of -1.7%, highlight the lack of inflationary pressure compared to the U.S., where fiscal policy and tariffs risk reaccelerating price pressures.\nRead More\n-\nPPA ETF Nears Record $152 as Defense Spending Soars Past $2.5 Trillion\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Surge to $2.8B as BlackRock Dominates Institutional Demand\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Hits $2.88 as Oversupply and Storage Surge Pressure Market\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - USD to JPY at 147.93 as Fed Cut, Rising U.S. Yields, and BOJ Dissent Drive Volatility\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart Signals Market Indecision\nWeekly price action in EUR/USD shows repeated failures from "

                "body": "The euro's holding its ground against the dollar, and the charts are telling a pretty clear story. We're seeing a classic range play developing, with buyers gearing up for what looks like another push higher. The technical setup suggests we're about to test some key levels that could determine where this pair heads next.\nMarket Forces at Play\nThe dollar's been softening lately as traders bet on cooler inflation numbers and potential Fed rate cuts down the road. Meanwhile, the ECB's been playing it cautious but steady, which is giving the euro some decent support. The technical picture backs this up too - when you see clean breaks above resistance like we did with that buy-side liquidity sweep, it usually means the momentum is real. As @Ib_Forex01 noted, the bias definitely favors testing that range high before any meaningful pullback happens.\nIf EUR/USD can close convincingly above 1.1760, we're probably looking at a run toward 1.1830 in the near term. But if it can't hold above 1.1700, that bullish structure starts to look shaky and we might see a slide back to 1.1650. Right now though, everything's pointing toward at least one more test of those highs before any serious correction kicks in.\nThe euro looks ready to make another move higher against the dollar, with 1.1760 as the immediate target. A clean break there opens up the path to 1.1830 and keeps the bullish story intact for now.\nChart Breakdown\nEUR/USD is currently sitting at 1.1745 after a solid recovery run. The pair swept through some liquidity around 1.1685, bounced off a fair value gap, and now it's eyeing the range high at 1.1760. If bulls can push through that level, the next major target sits at 1.1830. The downside support is holding at 1.1700, which has been acting as a solid floor recently. What's interesting is how cleanly the price broke above previous buy-side liquidity levels - that's usually a good sign that buyers are still running the show."

                "body": "The ECB needs to lower rates again in December or risk missing its inflation goal, Gediminas Simkus said Friday in Copenhagen.\nThe Lithuanian central bank chief, who sits on the Governing Council, warned that without another cut, price growth could stay stuck below the 2% target.\n\u201cFrom a risk-management perspective, it\u2019s better to cut than not,\u201d Simkus said, calling a December move necessary. \u201cThe inflation target would benefit, the economy would benefit, so we should do it in December and then wait and see.\u201d He made these comments while attending a meeting of European finance chiefs, where monetary policy was at the top of the agenda.\nSimkus made it clear that he thinks inflation risks are tilted to the downside. He said weaker imports from China, a stronger euro, and delayed climate-policy rollouts will keep prices down.\nAnd he didn\u2019t hold back on what\u2019s coming: core inflation already looks soft, wage growth is slowing, and fiscal spending won\u2019t boost demand anytime soon. \u201cOf course there are some upside risks, but those on the downside definitely dominate,\u201d he said.\nSimkus pushes for rate cut while ECB majority digs in\nSimkus is not speaking for most of his colleagues. Since the ECB left the deposit rate at 2% this month, most Council members have shown no rush to cut again.\nChristine Lagarde, the bank\u2019s president, repeated that borrowing costs are in a \u201cgood place\u201d to maintain price stability, a phrase several members have copied in their own remarks. That tone has led economists to walk back earlier bets on more easing. Markets have done the same.\nGreece\u2019s Yannis Stournaras is one of the dovish members who are happy with the current stance. He said the ECB pulled off a \u201csoft landing\u201d and was right to hold rates steady.\nFrance\u2019s Francois Villeroy de Galhau, however, doesn\u2019t think more cuts are off the table. He warned that inflation could slip further in the years ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think how inflation won\u2019t undershoot our target in the medium term,\u201d Francois said. \u201cI\u2019d definitely expect our projection for 2028 to be below 2%.\u201d\nThe most recent ECB forecasts, published in September, put inflation at 1.9% for 2027. The December projections will extend into 2028 for the first time, and will show whether policymakers have really done enough.\nSimkus isn\u2019t convinced they have. He pointed to factors that may weaken inflation pressures even more, including countries dragging their feet on emissions-trading reforms. That, combined with low wage gains and slow fiscal impact, could keep inflation below the target for longer than expected.\nMuller and Centeno say ECB should wait and watch\nStill, not every official is calling for a move. Madis Muller, Estonia\u2019s central bank head, argued there\u2019s no immediate reason to cut again. \u201cFor the time being, with interest rates mildly supportive of growth and inflation where we want it to be, I don\u2019t think we need to do more,\u201d he said, also from Copenhagen. He added that future growth will rely more on domestic demand than outside forces.\nPortugal\u2019s Mario Centeno isn\u2019t in a rush either, but he said the ECB shouldn\u2019t assume things won\u2019t change. \u201cI continue to believe that inflation risks are to the downside because the risks for economic activity are to the downside,\u201d Mario said. \u201cWe are comfortably sitting in a pile of risks. But we mustn\u2019t become too complacent.\u201d\nThe informal Copenhagen gathering wasn\u2019t just about interest rates. Central bankers and finance ministers also made headway on the ECB\u2019s plan for a digital euro.\nThe Eurogroup reached a deal on how to set holding limits for the currency, which the ECB has been pushing as a European response to US-backed stablecoins. Muller said the region needs a real alternative to card payments controlled by American giants like Visa and Mastercard.\nGet $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now"

With Fed easing and BoE trapped by sticky inflation, GBP/USD trades between 1.3332 support and 1.3725 resistance | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Under Pressure After BoE Holds at 4% While Fed Cuts to 4.00\u20134.25%\nThe GBP/USD pair slipped back below 1.3600 and then retreated further toward 1.3466, losing over 0.65% in the session, after the Bank of England opted to keep rates unchanged at 4% in a 7\u20132 vote. The U.S. Federal Reserve meanwhile delivered a 25 bps cut, lowering its target to 4.00\u20134.25%, and signaled as much as 50 bps more easing by year-end. This policy divergence has kept the U.S. dollar firm, with the DXY index climbing above 97.25, while the pound struggles to hold momentum.\nInflation and Wages Keep the BoE Trapped While Fed Turns Dovish\nUK inflation held at 3.8% in August, with core prices up 3.6% year-on-year, far above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. The persistence of price pressures, combined with slowing wage growth, is limiting the central bank\u2019s room to maneuver. Policymakers acknowledged disinflationary progress but stressed that cuts would be gradual and data-dependent. Across the Atlantic, Jerome Powell highlighted labor market weakness as justification for preemptive cuts, with markets now pricing a 92% chance of another Fed reduction in October. This clear divergence is weighing on GBP/USD, which fell nearly 0.71% for the week.\nRetail Sales Surprise Fails to Lift GBP/USD\nUK retail sales excluding fuel rose 0.8% month-on-month in August, well above expectations of 0.3%, following a 0.4% gain in July. Despite stronger-than-expected consumer data, GBP/USD failed to rally, instead extending losses toward a two-week low. Traders remain skeptical of UK resilience, noting that high inflation distorts nominal sales and that consumers may simply be paying more for fewer goods. The inability of positive macro data to support the pound underscores the dominance of monetary policy and political risks in driving sentiment.\nPolitical Turmoil Adds Risk Premium to British Assets\nThe pound\u2019s weakness has coincided with heightened domestic political uncertainty, feeding a risk premium into UK assets. Analysts noted that despite macroeconomic data favoring the UK over the U.S. on wages and hiring, the currency has underperformed. GBP/USD\u2019s retreat toward 1.3500 reflects investor caution, as confidence in UK governance and fiscal discipline continues to erode. The FTSE100 has also softened, suggesting broad skepticism across both currency and equity markets.\nTechnical Landscape Shows Key Support and Resistance Levels\nFrom a technical perspective, GBP/USD\u2019s rejection near 1.3725, its highest level since July 2nd, confirms the inability to break the 1.3800 ceiling that has capped rallies since 2022. Initial downside targets sit at 1.3561 and 1.3460, with a break lower opening the path to 1.3332 and possibly 1.3140. Longer-term charts show that the rise from 1.3051 (2022 low) toward 1.3787 may have completed, with the current move forming the third leg of a corrective pattern. A decisive move below the 55-week EMA at 1.3146 would confirm medium-term bearishness. On the upside, reclaiming 1.3725\u20131.3800 is critical for any sustainable recovery.\nRead More\n-\nPPA ETF Nears Record $152 as Defense Spending Soars Past $2.5 Trillion\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Surge to $2.8B as BlackRock Dominates Institutional Demand\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Hits $2.88 as Oversupply and Storage Surge Pressure Market\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - USD to JPY at 147.93 as Fed Cut, Rising U.S. Yields, and BOJ Dissent Drive Volatility\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nComparisons with EUR/GBP Highlight Sterling Weakness\nThe cross EUR/GBP climbed toward 0.8710, just 40 points shy of tw"

Despite the cut, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields surged to 4.13%, the highest in two weeks, while 30-year yields climbed to 4.75%, tightening conditions.

Japan still faces a heavy fiscal burden and sticky inflation, but even the hint of a shift put traders on alert. BOJ Governor Ueda remains cautious, but dissent has increased expectations of at least a 25 bp hike into year-end if wage pressures stay firm. That prospect leaves USD/JPY vulnerable if U.S. yields soften simultaneously.\nTechnical Landscape: Support at 145.47 and Resistance at 149.12 in Focus\nTechnically, USD/JPY\u2019s rebound above 145.47 avoided a deeper breakdown. Bulls now eye a move toward 149.12, a resistance that if broken could retest 150.90, last year\u2019s swing high. On the downside, a breach below 145.47 would resume the decline from the 150.90 peak, potentially dragging the pair toward 139.87, where the last corrective wave bottomed. Long-term structure suggests the uptrend from 102.58 (2021 low) remains intact unless the pair breaks decisively below 139.26, the 38.2% retracement of the 2021\u20132024 rally.\nDollar Index Recovery Adds Short-Term Support to USD/JPY\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) staged a rebound from 96.21 to 97.64, boosted by short covering after the Fed\u2019s less dovish tone than markets had priced in. Resistance looms at 98.08\u201398.23, where new dollar selling could re-emerge. For USD/JPY, that means near-term stabilization around 147\u2013148, but the bigger picture still shows dollar softness, especially if yields peak out and fiscal worries deepen.\nGlobal Trade Deals and Macro Headwinds Add Layers to Yen Outlook\nRecent U.S. trade accords with Europe and Japan cut tariffs from 30% to 15% and included a $550B Japanese investment pledge, reducing uncertainty but not reversing Japan\u2019s structural challenges.

                "body": "Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the market\u2019s hero because it is a meme coin and has tons of community support. Heading into Q4 2025, forecasts have DOGE establishing a New ATH above $1. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious momentum MUTM in presale Phase 6 at $0.035, which has already taken in over $16.01 million and has over 16,410 holders.\nThe presale is structured in a manner where the token price will increase with each phase, and the listing rate is $0.06, suggesting early investors can make gigantic profits if the trend continues. While DOGE stands to recover some upside and perhaps challenge new all-time highs if everything unfolds as anticipated, Mutuum Finance is being positioned to have considerably higher upside.\nDogecoin (DOGE) currently stands at $0.2685 with its price fluctuating between support at $0.22-$0.25 and resistance at $0.30. Analyst projections show DOGE going past $1 in the year 2025, with more bullish expectations pointing to it hitting $1.30-$1.50 in case sentiment, macroeconomics, or community momentum all are in its favor. Investors however envision Mutuum Finance possibly offering greater returns than DOGE\u2019s potential in 2025.\nMutuum Finance is in presale stage 6 where it has its token available at $0.035. The campaign has been going at a very fast rate and investors have already raised more than $16.01 million. The project plans to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum blockchain to retain long-term value and make payments easily.\nMutuum Finance is a bi-directional DeFi lending platform of multi-purpose utility, and is favorable to both borrowers and lenders. It is manipulation-resistant and scalable and can be accessed by institutional investors as well as retail investors.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) has strong risk management measures which aim for protocol security at every instance. The protocol is strong in under-collateralized and over-lending over-collateralization liquidation. Mutuum Finance does it via cascading Loan-to-Value ratios, liquidity, liquidation fees, and reserve factors hedging and safeguarding the liquidity of the platform under any market condition.\nInterest rate levied by MUTM is variable and considerably lower compared to the liquidity management. One of the applications in the market is variable interest lending: available money will start lending at lower rates and a lack of liquidity will mean extra charges to support loan repayment and new deposits. It entails that the borrowers will be able to attain fixed rate lending in borrowing and at a favorable rate in comparison to the variable one and only against the very liquid collateral.\nSustained growth via staking, token buys, and scheduled exchange listings are only one of Mutuum Finance\u2019s long-term objectives. It also has an ongoing $100,000 giveaway and guarantees to reward 10 individuals with $10,000 MUTM each.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is soaring in presale, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is hoping to surpass $1 in 2025. While DOGE predictions are aiming for $1.30\u2013$1.50, the presale of MUTM is already gaining huge momentum. While the tokens in Stage 6 are worth $0.035, the listing value is $0.06, giving early investors instant ROI upon launch. The project has surpassed $16.01M raised with 16,410+ holders backed by a USD-pegged stablecoin, robust lending protocol, and $100K community giveaway. With dual lending scalability, robust risk management, and institutional attractiveness, MUTM offers much more upside than DOGE\u2019s lackluster 2025 projections. Purchase tokens immediately before the presale price increases.\nFor more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance"

In this post, Ergo has made claims that HTX demanded $100,000 in marketing fees, and the refusal to pay the fees led to delisting.\nHoskinson offered Ergo a partner chain development in a show of support against the delisting, which aligned with ADA rising 3.81% on Wednesday.

Read our advice disclaimer here.\nTable of Contents\nSurpassing the $US100,000 mark was a huge moment for bitcoin in mid-December 2024, but the April 2025 slump to $US76,200 and recent rebound to an all-time high above $US123,000 have Australian investors asking: what\u2019s next?\nBitcoin\u2019s price is largely driven by supply, demand, competition and sentiment and it is extremely volatile\u2014from the dizzy heights of August it is now, as of mid-September, down to below $US116,000.\nWe\u2019ve looked at how the driving forces behind the price of the world\u2019s number one cryptocurrency might play out in the months ahead and spoken to experts to forecast what might happen to the value of BTC in the remainder of 2025.\nNo matter how thorough the analysis, cryptocurrency prices cannot be accurately predicted. Such is the volatility of crypto that anyone who invests in these assets must be prepared to lose their entire investment.\nFeatured Partners\nCurrent State of Play\nAt the time of writing in September 2025, bitcoin is trading at around $173,000 AUD\u2014down from the $180,000 AUD-plus it saw in August. This puts its market capitalisation at the 3.450 trillion AUD mark.\nPrices started climbing from around the $100,000 AUD mark after US President Donald Trump and the Republican Party\u2019s victories in the 2024 US elections, with investors looking forward to a new pro-crypto, anti-regulation government.\nPrices continued to rise through inauguration day in late January this year, peaking at around $169,000 AUS on January 19.\nA tumultuous first 100 days for the new president coincided with a slump in bitcoin\u2019s value which saw it fall as low as $126,000 AUD in early March. There was a turnaround in April, however, with prices returning to pre-slump levels.\nSince then, bitcoin\u2019s price has surged again to the levels we see today\u2014although, as is always the case with crypto in general and BTC in particular, the price movements never track a smooth line, and no gain can be taken for granted: short-term volatility is one of the defining characteristics of this entire asset class.\n(Two of the others are medium-term volatility and, you guessed it, long-term volatility.)\nSupply\nAlmost 20 million bitcoins have been mined since its inception in 2009. There is a 21 million limit on the number of bitcoins that will be created, but the rate at which new BTC is issued means we\u2019re a long way off yet.\nThat said, the supply of bitcoin held on centralised exchanges, at around 2.4 million, is one million fewer than in 2022, according to CryptoQuant, a crypto data provider. This could indicate a shift towards self-custody, potentially signalling that investors are increasingly looking to hold bitcoin in non-custodial wallets.\nHowever, the loss of bitcoin from exchanges coincides with an increase in bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) holdings, so it could be that available bitcoin is simply moving off exchanges and into ETFs.\nSo-called \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin ETFs hold actual bitcoins, allowing investors to buy into a fund that directly tracks bitcoin\u2019s performance without having to hold the crypto asset themselves.\nUnlike spot ETFs, futures bitcoin ETFs trade contracts that commit to the purchase or sale of physical bitcoin at a stated price at a certain date in the future. They do not hold physical bitcoins.\nThe slight squeeze on the availability of bitcoin only matters if demand changes. Increased demand could put upward pressure on prices.\nDemand\nCoinbase Institutional\u2014the crypto exchange\u2019s dedicated platform for institutional investors\u2014conducted a survey of more than 350 institutional investors on their plans regarding cryptocurrency.\nIts March 2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey found three-quarters expected to increase their allocations to digital assets this year, with 59% planning to allocate more than 5% of assets under management to digital assets.\nIn January, BlackR"

                "body": "USD/JPY faces intensifying volatility as central bank rhetoric and Japanese politics trigger monetary policy and price volatility.\nThe USD/JPY pair advanced 0.21% to close at 147.958 in the week ending September 19. In a choppy week, the pair slid to a low of 145.481 before briefly rebounding to a high of 148.284.\nThe Bank of Japan announced plans to begin offloading its $250 billion holding in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japanese Real Estate Investment Trusts (JREITs) on Friday, September 19. The adjustment signaled a further shift from ultra-loose monetary policy.\nWhile the BoJ kept interest rates at 0.5%, a 7-2 vote split fueled speculation about a near-term rate hike, sending USD/JPY below 148.\nThis week\u2019s economic calendar\u2014services PMI, Tokyo inflation, and BoJ rhetoric\u2014will be key price catalysts for the yen.\nOn Wednesday, September 24, Japanese service sector PMI numbers could affect the timeline for a BoJ rate hike. Economists forecast the S&P Global Services PMI to rise from 53.1 in August to 53.4 in September.\nA higher PMI reading could signal a pickup in momentum, given that the services sector accounts for over 70% of Japan\u2019s GDP. Beyond the headline PMI, the employment and price trends could be pivotal. Rising employment and higher prices may suggest increasing inflationary pressures, supporting a more hawkish BoJ policy stance. Services sector inflation remains a key contributor to national inflation.\nOn the other hand, slower services sector activity, falling employment, and lower prices may temper BoJ rate hike bets, weighing on yen demand.\nOn Friday, September 26, Tokyo inflation will take center stage. Economists expect Tokyo\u2019s annual inflation rate to rise from 2.6% in August to 2.9% in September and the so-called \u2018core-core inflation rate to hit 3.3% (August: 3%). A move further away from the BoJ\u2019s 2% target may raise the chances of an October policy adjustment, boosting appetite for the yen.\nConversely, a lower core-core reading may push back a rate hike until December, or potentially January. A less hawkish rate path may weigh on the yen.\nLast Friday (September 19), the BoJ\u2019s policy announcement hinted at plans to reach monetary policy normalization sooner than expected. Rising inflation may expedite rate hikes, potentially triggering a yen carry trade unwind. A resurgent yen could force investors to sell risk assets and repay yen-denominated debt, sending USD/JPY lower.\nIn July 2024, the BoJ reduced its purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and unexpectedly raised interest rates. A yen carry trade unwind pushed USD/JPY from 155.216 on July 31, 2024, to a September 14, 2024, low of 139.576. A more hawkish BoJ policy stance could have similar effects on USD/JPY trends.\nBookmark our real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY volatility.\nIn the US, it\u2019s another crucial week for the US dollar as markets consider the Fed\u2019s policy stance and upcoming economic data. Services PMI data, jobless claims, GDP, and the Personal Income and Outlays report will influence the Fed rate path and US dollar trends.\nKey events include:\nA sharper fall in services PMI, higher jobless claims, and softer-than-expected inflation could fuel bets on October and December Fed rate cuts. A more dovish Fed rate path could dampen investor appetite for the US dollar.\nConversely, stronger service sector activity, fewer claims, and higher inflation could support a less dovish Fed policy stance through the remainder of 2025. A less dovish Fed rate path could boost demand for the US dollar.\nBeyond the data, traders should closely monitor Fed speeches. Fed Chair Powell is due to speak on Tuesday, September 23. Multiple FOMC members are also on the calendar to deliver speeches.\nUSD/JPY\u2019s near-term outlook will hinge on key economic data and Fed speakers.\nOn the daily chart, the USD/JPY trades above the 50-day and the 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). The indicators suggest a bullish bias.\nA breakout above the September 19 "

Over the past week, the price has inched higher by 1.17%, though on a monthly basis, SOL has gained close to 30%. The driver isn\u2019t just retail speculation but rather unprecedented institutional accumulation. Galaxy Digital alone executed a $306 million purchase, adding 1.2 million SOL in a single day. Within five days, its total haul surpassed 6.5 million tokens, valued at more than $1.55 billion. Pantera Capital, which now allocates 23% of its $4.7 billion AUM into Solana, has made it the fund\u2019s largest crypto bet. Collectively, treasuries across firms like Forward Industries, Helius Medical Technologies, and DeFi Development Corp. exceed 17.11 million SOL, worth over $4 billion.\nETF Approval Creates a Path for Institutional Expansion in SOL-USD\nThe imminent approval of spot Solana ETFs is a structural inflection point. Analysts forecast that ETF-driven flows could push SOL to the $300\u2013$350 range, breaking well past the current $232\u2013$247 intraday band. Critical support has formed at $220\u2013$230, suggesting institutional buyers are ready to absorb dips. With Bitcoin holding $115,824 and Ethereum near $4,489, Solana\u2019s percentage performance continues to outperform major peers in relative terms. Traders view the ETF approval as a validation event that accelerates capital rotation into Layer-1 alternatives beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nTechnical Structure Suggests Pullback Before Higher Highs\nDespite bullish headlines, technical patterns indicate Solana could retrace before mounting its next leg higher. The Fibonacci retracement model points to a correction toward $252 (0.786 Fib) and possibly deeper supports at $195.50, $171.83, and $142.56. Moving Average Ribbon analysis shows short-term averages still trading above longer-term averages, signaling strength, but history suggests a tendency to retest the 20-day SMA, which is hovering close to the $198 zone. The MACD indicator confirms weakening momentum, with both signal and MACD lines trending downward, reinforcing short-term caution.\nOn-Chain Fundamentals: SOL-USD Maintains High Utility\nSolana\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) sits at $12.456 billion, down 2.2% in 24 hours but still the second-largest DeFi ecosystem behind Ethereum. Stablecoin volume on Solana surged to $19.4 billion, a 284% increase, signaling strong transactional demand. This surge highlights Solana\u2019s strength in payments, with daily blockchain throughput consistently exceeding 9 billion transactions\u2014more than the volume of many traditional capital markets combined. These utility metrics reinforce that institutional allocations are not merely speculative but are also tied to Solana\u2019s expanding network effect in DeFi, NFTs, and real-world settlement.\nComparative Returns: Solana (SOL-USD) vs Bitcoin and XRP\nBitcoin dominates headlines with its $115K handle, but its one-week performance was flat at \u20130.01%. Solana, by contrast, gained 0.29%, showing relative resilience even amid technical caution. XRP, trading at $2.98, fell 4.37% in the same period, highlighting divergence within top cryptos. On a year-to-date basis, Solana\u2019s nearly 30% advance places it ahead of XRP\u2019s ~20% appreciation but still trailing Bitcoin\u2019s broader institutional-driven rally. For investors looking at relative strength, Solana is increasingly positioned as the growth leader in the Layer-1 race.\nTreasury Accumulation and Insider Alignment in SOL-USD\nForward Industries\u2019 disclosure of 6.8 million SOL on its balance sheet is emblematic of a broader"

                "body": "The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) closed higher for the third consecutive session on Friday, rising 0.29% to 97.646. The rally followed a reversal bottom at 96.218 \u2014 a multi-year low just under the July 1 bottom at 96.377 \u2014 sparking a wave of short covering as sellers were caught below key support. The Fed\u2019s midweek rate cut, paired with a less aggressive stance on future easing, shifted market sentiment and fueled the rebound.\nDespite the prevailing downtrend, the move suggests short-term momentum may continue higher, with immediate resistance in focus. The 50-day moving average at 98.082 and the 50% retracement level of the recent two-month range at 98.328 form a strong technical barrier. This creates a short-term target zone between 98.082 and 98.238, where new short positions may re-enter the market.\nWhile the Fed delivered the anticipated quarter-point rate cut, the updated \u201cdot plot\u201d projects only two more cuts this year, signaling a slower pace of easing. This contrasts with earlier market expectations of a more aggressive path. Marc Chandler of Bannockburn Forex noted that the market had been pricing in a more dovish Fed, and the less accommodating stance forced a recalibration.\nShort positioning was crowded heading into the decision, with early-week weakness in the dollar suggesting traders expected a clear dovish signal. Instead, the restrained tone prompted a tactical unwind of dollar shorts, fueling the three-day rebound.\nU.S. Treasury yields pushed higher Friday despite the Fed\u2019s easing move. The 10-year yield hit 4.133%, its highest in two weeks, while the 30-year touched 4.75%. This backup in long-dated yields \u2014 counter to the rate cut \u2014 reflects concerns around fiscal deficits, issuance pressure, and modestly firmer inflation. Wells Fargo\u2019s Scott Wren noted that Treasury yields are syncing with higher GDP expectations and signs that inflation is not cooling as quickly as forecasted.\nSterling underperformed on Friday, falling 0.6% to $1.347 as UK borrowing figures surged past expectations, raising concerns over the sustainability of fiscal policy.\nMeanwhile, the yen found modest support after a surprise dissent within the Bank of Japan raised the possibility of earlier rate hikes, though the USD/JPY pair settled near 147.93 after a volatile session.\nWhile the DXY has staged a notable rebound off 96.218, the broader trend remains bearish. The zone between 98.082 and 98.238 \u2014 marked by the 50-day MA and Fibonacci retracement \u2014 is likely to attract renewed selling pressure. With Fed guidance limiting expectations for rapid easing and long-end yields rising, the dollar may consolidate below resistance before resuming lower unless inflation or growth data surprises to the upside.\nIf sellers don\u2019t return following a test of the retracement zone and the rally continues, traders should consider that stronger forces are at work \u2014 and the entire \u201csell the dollar\u201d strategy may be at risk of blowing up under a broad short-squeeze.\nMore Information in our Economic Calendar.\nJames Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Institutional buying interest will likely drive SOL to levels above resistances, possibly to $300-$350 in the next leg of the rally, considering the imminent approval for spot ETFs.\nKey support appears to be standing strong at $220-$230 levels, giving some room for upside as market sentiment picks up. Whereas SOL can potentially gain a lot from capital inflow driven by ETFs, some investors rate newcomer DeFi token Mutuum Finance as having even more percentage upside on the upswing.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is doing great in its sixth presale phase where it is gaining monumental momentum as investors in the market grow interested. Over 16,410 investors have already joined the project and the platform has already achieved the $16.01 million capital milestone. The trend is expected to continue gaining steam. Record-breaking milestones like these are an encouraging sign of increasing confidence of the investors as the platform nears launch.\nIn addition to buying tokens at a lower cost, investors can anticipate massive gains in the long run as the ecosystem continues to grow. Investors are flocking to the project because of its dual lending model, long-term potential, open-source and fully audited codebase, and serious tokenomics.\nMutuum Finance has tried once again in a bid to provide security in its platform by joining forces with CertiK in the release of an official bug bounty program, with a guaranteed reward pool of up to $50,000. The reward is provided in four tiers of severity i.e. critical, major, minor and low in such a way that any weakness can be discovered and removed.\nBy extending the invitation of outside auditing of its website by researchers and developers, Mutuum also invites the latest security features, which is an asset to its investor base security and trust.\nTiered levels of Mutuum Loans to Value and levels of liquidation are determined according to the underlying collateral\u2019s volatility. Reserve multipliers between a 10% level of safer and up to 35% of riskier items constitute the second source of stability. The system is as balanced in terms of access and safety and more market participation becomes possible and systemic risk is kept under control.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the altcoin to keep an eye on as Solana (SOL) sets the stage for ETF-driven profits. Experts believe SOL will climb to $300\u2013$350 once institutional investment through spot ETFs begins, but much of that upside already may be discounted. That leaves MUTM, currently at Stage 6 presale value at $0.035, offering investors significantly higher percentage upside potential. The project has brought in $16.01M+ and has 16,410+ holders, which is a marker of rapid momentum in the run-up to launch.\nWith a dual lending protocol, $50K bug bounty on CertiK, and robust tokenomics, Mutuum Finance brings security, utility, and scalability together to be more than just a short-term trade. For those waiting for outsized returns in the next bull run, MUTM is turning out to be the smarter buy now before Stage 7 propels the price to $0.04.\nFor more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLink"

On September 19 alone, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $223 million, while Ethereum ETFs added $47.8 million, reinforcing demand for regulated exposure even as retail activity slowed.\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT Fund Becomes the Dominant Player\nThe biggest driver remains BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which recorded $246 million in inflows in a single day. Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has taken in $60.6 billion in net flows, representing nearly 75% of all Bitcoin ETF inflows. Its assets under management now stand above $88 billion, cementing its position as the flagship product for institutional exposure. By contrast, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC lost $23.5 million, extending its streak of outflows as capital migrates to lower-fee alternatives.\nEthereum ETFs Record Gains but Rely on BlackRock\u2019s ETHA\nEthereum ETFs saw $47.75 million in inflows, but the entire positive balance was driven by BlackRock\u2019s ETHA fund, which collected $144 million in new money. Competitors such as Fidelity, Bitwise, and Grayscale posted a combined $70 million in outflows, showing that Ethereum ETF demand is highly concentrated around a single issuer. Assets across Ethereum ETFs now total $29.6 billion, representing roughly 5.5% of ETH\u2019s market capitalization at $4,440 per coin.\nBTC-USD Price Holds $115K Despite Heavy Options Expiry\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) trades at $115,760, down from its $124,100 all-time high on August 14, yet still +82% year-over-year. Price action has been tested by the $4.3 billion options expiry on September 20, which created short-term selling pressure. Analysts highlight $115,440 as the critical support, with a break above $117,500 resistance unlocking upside toward $123,280\u2013$137,300. If BTC loses support, potential downside could extend toward $103,000\u2013$105,000.\nFederal Reserve Policy Adds to Market Volatility\nETF inflows arrived during heightened macro uncertainty. The Federal Reserve\u2019s 25 bps rate cut lowered the federal funds rate from 4.50% to 4.25%, releasing liquidity into markets but failing to ignite an immediate BTC breakout. Futures open interest sits at $84.7 billion, with CME contracts down -3.0% in a single session, reflecting cautious positioning among hedge funds despite strong ETF demand.\nPublic Companies Deepen Exposure With $118B in Bitcoin Holdings\nInstitutional adoption now extends far beyond ETFs. Publicly listed firms collectively hold close to $118 billion worth of Bitcoin, tightening available supply and reinforcing BTC\u2019s role as a corporate treasury reserve. This growing layer of locked-up coins, combined with ETF accumulation, is gradually squeezing liquid availability on exchanges.\nRead More\n-\nPPA ETF Nears Record $152 as Defense Spending Soars Past $2.5 Trillion\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nSolana Price Forecast - SOL-USD at $239.75, Galaxy Digital\u2019s $306M Buy and ETF Momentum Push Targets to $300\u2013$350\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Hits $2.88 as Oversupply and Storage Surge Pressure Market\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - USD to JPY at 147.93 as Fed Cut, Rising U.S. Yields, and BOJ Dissent Drive Volatility\n20.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: Shifts in Institutional Focus\nWhile Bitcoin remains the dominant asset with 53.7% market share, Ethereum briefly outpaced BTC on September 18, recording $213 million in inflows versus Bitcoin\u2019s $163 million.

Technical analysis shows mixed signals: Arbitrum\u2019s RSI at 47.47 points to flat momentum, while a bearish MACD divergence may indicate downward risk. The token has slipped to $0.49, staying under key moving averages, as market participants watch to see how the new supply will be absorbed.\nArbitrum\u2019s token distribution is notably intricate. Its release plan, which uses both cliff and vesting mechanisms, has set aside 26.94% of tokens for the Offchain Labs team and advisors, with vesting taking place each month for three years. This unlock is a considerable share of what remains, sparking worries about an oversupplied market. Tokentrack reports the next large unlock will occur on September 23, 2025, when another 1.24% of all tokens will become available for trading. This phased release is intended to support long-term goals and market steadiness, yet may lead to more volatility if the selling mounts.\nDespite these short-term hurdles, Arbitrum\u2019s network fundamentals are solid.

                "body": "Bitcoin remains at the forefront of news stories with analysis remaining positive for a number of months after the 2025 halving. The current market trends, combined with on-chain accumulation and macro indicators, suggest that Bitcoin may soon hit $200K, attracting retail and institutional inflows. In this environment, investors are also looking at certain altcoins to fetch extra upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a token that has emerged on the radars of investors looking for high ROI and scarcity narrative.\nMarket Dynamics and BTC Accumulation\nAfter 2025, a major decrease in the supply of Bitcoin can lead to speculation and increase in price. Recent data from on-chain observations presents increasingly thriving accumulation of the resource through investors compiling their confidence. According to famous analysts, halving cycles give investors opportunities for placing their money in altcoins, which are full of potential. Bitcoin remains a major priority for investors hoping to stay on track with the bull market, including its recent dynamics.\nHigh-Probability Altcoins in the Spotlight\nBitcoin may be the dominant cryptocurrency, however, many other coins have caught the attention of investors who are hoping for an ROI as good as that for Bitcoin. Assets that enhance Bitcoin\u2019s growth are gaining attention as recent network upgrades and partnerships, as well as community adoption that is helping with that. As per Analysts in a post-halving bull market, monitoring liquidity flows, social sentiment and the expansion of the ecosystem are key factors in altcoin selection.\nA High-Potential Breakout Token to Watch\nMAGACOIN FINANCE is a token with a set supply of 170B and a Hashex-audited smart contract. It has the potential to break-out. Investors are increasingly attracted by its scarcity-based narrative, strong communities, and repeat participation of retail and institutional wallets. According to analysts, the on-chain adoption and structured governance of MAGACOIN FINANCE makes it good enough to join Bitcoin and other quality altcoins. The fact that the technology aims to be of use for a long time and is meant for early adopters, makes it attractive for diversification during the next leg of the bull.\nStrategic Outlook and Investment Considerations\nAs Bitcoin holds key support levels, investors weigh the odds between long-term buy-and-hold versus short-term altcoin betting. Historically, after the last halving, things started getting really heated up. Scarcity narrative kicks in. People start leveraging their positions. And of course, everybody starts getting on the network which naturally helps the price climb. So we see out-sized returns during such periods. Including MAGACOIN FINANCE or any other high-potential asset should be part of a diversified strategy to make the most of BTC\u2019s upside as well as any speculative gains from these breakout tokens across the market.\nConclusion\nAnalysts continue to retain a target price of $200,000 for Bitcoin following the halving, since the charts appear to be optimistic going forward. In addition to Bitcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates potential for a strong up side, just like Bitcoin does. With support from the community, it is a token that is driven by scarcity. Additionally, the token\u2019s scarcity guarantees that it will be adopted in the same manner as Bitcoin. As a result of this, investors are able to strategically position themselves for immediate return on investment (ROI) by holding MAGACOIN FINANCE, while also securing their involvement in the long-term digital ecosystem.\nTo learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:\nWebsite: https://magacoinfinance.com\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance\nThis article is not intended as financial advice.

One example Buterin highlighted was deposit rates for stablecoin lending on DeFi protocol Aave, which hover around 5% for blue-chips like Tether (USDT) and USDC (USDC) and above 10% for higher risk stables.\nSimilarly, Buterin noted that Google does many \u201cinteresting and valuable things\u201d \u2014 such as its Chromium family of browsers, Pixel phones, its open-source AI Gemini models, and more \u2014 but the revenue they make from those products is a fraction compared to what it makes through search and advertisements.\nIt comes as the total value locked on Ethereum DeFi recently surpassed $100 billion for the first time since early 2022. DeFi TVL tanked massively across the ecosystem during the 2022-2023 bear market, and TVL figures have largely trailed the performance of top layer 1 tokens this bull market.\nRelated: Ethereum is the \u2018biggest macro trade\u2019 for next 10-15 years: Fundstrat\nHowever, DeFi has picked up lately amid an increase in regulatory momentum, particularly the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which is tipped to push DeFi adoption even further.

But it does need to be something that is at least not actively unethical or not embarrassing.\u201d\nButerin criticized Google\u2019s incentive model, noting that advertising revenue pushes the company to hoard user data, conflicting with its original open-source and positive-sum ethos.\nVitalik advocates for basket currencies, flatcoins\nWhile low-risk DeFi is often about enabling easier access to the US dollar \u2014 particularly those in low-income and high-inflation countries \u2014 Buterin would like to see other innovations that provide economic support to Ethereum.\nButerin pitched the idea of building cryptoassets that track a basket of currencies and flatcoins that are based directly on consumer price indices.\nMagazine: Astrology could make you a better crypto trader: It has been foretold"

                "body": "Imagine a world where decentralized finance is less about high-stakes gambles and more about security, clarity, and trustworthiness. That\u2019s the new reality Ethereum is crafting with its keen pivot toward low-risk DeFi strategies. In a landscape historically dominated by the thrill of unbounded yields, co-founder Vitalik Buterin now calls for an evolution\u2014a call that could redefine our economic future. As we delve into Ethereum's journey towards stability, one pivotal question looms: Can this shift genuinely foster sustainable growth while captivating the interest of institutional players?\nA New Era of Financial Stability\nEthereum is shedding its previous high-risk, high-reward image in favor of a more prudent approach to decentralized finance. Recognizing that sustainability stands at the core of enduring success, the Ethereum community is pivoting towards essential financial mechanisms\u2014payments and savings now take center stage. By focusing on transparency and reliability, Ethereum seeks to create a resilient market environment that resonates with a global audience weary of speculative chaos.\nButerin\u2019s Blueprint for a Trustworthy Future\nIn Vitalik Buterin\u2019s vision, low-risk DeFi is more than a strategic pivot; it\u2019s a commitment to restoring faith in the very foundations of decentralized finance. He asserts, \u201cLow-risk DeFi embodies a return to the original promise of decentralized finance,\u201d underscoring the importance of stability and inclusivity. This isn\u2019t merely a retreat from past follies; it's an intentional redirection towards a more robust economic framework that places trust at its core.\nInstitutional Interest: The Catalyst for Change\nAs Ethereum embraces this low-risk shift, institutional attention is surging. Recent findings from Standard Chartered highlight Ethereum treasuries' remarkable sustainability potential, suggesting a positive trajectory for institutional adoption since mid-2025. Corporations are increasingly recognizing Ethereum as a solid foundation for treasury management, effectively fortifying its role in the marketplace and aiding in the quest for price stability. This institutional faith could be the spark that ignites broader acceptance and participation in the DeFi ecosystem.\nCommunity Engagement Fuels Confidence\nAmid this transformation, the support of the Ethereum community has been unwavering, presenting a united front behind Buterin\u2019s vision. The influx of developers and governance participants reflects an energized commitment to scalability and efficiency, reinforcing this paradigm shift. The data speaks volumes\u2014there\u2019s been a marked increase in unique addresses engaging with the Ethereum network, signaling a rise in investor confidence and enthusiasm for this newfound direction.\nIn Summation\nEthereum's deliberate transition towards low-risk DeFi charts a course for enduring growth, establishing a favorable environment for both institutional players and a burgeoning community. This renewed commitment to financial stability crucially redefines Ethereum\u2019s position in the broader cryptocurrency arena, appealing to users who prioritize trust over speculation. As the DeFi landscape continues its evolution, Ethereum stands poised to become a cornerstone of innovation\u2014ready to inspire confidence and transform financial aspirations. With an eye on the horizon, the Ethereum community is not just participating in a shift; they're crafting a legacy."

Companies are considering Ethereum for everything from treasury diversification to international payments, supply chain improvements, and as a platform for launching decentralized applications. However, investing in Ethereum introduces both exciting possibilities and significant risks. A core factor influencing these decisions is the dynamic Ethereum price USD, which impacts both investment returns and business operations. In this article, we\u2019ll examine the major opportunities and risks businesses face when investing in Ethereum\u2014and how to navigate them effectively.\nWhy Businesses Are Investing in Ethereum\nEthereum is not simply a cryptocurrency\u2014it is a programmable blockchain powering a vast ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and enterprise applications. Businesses see Ethereum as an enabler for:\nTreasury Diversification: Holding ETH allows companies to diversify corporate treasuries beyond fiat currencies, gaining exposure to the potential growth of digital assets.\nOn-Chain Payments: Ethereum facilitates instant, borderless payments and remittances, reducing reliance on banks and even outperforming traditional rails in cost and speed.\nProgrammable Business Logic: Smart contracts allow businesses to automate agreements, royalties, supply chain interactions, and more\u2014often with efficiency gains far greater than legacy systems.\nParticipation in DeFi: By staking or lending ETH, businesses can earn yield on idle assets, borrow against their holdings, and experiment with new capital efficiency strategies.\nFuture Market Positioning: Early movers benefit from learning, partnerships, and brand credibility as the Web3 and blockchain ecosystem expands.\nOpportunities in Ethereum Investment\nCapital Appreciation: The Ethereum price USD has historically seen significant upward swings during periods of network adoption and innovation. Strategic acquisition of ETH can deliver above-market returns, particularly for businesses with conviction in blockchain\u2019s future.\nYield Generation: Companies can participate in Ethereum staking (Proof-of-Stake), DeFi lending, and liquidity provision, earning returns beyond the typical yields found in fiat markets.\nInnovation and Business Growth: Investing in Ethereum signals a commitment to innovation and can serve as a springboard for new product launches, R&D, and collaborative ventures in the fast-moving crypto sector.\nHedge against Fiat Inflation: As inflation concerns grow, ETH holdings may serve as a macro hedge, especially when the Ethereum price USD outpaces the devaluation of local currencies.\nEnhanced Transparency and Security: Blockchain\u2019s immutable ledger ensures all transactions are traceable, reducing risk of fraud and enabling better audit and compliance controls compared to opaque traditional systems.\nRisks Associated with Ethereum Investment\nNo investment is without risks, and Ethereum presents several considerations that businesses must navigate:\nPrice Volatility: The Ethereum price USD is highly volatile, often moving 10% or more within a single day. This can drastically impact the value of holdings, complicate budgeting, and unsettle stakeholders unfamiliar with crypto\u2019s swings.\nRegulatory Uncertainty: The legal status of digital assets is evolving. Rapid regulatory change, tax law revisions, or outright restrictions in certain markets can unexpectedly alter the risk profile or utility of ETH investments.\nSecurity Risks: Holding and transacting in digital assets requires impeccable key management and technological hygiene. Cyberattacks, hacking, and human error can result in irreversible loss, so robust security protocols (such as multi-signature wallets and cold storage) are imperative.\nLiquidity Constraints: While ETH is highly liquid in major markets, large transactions can "

According to the Head of Product Marketing at the Solana Foundation, the next wave of growth will come from Decentralized Autonomous Teams (DATs) that will actively compete\u2014even with the Foundation itself\u2014to build and scale the ecosystem.\nThis marks a significant evolution in how Solana envisions growth: not just from a central authority, but from a wide network of self-organizing teams who are mission-aligned and resourceful.\nWhat Are DATs and Why Do They Matter?\nDATs, or Decentralized Autonomous Teams, are independent groups of builders, marketers, and developers operating on the Solana network. These teams are not controlled by any central body, including the Foundation. Instead, they are funded through grants, DAO voting, or other decentralized means, and they set their own goals to contribute to the ecosystem.\nThe Head of Product Marketing\u2019s recent statement underlines a shift in mindset. \u201cThe largest $SOL DATs will compete with Solana Foundation to efficiently grow the ecosystem with resources,\u201d he said\u2014implying that these teams are not just supporting players, but key drivers of innovation and expansion.\nA Sign of Solana\u2019s Maturing Ecosystem\nThis competition is seen as a healthy sign of decentralization. Rather than one entity dictating the network\u2019s direction, multiple players will now bring ideas, attract developers, and foster adoption. It also ensures that innovation isn\u2019t bottlenecked by centralized decision-making.\nIf the DAT model succeeds, the Solana Foundation may eventually step back, allowing community-led teams to take the lead in ecosystem development. This aligns with Solana\u2019s broader vision of becoming a truly decentralized, scalable blockchain .\nRead Also :\n- Billions Pour Into Bitcoin ETFs in Just 4 Days, While This Hidden Gem Gains Traction\n- BlockDAG Ships 20K+ Miners Across the Globe!

Over the past week, the price has inched higher by 1.17%, though on a monthly basis, SOL has gained close to 30%. The driver isn\u2019t just retail speculation but rather unprecedented institutional accumulation. Galaxy Digital alone executed a $306 million purchase, adding 1.2 million SOL in a single day. Within five days, its total haul surpassed 6.5 million tokens, valued at more than $1.55 billion. Pantera Capital, which now allocates 23% of its $4.7 billion AUM into Solana, has made it the fund\u2019s largest crypto bet. Collectively, treasuries across firms like Forward Industries, Helius Medical Technologies, and DeFi Development Corp. exceed 17.11 million SOL, worth over $4 billion.\nETF Approval Creates a Path for Institutional Expansion in SOL-USD\nThe imminent approval of spot Solana ETFs is a structural inflection point. Analysts forecast that ETF-driven flows could push SOL to the $300\u2013$350 range, breaking well past the current $232\u2013$247 intraday band. Critical support has formed at $220\u2013$230, suggesting institutional buyers are ready to absorb dips. With Bitcoin holding $115,824 and Ethereum near $4,489, Solana\u2019s percentage performance continues to outperform major peers in relative terms. Traders view the ETF approval as a validation event that accelerates capital rotation into Layer-1 alternatives beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nTechnical Structure Suggests Pullback Before Higher Highs\nDespite bullish headlines, technical patterns indicate Solana could retrace before mounting its next leg higher. The Fibonacci retracement model points to a correction toward $252 (0.786 Fib) and possibly deeper supports at $195.50, $171.83, and $142.56. Moving Average Ribbon analysis shows short-term averages still trading above longer-term averages, signaling strength, but history suggests a tendency to retest the 20-day SMA, which is hovering close to the $198 zone. The MACD indicator confirms weakening momentum, with both signal and MACD lines trending downward, reinforcing short-term caution.\nOn-Chain Fundamentals: SOL-USD Maintains High Utility\nSolana\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) sits at $12.456 billion, down 2.2% in 24 hours but still the second-largest DeFi ecosystem behind Ethereum. Stablecoin volume on Solana surged to $19.4 billion, a 284% increase, signaling strong transactional demand. This surge highlights Solana\u2019s strength in payments, with daily blockchain throughput consistently exceeding 9 billion transactions\u2014more than the volume of many traditional capital markets combined. These utility metrics reinforce that institutional allocations are not merely speculative but are also tied to Solana\u2019s expanding network effect in DeFi, NFTs, and real-world settlement.\nComparative Returns: Solana (SOL-USD) vs Bitcoin and XRP\nBitcoin dominates headlines with its $115K handle, but its one-week performance was flat at \u20130.01%. Solana, by contrast, gained 0.29%, showing relative resilience even amid technical caution. XRP, trading at $2.98, fell 4.37% in the same period, highlighting divergence within top cryptos. On a year-to-date basis, Solana\u2019s nearly 30% advance places it ahead of XRP\u2019s ~20% appreciation but still trailing Bitcoin\u2019s broader institutional-driven rally. For investors looking at relative strength, Solana is increasingly positioned as the growth leader in the Layer-1 race.\nTreasury Accumulation and Insider Alignment in SOL-USD\nForward Industries\u2019 disclosure of 6.8 million SOL on its balance sheet is emblematic of a broader"

                "body": "Wall Street's three major stock indexes have been on quite the roller coaster since 2025 began. Shortly after President Donald Trump unveiled his tariff and trade policy following the close of trading on April 2, the broad-based S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.49%), growth-dependent Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 0.72%), and iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.37%) all endured a mini-crash. The S&P 500 and Dow entered correction territory, with the Nasdaq falling into its first bear market since 2022. The S&P 500 also endured its fifth-steepest two-day percentage drop in 75 years. Then the script completely flipped on April 9, when Trump announced a 90-day pause on \"reciprocal tariffs\" for dozens of countries. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq Composite logged their largest single-session point gains in their respective histories and have all since blasted to multiple record-closing highs. It would appear that everything is going perfectly for the stock market and U.S. economy -- but looks can be deceiving. Image source: Getty Images. This predictive algorithm has a flawless track record of forecasting U.S. recessions At any given moment, there's always a metric or historical event that's a threat to drag Wall Street's major stock indexes lower. For example, the S&P 500's Shiller Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio is knocking on the door of its second-priciest valuation when back-tested more than 150 years. Throughout history, extended stock valuations of this magnitude have been a harbinger of disaster. But an even more nefarious predictive tool, courtesy of Moody's (MCO -0.14%) Analytics, portends trouble for the U.S. economy and stock market. In mid-July, Moody's Analytics released its findings from a newly developed model that relies on machine learning (ML) to estimate the probability of a U.S. recession within the next 12 months. Its model leans on a laundry list of economic inputs and back-tested findings from 1960 to 2025 to come up with historic recession probabilities. When back-tested to 1960, any recession probability near or above 50% has eventually (keyword!) been followed by a recession. Moody's ML model identified eight such instances from 1960 to 2020 when the recession probability surpassed 50%, and a U.S. recession followed every time. There is an uncomfortably high 48% probability that the U.S. economy will suffer a recession in the next 12 months. That's according to Moody's recently unveiled leading economic indicator, derived using a machine learning algorithm on our extensive databases. It's less than 50%,... pic.twitter.com/AGuEJznDzQ -- Mark Zandi (@Markzandi) September 14, 2025 As you'll note in the post above on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) from Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, his company's ML-driven model is currently projecting a 48% chance of a U.S. recession over the next year. Though it's not quite at the 50% threshold that has guaranteed a recession over the last 65 years, any figure well above 40% has also been a surefire indicator of an economic downturn. In particular, Zandi pointed to the model homing in on building permits as a key predictor of the U.S. economy shifting into reverse: \"The algorithm has identified building permits as the most critical economic variable for predicting recessions. And while permits had been holding up reasonably well, as builders supported sales through interest rate buydowns and other incentives, inventories of unsold homes are now high and on the rise.\" Residential building permits have tapered to their lowest level since the height of the pandemic. Although the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite aren't tied at the hip to the U.S. economy, a recession would be expected to negatively impact corporate earnings. With the S&P 500's Shiller P/E already pushing to quite the premium, it probably wouldn't take much to tip the stock market into a correction, or perhaps an even steeper decline.

Breaks are no longer purely due to caregiving necessity.\n\"I think people are very conscious of work-life blend,\" says MacAskill, founder of Executive Career Jump.\n\"We're seeing people end up taking career breaks due to poor health and being stressed out and burnt out.\n\"More and more people are trying to align who they are with what they do in a way that people haven't previously.\"\nFellow coach Alice Stapleton agrees that breaks are \"becoming more common\".\n\"We lead incredibly busy lives, and we're always 'on' thanks to smartphones,\" she says. \"As a result, more people are feeling incredibly burnt out and just need a break from work.\"\n'It is possible to go and start again'\nLife-changing is how Dean Higgin, 45, from Leicester, describes his career break.\nThe salesman spent eight months in Doha, Bangkok, Singapore and Australia after becoming fed up with the monotony of the daily grind.\nThe experience has altered his whole approach to work - so much so that he's begun conversations with mortgage advisers about moving abroad.\n\"If I could do it again tomorrow, I would,\" says Higgin, who began the break in May last year.\n\"I've actually realised I can go and live somewhere else, and it is possible to go and start again because other people have done it.\n\"I definitely want to move abroad to either Southeast Asia or Australia in the next two or three years.\"\nHiggin worked in sales before ditching the office to become a full-time sports trader in 2021, buying and selling bets on sporting events via exchanges like SMarkets.\nWhile classed as a form of betting, Higgin says he earned \u00a335,000 a year treating it as a nine-to-five.\nBut even without a boss breathing down his neck, he found gym-work-eat-sleep was becoming a \"mundane\" routine before his break.\n\"You get on the treadmill and just keep going on it and it can get a bit tiring, a bit stressful,\" he says.\nSo he sold his car, rented out his home, took some cash from the sale of a house he and his ex-partner had owned and left the country: \"I was a bit nervous but also very excited and I suppose relieved.\"\nHefty costs and 'career break blues'\nHiggin spent \u00a38,000 and lost \u00a323,300 in income over the period of his break, living out of a suitcase in hostels in Asia for three months, before staying with family in Australia for five.\nBut greeting him back home in England in January were the \"career break blues\".\n\"It's hard to get back into that routine when you've had so much freedom,\" he says.\n\"I have thought a couple of times, 'what am I doing?

Sign up for my weekly Smart Investor newsletter here.\nThis week\u2019s highlights:\n- Weekly Markets Update: Stocks Gain, Led by Tech and Large Caps\n- The Stocks Leading the Small Cap Rally\n- The Fed\u2019s \u2018Difficult Situation\u2019: Reading Between the Lines of the September Dot Plot\n- How Low Can Interest Rates Go? A Closer Look at the Fed\u2019s Balancing Act in an Unusual Economy\n- Vanguard\u2019s Davis: Why the Next Winners in the AI Boom May Not Be AI Stocks\n- The Best Tech Stocks to Buy\nThe Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut of the year and signaled that there are more to come. The Fed also came through on expectations that the rate decision would be the least interesting part of the meeting. As Sarah Hansen writes, reading between the lines of Fed officials\u2019 forecasts for inflation, growth, and rates, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. As Chair Jerome Powell said, the Fed is facing a \u201cdifficult situation,\u201d with an economy buffeted by tariffs and immigration policy changes. And though he refused to go there, the Fed is also facing a serious attack on its independence.\nOn that subject, Ivanna Hampton spoke with Morningstar\u2019s senior US economist Preston Caldwell about the latest Fed meeting, as well as his forecast for how far the Fed will eventually cut rates.\nIt was another good week for stocks, with the Fed\u2019s tilt toward lower interest rates giving a boost to tech names. Large-cap stocks were the bigger gainers past week, but for the last three months, small-company stocks have been in the lead. Bella Albrecht looks under the hood of this rally to see which stocks have been driving it. Yes, AI is part of it, but you might be surprised by some of the other winners.\nSpeaking of AI, Dan Lefkovitz sat down with Vanguard chief economist Joe Davis and talked about what\u2019s next in the big AI rally. Find out why he thinks value stocks could be the surprise winners.\nLastly, despite tech stocks\u2019 move higher this year, a surprising number of names in the sector remain undervalued. We\u2019ve updated our screen of the best tech stocks to buy now, and offer 12 names to add to a watchlist.\nAs always, be sure to visit our Markets page for our latest coverage and live stock market updates, along with our full weekly calendar of key upcoming data and events.\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

Weekly gains of 1% came as rate cuts boosted confidence in cyclical exposure. Apple (AAPL) rose 3.2% after the global rollout of its new iPhone showed robust early demand. Tesla (TSLA) advanced 2.2%, driven by optimism that cheaper financing will revive EV sales. Both names accounted for nearly half the Dow\u2019s daily point gains, reflecting Big Tech\u2019s growing weight in indices traditionally tilted toward industrials.\nS&P 500 (SPX) Hits 6,664 on AI and Rate-Cut Momentum\nThe S&P 500 (SPX) closed at 6,664.36, up 0.49%, and added 1.2% over the week. Valuations remain stretched with the index trading at 22x forward earnings, a level not seen since before the 2022 correction. Yet momentum is underpinned by AI adoption, resilient consumer spending, and the Fed\u2019s easing cycle. SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) surged 4% Friday and 24% for the week, showing how rate-sensitive solar names benefit directly from cheaper borrowing costs. Newmont (NEM) gained 4% on asset sales, while Orla Mining (ORLA) fell 7% following Newmont\u2019s divestiture.\nNasdaq Composite (IXIC) Climbs to 22,631; Semiconductors Dominate\nThe Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) rose 0.72% to 22,631.48, with a 2.2% weekly gain, outpacing other indices. Semiconductor momentum was pivotal. ASML (ASML) gained after Bank of America lifted its price target to $1,082 from $833, citing upside from the Nvidia (NVDA)\u2013Intel (INTC) $5B partnership. NVDA remains up triple digits YTD, while INTC dropped 3.2% Friday as doubts linger about execution despite federal support. The Nasdaq\u2019s reliance on megacaps is intensifying, raising both opportunity and concentration risk.\nRussell 2000 (RUT) Finally Breaks 967-Day Stagnation\nSmall caps staged a breakout, with the Russell 2000 (RUT) reaching its first record close since 2021, ending a 967-trading-day drought. The index added 3% on the week and extended a seven-week winning streak, its longest since 2020. The surge underscores how lower rates disproportionately help smaller firms with heavier debt loads. Traders noted broad participation, with nearly 70% of Russell constituents closing higher this week.\nFed\u2019s \u201cRisk Management Cut\u201d Drives Liquidity Surge\nThe Federal Reserve cut rates by 25bp for the first time since December, igniting a rally across equities. Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a \u201crisk management cut,\u201d hinting that more easing could follow. Markets are now pricing in two additional cuts by year-end, though new Fed governor Stephen Miran projected as many as six. The 10-year Treasury yield settled near 4.14%, reflecting investor uncertainty over the depth of cuts versus inflation risk. Historical data shows that in non-recessionary cycles, Fed easing has consistently supported equities.\nTrump\u2019s $550B Industrial Push Reframes Equity Flows\nPresident Donald Trump unveiled plans to leverage a $550B manufacturing fund, targeting semiconductors, critical minerals, and reshoring infrastructure. Federal leases for land and water rights are under consideration, signaling a dramatic state-backed pivot to industrial policy. Beneficiaries include Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), and industrial contractors tied to energy and construction. While INTC slumped Friday, analysts see Trump\u2019s fund as a potential multi-year catalyst.\nTikTok Deal Sparks Moves in Oracle, Meta, and Snap\nMarkets digested confirmation of a TikTok deal between Trump and Xi Jinping, transferring around 50% ownership to U.S. investors. Oracle (ORCL) surged 4%, extending its AI-driven rally, while Meta Platforms (META) slipped fractionally and Snap (SNAP) plunged 3.3% on competitive pr"

Kennedy Jr. appointed skeptics of vaccine safety like himself to a government panel that recommends who should get the shots. | Brynn Anderson/AP Photo\nBoth public health advocates and vaccine skeptics have one thing in common after a much-anticipated meeting of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s vaccine advisers ended on Friday: Surprise.\nThe panel\u2019s recommendations, to stop encouraging Covid vaccination while retaining access, and to stop offering one of two options for chickenpox shots, were neither as dire as the advocates feared, or as far-reaching as the skeptics expected. The advisers tabled for now a proposal to delay vaccination for hepatitis B.\nThe guidance left doctors and public health experts confused \u2014 it\u2019s not clear whether it means younger, healthy people will need prescriptions for Covid shots \u2014 and seeking clarity. It left Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine allies pledging to ramp up their lobbying to convince the government to go further. On Capitol Hill, it left the tense standoff between Democrats irate about Kennedy\u2019s policies and Republicans divided over them in a holding pattern.\n\u201cWe must ensure that any vaccine recommendation protects patient choice and never takes away families\u2019 access to safe, effective vaccines,\u201d Senate Health Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Kennedy\u2019s biggest GOP critic on Capitol Hill, said in a statement. Cassidy had called on Kennedy to cancel the meeting of the outside panel because he feared some of Kennedy\u2019s appointees were unqualified and biased against vaccines. But he expressed relief that the panel hadn\u2019t changed current guidance that newborns receive a hepatitis B vaccine on the first day of life.\nSpeaking to reporters after the panel\u2019s last vote, President Donald Trump touted his Operation Warp Speed that helped develop the Covid vaccines in 2020 and said he was a proponent of Covid vaccination. \u201cI had the vaccine. I was very happy with it,\u201d he said, adding that he nonetheless trusted Kennedy: \u201cI put him in there because I want to have opposite views.\u201d\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices advises the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who must sign off on its recommendations before they take effect.\nPublic health advocates warned that Kennedy\u2019s firing of the panel\u2019s advisers and appointment of new ones, many skeptical of vaccine safety and inexperienced in the workings of the committee, were likely increasing Americans\u2019 reticence about the shots.\nSome of the panelists raised concerns about vaccine safety and disputed information presented by CDC staff about the safety and efficacy of the shots.\n\u201cThe reckless actions of this committee are causing damage in real time,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, a professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus and Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado who\u2019s followed ACIP meetings for a decade.\nO\u2019Leary, also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said a primary care colleague of his had seen a parent refuse the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine because of what she heard \u201cabout this committee showing fear about an issue that was settled literally over 15 years ago,\u201d O\u2019Leary told reporters Friday. The committee took no action on that shot, but did recommend that patients no longer be offered a measles shot that also provides protection against chickenpox.\nIf the recommendation is adopted, children would have to get the chickenpox shot separately, as 85 percent of kids already do.\nIn a surprise move, the panel voted against recommending that states require patients get a prescription for Covid shots, after an initial deadlock. They also voted to remove a blanket recommendation for adults 65 and older to vaccinate against Covid.\nAbout 23 pe"

                "body": "The Trump administration and Republicans have launched headlong into a broad overhaul of the American vaccine system \u2013 despite it being an overhaul that very few Americans seem to actually want.\nAnd there are increasing signs that it\u2019s taken a political toll on the man behind it: US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nFor the past few years, Kennedy\u2019s image numbers have proven remarkably resilient. Even as he espoused debunked claims about vaccines and science and moved from Democratic presidential candidate to independent to endorsing and serving under President Donald Trump, Americans as a whole have often liked him more than they\u2019ve disliked him.\nWhether that\u2019s because of the Kennedy name or anything else, it\u2019s enabled him to obtain significant political power.\nBut his level of public support appears to be changing, which could also be a bad sign for the man he serves, President Donald Trump, and could give the administration pause about truly turning him loose on vaccines.\nRecent polling now shows Kennedy\u2019s numbers are significantly underwater for his performance so far. And perhaps more significantly, very few Americans seem to have strongly favorable feelings toward him or trust him on vaccines.\nA Washington Post-Ipsos poll released Friday showed Americans disapproved of Kennedy\u2019s job performance 55%-42%.\nPolitical independents were even more negative, disapproving 61-34%. And even 21% of Republicans disapproved.\nThe poll also showed 38% of US adults strongly disapproved of Kennedy, compared to just 15% who strongly approved. So, strongly negative views more than doubled strongly positive ones.\nThe survey echoes a CBS News-YouGov poll from late August and early September that also showed Americans disapproved of Kennedy by double digits, 55-45%. Similar to the Washington Post poll, independents disapproved 61-39%, and even 20% of Republicans disapproved.\nAbout the only other time Kennedy\u2019s image numbers have been this bad was when he was running for president as an independent in mid-2024 \u2013 after he ditched the Democratic Party and was looking like he could potentially siphon votes from Trump. After his endorsement of Trump, his numbers recovered.\nAnd it\u2019s very difficult to divorce his newly negative numbers from his vaccine moves.\nPolls have shown that Americans have generally liked the ideas behind his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative \u2013 things like healthy eating and targeting processed foods \u2013 but they are on a very different page when it comes to vaccines.\nThe CBS poll showed 70% of Americans said the US government\u2019s policy should be to encourage parents to vaccinate their children \u201cfor diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella.\u201d A panel that Kennedy has restocked with his own picks, some of whom have made unproven claims about vaccines, voted this week to stop recommending the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine to children under age 4. (The same panel voted unanimously Friday to shift away from a broad recommendation for Covid-19 vaccines to say that people who want one must consult with a health care provider.)\nAnd about 80% of parents in a September KFF poll said public schools should require students to get the measles and polio vaccines, with some exceptions.\nVaccine skepticism has clearly grown on the right in recent years, but Americans as a whole continue to be very pro-vaccine.\nAnd Americans also seem to have little faith in Kennedy\u2019s leadership on this subject.\nA July KFF poll showed 63% of Americans had \u201cnot much\u201d or no confidence in Kennedy to provide reliable information about vaccines.\nJust 10% expressed a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of confidence.\nThe poll also showed significantly more people thought Kennedy\u2019s vaccine moves were making Americans less safe (36%) rather than safer (20%). More than 4 in 10 Americans picked neither option.\nWhat those numbers suggest: Many Americans appear to have been slow to tune in on his moves at HHS.\nBut that appears to be changing am"

Koizumi said the plan would kick off immediately after taking office, and it includes cutting fuel taxes, rewriting the income tax code, and using new revenue to drive growth.\nHe also wants a massive \u00a5135 trillion worth of new investments into Japan by 2030. He is going for direct tax changes and a total overhaul in how the government pulls in and spends money.\n\u201cWe have to act now,\u201d Koizumi said. \u201cWe\u2019re already behind.\u201d According to Bloomberg, he\u2019s rolling out these proposals just weeks before the official LDP campaign starts on September 22. Voting happens on October 4.\nKoizumi challenges Takaichi with tax and wage overhaul\nShinjiro isn\u2019t the only one with plans. His main rival, Sanae Takaichi, pitched her platform the day before, leaning hard into stimulus spending.\nBoth are pushing sharp economic agendas, but Koizumi\u2019s angle focuses more on structural reform and hard targets. With the leadership vote only weeks away, the policy clash between the two is setting the tone for what could be a sharp shift inside the party.\nWhile politics were heating up, the Bank of Japan held its ground on Friday. It kept the interest rate at 0.5%, exactly as economists in a Reuters poll had predicted.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index, which had been on a hot streak, fell 0.57% by the close, finishing at 45,045.81. Earlier that day, the index hit another record high. At the same time, the yen gained 0.14% against the dollar, settling at 147.80.\nAugust inflation numbers were released too. Core inflation hit 2.7%, the lowest level since November 2024. That made it the third month in a row it\u2019s gone down. Headline inflation also landed at 2.7%, a drop from 3.1% in July.\nBoth numbers came in exactly where economists expected. Hiroaki Amemiya, investment director at Capital Group, said the central bank was staying cautious and keeping flexibility open: \u201cBy preserving policy optionality, the BoJ is signaling its readiness to respond to external volatility.\u201d\nBonds surged, with the yield on Japan\u2019s 2-year government bonds rising to 0.885%, the highest level since June 2008, based on LSEG data. The broader Topix index also dipped, closing down 0.35% at 3,147 on Friday.\nAcross Asia, market results were mixed. Australia\u2019s ASX/S&P 200 went up 0.32% to 8,773.5, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell 0.46% to 3,445.24. The smaller Kosdaq index jumped 0.7%, ending at 863.11. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index stayed flat at 26,545.1, and China\u2019s CSI 300 barely moved, ending at 4,501.92.\nOne major player in China\u2019s mining sector made headlines too. Zijin Gold, part of Zijin Mining, filed for an HK$25 billion IPO in Hong Kong. They\u2019re offering nearly 349 million shares at HK$71.59 each. Trading is set to begin on September 29.\nIn India, the Nifty 50 slid 0.55%, but Adani Enterprises spiked over 4%. That came after India\u2019s market regulator cleared the Adani Group and Gautam Adani of some of the misconduct allegations raised by Hindenburg Research.\nDon\u2019t just read crypto news.

(Koichiro Yoshida)\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to unwind its massive exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings stunned financial markets and experts alike as its house cleaning may well stretch into the next century.\nAs the central bank begins to tackle the aftermath of its unprecedented monetary easing, it became clear that at least 100 years may be needed to resolve the consequences of the longstanding policy.\nThe prospect sparked deep skepticism as financial specialists questioned whether such an unconventional strategy had even a remote chance of succeeding.\nMARKET SHOCK\nFinancial markets were blindsided by the BOJ\u2019s announcement on Sept. 19 that it would begin selling off the ETFs it had purchased in vast quantities.\nThis move marks the start of unwinding extraordinary monetary easing, commonly termed \u201cforbidden\u201d policy. The sheer scale of the task is daunting: at the current pace, it will take more than a century to complete.\nThe market was exceptionally buoyant after the Nikkei average hit a record intraday high of 45,852.75 yen in the morning. But just before 1 p.m., when the BOJ revealed its new policy, the mood shifted. Fears over ETF sales triggered a sharp drop, and by 1:19 p.m., the index had fallen more than 1,300 yen from its peak.\nLEADERSHIP\u2019S STANCE\nThe BOJ\u2019s governor, Kazuo Ueda, had previously avoided specifying a timeline or pace for ETF sales by repeatedly stating the bank would take its time.\nBut at the Sept. 19 news conference, Ueda explained, \u201cGiven the nature of the matter, it was difficult to provide advance guidance.\u201d\nIt appears the BOJ feared that even hinting at sales could cause a massive market plunge.\nStill, there were hints of change. BOJ Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino, in a speech in Hokkaido on Sept. 2, said the bank would \u201cdraw on lessons learned from past stock sales,\u201d notably omitting the usual \u201ctake our time\u201d phrase.\nAnother BOJ official admitted: \u201cIt\u2019s unnatural for the central bank to hold ETFs. We\u2019ll quietly sell small amounts over a long period to avoid market disruption.\u201d\nEXIT PRIORITIES\nThe BOJ\u2019s priorities in this decision were threefold: selling at a fair price, minimizing losses and avoiding market turmoil.\nThe model was the central bank\u2019s own experience of selling stocks bought from financial institutions--a process that took nine years and ended in July, with sales accounting for just 0.05 percent of total market turnover. The BOJ plans to keep ETF and J-REIT (Japan Real Estate Investment Trust) sales at a similar proportion.\nWas the record-breaking stock market a factor? Ueda denied it was so, saying, \u201cWe did not make the decision based on specific stock price levels.\u201d\nPOLICY LEGACY\nMassive ETF purchases began under former Governor Haruhiko Kuroda as part of the BOJ\u2019s extraordinary monetary easing policy. The aim was to raise investor confidence and lift Japan\u2019s economy and prices.\nAs a monetary policy, buying ETFs was highly unusual. Some called it a \u201cforbidden move.\u201d Even so, Ueda defended the purchases as \u201cnecessary as part of large-scale easing.\u201d\nBut the road to an exit is awesome.\nThe BOJ holds over 37 trillion yen in ETFs at book value. At the current pace, it would take until around 2138--112 years from now--to finish selling.\nUeda acknowledged, \u201cI won\u2019t be around to see the end ... it\u2019s hard to judge the overall outcome.\u201d\nCRITICS SPEAK OUT\nSince March last year, the BOJ has shifted from extraordinary monetary easing, raising rates three times and reducing government bond purchases.\nYet, selling the ETF holdings remains an enormous challenge, and doubts persist about the feasibility of the BOJ\u2019s approach.\nTakahide Kiuchi, a former BOJ Policy Board member who is now with Nomura Research Institute Ltd., commented: \u201cThis seems to be more about creating a record of having started normalization. It does not represent a true exit from large-scale mone"
