                "body": "Gold prices have hovered around $4,200, reacting to a sliding US Dollar and anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut. The Gold trading price dipped by 0.20% on Wednesday, despite trading above $4,200 after reaching a high of $4,240.\nThe mixed US economic data, alongside expectations of a Federal Reserve meeting rate cut, influenced the day\u2019s market movements. ADP reported job cuts in private companies for November, while ISM\u2019s data indicated stability in the services sector, which constitutes two-thirds of the US GDP.\nCentral Banks Purchase Gold\nCentral banks, meanwhile, purchased 53 tons of Gold in October, the most for the year, bolstering future price predictions. The US Dollar Index fell by 0.44% to 98.87, the lowest since October, due to economic developments and speculation about future Federal Reserve leadership.\nMoney market instruments show an 85% chance of a 25-basis point future rate reduction. The US 10-year Treasury Note yield fell by two basis points to 4.071%, with Gold expected to rise as real US yields drop. Analysts predict Gold may challenge the $4,250 mark, moving potentially towards $4,300.\nGold\u2019s price is influenced by the geopolitical climate, interest rates, and currency strength, with the US Dollar serving as a prominent factor in its valuation.\nMarket Pricing and Strategies\nWith the market pricing in an 85% probability of a Fed rate cut next week, much of the good news is already reflected in gold\u2019s $4,200 price. This creates a risky \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d scenario for traders. We should therefore focus on options strategies that can profit from the coming volatility, rather than taking a simple directional bet.\nThe bullish case is supported by a weakening US Dollar and strong central bank buying, a trend we\u2019ve seen continue since their record-breaking purchases in 2022. Buying call options with a strike price above the $4,250 resistance level could be a cost-effective way to capture upside if the Fed signals even more aggressive cuts for 2026. This limits downside risk to the premium paid if the market reaction is muted.\nHowever, the risk of a surprise \u201cno cut\u201d decision from the Fed is real, especially with the ISM Services data showing resilience in the US economy. To hedge against a sharp drop, we should consider buying put options with a strike below the $4,113 support level. Looking back at the market whiplash during the initial Fed pivot discussions in late 2023, we know how quickly sentiment can reverse on a hawkish surprise.\nGiven the binary nature of next week\u2019s meeting, a significant price swing is almost guaranteed. A straddle strategy, which involves buying both a call and a put option at the same strike price, is well-suited for this environment. This position profits if gold makes a strong move in either direction following the Fed\u2019s announcement.\nThe longer-term outlook remains positive, with markets expecting nearly 90 basis points of cuts in 2026 and central banks continuing their historic accumulation of gold. This supports holding some longer-dated bullish positions. The World Gold Council has reported that central banks added over 1,000 tonnes in both 2022 and 2023, establishing a strong floor for the price.\nBefore the Fed meeting, we will be watching the upcoming Core PCE inflation report and jobless claims data very closely. Any sign of persistent inflation or a surprisingly strong labor market could lower the odds of a rate cut and trigger a sell-off in gold before the main event. Traders should be prepared to adjust their positions quickly based on this incoming data."

                "body": "Introduction\nGold prices are pushing toward new highs today as market participants react to key U.S. economic data and rising geopolitical tensions. The ADP Non-Farm Employment Change report released today came in well below expectations, with a significant miss that has fueled speculation about the Fed's next steps. This weak employment data has strengthened the narrative of an impending rate cut by the Federal Reserve, providing support for gold. With growing doubts about the economic recovery and ongoing concerns about global instability, gold\u2019s safe-haven appeal is more relevant than ever.\nHere is more on this.\n1. Expectations of Federal Reserve Policies and Trump\u2019s Selection of the Next Fed Chairman\nAmong the many factors that affect gold prices, the speculation regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy stands out. The recent confirmation by President Trump that he plans to nominate the new Federal Reserve Chairman in the first part of next year has led market speculation regarding this possible change in monetary policy, anticipating this may result in a dovish Fed approach in favour of lower interest rates.\nThis trend regarding lower interest rates has the attention of investors in particular, as gold tends to perform favourably in this kind of rate structure. Gold historically performs well under conditions of reduced real yields because gold provides investors with asset alternatives that would no longer be of interest in such conditions. It appears investors are anticipating the Fed's possible announcement of a rate cut in December, in which the probability of this action being taken stands at 89%. This possible easing in Fed policy would result in gold\u2019s favour regarding hedge functions in view of the weakening dollar.\n2. Geopolitical Risks and Safe-Haven Demand\nThe other factor benefiting gold\u2019s prices is rising geopolitical tensions, especially in areas such as Latin America, due to the aggressive approach taken by President Trump in dealing with counties like Venezuela. The threats by President Trump regarding possible military strikes in drug-trafficking countries and recent statements regarding immigration policy are contributing factors in this respect.\n3. Economic Data and the Impact on Gold Sentiment\nToday\u2019s ADP Non-Farm Employment Change report showed a 32,000-job loss for November, significantly worse than the forecasted 5,000-job increase. This miss reinforces expectations for a Fed rate cut in December, which is favorable for gold.\nAdditionally, the ISM Services PMI came in at 52.6, slightly above expectations, indicating that the services sector is still expanding. While the data mixed slightly, the overall tone has supported the case for a dovish Fed and lower yields, which directly benefit gold.\nLooking ahead, traders are closely watching the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) data, which is expected to be released soon. The NFP report is particularly significant given the lengthy government shutdown, which delayed data collection, making the upcoming report crucial in gauging the health of the labor market. A weak NFP print could further support the case for a rate cut, strengthening the bullish sentiment for gold.\n4. Technical Analysis and Future Outlook\nTechnically speaking, the gold price has formed a bullish pattern on the 4 hour time frame which is shown on the chart. In addition to this, the price trading above the 50-day SMA on the intra-day time which means that the bulls are strongly in control of the price. Both RSI and MACD are not showing signs of overbought which means that the momentum in the gold price can very much continue.\nThe important price levels in terms of support and resistance are shown on the chart below\nGold trading chart: XTB\nConclusion\nThe precious metal gold continues to follow an upward path based on many factors including the expectation of a dovish Federal Reserve, geopolitical tensions, and strong demand for safe-haven assets.\nDespite the optimism in the future price"

Heading into the new year, analysts see no end to this trend.\nStrong gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and central bank purchases are projected to continue into next year as investors, particularly in the west, increasingly recognize the hedge value of gold.\nGlobal financial services firm Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) sees demand for gold from ETFs and central banks pushing the gold price back up above US$4,500 per ounce by mid-2026.\nThe World Gold Council (WGC) also expects the themes of risk and uncertainty to continue driving gold.\n\u201cI think the performance of gold (in 2025) speaks volumes about the global perspective on risk and uncertainty. And I keep saying those terms over and over again \u2014 I hope they they sink in with your investor base,\u201d Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist, Americas, at the WGC, told the Investing News Network (INN) in a late November interview.\n\u201cMy sense is that we're going to continue to see these challenges in 2026.\u201d\nCavatoni expects this will translate into continued strong ETF flows and central bank demand for the monetary metal for 2026, although central bank buying may come at a slower pace than the past few years.\nGold as a hedge against potential AI stock bubble\nAnother potential 2026 tailwind for gold is a correction in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\nAnalysts are increasingly warning that this could happen, and it's possible that AI bubble meltdown concerns may push more investors away from equities and into gold in the coming year.\nMichael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Global Research, told his clients in late October that gold may be one of the strongest hedges if the AI bubble bursts.\nSimilarly, Macquarie analysts are warning that if AI tech firms and their clients can\u2019t demonstrate a return on their huge investments in the emerging technology, gold may be the best bet for protection against the resulting market fallout: \u201cOptimists buy tech, pessimists buy gold, hedgers buy both.\"\nSpeaking from the sidelines of the New Orleans Investment Conference, Mike Maloney of GoldSilver.com told INN that the uncertainty generated by Trump\u2019s tariffs is beginning to \u201cslow down world trade,\u201d which has negative consequences for the AI sector. \u201cAnd I think that will be the thing that ends up popping (the AI bubble),\u201d he added.\nWeak US dollar, low interest rates price positive for gold\nThe gold price has an inverse relationship with the US dollar and real interest rates. Indeed, Morgan Stanley's US$4,500 gold forecast for mid-2026 is predicated on a weaker dollar and lower rates.\nLower rates typically weaken the dollar, and Trump has been pressuring the US Federal Reserve to drop rates since taking office. With Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term due to end next year, market watchers are anticipating that a more dovish Fed head will take the helm. This means that more rate cuts are likely on the table for 2026.\nA softer dollar and a low rate environment would provide foundational support for further"

The benchmark February contract on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange fell 38 ringgit, or 0.92%, to 4,115 ringgit (about $1,000) per metric ton in early trade.\nWhat does this mean?\nPalm oil usually tracks other major edible oils, and those signals are pointing lower right now. Related vegetable oil contracts on China\u2019s Dalian Commodity Exchange and soyoil futures on the Chicago Board of Trade both declined, undercutting demand for palm in global food and feed markets. On top of that, a Reuters survey suggests Malaysia\u2019s palm oil inventories jumped in November to their highest level in more than six-and-a-half years, after exports slumped even as production hit a record for the month \u2013 a textbook oversupply squeeze on prices. A stronger ringgit, up about 0.15% against the dollar, adds another headwind by making Malaysian palm oil slightly pricier for overseas buyers paying in foreign currencies. There is a partial offset from energy markets, though: crude oil inched higher after fresh Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil infrastructure raised supply concerns, which can make palm a more attractive biodiesel feedstock when fossil fuel prices rise. From a technical angle, Reuters analyst Wang Tao sees prices struggling to break resistance around 4,202 ringgit and potentially retesting support near 4,121 ringgit per ton.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Soft commodities are speaking a more complicated language.\nPalm oil sits at the crossroads of food, fuel, and currency markets, so its latest drop offers a snapshot of broader commodity sentiment. Record Malaysian output and rising stocks are colliding with sluggish demand, even as US soybean shipments to China pick up again, with at least six bulk vessels set to load at Gulf Coast terminals through mid-December. That renewed US-China crop trade supports soybeans and soyoil, sharpening competition for palm in both food manufacturing and biodiesel markets. At the same time, a weaker dollar \u2013 it just hit a five-week low as traders bet the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week \u2013 would normally prop up commodity prices, but the localized strength of the ringgit is muting that boost for Malaysian exporters. For investors tracking agriculture, all this points to ongoing volatility across vegetable oils, with regional currency swings, trade flows, and energy prices likely driving the next moves.\nThe bigger picture: Food and fuel are moving in closer lockstep.\nThe palm oil story underscores how tightly food and fuel markets are being bound together by policy, trade, and conflict. Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil infrastructure and stalled peace efforts have nudged crude prices higher on supply fears, even as demand stays relatively soft. When fossil fuel prices rise, biofuels tend to look more attractive, which can pull harder on feedstocks like palm and soyoil \u2013 especially in countries with firm biodiesel blending mandates. Add in easing US-China trade tensions in crops and expectations of lower US interest rates, and global trade routes and financing costs for big commodity producers are starting to shift. For governments and businesses, that means planning for a world where shocks in energy markets can quickly ripple into food prices, inflation paths, and the politics of trade.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 2 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Abstract\nThe evaluation of the basic properties and hydrocarbon generation potential of medium-low maturity shale oil serves as a critical link between geological resources and engineering development. This study focuses on JY oil shale, utilizing analytical techniques including vitrinite reflectance (R0), total organic carbon (TOC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Rock-Eval pyrolysis to systematically characterize its geochemical properties. Based on sample characteristics, an in-situ upgrading simulation system was developed and optimized. By comparing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) T1-T2 spectrum and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PY-GC-MS) results before and after thermal cracking, the research further elucidates the mechanism by which thermal cracking influences the occurrence state of organic matter. Results indicate that the JY shale samples have a TOC content ranging from 1.94% to 2.57%, a total hydrocarbon generation potential (S1 + S2) of approximately 21 mg/g, R0 between 0.66% and 1.18%, and a sapropelinite content in kerogen as high as 90.33%. These parameters classify the kerogen as Type0 I, belonging to medium-low maturity source rocks with high organic matter abundance, favorable pyrolysis characteristics, and significant hydrocarbon generation potential, thus qualifying for in-situ upgrading development. Simulation experiments conducted within the temperature range of 400 \u00b0C to 600 \u00b0C show that under isothermal conditions at 450 \u00b0C for 12 h, the organic carbon degradation rate can reach about 40%, and fracturing measures can enhance the in-situ upgrading effect. After thermal cracking, the proportion of kerogen decreases by approximately 10%, the proportion of adsorbed hydrocarbons increases by about 5%, and the proportion of free hydrocarbons increases by roughly 3%. PY-GC-MS analysis further reveals that the proportion of light hydrocarbons increases significantly by about 20%, while the proportion of heavy hydrocarbons decreases by over 20%, validating the conversion sequence of \u201cheavy hydrocarbons \u2192 medium hydrocarbons \u2192 light hydrocarbons\u201d during thermal cracking. This study methodologically integrates multi-scale analysis with a self-developed simulation system and mechanistically clarifies the evolution pathway of the three-phase state of organic matter and the trend toward lighter hydrocarbon compositions. It provides theoretical and experimental support for assessing the feasibility of in-situ upgrading development and optimizing techniques for medium-low maturity shale oil, offering valuable insights for mitigating development risks.\nIntroduction\nAgainst the backdrop of global energy transition and persistent demand for fossil fuels, the development of unconventional oil and gas resources has emerged as a strategic priority for ensuring energy security and addressing supply-demand imbalances. Unlike conventional resources, unconventional oil and gas\u2014such as shale oil, tight oil, oil sands, and coalbed methane\u2014are characterized by widespread distribution, substantial reserves, and significant development potential. These attributes have elevated their role from a supplementary energy source to a major alternative resource1.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that unconventional oil and gas will account for over 50% of the global incremental supply by 20402. Among these resources, shale oil has emerged as a pivotal factor in reshaping the global energy landscape, driven by technological breakthroughs and commercial maturation. Exemplified by the North American \u201cshale revolution,\u201d the United States has witnessed a dramatic surge in shale oil production\u2014from under 500,000 barrels per day in 2005 to more than 9 million barrels per day in 2024\u2014enabled by the widespread adoption of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. This transformation has not only reinforced U.S. energy independence but also exerted profound impacts on global crude oil markets and geopolitica"

                "body": "Malaysian palm oil futures fell on heavy stockpiles, softer rival vegetable oils, and a firmer ringgit that\u2019s nudging up costs for overseas buyers.\nabout 3 hours ago \u2022 3 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nMalaysian palm oil futures slipped for a second straight session on Thursday, dragged down by swelling inventories, weaker rival vegetable oils, and a firmer ringgit. The benchmark February contract on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange fell 38 ringgit, or 0.92%, to 4,115 ringgit (about $1,000) per metric ton in early trade.\nWhat does this mean?\nPalm oil usually tracks other major edible oils, and those signals are pointing lower right now. Related vegetable oil contracts on China\u2019s Dalian Commodity Exchange and soyoil futures on the Chicago Board of Trade both declined, undercutting demand for palm in global food and feed markets. On top of that, a Reuters survey suggests Malaysia\u2019s palm oil inventories jumped in November to their highest level in more than six-and-a-half years, after exports slumped even as production hit a record for the month \u2013 a textbook oversupply squeeze on prices. A stronger ringgit, up about 0.15% against the dollar, adds another headwind by making Malaysian palm oil slightly pricier for overseas buyers paying in foreign currencies. There is a partial offset from energy markets, though: crude oil inched higher after fresh Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil infrastructure raised supply concerns, which can make palm a more attractive biodiesel feedstock when fossil fuel prices rise. From a technical angle, Reuters analyst Wang Tao sees prices struggling to break resistance around 4,202 ringgit and potentially retesting support near 4,121 ringgit per ton.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Soft commodities are speaking a more complicated language.\nPalm oil sits at the crossroads of food, fuel, and currency markets, so its latest drop offers a snapshot of broader commodity sentiment. Record Malaysian output and rising stocks are colliding with sluggish demand, even as US soybean shipments to China pick up again, with at least six bulk vessels set to load at Gulf Coast terminals through mid-December. That renewed US-China crop trade supports soybeans and soyoil, sharpening competition for palm in both food manufacturing and biodiesel markets. At the same time, a weaker dollar \u2013 it just hit a five-week low as traders bet the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week \u2013 would normally prop up commodity prices, but the localized strength of the ringgit is muting that boost for Malaysian exporters. For investors tracking agriculture, all this points to ongoing volatility across vegetable oils, with regional currency swings, trade flows, and energy prices likely driving the next moves.\nThe bigger picture: Food and fuel are moving in closer lockstep.\nThe palm oil story underscores how tightly food and fuel markets are being bound together by policy, trade, and conflict. Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil infrastructure and stalled peace efforts have nudged crude prices higher on supply fears, even as demand stays relatively soft. When fossil fuel prices rise, biofuels tend to look more attractive, which can pull harder on feedstocks like palm and soyoil \u2013 especially in countries with firm biodiesel blending mandates. Add in easing US-China trade tensions in crops and expectations of lower US interest rates, and global trade routes and financing costs for big commodity producers are starting to shift. For governments and businesses, that means planning for a world where shocks in energy markets can quickly ripple into food prices, inflation paths, and the politics of trade.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 2 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "EUR/USD Forecast: Euro hits one-month high on Eurozone data, Fed easing divergence\n- The Euro reaches a one-month high, supported by stronger-than-expected Eurozone services data.\n- Improved risk sentiment and expectations of Federal Reserve easing continue to weigh on the US Dollar.\n- Markets anticipate softer US services activity after a deeply disappointing ADP employment report.\nEUR/USD trades around 1.1660 on Wednesday, up 0.30% on the day, supported by renewed demand for the single currency and a weakening US Dollar (USD). The pair extends its advance toward fresh one-month highs, helped by stronger European economic indicators and a widening policy gap in favor of the Eurozone.\nEurozone growth prospects improved further after the HCOB Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for November was revised higher to 53.6 from 53.1, marking a fourth consecutive monthly expansion and the strongest reading since May 2023. The upward revisions were broad-based, with France rising to 51.4 and Germany to 53.1.\nThese data reinforce the firm stance of the European Central Bank (ECB). President Christine Lagarde told the ECON Committee of the European Parliament that growth should be supported by household spending and a resilient labor market, adding that underlying inflation remains aligned with the ECB\u2019s 2% medium-term target.\nThe contrast with the Federal Reserve (Fed) is becoming increasingly pronounced. Markets are pricing an 85% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut next week, with additional cuts expected in 2026. Speculation that White House adviser Kevin Hassett could replace Chair Jerome Powell, potentially steering policy toward further easing, has amplified this divergence.\nUS data released earlier in the day has also pressured the US Dollar. The ADP Employment Change report showed a loss of 32,000 jobs in November, compared with an expected gain of 5,000, highlighting growing weakness in the labor market. ADP noted that employers are facing cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.\nLater today, attention turns to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) Services PMI, expected to ease to 52.1 from 52.4 in October. Another decline in the employment sub-index, already contracting for the past five months, would reinforce concerns about a sharper slowdown in the US economy.\nIn this environment, the divergence between a firm-leaning ECB and a Fed preparing for deeper monetary easing continues to support the Euro (EUR). Should the ISM report disappoint, downside pressure on the US Dollar could intensify, potentially allowing EUR/USD to extend its recent upward momentum beyond current monthly highs.\nEUR/USD Technical Analysis\nIn the 4-hour chart, EUR/USD trades at 1.1664, up for the day, 26 pips above the day opening price. The 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) is rising at 1.1582, and the pair holds above it, reinforcing a bullish bias. Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 71.45 is overbought and suggests momentum is stretched. Immediate resistance aligns at 1.1669, followed by 1.1728, and a sustained break could extend the advance.\nAbove the 100-period SMA, the bias stays firm. RSI has eased from 72.52 to 71.45, hinting at cooling momentum. The rising trend line from 1.1491 underpins the bullish tone, offering support near 1.1609. Additional support is seen at 1.1469. A dip into trend-line support could attract fresh bids and keep the uptrend intact.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool)\nPremium\nYou have reached your limit of 3 free articles for this month.\nStart your subscription and get access to all our original articles.\nAuthor\nGhiles Guezout\nFXStreet\nGhiles Guezout is a Market Analyst with a strong background in stock market investments, trading, and cryptocurrencies.

                "body": "Asia stocks dither despite Fed easing bets; Nikkei jumps on tech gains\nThe euro\u2019s (EUR/USD) appreciation above twelve percent against the dollar this year is emerging as a meaningful disinflationary force for the eurozone, and markets are now testing how far that currency effect can shape the European Central Bank\u2019s rate path. The exchange rate dynamic is already visible in the inflation data, with headline CPI at 2.2 percent in November as EUR/USD trades near levels not seen since mid-year. The immediate market reaction is modest, yet the consistency of the euro\u2019s strength is forcing investors to rethink the downside risks to the ECB\u2019s policy rate, currently held at 2 percent.\nThe core issue now is not whether the euro\u2019s appreciation lowers inflation, but how forcefully the ECB should respond when the disinflation channel originates from FX rather than domestic slack. Philip Lane\u2019s speech clarifies that the ECB\u2019s models assign a measurable weight to the exchange rate.\nA ten percent rise in the euro reduces inflation markedly across a three-year horizon, with a peak effect of about 0.6 percentage points after twelve months. Since the broad euro has already appreciated more than twelve percent in 2025, the disinflation impulse is no longer hypothetical. It is embedded in the forecast horizon that will inform policy meetings well into next year.\nThis matters because the euro\u2019s strength is not purely a monetary phenomenon. It reflects shifting global capital flows, a softer US dollar environment, and a European macro profile that is stabilizing without overheating. A firm currency lowers the price of imported goods and services, while simultaneously softening external demand for euro-area exports.\nThis dual effect suppresses inflation through both the cost channel and the demand channel. It also complicates the ECB\u2019s communication strategy because the bank has repeatedly signaled that it is in a good place on policy, even as its own models show a stronger currency pulling inflation away from target.\nMarket pricing across FX and rates is already adjusting. EUR/USD has been buoyed by the eurozone\u2019s improving real rate differential and is trading comfortably above earlier mid-year ranges. Rate markets continue to price a steady ECB stance into the coming year, but the currency trajectory encourages investors to assign a higher probability to another rate cut if headline inflation continues to drift lower. European sovereign yields remain anchored, reflecting both the policy hold and the expectation that the exchange rate itself is doing part of the tightening. Meanwhile, the dollar\u2019s inability to regain traction limits the upside risk for EUR/USD and reinforces the disinflation trend feeding into eurozone forecasts.\nThe forward view hinges on how persistent the euro appreciation proves. Investors will monitor incoming inflation prints, wage agreements, trade flows, and any shift in U.S. rate expectations that could narrow or widen the transatlantic differential. The base case is that the ECB maintains its current stance while signaling patience, allowing the currency\u2019s impact to pass through without pre-emptive easing. The risk scenario is a quicker and broader deceleration in core prices that forces policymakers to reassess the balance of risks, particularly if export softness deepens and domestic demand plateaus.\nThe investor takeaway is straightforward. As long as the euro holds its appreciation and inflation continues to slip toward the lower band of the ECB\u2019s comfort zone, rate cut speculation will remain alive. FX strength has become a meaningful macro variable for the eurozone, and traders should recognize that positioning in EUR/USD and front-end rates now embeds an asymmetric sensitivity to softer inflation surprises.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - (EURUSD=X) Hits Six-Week High at 1.1660 as Weak U.S. Labor Data Fuels Fed Rate-Cut Momentum\nThe EUR/USD pair extends its rally toward 1.1675, supported by falling U.S. Treasury yields (US10Y 4.06%), soft hiring data, and stronger Eurozone PMI | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro Gains Momentum as Dollar Weakness Deepens\nThe EUR/USD pair advanced to 1.1660 after touching 1.1675, its highest since October 20, driven by a broad selloff in the U.S. Dollar (DXY 99.20, -0.33%). Market participants continue to price an almost certain 25-basis-point rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on December 10, while soft U.S. employment data reinforced bearish pressure on the Greenback. The ADP Employment Change report showed a 32,000 job decline, missing expectations for a 5,000 increase, adding to evidence of slowing private-sector momentum. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) dropped to 4.06%, extending its multi-week downtrend, while traders anticipate further declines toward 3.90% should rate-cut bets intensify.\nU.S. Economic Indicators Reinforce Dovish Fed Outlook\nDespite a marginal uptick in ISM Services PMI to 52.6 (previous 52.4), underlying components show persistent weakness. The Employment Index contracted for a sixth straight month at 48.9, while New Orders fell to 52.9, down sharply from 56.2. The Prices Index eased to 65.4, signaling moderating inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, the S&P Global Services PMI dipped to 54.1 from 54.8, marking its lowest in five months. Combined with the weak ADP data, this reinforced market conviction that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will cut rates next week. The CME FedWatch Tool now assigns a 90% probability of a cut, up from 63% a month ago, anchoring EUR/USD\u2019s bullish bias.\nEurozone Resilience Strengthens EUR/USD Fundamentals\nAcross Europe, macro indicators lend further support to the Euro. The Eurozone Composite PMI rose to 53.6, up from 53.1, while Germany\u2019s Services PMI improved modestly to 53.4. Inflation figures confirmed stability, with headline CPI at 2.2% (vs. 2.1% prior) and core CPI unchanged at 2.4%, easing fears of renewed disinflation. This stability allows the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintain its restrictive stance, contrasting with the Fed\u2019s dovish pivot. The German\u2013Italy yield spread narrowed to 70 basis points, its lowest since 2010, underscoring improved sentiment across the Eurozone\u2019s bond markets and reducing risk premiums on the single currency.\nPolitical and Geopolitical Dynamics Favor the Euro\nRecent geopolitical headlines also contributed to Euro resilience. Russia\u2019s acknowledgment of \u201cconstructive\u201d dialogue regarding U.S.-mediated peace proposals in Ukraine tempered safe-haven flows into the U.S. Dollar. Although no breakthrough is confirmed, the moderation of war rhetoric lifted regional confidence. Simultaneously, market speculation around the potential appointment of Kevin Hassett\u2014a noted dove\u2014as the next Federal Reserve Chair intensified expectations of prolonged monetary easing under the Trump administration, which further depressed the Dollar.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD Eyes Resistance at 1.1728 and 1.1800\nTechnically, the EUR/USD structure remains strongly bullish. The pair trades firmly within an ascending channel, staying above its 50-day EMA (1.1606) and 200-day EMA (1.1583). The recent breakout above 1.1650 confirmed a shift in trend momentum, with the next resistance levels seen at 1.1728\u2014the prior swing high\u2014and 1.1800, a psychological threshold that could attract momentum buyers. RSI reads 68, reflecting overextended bullish conditions but with no immediate reversal signs. Immediate support now sits at 1.1600, followed by 1.1550, with deeper structural support near 1.1480\u20131.1500, aligning with the base of the November consolidation.\nRead More\n-\nHealthcare XLV ETF (NYSEARCA:XLV) Hits $155.29 as Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, and AbbVie Fuel Sector Rally\n03.12.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS Archi"

Traders are pricing nearly an 89% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) at the December 10 policy meeting, while the Bank of England (BoE) is expected to follow on December 18. This dual-dovish setup is keeping the pound steady against the dollar, as both central banks edge toward policy easing but with different economic pressures driving their decisions.\nU.S. Dollar Weakness and the Impact on GBP/USD (GBP/USD)\nThe decline in the dollar is being fueled by softening U.S. data and dovish comments from Fed officials. The ADP Employment Change for November is forecast at just 5K new jobs, down from 42K, signaling an increasingly fragile labor market. The ISM Manufacturing PMI also contracted for a ninth consecutive month, falling to 48.2 versus expectations of 48.6. These figures reinforce the case for policy easing, while speculation over the next Fed Chair \u2014 reportedly Kevin Hassett, a noted advocate for lower interest rates \u2014 has accelerated selling pressure in the greenback. The 10-year Treasury yield has dropped to 4.06%, and the VIX remains subdued near 16.5, showing calm conditions favoring risk assets. As a result, GBP/USD continues to climb from its late-November base near 1.3150, with momentum building toward resistance around 1.3280\u20131.3325.\nBank of England\u2019s Balancing Act Amid Cooling Inflation\nWhile U.S. dollar softness supports GBP/USD, the BoE faces a very different domestic reality. UK inflation cooled sharply to 2.5% in November, moving closer to the 2.0% target, and GDP growth remains stagnant. The last Monetary Policy Committee vote split 5-to-4 in favor of holding rates at 5.00%, but four members supported a 25-bps cut, revealing a deeply divided outlook. The combination of falling consumer spending, flat retail volumes, and slowing wage growth increases pressure on the BoE to ease. Traders are now betting on a quarter-point rate cut on December 18, which could temper further pound gains if confirmed. Still, near-term fiscal stability from the government\u2019s \u00a322 billion budget headroom continues to offer modest support for sterling demand.\nMarket Positioning and Technical Levels\nFrom a technical standpoint, GBP/USD is holding within a strong ascending channel, anchored by immediate support at 1.3210\u20131.3220 (aligned with the 50-day EMA) and deeper support near 1.3180 (200-day EMA). Resistance sits at 1.3275, followed by 1.3325, which coincides with mid-October highs. If momentum accelerates beyond 1.3330, the next bullish extension targets 1.3385\u20131.3400. The RSI at 59\u201360 suggests strengthening momentum without overbought signals, while the broader structure remains positive unless a daily close below 1.3180 occurs. On the downside, sustained weakness under 1.3150 could expose 1.3080\u20131.3100, a key retracement zone.\nMacro Correlations and Cross-Asset Context\nThe pound\u2019s resilience is amplified by broader market trends. Gold (XAU/USD) trading above $4,200, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) near $92,900, and declining yields collectively signal a pro-risk environment. Meanwhile, U.S. oil (WTI CL=F) remains range-bound near $59.20, limiting inflationary impulses that might otherwise delay Fed easing. The CBOE British Pound Volatility Index (BPVIX) has risen modestly from 7.5 to 8.2, reflecting pre-event hedging ahead of the twin central bank decisions. However, implied volatility still suggests the market is not fully pricing in a shock outcome from either the Fed or BoE, leaving room for a sharp direc"

Hassett is seen as a close ally who supports Trump's call for quicker and deeper interest rate reduction to stimulate the economy, which might undermine the USD.\nOn the other hand, the UK Autumn November budget has reinforced bets for a December rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE), which could weigh on the Cable. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the need to bring inflation and interest rates down to boost business investment and economic growth. A majority of analysts expect the UK central bank to cut interest rates to 3.75% in December, with markets pricing in a 90% chance.\nElesewhere, BoE policymaker Catherine Mann said on Wednesday that US Dollar status as a global reserve currency could be undermined by the country's reduced support for its friends and military allies.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly"

The pair remains supported by the underperformance of the US Dollar (USD), which continues to weaken amid expectations of a possible leadership change at the Federal Reserve (Fed) and a stream of data pointing to slowing US economic momentum.\nThe US Dollar remains pressured after speculation emerged that Kevin Hassett, the current White House economic adviser, could become the successor to Jerome Powell, whose term as Fed Chair ends in May. Hassett has previously expressed support for lower interest rates, reinforcing expectations of a more dovish monetary stance. This prospect is directly weighing on the USD.\nUS data released on Tuesday and Wednesday extend this negative bias. The latest ISM Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) shows services activity still expanding but losing momentum, with a sharp slowdown in new orders and a sixth consecutive monthly contraction in employment. Final S&P Global US Services PMI figures also point to moderating activity. Meanwhile, the ADP Employment Change report revealed a drop of 32,000 jobs in November, contrasting with expectations of job gains and strengthening the view that the Fed is likely to cut rates at next week\u2019s policy meeting.\nIn Australia, the Australian Dollar (AUD) remains resilient despite weaker-than-expected third-quarter growth. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose 0.4% QoQ versus 0.7% expected, though the details of the report remain generally encouraging.\nComments from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) reinforce this resilience. Governor Michele Bullock indicated that further tightening would be needed if inflation proves persistent, noting that the labor market remains \u201ca little tight\u201d and that the output gap is likely \u201cclosed\u201d.\nMarket attention now turns to Australia\u2019s Trade Balance data due Thursday, while US traders await Friday\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report.

While technicals favour Aussie bulls, bond futures look stretched, raising squeeze risk. Equities remain in limbo, with a retracement in short-dated bonds potentially the spark for a near-term rally.\nRetail \u201cRocks\u201d in October\nSource: ABS\nAustralian household spending rose 1.3% in October, the strongest monthly increase since January 2024 and a clear departure from the subdued tone in Q3. The surge followed a 0.3% rise in September and left annual growth at 5.6%.\nDiscretionary spending drove the improvement, with goods categories rebounding after months of weakness. Clothing and footwear lifted 3.5%, furnishings and household equipment rose 3.0%, and electronics also gained. Services spending climbed, supported by major concerts and cultural festivals that boosted catering, hospitality and hotel stays. All nine categories recorded growth over the month.\nThe contrast with yesterday\u2019s Q3 national accounts is stark. That report showed discretionary spend under pressure, masked by non-essential services, and a rising household savings ratio that pointed to caution among consumers. Today\u2019s data suggests that restraint may have been temporary, with the ABS noting promotional retail events and major concerts as key drivers of the October surge. These factors imply the strength may not last, although it does coincide with a noticeable improvement in consumer sentiment and firmer consumer data overall this year.\nRBA Rate Hikes Now Priced\nSource: Bloomberg\nWith productivity growth weak and wages pressure still evident, the risk is that robust household spending may see the supply side of the economy struggle to keep pace. That could amplify the recent acceleration in inflation, raising the prospect that price pressures build further. It\u2019s this dynamic that has seen markets shift from pricing cuts to hikes. Swaps now fully price a 25 basis point increase in the RBA cash rate to 3.85% by November next year, with a move in the first half now considered line ball by traders. The repricing has pushed the Australian dollar sharply higher while weighing on equities and government bond futures.\nAUD/USD Bullish Bias Retained\nSource: TradingView\nAUD/USD extended its bullish move on the back of the data, pushing towards resistance at .6625. That\u2019s the first topside level of note, followed by minor resistance at .6660 with a tougher test awaiting bulls above .6700 where the Aussie reversed hard from earlier this year. On the downside, the November high of .6580 should be on the radar. The message from the momentum indicators continues to favour bullish setups, with RSI (14) trending higher above 50 while MACD has staged a bullish crossover and is now pushing into positive territory, confirming building upside pressure.\nBond Rout Looking Fatigued\nSource: TradingView\nWhile the AUD has benefited from the recalibration in the RBA rate outlook, the price action in Australian three-year government bond futures\u2014which are heavily influenced by monetary policy expectations\u2014suggests those tailwinds may have run their course in the near term.\nThe contract is extremely oversold on RSI (14), increasing the risk of a squeeze following such a significant bearish move over the past six weeks. The inability for the price to hold most of its gains following the hot spending report hints the move may be at or near exhaustion point, suggesting we may see some form of retracement in the near term. 96.02 is the first level to watch should we see a bounce, followed by 96.08, 96.135 and 96.26.\nWhile squeeze risk is elevated, the message from the oscil"

Despite a softer Q3 GDP, the underlying details reflected resilience in the Australian economy, which aided the AUD in recovering quickly from the sell-off.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about day trading brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nThe Australian economy in the third quarter slowed to 0.4% QoQ, against 0.7% expected. However, annual growth accelerated to 2.1%, the fastest pace in the last two years. Although the headline growth missed the forecast, solid public and private investments, as well as firm household spending, offset a drag from inventories and weaker net trade. This indicates the recovery signs in Australia\u2019s economy as it heads into 2026.\nThe GDP breakdown also prompts traders to reassess their expectations for RBA policy. RBA Governor Michele Bullock commented earlier on Wednesday that the central bank is assessing whether inflation pressures are temporary or not. The Australian CPI rising to 3.8% YoY in October, while trimmed-mean inflation surging to 3.3%, showed limited scope for near-term easing by the RBA. Institutions like OCBC and Standard Chartered anticipate the cash rate to stay unchanged at 3.60% at the 9th December meeting. The risk tilts towards a more hawkish tone, while swaps fully price in a rate hike by the end of 2026.\nOn the other hand, the US dollar remains near two-week lows as markets price a 90% probability of a 25 bps rate cut next week. Speculations around the next dovish Fed Chair also add downward pressure on the greenback. Meanwhile, risk sentiment remains constructive amid optimism for a Russia-Ukraine peace agreement. Meanwhile, China\u2019s Services PMI slipped to 52.1 from 52.6 but is still above expectations, helping Aussie stay positive.\nAUD/USD Key Events Ahead\nThe major data releases ahead include:\n- US ADP\n- ISM Services PMI\nDisappointing data could reinforce the bullish momentum in AUD/USD.\nAUD/USD Technical Price Analysis: Potential Consolidation Before Upside\nThe 4-hour chart for the AUD/USD suggests a potential consolidation as the price stays near the key resistance level at 0.6580. Any clear breakout will aim to move higher to test October highs near 0.6620. However, the immediate resistance level, combined with an overbought RSI signal, leads to a potential downside correction.\n\u2013Are you interested to learn more about crypto signals?

                "body": "USD/JPY declines as market focus shifts to Bank of Japan policy\nThe USD/JPY pair fell to 155.67 on Wednesday, recovering part of the previous session\u2019s sharp losses. The decline was driven by renewed pressure on the US dollar, as market expectations for a deeper Federal Reserve easing cycle gained traction.\nDomestically, investor attention remains firmly fixed on the likelihood of a Bank of Japan (BoJ) interest rate hike at its December meeting. This possibility has been underscored by recent hawkish signals from certain BoJ officials, creating a contrast with market perceptions that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s government favours more accommodative monetary conditions.\nThis week, Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama sought to downplay any perceived policy rift, stating there is no discrepancy between the government\u2019s and the central bank\u2019s economic assessments. This remark underscores the continued official emphasis on coordination between fiscal and monetary policy.\nHer comments followed a speech by BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who expressed confidence in Japan\u2019s economic outlook and confirmed the central bank will carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of a rate increase at its December policy review.\nTechnical analysis: USD/JPY\nFour-hour chart\nOn the H4 chart, USD/JPY remains in a downward correction phase following its accelerated rally in mid-November. The pair is trading below the key resistance level of 156.76, forming a potential reversal structure near the lower Bollinger Band. Selling pressure persists, as evidenced by the market\u2019s failure to sustain a move above the indicator\u2019s middle band.\nA decisive break below the 154.66 support level would signal a deeper correction, targeting the area of previous local lows. Conversely, a sustained recovery and close above 156.76 would provide the first technical signal of a potential recovery, opening a path for the pair to retest the 157.90\u2013158.00 resistance zone.\nOne-hour chart\nOn the H1 chart, USD/JPY is undergoing an upward correction after rebounding from support at 157.91. However, the upside appears constrained by the upper Bollinger Band. While buyers are attempting to push above the intermediate resistance at 158.40, price action remains choppy and lacks clear directional conviction.\nThe technical picture suggests a phase of sideways consolidation with a downside bias. Maintaining the price below 158.45 increases the likelihood of a retest of 157.91. A break below this level would strengthen the bearish scenario, targeting the lower boundary of the current range. For a confirmed bullish shift, a sustained move above 158.45, followed by a breakout towards 158.80\u2013159.00, would be required.\nConclusion\nUSD/JPY is consolidating its recent decline amid a tug-of-war between a softer US dollar and evolving expectations for BoJ policy. The technical structure across both timeframes suggests a cautious, range-bound environment with a current tilt towards the downside. The immediate directional catalyst will likely be the BoJ\u2019s December meeting, but in the near term, traders should watch for a break outside the 156.76\u2013154.66 range on the H4 chart for a clearer signal on the pair\u2019s next significant move.\nAuthor\nRoboForex Analysis Department\nRoboForex\nRoboForex Analysis Department provides timely market insights, expert technical analysis, and actionable forecasts across forex, commodities, indices, and equities."

                "body": "Published on: 2025-12-03\nThe yen has finally stopped being a one-way short. After spending most of 2025 pinned at historically weak levels, USD/JPY is now trading around \u00a5155.7, down from recent highs near \u00a5158 and well below the year's peak above \u00a5158.8.\nAt the same time, Japanese bond yields are at their highest since 2008, the Bank of Japan is openly talking about another rate hike, and Tokyo is waving the intervention flag again.\nThe big question for traders is whether this is just a pause in the dollar uptrend or the first real phase of a yen comeback.\nOn a full-year view, the yen is still weak:\n2025 high in USD/JPY: about 158.87 on 10 January.\n2025 low in USD/JPY: about 139.89 on 22 April (yen strongest).\nAverage for 2025: roughly 149.1.\nAs of 3 December 2025, USD/JPY is around 155.7, down slightly on the day and a few big figures below the recent 157\u2013158 area.\nSo yes, the yen has strengthened from the recent highs, but it's still far weaker than it was in April and far above levels that used to trigger panic a few years ago.\nShort-term, the shift is clearer:\nData note USD/JPY topped around 157.89 on 20 November and then slid to an intraday low near 155.3 at the start of December.\nData suggest that the pair dipped below 155.5 as BoJ Governor Ueda hinted at a December rate hike.\nIn other words, from the 157\u2013158 zone, yen buyers finally showed up. The move isn't huge in percentage terms, but after months of one-way traffic, it matters.\nMost major technical desks still frame USD/JPY as long-term bullish but short-term tired:\nThe USD/JPY pair surged above 156.5\u2013157 in November, retesting and then retreating from the 157.8\u2013158 zone, which marked a ten-month high.\nRecent data shows a rejection above 157 and a pullback into the 155\u2013156 area, with dips below 155 bought so far.\nIt points to dense support between 155.7 and 155.0, with deeper support around 154.4\u2013154.7 and then 153.0\u2013153.7. Resistance is clustered at 157.9 and the prior high around 158.2\u2013159.0.\nTable: USD/JPY Technical Map (Daily / 4H)\nRight now, the price is sitting on that 155 support shelf. If the support holds, markets can dismiss the yen's recent bounce as merely a correction within the broader USD/JPY uptrend. If we start closing cleanly below 154\u2013153, the argument shifts toward a medium-term top forming.\nThe structural story starts with the Bank of Japan finally leaving negative rates behind:\nThe Bank of Japan has raised its short-term policy rate from near 0% to 0.5% through a series of hikes across 2024\u20132025.\nIn January 2025, it raised the rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, the highest since 2008, on the view that inflation and wages are finally on a sustainable path above 2%.\nBy July 2025, the BoJ held at 0.5% but clearly said it could resume hikes if inflation and wages stayed firm.\nThat's a complete regime shift from the decade of zero rates and yield-curve control that crushed the yen earlier in the 2020s.\nRecent data support more tightening:\nJapan's core CPI rose 3.0% year-on-year in October, remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three consecutive years.\nTokyo inflation: local CPI in the capital beat forecasts and stayed well above 2%, with core measures around 2.7\u20132.8%.\nBond markets have taken the hint:\nThe 10-year JGB yield is around 1.88%, the highest since 2008.\n2-year and 5-year yields are near 1.0\u20131.4%, also at 2008 levels.\nHigher domestic yields reduce the incentive to park money overseas unhedged, and they make it costlier to stay in short-yen carry trades.\nThe latest leg of yen strength came from Governor Ueda's comments:\nOn 21 November, he said the BoJ will debate the \"feasibility and timing\" of a rate hike at upcoming meetings, warning that a weak yen could lift underlying inflation. Markets took this as the strongest signal yet of a live December meeting.\nOn 1 December, speaking in Nagoya, Ueda said the BoJ would weigh a hike at the 18\u201319 December meeting, sending USD/JPY below \u00a5155 at one point and pushing JGB yields higher.\nMarket"

                "body": "Japan heads into Thursday\u2019s Tokyo Stock Exchange session with risk appetite recovering, the yen strengthening, and bond yields at multi\u2011year highs \u2013 a tricky mix for the Nikkei 225 right as investors eye a potential Bank of Japan rate hike later this month. [1]\nKey points before the Tokyo open (Thursday, 4 December 2025)\n- Nikkei just reclaimed the 50,000 area after a powerful tech\u2011led rebound on Wednesday, even as the broader Topix lagged. [2]\n- BoJ expectations have flipped hawkish after Governor Kazuo Ueda said the bank will debate the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of raising rates at the 18\u201319 December meeting, pushing JGB yields to their highest levels since 2008. [3]\n- The yen has strengthened back toward \u00a5155 per dollar, and Rabobank now forecasts USD/JPY \u201csafely back below 150\u201d within three months, a key risk for Japan\u2019s exporters and equity bulls. [4]\n- Wall Street rallied again overnight, with the Dow up about 0.9% (more than 400 points) as weak private\u2011sector jobs data reinforced market bets on a Fed rate cut next week. [5]\n- Japan\u2019s services PMI stayed firmly in expansion at 53.2 in November, and the composite PMI rose to 52.0, underscoring domestic resilience despite export softness. [6]\n- Bond markets remain volatile ahead of a 30\u2011year JGB auction, with super\u2011long yields at record highs as investors brace for both BoJ tightening and heavy government issuance. [7]\nBelow is a deeper dive into the main drivers that could shape Thursday\u2019s session in Tokyo.\n1. How Tokyo closed on December 3 \u2013 and why it matters for the open\nAfter a bruising start to the week driven by BoJ shock, Tokyo\u2019s equity market showed clear signs of healing on Wednesday.\n- Nikkei rebound: Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose roughly 1\u20131.5% on Wednesday, trading around the 50,000 mark at one point and closing just shy of that psychological level. Gains were concentrated in large\u2011cap tech and AI\u2011linked names. [8]\n- Topix lag: The broader Topix index actually finished lower on the day, dragged by banks and some domestic cyclicals, highlighting that the rally was narrow rather than broad\u2011based. [9]\nSector moves on Wednesday (Tokyo): [10]\n- Chip & tech winners:\n- Advantest: +~4.5%\n- Tokyo Electron: roughly +4%\n- Renesas Electronics: nearly +7%\n- SoftBank Group: around +4% intraday; other reports noted gains above 6% later in the day as AI optimism and headlines about Nvidia exposure drove flows.\n- Banks under pressure:\n- MUFG and SMFG each slipped about 2% as investors took profits following earlier gains tied to rate\u2011hike speculation.\n- Autos softer:\n- Toyota, Honda and Nissan all fell around 0.5\u20131%, reflecting concerns that a stronger yen could squeeze overseas earnings.\nWhy this matters for Thursday:\n- The headline index looks strong, but under the surface breadth was weak and interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive names struggled \u2013 a pattern that can easily flip if global risk sentiment wobbles or if bond yields lurch higher again. TS2 Tech+1\n- For Thursday\u2019s open, traders will be asking whether the tech\u2011led relief rally can extend, or whether we see rotation back into banks and value if bond market stress eases.\n2. BoJ rate\u2011hike bets and surging JGB yields are still the big story\nThe biggest macro driver for Japanese assets this week remains the Bank of Japan.\nUeda\u2019s hawkish signal\nOn Monday, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered his clearest hint yet that another rate rise is on the table, saying the bank would weigh the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of hiking at the 18\u201319 December meeting. [11]\nMarkets are now largely pricing in a 25bp move to 0.75%, while watching carefully for guidance on the pace of further tightening.\nJGB yields at multi\u2011year highs\nJapanese government bonds have been hit hard:\n- 10\u2011year JGB yield: around 1.89%, the highest since 2008.\n- 5\u2011year yield: about 1.39%, highest since mid\u20112008.\n- 2\u2011year yield: just above 1.0%, near a 17\u2011year peak.\n- 30\u2011year yield: 3.425%, a record, ahead of Thursday\u2019s long\u2011bond auction.

                "body": "USD/CAD trades with positive bias above mid-1.3900s; upside potential seems limited\n- USD/CAD stages a modest bounce from the vicinity of a one-month trough set last week.\n- A modest USD uptick supports spot prices, though a combination of factors caps gains.\n- The divergent Fed-BoC policy outlooks and an uptick in Crude Oil prices act as a headwind.\nThe USD/CAD pair attracts some buyers during the Asian session on Thursday, and for now, seems to have snapped a two-day losing streak back closer to the 1.3940-1.3935 region, or a nearly one-month low, touched last week. Spot prices, however, lack bullish conviction and currently trade around the 1.3960-1.3965 area, up 0.10% for the day, amid mixed cues.\nThe US Dollar (USD) attempts a modest recovery from its lowest level since late October, touched on Wednesday, and turns out to be a key factor offering some support to the USD/CAD pair. Any meaningful USD appreciation, however, seems elusive amid bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs again next week. The expectations were reaffirmed by the dismal US ADP report, which showed that private-sector employers unexpectedly shed 32,000 jobs in November.\nThe data points to a weakening US labor market and comes on top of signs of a slowdown in the world's largest economy, which backs the case for further policy easing by the Fed. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to the Bank of Canada's (BoC) hawkish signal, stating that it is likely finished cutting for now. Apart from this, some follow-through recovery in Crude Oil prices could underpin the commodity-linked Loonie and contribute to capping further gains for the USD/CAD pair.\nTraders now look to Thursday's US economic docket, featuring Challenger Job Cuts and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Apart from this, the Canada Ivey PMI might provide some impetus later during the North American session. The market focus, however, will remain on the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index and the monthly Canadian jobs report. This, in turn, will play a key role in determining the next leg of a directional move for the USD/CAD pair.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital "

                "body": "USD/CAD is weakening as the US Dollar faces ongoing selling pressure. Weak ADP data amplifies US labour market concerns, affecting the US Dollar. Friday\u2019s Canadian jobs report is gaining attention ahead of the Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate decision.\nThe Canadian Dollar is strengthening against the US Dollar, trading around 1.3950. The Greenback is pressured by a dovish Federal Reserve outlook, nearing one-month lows as bearish trends grow.\nADP National Employment Report\nThe ADP National Employment Report shows private-sector job losses in November by 32,000, missing expectations of a 5,000 increase. October\u2019s revised figure now stands at a 47,000 gain, up from 42,000.\nThis data is timely for policymakers, with November and October Nonfarm Payrolls to be released on December 16. The US Dollar Index fell to around 98.96, near a one-month low, down about 0.40%.\nMarkets believe the data supports a potential Fed rate cut, aligning with policymakers\u2019 recent comments on slowing labour. The ISM Services PMI later in the day could further support easing expectations.\nIn Canada, the Q3 Labour Productivity figures rose 0.9%, against a 0.4% forecast. Attention turns to Friday\u2019s labour market release, pivotal before the Bank of Canada\u2019s December rate decision.\nUS Labor Market Trends\nWe\u2019re seeing clear signs the US labor market is losing steam, with the ADP report showing a surprising drop in private payrolls. This reinforces our view that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting next week. For derivative traders, this means positioning for further downside in USD/CAD should be the primary focus in the coming weeks.\nThe weak ADP print isn\u2019t an isolated event, as recent data from the Challenger, Gray & Christmas report showed job cut announcements rose by 15% in November 2025, reaching the highest level in eight months. This trend suggests the official Nonfarm Payrolls report due on December 16 could also disappoint expectations. This puts a firm ceiling on the US dollar for the remainder of the year.\nOn the other side of the pair, we expect the Bank of Canada to be more hesitant to cut rates. Canada\u2019s latest CPI report showed core inflation remains sticky at 3.1%, well above the BoC\u2019s target. This policy divergence, where the Fed is easing while the BoC may hold steady, provides a strong fundamental reason for continued Canadian dollar strength against its US counterpart.\nWe have seen this playbook before, most recently in late 2023 when markets began pricing in aggressive Fed cuts for the following year. During that period, the US Dollar Index fell nearly 5% in just two months. The current setup feels very similar, suggesting this initial move lower could have significant follow-through into early 2026.\nGiven the high probability of a Fed cut and the upcoming Canadian jobs report, we believe buying January 2026 expiry put options on USD/CAD is a compelling strategy. Look for strikes around the 1.3850 level to capitalize on a break of the recent lows. This offers a defined-risk way to profit from the expected increase in volatility around the Fed and BoC meetings."

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair has been trending positively for the second consecutive day, surpassing the 206.00 level. The British Pound gains support from reduced UK budget uncertainty and a weaker US Dollar. However, expectations of a Bank of England interest rate cut limit strong bullish bets on the Pound.\nThe Japanese Yen Dynamics\nThe Japanese Yen remains strong due to the Bank of Japan\u2019s hawkish stance, which offsets GBP gains. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has spoken about improving economic and price projections, signalling potential rate hikes that support the Yen. Continued geopolitical concerns from the Russia-Ukraine conflict enhance the Yen\u2019s safe-haven appeal, advising caution before expecting the GBP/JPY cross to appreciate notably.\nRecent currency movements show the Japanese Yen as the strongest against the US Dollar in the past week. Percentage changes reveal that while the Yen gained against several currencies, it lost ground relative to others like the New Zealand Dollar and Australian Dollar. This variability highlights the complex dynamics affecting currency performance in global markets.\nGiven that GBP/JPY is struggling to push higher, we see a clear divergence in central bank policy creating a ceiling. The Bank of Japan is signaling it is ready to raise interest rates, while the Bank of England appears poised to cut them. This fundamental clash is likely to put downward pressure on the currency pair in the coming weeks.\nWe believe the Bank of Japan\u2019s hawkish stance is now backed by data, giving traders confidence. For instance, Tokyo\u2019s Core CPI data released last week for November 2025 came in at 2.7%, remaining stubbornly above the central bank\u2019s 2% target for over a year and a half. This makes Governor Ueda\u2019s recent comments about meeting price projections seem like a direct prelude to a rate hike at the December 19th meeting.\nBank Of England Rate Cut Expectations\nOn the other side of the trade, expectations for a Bank of England rate cut on December 18th are solidifying. The most recent inflation figures from mid-November 2025 showed the headline rate falling to 2.4%, a significant drop and much closer to the BoE\u2019s target. With recent labor market reports also indicating a slowdown, a pre-emptive rate cut to support the economy seems increasingly probable.\nFor derivative traders, this outlook suggests positioning for a drop in GBP/JPY. Buying put options with strike prices below 205.50 could be a viable strategy to capitalize on a potential downturn driven by these policy moves. This allows for profiting from a fall in the pair while clearly defining the maximum risk involved.\nWe remember the sharp JPY rallies seen during 2023 and 2024 when the BoJ merely adjusted its policy language, so an actual rate hike could trigger a significant move. The ongoing geopolitical tensions also provide a supportive backdrop for the safe-haven JPY, adding another layer of caution for anyone holding long positions. Therefore, any strength in the cross towards the 206.50 level could be viewed as a selling opportunity.\nAll eyes should now be on the final UK Services PMI this week for any immediate shifts in sentiment. However, the most significant volatility will surround the central bank meetings in mid-December. Any data release that reinforces the current dovish BoE and hawkish BoJ narrative will likely accelerate the downward pressure on GBP/JPY."

Spot prices look to build on the overnight bounce from the vicinity of a one-week low, touched on Monday, though a combination of diverging forces warrants some caution for bullish traders.\nThe British Pound (GBP) draws some support from an end to the uncertainty surrounding the UK budget and a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD). This, in turn, is seen as a key factor acting as a tailwind for the GBP/JPY cross. However, firming expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates later this month, amid softer inflation and a cooling labor market, hold back the GBP bulls from placing aggressive bets.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, continues with its relative outperformance on the back of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish outlook and caps the GBP/JPY cross. In fact, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Tuesday that the likelihood of the central bank's economic and price projections being met is rising. This was seen as the strongest signal that conditions for a rate hike were falling in place and underpins the JPY.\nApart from this, persistent geopolitical uncertainties stemming from the protracted Russia-Ukraine war and the risk of a further escalation of conflict benefit the JPY's safe-haven status. This further warrants caution before positioning for any meaningful appreciating move for the GBP/JPY cross. Traders now look forward to the release of the final UK Services PMI, which might influence the GBP and provide a fresh impetus.\nJapanese Yen Price Last 7 Days\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies last 7 days.

On crypto, \"my thought process has evolved,\" Fink said, repeating a statement that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said about tariffs during an earlier conversation on the same stage.\nBlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which launched at the beginning of 2024, along with several competitor ETFs, quickly grew to become the largest US-listed bitcoin ETF.\nToday, the ETF has accumulated over $70 billion in assets, becoming the world's fastest-growing ETF and, along with bitcoin holding juggernaut Strategy (MSTR), one of the largest bitcoin holders in the world. The ETF has also become BlackRock's most profitable product.\n(IBIT)\nFink's comments followed a question from the Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin, who noted that in the past, Fink had called crypto \"an index for money laundering.\" Fink interjected, adding, \"and thieves.\"\nStill, volatility for bitcoin remains a feature of the asset and crypto markets overall, as evidenced by the wipeout on Oct. 10 and the recent sharp sell-off in crypto.\n\"Bitcoin is still heavily influenced by leveraged players,\" Fink said. \"That's why you\u2019re going to have more volatility.\"\nRead more: Is now the time to invest in bitcoin?\nLike many in the traditional financial world, Fink also touted tokenization as crypto's real opportunity to transform the traditional finance world.\nEarlier this week, Fink and BlackRock COO Rob Goldstein laid out the case for how all of finance \u2014 from stocks and bonds to real estate and infrastructure assets \u2014 could exist on blockchains in a column published in The Economist.\n\"The whole idea ... is to just reduce huge friction costs, making investing easier, simpler ... it's going to allow it for, I would say, a free-flowing process in investing,\" Fink said.\nBlackRock and other Wall Street firms still need to Senate to vote on crypto market structure legislation, known as the Clarity Act, before diving deeper into those efforts. The act is written to establish a framework for which regulators would oversee certain tokenized assets and effectively solidify the crypto industry's policy wins secured during the Trump administration."

Speaking to Bloomberg, Gensler highlighted that many tokens do not provide tangible returns or dividends, making them speculative investments. This remark came as Bitcoin approached $92,000 after a volatile week marked by bond market turbulence and shifting institutional positions.\nGensler emphasized the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, pointing to the lack of underlying value in most tokens. He explained, \u201cYou have to ask yourself, what\u2019s the fundamentals? What\u2019s underlying it?\u201d He made it clear that Bitcoin stands apart, suggesting that it holds more credibility than the thousands of alternative tokens in circulation. Despite this, he acknowledged that even Bitcoin remains volatile and subject to market fluctuations.\nVanguard Reverses Stance on Crypto ETFs\nOn the same day Gensler made his remarks, Vanguard, a leading asset manager, reversed its policy on cryptocurrencies. Vanguard allowed its 50 million clients to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana ETFs. This shift in stance came under the leadership of CEO Salim Ramji, who had previously led BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF initiative. The policy change led to a market surge, with Bitcoin jumping 6% on the first day of the new trading conditions.\nThe market responded positively, with Vanguard\u2019s move sparking an immediate surge in trading volume. Within 30 minutes, $1 billion in IBIT volume was recorded. Vanguard\u2019s decision marks a dramatic shift from its earlier opposition to cryptocurrency, signaling increasing institutional acceptance. The company now offers regulated spot ETFs from industry leaders such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and Bitwise.\nBitcoin\u2019s Recovery and Market Outlook\nBitcoin\u2019s price rebounded toward $92,000 following the end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative tightening policy. The Fed\u2019s actions injected $13.5 billion into the market, spurring growth in digital assets. Despite previous market turbulence, including declines triggered by Japanese rate hike expectations, the cryptocurrency market continued to grow, with Ethereum and XRP also showing gains.\nGary Gensler\u2019s cautious outlook on cryptocurrencies contrasts with the broader market optimism following these developments. Analysts like Michael Van De Poppe have predicted Bitcoin could test new highs, potentially reaching $100,000 in December. However, they caution that if Bitcoin loses support at $92,000, it could face a pullback to $88,000 to $90,000."

                "body": "- Ethereum underwent its second major upgrade of the year on Wednesday.\n- The upgrade, Fusaka, further reduces the cost of transactions on layer 2 blockchains.\n- A minor upgrade will follow on December 9.\nEthereum underwent its second major upgrade of the year on Wednesday, further reducing the cost of transactions on affiliated layer 2 blockchains while improving user experience and hardening the network against a common exploit.\nThe upgrade, codenamed Fusaka, also sets the stage for future upgrades that could increase the throughput of Ethereum itself.\nSince the Merge, the network\u2019s momentous 2022 upgrade, improvements have come at an annual clip. But a crisis of confidence early this year has led to renewed urgency among Ethereum developers, and Fusaka\u2019s release comes just seven months after the previous upgrade, Pectra.\nWhile highly decentralised, Ethereum has long faced a major barrier to mass adoption: it gets congested, sending transaction fees soaring. Layer 2 blockchains have emerged as a workaround, processing transactions affordably while using Ethereum as a settlement layer.\nFusaka\u2019s chief feature is a substantial increase in the amount of data that layer 2 blockchains can send to Ethereum.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this new technique that people have been working on for a very long time,\u201d Alex Stokes, Ethereum Foundation, said on a livestream hosted by EthStaker on Wednesday. \u201cIt lets us scale while not compromising on the values that are so important to Ethereum.\u201d\nLayer 2s send packets of data known as blobs to Ethereum for settlement. Fusaka introduces a concept known as peer data availability sampling, or PeerDAS, which allows individual nodes to store a fraction of blob data without compromising their ability to verify the entirety of that data.\nLayer 2 blockchains can currently send a maximum of 9 blobs per block. After Wednesday\u2019s upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s blob capacity will jump eightfold, though increases will be implemented slowly in a series of smaller upgrades enabled by Fusaka.\n\u201cWe could say here, in just a few minutes, dial this knob up 8x,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cGiven this is a very new technique, and we\u2019re not sure how the network will respond, this is not the wisest decision.\u201d\nThe first mini-upgrade is scheduled for December 9 and will increase maximum blob capacity to 15. A second upgrade scheduled for January 7 will increase max capacity to 21 blobs per block.\nAccording to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, PeerDAS could eventually make it cheaper to transact on Ethereum itself.\n\u201cWe think of blobs as being for L2s,\u201d he said on the livestream Wednesday. \u201cIn the long term, we want to dump L1 data into blobs as well.\u201d\nOther improvements in Fusaka will allow users to sign transactions using biometrics \u2014 leveraging smartphones\u2019 facial recognition technology, for example \u2014 and will harden Ethereum against denial-of-service attackers, who attempt to render the network useless by clogging it with a flood of spam transactions.\n\u201cThere are, like PeerDAS in here, a pile of strategic upgrades that frankly are not going to be visible tomorrow,\u201d Paul Brody, of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, said on the livestream.\n\u201cWe actually already have more network transaction capacity than we really need. But we are laying the foundation on the road to a trillion transactions a day, and we will need every single [upgrade] by the time we are done.\u201d\nEthereum\u2019s next major upgrade, Glamsterdam, will be implemented sometime in 2026 and include improvements expected to lower the cost of using Ethereum mainnet.\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": "Ethereum Launches Fusaka Upgrade to Make Network More Scalable\nEthereum has rolled out its Fusaka upgrade, a major step that lets the network handle more transactions while prioritizing safety and decentralization.\nFusaka centers on EIP-7594: PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling), a system that enables Ethereum nodes to verify that block data is complete without downloading everything. This increases the network\u2019s capacity while keeping it safe and decentralized.\nEthereum \u2013 the world\u2019s largest smart contract blockchain with a total value locked (TVL) of over $73 billion in decentralized finance (DeFi) \u2013 processes 1.3 to 1.8 million transactions per day, according to Etherscan data.\nETH is up 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\u201cIt makes Ethereum more scalable without compromising decentralization. That is the entire point,\u201d Jason Chaskin, Ethereum Foundation Apps Relation Lead, explained to The Defiant. \u201cThe trade-off is that this path has taken almost a decade of research and engineering. It is the hard way to scale a blockchain, but it avoids the shortcut of forcing everyone into data centers.\nHe added that Fusaka also raises the Layer 1 (L1) gas limit from 45 million to 60 million units and introduces an R1 signature precompile, which makes it cheaper and easier for developers to use passkeys in Ethereum apps. For Layer 2 (L2) networks, which already have very low fees, Fusaka ensures they remain that way.\n\u201cPeerDAS gives rollups more blob space, and that space is only going to increase over time,\u201d Chaskin said. \u201cOn speed, L2s are already extremely fast. Arbitrum is about 250 ms, and Base is around 200 ms, for example.\u201d\nThe upgrade is an important step in Ethereum\u2019s plan to handle more transactions and prepare for future improvements. Since most activity now happens on L2s like Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, lowering data costs is key to keeping fees low and supporting more users.\n\u201cThis is the first step of L2 data scaling. Ethereum will increase blob capacity slowly and methodically once operators and researchers are confident it is safe,\u201d Chaskin said. \u201cThe good news is these increases can happen through blob-only forks, so we do not need to wait for a giant hard fork every time.\u201d\nHe emphasized that the main risk is that this is new software running live for the first time, so the rollout will be careful. Still, he added that for the first time, Ethereum will have reliably low fees over the long term.\n\u201cThat changes what developers can build and what users can expect. When you know fees will stay under a penny, whole new categories of applications become viable,\u201d Chaskin said. \u201cIt makes Ethereum the most predictable environment to build in.\u201d\nThe upgrade comes just a few weeks after the Ethereum Foundation revealed new details about its upcoming Interop Layer, a system that aims to make the network\u2019s growing Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem work like a single, unified chain.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

Fusaka \u2013 a blend of the names Fulu + Osaka \u2013 consists of two upgrades happening on Ethereum\u2019s consensus and execution layers at the same time. The goal of the upgrade is to enable Ethereum to handle the large transaction throughput from the layer-2 chains that use the blockchain as their base layer. Fusaka consists of 12 code changes, also known as \u201cEthereum Improvement Proposals\u201d (EIPs) that will make the layer-2 experience faster and cheaper. The biggest change in Fusaka is known as PeerDAS, which allows validators to check only segments of data instead of full \u201cblobs,\u201d easing bandwidth demands and lowering expenses for both validators and layer-2 networks. Layer 2s currently submit thousands of transactions to Ethereum via \u201cblobs,\u201d where validators currently on the Ethereum blockchain have to download all of the transaction data from the blob to verify it is accurate, creating bottlenecks. With this improvement, those validators will only need to verify a fraction of a blob, speeding up the process and lowering the transaction fees that come with it. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\nANTHROPIC STUDY ON DEFI AI AGENTS: AI agents are getting good enough at finding attack vectors in smart contracts that they can already be weaponized by bad actors, according to new research published by the Anthropic Fellows program. A study by the ML Alignment & Theory Scholars Program (MATS) and the Anthropic Fellows program tested frontier models against SCONE-bench, a dataset of 405 exploited contracts. GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5 collectively produced $4.6 million in simulated exploits on contracts hacked after their knowledge cutoffs, offering a lower bound on what this generation of AI could have stolen in the wild. The team found that frontier models did not just identify bugs. They were able to synthesize full exploit scripts, sequence transactions and drain simulated liquidity in ways that closely mirror real attacks on the Ethereum and BNB Chain blockchains. The paper also tested whether current models could find vulnerabilities that had not yet been exploited. GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5 scanned 2,849 recently deployed BNB Chain contracts that showed no signs of prior compromise. Both models uncovered two zero-day flaws worth $3,694 in simulated profit. One stemmed from a missing view modifier in a public function that allowed the agent to inflate its token balance. Another allowed a caller to redirect fee withdrawals by supplying an arbitrary beneficiary address. In both cases, the agents generated executable scripts that converted the flaw into profit. Although the dollar amounts were small, the discovery matters because it shows that profitable autonomous exploitation is technically feasible. \u2014 Sam Reynolds Read more.\nETHEREUM DEVELOPERS PUSH ZK PROTOCOL FOR PRIVACY: Ethereum developers are refining a zero-knowledge protocol designed to bring stronger privacy guarantees to on-chain interactions, starting with a \u201cSecret Santa\u201d-style matching system that could evolve into a broader toolkit for private coordinatio"

                "body": "Solana Mobile to roll out native taken in January\nSolana is set to roll out the awaited native token tied to its latest mobile phone model, Seeker, at the start of 2026, with the coin set to be the governance token of the company\u2019s mobile ecosystem.\nSolana Mobile announced in an X post on Wednesday that the \u201cSKR\u201d token will have a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with 30% allocated for airdrops and 25% reserved for growth and partnerships.\nAn additional 10% of the token\u2019s supply will be for liquidity, 10% for a community treasury, 15% for Solana Mobile and 10% for Solana Labs, the mobile arm\u2019s parent company.\nSolana Mobile said in May that it was planning to launch the SKR token, saying it would give owners of its new Seeker smartphone, which came pre-loaded with crypto apps and features, \u201cactual ownership in the platform.\u201d\nThe company shared that the token would have \u201clinear inflation to incentivize early participants\u201d who stake it, but it would share more on the token at the upcoming Solana Breakpoint Conference on Dec. 11 to 13.\nSolana Mobile eyes ecosystem growth with SKR\nA key selling point Solana Mobile initially marketed for the Seeker was its decentralized application (DApp) store, which hosts over 100 Solana-based DApps as the firm looked to expand beyond the phone just being seen as a \u201crewards magnet\u201d like its first variant, the Saga.\nWhile it has had some teething issues since launch, Solana Mobile has indicated that the SKR token will be utilized to bolster the DApp store and ecosystem surrounding the phone.\nAlongside the SKR announcement, Solana Mobile also introduced \u201cguardians,\u201d which will \u201cvalidate trust\u201d across its phone ecosystem.\n\u201cAt launch, SKR serves as a growth and coordination mechanism: stake to Guardians, support builders, secure devices, curate the DApp Store,\u201d Solana Mobile said. \u201cAs the ecosystem scales, SKR ensures its value flows back to the community that powers it.\u201d\nRelated: Solana onchain flows flag notable supply shift as SOL trades near key support\nOn the user end, SKR holders will be able to earn rewards from staking the asset with guardians. Solana Mobile will be the first guardian, with others joining later in 2026, such as Helius Labs, Double Zero and Triton One.\n\u201cGuardians verify device authenticity, review DApp submissions, and enforce community standards,\u201d the post stated.\nThe news has coincided with a small bump in the price of Solana (SOL), with the price sitting at around $140 before the announcement. It is now at $145.68, up 5.4% over the past 24 hours."

The report is the last month jobs reading for the Federal Reserve before its meeting on interest rates next week. The CME FedWatch tool points to an 89% likelihood the Fed will cut rates by a quarter-percentage point.\nIn addition, The Information reported that Microsoft (MSFT) is lowering AI software sales quotas \"as customers resist newer products.\" Shares of the tech giant closed 2.5% lower to lead Dow decliners.\nThe other Magnificent Seven large-cap technology stocks were mixed, with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), the world's most valuable company, down 1% after having recorded gains the first two days this week.

Shares of fellow chipmakers ON Semiconductor (ON) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) rose 11% and 5.7%, respectively.\n- Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares added 6.9% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to \"overweight\" from \"equal weight\" and lifted its price target. Analysts pointed to growing optimism around Vertex's pipeline of kidney treatments, with data from Phase 3 clinical trials of two experimental drugs, Pove and Inaxaplin, anticipated next year.\n- Shares of Delta Airlines (DAL) rose 3.6% after it warned that the government shutdown, which disrupted air traffic across the country, likely cost the carrier about $200 million in pre-tax profit in the current quarter.

                "body": "Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P futures signal modest gains after stock market rally amid Fed rate cut bets\nSynopsis\nUS stock futures traded mixed as investors digested a surprise drop in ADP jobs data, increasing the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut at the December 10 meeting. Major indexes closed higher earlier, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.9%. Tech stocks, particularly in the AI sector, showed caution amid upcoming earnings reports.\nEarlier premarket sessions showed Dow futures at 47,600 (+0.12%), S&P 500 futures at 6,848 (+0.11%), and Nasdaq 100 futures at 25,614 (+0.03%), aligning with broader bets on cheaper borrowing costs impacting mortgages and credit.\nKey influences on stock futures movement\nThe key driver behind the futures movement was growing anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut, with markets pricing in roughly an 85% probability of a 25 basis point reduction in December 2025, according to CME FedWatch data.This shift was fueled by comments from Fed officials and weak ADP jobs data, which together suggested the Fed may lower rates at the upcoming December 9-10 FOMC meeting to support a weakening labor market and sustained economic growth risks.\nNotably, major banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs revised their outlooks to expect a December cut, reversing earlier predictions for a January move. However, some uncertainty remained due to mixed economic signals, including rising inflation pressures.\nThe artificial intelligence sector struggled on Wednesday, with tech being the weakest S&P 500 group due to declines in Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom. Microsoft shares fell 2.5% after a report claimed it lowered AI software sales targets amid customer resistance, but the stock rebounded following Microsoft's denial of the report.\nAdditionally, premarket volatility was influenced by tech sector caution and Bitcoin price fluctuations, with significant earnings from tech companies such as Salesforce and Snowflake set to impact sentiment. Globally, mixed performances in Asian and European markets added to the measured tone.\nFAQs\nHow might earnings impact futures volatility?Salesforce and Snowflake results could sway tech-heavy Nasdaq futures, with AI momentum and data workloads key amid rate-sensitive trading.\nMarket odds for a 25 basis point Fed cut stand near 85%, backed by Fed officials' comments and economic data trends, although some uncertainty persists."

                "body": "The UK's benchmark FTSE 100 index has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth throughout 2025, defying earlier economic anxieties to approach the symbolic 10,000-point threshold. As of early December 2025, the index has delivered a \"jaw-dropping\" total return of approximately 19.3% year-to-date, significantly outperforming some global counterparts like the S&P 500. This robust performance is largely fueled by a confluence of anticipated interest rate cuts by the Bank of England, a resurgence in key sectors, and attractive corporate valuations, painting a cautiously optimistic picture for the broader UK stock market.\nHowever, beneath the surface of record highs, the UK market navigates a complex landscape of underlying economic fragility and global uncertainties. While investor confidence appears to be on the rise, driven by evolving monetary policy and targeted government initiatives, concerns about slower economic growth and a fragile fiscal position persist. The immediate implications point towards continued optimism for equities, particularly mid-caps, and a strategic rotation into value-oriented and sector-specific opportunities, even as the market grapples with liquidity challenges and stiff competition from international financial hubs.\nThe UK Market's Ascent: A Detailed Look at 2025's Defining Moments\nThe journey to the FTSE 100's near 10,000-point milestone has been shaped by a series of pivotal events and policy shifts throughout 2025. After peaking at 5.25% in August 2023, the Bank of England (BoE) embarked on a series of monetary easing measures, delivering three quarter-point interest rate cuts during 2025, bringing the base rate down to 4%. This dovish pivot by the BoE has been a primary catalyst, significantly bolstering equity valuations and providing a much-needed tailwind for the financial sector. Further rate cuts are widely anticipated in December 2025, potentially lowering the base rate to 3.75%, with more reductions forecasted into 2026.\nThe timeline leading to this market surge also includes Chancellor Rachel Reeves' budget announcement, which, despite initial mixed reactions to its \u00a326 billion in tax rises and increased spending commitments, introduced measures aimed at boosting UK equity ownership. Reforms such as a stamp duty holiday on newly listed shares and proposed ISA reforms requiring a portion of the allowance to be allocated to UK stocks have been viewed positively by market participants. Additionally, loosened capital rules from the BoE provided a direct boost to banking stocks, which are key components of the FTSE 100.\nKey players and stakeholders involved in this market narrative include the Bank of England, whose monetary policy decisions have been paramount, and the UK government, whose fiscal policies and initiatives are shaping the investment landscape. Large multinational corporations listed on the FTSE 100, benefiting from a weaker pound that enhances overseas revenues, have also been significant drivers. Initial market reactions to these developments have been largely positive, evidenced by rising trading volumes and renewed investor optimism, particularly towards sectors poised to benefit from lower interest rates and strategic government support.\nCompanies Poised for Gains and Those Facing Headwinds\nThe current market dynamics are creating distinct winners and losers among public companies trading on the UK stock market. Companies within the financial services sector are clear beneficiaries of the Bank of England's interest rate cuts. Lower borrowing costs improve the economic outlook, reduce the risk of loan defaults, and can stimulate lending activity. Major banks such as Lloyds Banking Group (LSE: LLOY) and Barclays (LSE: BARC) have seen their valuations propped up by these expectations, and further rate cuts in December and into 2026 are expected to continue supporting their share prices.\nThe energy sector and basic resources companies have also been strong performers, del"

[2]\n- By 08:30 GMT, Vox Markets put the index at 9,689.46 (-0.13%), with the mid\u2011cap FTSE 250 at 21,945.86 (-0.16%). [3]\n- A late\u2011morning snapshot from Lloyds Bank\u2019s market page showed the FTSE 100 at 9,687.79 (-0.14%), the FTSE 250 at 21,923.18 (-0.27%) and most broader UK indices modestly lower, while the tech\u2011heavy techMARK eked out small gains. [4]\nReal\u2011time data from Google Finance had the FTSE 100 trading around 9,690\u20139,700 late in the morning, with a day range of roughly 9,684\u20139,705 and a 52\u2011week range of 7,544.83\u20139,930.09, underlining how close the index remains to its record highs near 10,000. [5]\nOn the continent, Germany\u2019s DAX was up about 0.3%, while France\u2019s CAC 40 slipped fractionally, mirroring the \u201cno clear direction\u201d tone across Europe. [6]\nMacro backdrop: Fed cut hopes, UK services slowdown and stronger sterling\nFed and US data in focus\nThe mood in London is still heavily influenced by the US Federal Reserve:\n- Traders are pricing in a 25 bps Fed rate cut next week, with US ADP employment data later today treated as an unusually important guide because the official non\u2011farm payrolls report has been delayed by the ongoing US government shutdown, according to commentary from Interactive Investor quoted by Vox Markets. [7]\n- ADP is expected to show only around 10,000 jobs added in November, down from 42,000 in October, heightening debate about whether the US labour market is finally cooling. [8]\nA more dovish Fed would normally support equities, but after a strong run into record territory, investors appear reluctant to chase the FTSE 100 higher without clearer data.\nBank of England, capital rules and growth outlook\nTuesday\u2019s session was dominated by the Bank of England\u2019s surprise decision to ease capital requirements for UK banks for the first time since the global financial crisis, after the sector sailed through stress tests. [9]\n- Reuters reported the move lifted major bank shares by around 0.9\u20131.6% on Tuesday and helped the FTSE 100 briefly trade higher before closing flat. [10]\n- The OECD simultaneously boosted its forecast for UK growth in 2026, crediting the government\u2019s recent budget, adding a medium\u2011term positive but not enough to move markets sharply on the day. [11]\nYet the Bank has also warned that the global AI boom is being fuelled by heavy leverage, with AI\u2011linked equities representing a large share of US market capitalisation and valuations approaching dot\u2011com levels. That leaves UK equities vulnerable to global risk\u2011off episodes even if AI exposure at home is more limited. [12]\nUK and eurozone PMI: cooling at home, warming on the continent\nFresh PMI data added nuance to the growth story:\n- A Lloyds\u2011linked market note highlighted that UK services growth slowed in November, with \u201cweakening conditions and fragile client confidence,\u201d confirming that the domestic economy remains soft. [13]\n- In contrast, eurozone business activity expanded at its fastest pace since early 2023, driven by services, suggesting external demand may help UK multinationals even as the home market lags. [14]\nPound recovery takes some shine off exporters\nSterling\u2019s rebound toward $1.32 on Wednesday morning, after recent weakness, is another subtle headwind for FTSE 100 exporters whose overseas earnings are translated back into pounds.

                "body": "Steve Cropper, guitarist and member of Stax Records' Booker T and the M.G.'s, dies\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. \u2014 Steve Cropper, the lean, soulful guitarist and songwriter who helped anchor the celebrated Memphis backing band Booker T. and the M.G.'s at Stax Records and co-wrote the classics \"Green Onions,\" \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay\" and \"In the Midnight Hour,\" has died. He was 84.\nPat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, said Cropper's family told her that Cropper died on Wednesday in Nashville. The foundation operates the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, located at the site of the former Stax Records, where Cropper worked for years.\nA cause of death was not immediately known. Longtime associate Eddie Gore said he was with Cropper on Tuesday at a rehabilitation facility in Nashville, where Cropper had been after a recent fall. Cropper had been working on new music when Gore visited, he said.\n\"He's such a good human,\" Gore said. \"We were blessed to have him, for sure.\"\nThe guitarist, songwriter and record producer was not known for flashy playing, but his spare, catchy licks and solid rhythm chops helped define Memphis soul music. At a time when it was common for white musicians to co-opt the work of Black artists and make more money from their songs, Cropper was that rare white artist willing to keep a lower profile and collaborate.\n'Play it, Steve!'\nCropper's very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \"The Blues Brothers\" and played on their hit cover of \"Soul Man.\"\nIn a 2020 interview with The Associated Press, Cropper discussed his career and how he mastered the art of filling gaps with an essential lick or two.\n\"I listen to the other musicians and the singer,\" Cropper said. \"I'm not listening to just me. I make sure I'm sounding OK before we start the session. Once we've presented the song, then I listen to the song and the way they interpret it. And I play around all that stuff. That's what I do. That's my style.\"\nRolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, asked once about Cropper, said simply, \"Perfect, man.\" On a YouTube instructional video, guitar virtuoso Joe Bonamassa says Cropper's moves are often copied.\n\"If you haven't heard the name Steve Cropper, you've heard him in song,\" Bonamassa said.\nHe got his first guitar at 14\nCropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.\nCropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with \"Last Night.\"\nSatellite soon was later renamed Stax, where some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys formed Booker T. and the M.G.'s. Featuring Cropper, keyboard player Booker T. Jones, bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, they were known for their hit instrumentals \"Green Onions,\" \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"Time Is Tight,\" and backed Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others.\nThe racially integrated band, a rarity in its day, was so admired that even non-Stax artists recorded with them, notably Wilson Pickett. Jones, who is the only surviving member of the band, and Jackson are Black. Dunn and Cropper are white.\n\"When you walked in the door at Stax, there was absolutely no color,\" Cropper said in the AP interview. \"We were all there for the same reason \u2014 to get a hit record.\"\nInspired by "

Bycroft, 83, of Roseville, IL, passed away on Tuesday, December 2, 2025 at his home in the arms of the only woman he ever loved.\nHoward was born August 17, 1942, in Monmouth, IL, to Clarence and Mary (Beard) Bycroft. He was raised and educated in Roseville, where he attended Roseville High School and began developing the strong work ethic that would guide him throughout his life.\nOn July 14, 1962, Howard married Susan Felt in Roseville, Illinois. Their marriage of more than six decades was a source of deep joy, partnership, and devotion. Susan lovingly survives him. Howard\u2019s greatest joy in life was his family and he thoroughly enjoyed harassing and teasing those close to him. He was also a legendary prankster and those blessed with a prank from Howard can attest to this.\nHoward spent his entire life farming in the Roseville area, a vocation he cherished. He took great pride in working the land and caring for his livestock, and he remained dedicated to agriculture until his retirement. Beyond farming, he found pleasure in collecting and showing antique IH tractors and enjoyed spending time outdoors, especially hunting. After retirement Howard enjoyed spending time watching birds and squirrels bickering in the yard. He also served as past president of the American British White Park Association (ABWPA), reflecting his commitment to the farming and livestock community. Howard was a committed member of the Roseville Church of the Nazarene.\nSurviving Howard is his wife, Susan Bycroft of Roseville, IL; two children, Bonnie (Ron) White of Roseville, IL, Vic (Leigh) Bycroft of Ft. Dodge, IA; his grandchildren, Josh (Leanna) Anderson of Muscatine, IA, Rachel (Brandon) Blackman of Kirkwood, IL, Aysah Dondlinger of Brookings, SD; three great grandchildren; and several step grand and great grandchildren.\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, and one sister, Ellen Solomon. Also awaiting him on the other side of the rainbow bridge are his faithful companions, Rags and Patchy.\nMemorial Services will be held at 10:30 a.m., Friday, December 5, 2025 at McGuire & Davies Funeral Home and Crematory, Monmouth, IL. Cremation rites have been accorded. Interment will be in Ellison Cemetery at a later date. A potluck will follow the service at the funeral home, and the family invites you to join them to share your memories.

                "body": "In the morning session four days ago, the Nikkei Stock Average rose significantly by 731.56 yen from the previous day to close at 50,596.24 yen, marking its third consecutive day of gains. The TOPIX (Tokyo Stock Price Index) also rebounded sharply, rising by 51.86 points to 3,386.18 points, surpassing its previous record closing high of 3,381.72 points set on November 13. Continued expectations of interest rate cuts in the U.S. market on the 3rd led to further gains in the NY Dow and Nasdaq Composite Index. In the Tokyo market, the strong momentum from the previous day carried over due to the rise in U.S. stocks. The market absorbed profit-taking pressures steadily, maintaining robust movements. By 11:28 a.m., the Nikkei Average had widened its gains to 734.66 yen higher at 50,599.34 yen, closing the morning session near its intraday highs. AI and robotics-related stocks such as Fanuc <6954.T> and Yaskawa Electric <6506.T> surged. The dollar-yen exchange rate stood around 155.30 yen, reflecting a slight weakening of the yen from earlier levels.\nTrading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime Market reached 1.05249 billion shares, with a total trading value of 2.6527 trillion yen. The number of advancing issues exceeded 80%, with 1,328 stocks rising, while 227 declined, and 54 remained unchanged.\nBy sector, 31 out of the 33 industries recorded gains, while two declined. Wholesale stocks like Itochu <8001.T> and Mitsubishi Corp <8058.T>, as well as securities and futures-related stocks such as Daiwa Securities Group <8601.T> and Nomura <8604.T>, advanced. Machinery stocks like Disco <6146.T> and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T>, as well as information and communication stocks such as KDDI <9433.T> and SoftBank Group <9984.T>, also performed strongly. Mining stocks including INPEX <1605.T> and Petroleum Resources Development <1662.T>, and electrical equipment stocks like Hitachi <6501.T> and Keyence <6861.T> remained solid. Steel stocks such as Nippon Steel <5401.T> and JFE Holdings <5411.T>, along with transportation equipment stocks like Toyota <7203.T> and Honda <7267.T>, were firm as well. On the downside, fishery and agriculture stocks such as Nissui <1332.T> and nonferrous metal stocks like Furukawa Electric <5801.T> and Sumitomo Electric <5802.T> declined.\nOther notable gainers included AD Works <2982.T>, Nabtesco <6268.T>, Sinfonia <6507.T>, Nachi-Fujikoshi <6474.T>, and Sekisui Chemical <4228.T>. Conversely, decliners included Uchida Yoko <8057.T>, Sumitomo Pharma <4506.T>, WOWOW <4839.T>, AGC <5202.T>, and Digital HD <2389.T>.\nProvided by: Wealth Advisor Co."

                "body": "Japan heads into Thursday\u2019s Tokyo Stock Exchange session with risk appetite recovering, the yen strengthening, and bond yields at multi\u2011year highs \u2013 a tricky mix for the Nikkei 225 right as investors eye a potential Bank of Japan rate hike later this month. [1]\nKey points before the Tokyo open (Thursday, 4 December 2025)\n- Nikkei just reclaimed the 50,000 area after a powerful tech\u2011led rebound on Wednesday, even as the broader Topix lagged. [2]\n- BoJ expectations have flipped hawkish after Governor Kazuo Ueda said the bank will debate the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of raising rates at the 18\u201319 December meeting, pushing JGB yields to their highest levels since 2008. [3]\n- The yen has strengthened back toward \u00a5155 per dollar, and Rabobank now forecasts USD/JPY \u201csafely back below 150\u201d within three months, a key risk for Japan\u2019s exporters and equity bulls. [4]\n- Wall Street rallied again overnight, with the Dow up about 0.9% (more than 400 points) as weak private\u2011sector jobs data reinforced market bets on a Fed rate cut next week. [5]\n- Japan\u2019s services PMI stayed firmly in expansion at 53.2 in November, and the composite PMI rose to 52.0, underscoring domestic resilience despite export softness. [6]\n- Bond markets remain volatile ahead of a 30\u2011year JGB auction, with super\u2011long yields at record highs as investors brace for both BoJ tightening and heavy government issuance. [7]\nBelow is a deeper dive into the main drivers that could shape Thursday\u2019s session in Tokyo.\n1. How Tokyo closed on December 3 \u2013 and why it matters for the open\nAfter a bruising start to the week driven by BoJ shock, Tokyo\u2019s equity market showed clear signs of healing on Wednesday.\n- Nikkei rebound: Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose roughly 1\u20131.5% on Wednesday, trading around the 50,000 mark at one point and closing just shy of that psychological level. Gains were concentrated in large\u2011cap tech and AI\u2011linked names. [8]\n- Topix lag: The broader Topix index actually finished lower on the day, dragged by banks and some domestic cyclicals, highlighting that the rally was narrow rather than broad\u2011based. [9]\nSector moves on Wednesday (Tokyo): [10]\n- Chip & tech winners:\n- Advantest: +~4.5%\n- Tokyo Electron: roughly +4%\n- Renesas Electronics: nearly +7%\n- SoftBank Group: around +4% intraday; other reports noted gains above 6% later in the day as AI optimism and headlines about Nvidia exposure drove flows.\n- Banks under pressure:\n- MUFG and SMFG each slipped about 2% as investors took profits following earlier gains tied to rate\u2011hike speculation.\n- Autos softer:\n- Toyota, Honda and Nissan all fell around 0.5\u20131%, reflecting concerns that a stronger yen could squeeze overseas earnings.\nWhy this matters for Thursday:\n- The headline index looks strong, but under the surface breadth was weak and interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive names struggled \u2013 a pattern that can easily flip if global risk sentiment wobbles or if bond yields lurch higher again. TS2 Tech+1\n- For Thursday\u2019s open, traders will be asking whether the tech\u2011led relief rally can extend, or whether we see rotation back into banks and value if bond market stress eases.\n2. BoJ rate\u2011hike bets and surging JGB yields are still the big story\nThe biggest macro driver for Japanese assets this week remains the Bank of Japan.\nUeda\u2019s hawkish signal\nOn Monday, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered his clearest hint yet that another rate rise is on the table, saying the bank would weigh the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of hiking at the 18\u201319 December meeting. [11]\nMarkets are now largely pricing in a 25bp move to 0.75%, while watching carefully for guidance on the pace of further tightening.\nJGB yields at multi\u2011year highs\nJapanese government bonds have been hit hard:\n- 10\u2011year JGB yield: around 1.89%, the highest since 2008.\n- 5\u2011year yield: about 1.39%, highest since mid\u20112008.\n- 2\u2011year yield: just above 1.0%, near a 17\u2011year peak.\n- 30\u2011year yield: 3.425%, a record, ahead of Thursday\u2019s long\u2011bond auction. [12]\nSelling has been driven by a double whammy of:\n- Rising expectati"

                "body": "Chip and tech names jumped on Fed rate-cut hopes, even as bank and auto stocks fell and most Tokyo-listed shares ended lower overall\n1 day ago \u2022 3 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei index inched up 0.7% to 49,670 on Wednesday \u2013 powered mostly by big tech and chip names \u2013 even as nearly 70% of Tokyo-listed stocks fell and the broader Topix index slipped 0.37%.\nWhat does this mean?\nJapan\u2019s stock market is looking like a tale of two economies. On one side, tech and chip-related firms \u2013 including Advantest, Tokyo Electron, Renesas Electronics, and tech investor SoftBank Group \u2013 jumped as they tracked Wall Street\u2019s tech rally, fueled by growing bets that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week. Lower US rates tend to prop up growth and tech stocks around the world by making future earnings more valuable and loosening financial conditions. On the other side, investors are cashing out of sectors that have already surged: major banks like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group fell around 2% after a strong run-up on expectations that the Bank of Japan might lift rates at its December 18 \u2013 19 meeting. Automakers such as Toyota, Honda, and Nissan also slipped, as a strengthening yen threatens to squeeze exporters\u2019 profits \u2013 so with just 26% of prime-market stocks rising versus 69% falling, the Nikkei\u2019s gain is papering over broad selling pressure underneath.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: One index many different stories.\nThe split between a rising Nikkei and a falling Topix shows how a few heavyweight stocks can haul headline indices higher even when most shares are under pressure. Tech and chip firms now wield outsized clout in Japan, a bit like the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d in the US: when they surge on global rate-cut hopes or booming AI demand, they can offset weakness in banks, autos, and smaller domestically focused firms. The retreat in Japanese bank shares after a strong rally also underlines how hypersensitive rate-linked sectors are to every hint from the Bank of Japan, with Governor Kazuo Ueda openly debating the pros and cons of the first proper hike in years. For global investors, this all drives home that Japan\u2019s market is being tugged by two powerful forces at once \u2013 a US-led tech cycle shaped by Fed policy and a homegrown rate story driven by the BoJ.\nThe bigger picture: Japan sits at the crossroads of global policy shifts.\nTokyo\u2019s next moves will be steered by both US and Japanese central banks. If the Fed starts trimming rates, extra global liquidity could keep fueling growth and tech stocks, boosting Japanese chipmakers that plug into worldwide supply chains. At the same time, even a modest BoJ rate hike would mark a sharp break from decades of ultra-loose policy, with knock-on effects for bank profitability, the yen\u2019s strength, and export-heavy sectors like autos. That mix could reshape capital flows across Asia, as investors rethink Japan\u2019s role as a low-yield funding hub and a manufacturing powerhouse. The current gap between the Nikkei and the broader market is an early hint that this transition could be bumpy and uneven.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nNews\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 2 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
