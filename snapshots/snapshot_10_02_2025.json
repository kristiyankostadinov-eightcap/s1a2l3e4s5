The rally comes at the precise moment the U.S. government entered its first shutdown in seven years, a political impasse that immediately heightened safe-haven demand. Tuesday\u2019s close at $3,840.80 marked a weekly climb of 3.1% from $3,769.80 and a monthly surge of 13.3% from $3,432.50. Compared with October 1, 2024, when gold opened at $2,631.40, prices have gained an extraordinary 47.7% year-over-year, underscoring the scale of capital rotation into the metal.\nShutdown Shakes Confidence and Pushes Capital Into Gold\nThe shutdown has slashed government activity and left the Bureau of Labor Statistics operating with just one employee out of 2,055, delaying critical labor data that guides monetary policy. The absence of official reports forces traders to rely on private surveys such as ADP payrolls. Historically, shutdowns have been neutral to slightly positive for markets, but the timing of this one, colliding with high inflation and tariff uncertainty, has amplified demand for gold. Risk assets from equities to corporate bonds have softened while investors move decisively into bullion.\nTechnical Picture of Gold Futures and Spot Levels\nOn the COMEX, December futures trade at $3,898.40, up $25.20 or 0.65% intraday. Spot sits at $3,871.88 after touching the record high, with resistance now re-anchored around $3,922 and psychological projections already circling $4,000. Support sits first at $3,840, Tuesday\u2019s close, and deeper at $3,800 where heavy liquidity has been observed. Analysts point to overbought momentum, but rather than triggering correction, it has turned into consolidation at elevated levels. Goldman Sachs recently upgraded year-end projections to $3,700 when gold was at $2,633; now, markets are discussing whether $4,000 is imminent before Q4 ends.\nCentral Banks Intensify Gold Buying\nThe International Monetary Fund confirmed global central banks acquired 400 tons of gold in 2022, the highest since records began, and accumulation has continued into 2025. China, India, and Turkey remain leading buyers, diversifying away from the U.S. dollar amid fiscal concerns. BNP Paribas Fortis strategists emphasize that central banks were the first to bid aggressively, and now that private investors are joining, the rally has accelerated sharply. At present, gold and gold-related investments still account for barely 2% of global portfolios, which analysts argue leaves considerable room for capital inflows.\nInflation, Tariffs and the Macro Backdrop\nConsumer prices in the U.S. rose 3.7% year-over-year in the latest release, keeping real yields negative and making gold structurally attractive. At the same time, tariff uncertainty under the Trump administration has widened volatility in industrial commodities and equities, while enhancing the appeal of hard assets. The dollar index weakened on shutdown fears, compounding gold\u2019s upside momentum. Europe\u2019s central banks, led by the ECB, recently lifted rates again to tame inflation, destabilizing equities and indirectly favoring bullion demand.\nAsian and Global Market Dynamics\nAsian holidays, particularly China\u2019s Golden Week, usually compress liquidity and flatten returns in early October. Yet gold has ignored seasonal weakness, surging despite reduced participation in Asia. In the Philippines, gold is priced at PHP 7,233.92 per gram, reflecting the translation of international prices into local currency strength. Glo"

Amidst these complexities, investors worldwide are turning more attention towards the best gold stocks for inflation, seeking both stability and strategic growth in their portfolios.\nIn this definitive guide, we explore the top gold mining stocks and the best gold-silver mining stocks for 2025: which companies offer resilience, value, and a sustainable hedge in uncertain times? From Newmont and Barrick to Agnico Eagle and Pan American Silver, we analyze each company\u2019s strengths as a strategic asset and highlight why diversified exposure to precious metals like gold and silver matters now more than ever.\nWe\u2019ll also review investment criteria, sustainability trends, and how innovative technologies\u2014such as satellite-based monitoring by Farmonaut\u2014contribute to the operational stability and long-term value in the mining sector.\nWhy Gold Mining Stocks Matter in 2025\nGold has long held its reputation as a safe store of value\u2014a beacon of stability as inflation erodes currency purchasing power. But in 2025, what makes gold mining stocks more than just a traditional hedge?\n- Operational Leverage: Unlike physical gold, mining stocks offer magnified gains when gold prices rise, thanks to the high operational leverage embedded in the sector.\n- Dividends and Growth: Many leading mining companies, such as Newmont and Barrick, provide dividends and invest in future growth, delivering returns that bullion alone cannot.\n- Market Stability: Gold mining companies act as a barometer of market stability, often outperforming during inflationary or volatile periods as fear drives demand for precious metals.\n- Diversification: The best gold silver mining stocks create a natural hedge, as gold and silver often react differently to market forces, smoothing overall portfolio returns.\n- ESG and Sustainable Practices: Modern investors increasingly reward companies with clear environmental and social governance strategies, making operational efficiency and sustainability key differentiators.\nThe global economy is unwavering in its demand for gold and silver as both industrial inputs and monetary reserves. As inflation persists, demand for assets viewed as reliable stores of value\u2014and the companies producing them\u2014remains robust.\nTop Gold Mining Stocks to Watch in 2025\nTo discover the best gold stocks for inflation in 2025, we focus on companies with strong operational fundamentals, diversified geographic reach, transparent ESG practices, and proven value creation. Here are the standouts to consider for your portfolio.\n1. Newmont Corporation (NEM)\n- Position: World\u2019s largest gold miner, leader in mining, cash flow, and global scale\n- Operations: Extensive mines in the Americas, Australia, and Africa\n- Strengths: Diversified assets, strong free cash flow, robust balance sheet\n- Sustainability: Advanced mining technologies and sustainable environmental practices\n- Strategy for 2025: Focused on selective production expansion and further adoption of ESG protocols, aligning with rising investor expectations\nWhen inflation or gold prices rise, Newmont\u2019s operational leverage means net income and dividend growth are often magnified. As the top gold mining corporation globally, Newmont remains a prime candidate "

                "body": "The EUR/USD pair gains ground near 1.1735 during the Asian trading hours on Thursday. The concern over the impact of the US government shutdown undermines the US Dollar (USD) against the Euro (EUR). The US weekly Initial Jobless Claims will not be published in light of the ongoing federal shutdown.\nThe US federal government shut down on Wednesday after a deadlocked Congress failed to reach a deal on funding. Government agencies warned this would halt the release of the closely watched September employment report, among other things. The US President Donald Trump administration on Wednesday froze $26 billion for Democratic-leaning states, following through on a threat to use the shutdown to target Democratic priorities.\nMarkets expect further policy easing at the Fed\u2019s October meeting to be a lock, with Fed funds futures implying a 99.4% chance of a 25-basis-point (bps) cut, up from 96.2% a day earlier, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nThe US Supreme Court said on Thursday that it would hear arguments in January over Trump's attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, leaving her in the post for now. Easing concerns about the Fed\u2019s independence might help limit the USD\u2019s losses in the near term.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said there are no serious threats to the outlook for euro-area inflation but that officials must remain vigilant. Her remarks indicated that the ECB is in no rush to lower borrowing costs further. This, in turn, supports the shared currency against the USD.\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone\u2019s economy.\nAnother significant data release for the Euro is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over"

                "body": "Key points for the Euro 2025 Q4 outlook\n- Euro breakout extends more than 17% off the yearly lows- rallies seven of the past eight-months\n- FOMC cuts rates for the first time since December amid elevated inflation & softening employment\n- ECB nearing end of easing cycle as inflation approaches 2% target- remains \u2018data dependent\u2019\n- EUR/USD breakout exhausts into technical resistance into the close of Q3\n- Correction risk rises into the close of the year- broader outlook constructive while above 2024 highs\nEuro has rallied more than 13% since the start of year with EUR/USD marking the largest single-year range since 2022 and the largest yearly advance since 2017. Price has seen just one monthly-decline this year (July) and while a breakout of a multi-year downtrend keeps the broader focus higher, the advance may be vulnerable into the close of the 2025 as price struggles at a key technical resistance.\nFederal Reserve Spotlight\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points for the first time this year in September as concerns over a softening labor market began to mount. In the latest FOMC rate decision, Chair Powell cited that, \u201cThere is No Risk-Free Path,\u201d as the risks to inflation are to the upside, while the risks to employment are to the downside. Powell specifically noted that the decision to cut rates was largely an \u201cinsurance\u201d against the potential of a sharper slow down rather than a full pivot to stimulate the economy.\nThe comments suggest that the Fed\u2019s dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices remain at odds with inflation still running well-above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. In fact, the latest read on Core Personal Consumption Expenditures show prices up 2.9% y/y in August and with equity markets at all-time highs and unemployment at 4.3%, one could make the argument that the Fed should be on hold, if not raise rates. Historically, inflation is a harder beast to tame than employment and in the current environment, the Fed does risk losing inflation-fighting credibility should prices continue rise; a risk the market has yet to appreciate.\nOne of the \u2018X\u2019 factors for inflation remains the potential impact of tariffs. In his most recent press conference, Chair Powell noted that the \u201creasonable base case\u201d scenario is that tariffs will be a one-time shift in prices that is likely to occur over several quarters. What that means for policy remains to be seen and despite the inflation risk, market participants are still pricing in another 25 basis point cut in October and December.\nFOMC Summary of Economic Projections\nSource: FOMC\nThe latest Summary of Economic Projections showed an improving growth outlook for 2025 with the committee revising real GDP to 1.6%, up from 1.4% in June. Despite core PCE still expected to end the year above 3%, the updated interest rate dot plot continues to suggest many committee members see scope for at least one more rate cut this year. It\u2019s worth noting that the distribution has widened out considerably and shows that committee members remains split on the appropriate stance for monetary policy.\nFOMC Interest Rate Dot Plot\nSource: FOMC\nAs of late-September, Fed Fund Futures continue to price a 67% chance the central bank will cut another 50 basis points by the end of the year. With investors still insisting lower rates are on the horizon, the risk is for the Fed to disappoint markets- especially if tariffs begin to put further upward pressure on prices and thwart future cuts. For the US Dollar, this could offer a reprieve from the recent selling pressure we\u2019ve seen throughout 2025.\nSource: CME\nECB Nearing End of Rate-Cut Cycle?\nIn June, the European Central Bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points with the central bank signaling it will remain \u2018data-dependent\u2019 in the months ahead as inflation in the Euro area approaches the 2% target. In her last press conference, ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that \u2018the disinflation process is over\u2019 and the market census has "

The U.S. government officially shut down at midnight after Congress failed to pass a funding bill, leaving federal workers furloughed and raising the risk of delayed economic data releases. This political paralysis pressured the dollar broadly, allowing the euro to consolidate above the 1.1710 support zone despite intraday dips to 1.1720.\nLabor Market Weakness Shifts Fed Policy Expectations\nThe ADP Employment Change report showed a 32,000 private-sector job loss in September, a major disappointment versus the 50,000 increase expected and far worse than the August revision, which dropped from a gain of 54,000 to a loss of 3,000. The soft labor market print triggered an immediate reaction in EUR/USD, with the pair spiking from its low near 1.1720 back toward the 1.1750 handle. The weak labor picture adds to speculation the Federal Reserve may have to accelerate its easing cycle, further undermining the dollar.\nEurozone Inflation Stays Firm as ECB Holds Steady\nAcross the Atlantic, the preliminary September Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in the Eurozone rose 2.2% year-on-year, while Germany\u2019s CPI jumped to 2.4% from 2.2% in August. Core HICP remained steady at 2.3%. These figures confirm inflation remains sticky in Europe, reinforcing the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to keep policy restrictive for now. Still, the euro failed to gain sustained momentum from the data, showing investors remain more focused on U.S. developments.\nISM Manufacturing PMI Expected to Improve Slightly but Stay in Contraction\nLater in the session, attention shifts to the ISM Manufacturing PMI, expected at 49 for September versus 48.7 in August. A reading below 50 would still reflect contraction, but any upside surprise could limit the dollar\u2019s losses. Traders are watching whether the shutdown and deteriorating labor conditions weigh further on business confidence, potentially locking the U.S. economy into a soft patch as Q4 begins.\nTechnical Picture: Resistance at 1.1780 Caps Upside Momentum\nTechnically, EUR/USD set an intraday high at 1.1778, just below the critical resistance at 1.1780. A break above this zone would expose 1.1830 and 1.1880 as the next upside targets, potentially opening the door to a retest of the late-September highs near 1.1820. On the downside, immediate support lies at 1.1710\u20131.1715, followed by 1.1685 and 1.1650. Longer-term moving averages remain supportive, with the 100-day and 200-day SMAs trending higher well below current levels, keeping the risk skewed to the upside.\nRead More\n-\nMSTY ETF Climbs to $14.35 With 179% Yield as Bitcoin ETF Inflows Top $430M\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs XRPI and XRPR Surge as $2.94 XRP Price Rides ETF Flows, SEC Ruling, and Institutional Demand\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - (NG=F) Breaks Higher to $3.35 as Pipeline Cuts Pressure Waha and Winter Demand Rises\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Slumps to 147.00 as BoJ Tightening Bets Rise and U.S. Shutdown Hits Dollar\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nMarket Sentiment and Seasonal Bias Favor EUR/USD Bulls\nSeasonality also plays a role.

The pair may further appreciate as the Pound Sterling (GBP) receives support from the cautious remarks from the Bank of England (BoE) officials.\nBoE policymaker Catherine Mann said Wednesday that the risk of \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d inflation is materializing, emphasizing concerns over persistent price pressures. Mann added that keeping rates on hold is appropriate for the current period.\nBoE Deputy Governor Clare Lombardelli warned on Tuesday that officials should not consider inflation shocks as temporary. Lombardelli stated that an increase in inflation could be from a one-off event, but its impact could prove to be more persistent.\nThe GBP/USD pair also draws support as the US Dollar (USD) struggles after the United States (US) government shutdown on Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a funding deal. The September US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report will not be released on Friday, as the Labor Department has paused virtually all activity.\nThe US ADP Employment Change report, released on Wednesday, showed that private sector payrolls declined by 32,000 in September and annual pay growth was up 4.5% year-over-year. This figure followed the 3,000 decrease (revised from a 54,000 increase) reported in August and came in below the market expectation of 50,000.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. There"

Sterling\u2019s momentum was fueled by disappointing U.S. labor data, growing certainty around Federal Reserve rate cuts, and the political and economic disruption caused by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. The move reflects a decisive shift in sentiment as traders rotate out of the dollar, driving the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) to 97.50, near a one-week low.\nLabor Market Weakness: ADP Misses by 82,000 Jobs\nADP private-sector payrolls showed a surprise 32,000 job loss in September, against expectations for a 50,000 gain. The shock worsened after August\u2019s figures were revised from a previously reported +54,000 to a -3,000 decline. The adjustment highlights persistent fragility in U.S. hiring trends. Economists had argued that Q2 growth near 3% should underpin jobs, but instead companies are showing caution. The weak print adds heavy weight to Friday\u2019s upcoming Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) release\u2014already threatened by the government shutdown\u2019s impact on Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting.\nU.S. PMI Mixed, Dollar Unable to Rebound\nManufacturing data failed to provide relief for the dollar. The S&P Global Manufacturing PMI held steady at 52.0, while the ISM measure inched up to 49.1, still below the growth threshold. Although this was a mild improvement from 48.7 in August, it kept the manufacturing economy in contraction territory. Traders responded by marking down dollar value further, particularly against currencies with stronger macro backdrops like the British pound.\nSterling Strength Reinforced by UK Growth Surprise\nSterling\u2019s push higher came not only from dollar weakness but also from solid domestic data. UK Q2 GDP expanded 1.4% year-over-year, beating the consensus of 1.2%, with quarterly growth steady at 0.3%. The upside surprise offset dovish comments from BoE policymaker Dave Ramsden, who warned of restrictive policy\u2019s impact on jobs and investment. For markets, the stronger GDP print underlines resilience in the UK economy despite tight monetary conditions and gave the pound an additional boost in its climb above 1.3450.\nShutdown Fallout Amplifies Sterling\u2019s Advantage\nThe U.S. government shutdown has now placed more than 750,000 federal workers on furlough, delaying essential economic data and deepening concerns about fiscal mismanagement. Market participants worry that without timely releases\u2014particularly the September NFP\u2014the Fed will rely heavily on private reports like ADP and ISM, which have already disappointed. This structural uncertainty magnifies pressure on the dollar and plays directly into GBP/USD\u2019s surge toward the 1.3530\u20131.3600 resistance zone.\nMarket Positioning: Fed Cuts Nearly Fully Priced\nInterest rate markets have accelerated their bets on Federal Reserve easing. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, traders now assign a 97% probability of a cut in October and a 76% probability of another cut in December. This represents one of the most aggressive pricing cycles since the pandemic, sharply undermining the dollar\u2019s yield advantage. Sterling\u2019s relative appeal grows in this context, even though the BoE faces pressure to cut in early 2026.\nRead More\n-\nMSTY ETF Climbs to $14.35 With 179% Yield as Bitcoin ETF Inflows Top $430M\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs XRPI and XRPR Surge as $2.94 XRP Price Rides ETF Flows, SEC Ruling, and Institutional Demand\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - (NG=F) Breaks Higher"

Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback\u2019s performance against a basket of six major currencies, is hovering near 97.50, close to a one-week trough.

                "body": "- AUD/USD failed to move too far in either direction on Wednesday.\n- Australian Trade Balance figures are due early Thursday.\n- US government shutdown has crimped the flow of critical inflation and jobs data.\nAUD/USD took a breather on Wednesday, churning in place near 0.6620 after a three-day gain streak that saw the US Dollar (USD) rebound from a three-week low of 0.6520 against the Australian Dollar (AUD). The US government has entered it\u2019s fourth federal shutdown during Donald Trump\u2019s two terms as president, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has warned that it will not be able to deliver the latest Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) jobs data amid a federal shuttering.\nAustralia\u2019s Trade Balance is expected to have dipped to 6.5 billion in August. Imports declined 1.3% in July, alongside a 3.3% uptick in Exports during the same period, bringing Australia\u2019s July Trade Balance to 7.31 billion MoM. Australian Trade Balance data drops at 01:30 GMT. Australian S&P Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data will also land on late on Thursday at 23:00 GMT. Australian Services PMIs are expected to hold steady at 52.0 for September.\nThis week\u2019s hotly anticipated US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) jobs report is at risk of being delayed or suspended. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a government shutdown will result in official dataset releases being suspended until federal operations resume.\nADP Employment Change figures came in much lower than the street expected, showing a contraction of -32K in September versus the expected 50K. August\u2019s initial print of 54K was also revised sharply lower to -3K. ADP jobs figures suffer from constant revisions, but the figure has generally missed expectations for all but three of the monthly figures published since the start of 2025.\nWith the NFP print in jeopardy, investors are leaning further on private data such as ADP. According to the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool, rate trader bets of another quarter-point interest rate cut on October 29 surged to 99% post-ADP on Wednesday. Rate markets are also pricing in nearly 90% odds of a third-straight rate trim on December 10, and a further 93% that the Fed will deliver a fourth interest rate cut by next April at the absolute latest.\nAUD/USD daily chart\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is A"

The move was caused by a Bloomberg...\nQuick overview\n- AUD/USD dropped sharply to around 0.6600 due to a Bloomberg report about China's state iron-ore buyer advising steelmakers to stop purchasing from BHP.\n- Domestic economic indicators show Australia is facing challenges, with the AiG Industry Index in contraction and building permits down 6% in August.\n- The RBA maintained interest rates at 3.6%, while the U.S. Dollar is influenced by expectations of an October rate cut and a potential government shutdown.\n- For traders, a close above 0.6630 could signal a long position towards 0.6660, while a drop below 0.6585 may warrant a short position.\nDuring European hours, AUD/USD was trading around 0.6600 before dropping sharply. The move was caused by a Bloomberg report that China\u2019s state iron-ore buyer told steelmakers to stop buying from BHP \u2013 a major Australian exporter. The news spooked markets and knocked confidence in the Aussie. Mysteel later denied the directive but the damage was done.\nDomestic Data Adds to Pressure\nAustralia also had its own headwinds. The AiG Industry Index remained in contraction at -13.2 despite a small lift. The S&P Global Manufacturing PMI cooled to 51.4 from 53.0 showing expansion slowing. Building permits fell 6% in August and continued a weak trend. These local data points show the Australian economy is under pressure \u2013 limiting the upside for AUD even without external shocks.\nCentral Banks & U.S. Factors at Play\nThe RBA left rates at 3.6% with Governor Bullock saying wait and see rather than forward guidance. Meanwhile the U.S. Dollar is being nudged lower by expectations of a October rate cut (97% priced in) and a U.S. government shutdown. These factors are making AUD/USD more reactive to cross border news flows than domestic strength.\nAUD/USD Technical Outlook: A Roadmap\nOn the 4-hour chart AUD/USD has reclaimed its 50-EMA (~0.6585) and 100-EMA (~0.6572). A pattern of higher lows since late September suggests bullish pressure. RSI is at 61.7 not overbought yet. A three white soldiers pattern pushed price higher but resistance at 0.6630 capped momentum.\n- Close above 0.6630 could open up to 0.6660-0.6706\n- Failure to hold 0.6585-0.6570 could see a pullback to 0.6560 or 0.6523 (trendline support)\nAUD/USD Trade Setup\nOne simple trade: wait for a close above 0.6630 with volume. If that happens you can go long AUD/USD to 0.6660 then 0.6706. Stop loss below 0.6570 to protect against false breaks. Risk/reward is good if momentum continues. If price reverses and goes below 0.6585 consider short or sit out.\n- Check out our free forex signals\n- Follow the top economic events on FX Leaders economic calendar\n- Trade better, discover more Forex Trading Strategies\n- Open a FREE Trading Account"

                "body": "The AUD/USD pair holds onto gains near 0.6620 during the European trading session on Wednesday. The Aussie pair demonstrates strength as the US Dollar (USD) continues to face selling pressure, with Washington entering a shutdown.\nAt the time of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades lower to near 97.70.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s midnight, government funding expired after Republicans failed to pursuade Democrats to support the short-term funding bill in the House of Senate, which was expected to extend shutdown deadline to November 21.\nThe impact of partial US government closure will be significant on the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) decision in the monetary policy meeting later this month, as the majority of key economic data releases, including Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data, would halt. Such a scenario increases the significance of the ADP Employment Change data for September, which will be published at 12:15 GMT.\nIn the September monetary policy, the Fed reduced interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 4.00%-4.25%, citing labor market risks.\nEconomists expect US private employers to have added 50K fresh workers, slightly lower than 54K IN August.\nMeanwhile, the Australian Dollar (AUD) struggles to extend Tuesday\u2019s gains that were driven by the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) monetary policy announcement. On Tuesday, the RBA held its Official Cash Rate (OCR) steady at 3.6% and signaled no urgency for interest rate cuts.\nRBA Governor Michelle Bowman also warned that inflationary pressures could prove to be persistent in the near term. \u201cComponents of monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) are little higher than expected, inflation is not running away,\u201d Bullock said.\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing in new purchases. It is usually positive for the US Dollar."

The yen\u2019s strength has been reinforced by rising speculation of Bank of Japan (BOJ) tightening after two policymakers dissented at the latest meeting, while the Tankan survey showed resilience across manufacturing and services. With the dollar under pressure and the yen leading FX majors, traders are watching Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report for the next catalyst.\nView related analysis:\n- ASX 200 Morning Outlook: October Brings Bullish Bias and High Volatility\n- Gold Outlook: Rising Implied Volatility on Path to $4000\n- Australian Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, GBP/AUD\n- Japanese Yen Price Action Setups: USD/JPY, AUD/JPY, GBP/JPY\nUSD/JPY Slides As Yen Strength Meets US Dollar Weakness\nADP Jobs Data Pressures the US Dollar\nA weak ADP private payrolls report sparked fresh bets of a Fed cut, weighing on the US dollar and yields. The -32k print marked the fastest contraction since March 2023, while August\u2019s figure was revised down sharply to -3.5k from 54k. However, some concerns were tempered after it emerged that missing September data inputs meant the calculations had a much \u201ccoarser granularity than in previous years\u201d.\nEven so, the employment trend is clearly weakening, helping set the tone for Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report. The US dollar clawed back some of its earlier ADP-driven losses but remains under pressure ahead of NFP.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: ADP, LSEG\nBOJ Dissents Fuel Japanese Yen Rally\nThe Japanese yen has extended its rally this week on renewed expectations of Bank of Japan (BOJ) tightening. While the BOJ kept rates unchanged, two board members dissented, signalling growing appetite for policy shifts. The quarterly Tankan survey also highlighted resilience, with the large manufacturers\u2019 index climbing to 14 and the services outlook reaching a four-decade high of 28.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: Bank of Japan (BOJ)\nYen Outperforms Across FX Majors\nThe Japanese yen is currently the strongest FX major this week, while the US dollar is the weakest. USD/JPY has dropped -1.6% from Monday\u2019s open, while CHF/JPY is down -1.9% from last week\u2019s multi-year high. EUR/JPY is tracking a weekly bearish engulfing pattern, down -1.4%, and the Canadian dollar has fallen to a 13-week low against the yen. Even the Australian dollar has lost ground, with AUD/JPY turning lower after yesterday\u2019s sharp selloff.\nWith the prospects of a BOJ hike returning alongside economic data potentially forcing the Fed\u2019s dovish hand, I can revisit my earlier bias of a major high forming on USD/JPY.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nUSD/JPY Weekly Technical Outlook: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nThe rally from the April low on the USD/JPY weekly chart continues to look corrective, pointing to an eventual move to fresh lows. A shooting star candle beneath the March high in late July signalled weakness, and USD/JPY now appears on track to form a lower high followed by a bearish engulfing week.\nThe 50-week SMA has acted as resistance since early July, capping momentum. Bears may look to fade minor rallies, with the September low at 145.48 as the first target. A break beneath this level exposes the 143.87 high-volume node (HVN). Should the corrective phase from the April low be complete, USD/JPY could trade below 138.50 in the coming weeks or months.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nUSD/JPY Daily Levels To Watch\nUSD/JPY has now declined for a fourth consecutive day, with daily ranges expanding into the lows. This raises the risk of late sellers being caught short near support, suggesting bears may prefer to wait for a period of consolidation or a corrective bounce before re-engaging.\nThe 200-day EMA and the monthly pivot point "

Investors seem convinced that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will stick to its policy normalization path and hike interest rates in October. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs two more times by the end of this year. The resultant narrowing of the US-Japan rate differential might continue to benefit the lower-yielding JPY.\nMeanwhile, the market reaction to the US government shutdown, so far, has been muted amid expectations of a limited impact on the economic performance. This remains supportive of a generally positive risk tone, which, in turn, is seen undermining the JPY's safe-haven status. The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, struggles to capitalize on the overnight bounce from a one-week low amid dovish Fed expectations. This keeps a lid on the USD/JPY pair's modest uptick and suggests that any meaningful rise might still be seen as a selling opportunity.\nJapanese Yen is undermined by receding safe-haven demand; BoJ-Fed divergence favors bulls\n- US government agencies began shutting down after President Donald Trump's Republican Party failed to agree with opposition Democrats on a way forward on a spending bill. Investors, however, seem relatively unfazed, as shutdowns have historically had a limited impact on the economic performance.\n- Wall Street's three major indices registered gains for the fourth consecutive day, and the spillover effect is evident from a generally positive tone across the Asian equity markets. This turns out to be a key factor undermining the safe-haven Japanese Yen during the Asian session on Thursday.\n- The main event risk from Japan this week will be the Liberal Democratic Party leadership election on Saturday, 4th October. The new Prime Minister will influence the trajectory of Japan's fiscal policy, which could further determine the Bank of Japan's policy stance and drive the JPY in the near term.\n- Meanwhile, the Summary of Opinions from the September BoJ meeting, released on Tuesday, revealed that board members debated the feasibility of raising interest rates. Moreover, traders are pricing in the possibility of a 25-basis-point BoJ rate hike later this month, which should limit JPY losses.\n- In contrast, the CME Group's FedWatch Tool indicates that traders have fully priced in a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in October and see around a 90% probability of another rate reduction in December. The bets were lifted by the disappointing US private-sector employment details.\n- Automatic Data Processing reported on Wednesday that private companies shed 32,000 jobs in September, marking the biggest drop since March 2023. Moreover, the August payrolls number was also revised to show a loss of 3,000 compared to an increase of 54,000 reported initially.\n- Separately, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in slightly above consensus estimates and improved from 48.7 to 49.1 in September. This, however, still pointed to a contraction in the manufacturing business activity for the seventh straight month.\n- The immediate effect of a partial US government shutdown is likely to be a delay in key US macro releases, including the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims on Thursday and the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday. This leaves the US Dollar at the mercy of speeches from FOMC members.\nUSD/JPY holds above 100-day SMA support; not out of the woods yet\nFrom a technical perspective, the overnight breakdown below the 147.00 mark could be seen as a key trigger for the USD/JPY bears.

The September US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report will not be released on Friday, as the Labor Department has paused virtually all activity.\nThe US ADP Employment Change report, released on Wednesday, showed that private sector payrolls declined by 32,000 in September and annual pay growth was up 4.5% year-over-year. This figure followed the 3,000 decrease (revised from a 54,000 increase) reported in August and came in below the market expectation of 50,000.\nThe USD/CAD pair could also lose ground as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) receives support from improving Oil prices. It is worth noting that Canada is the largest Oil exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price rises to near $62.00 per barrel at the time of writing. However, crude Oil prices remain close to four-month lows amid oversupply concerns. OPEC+ is set to meet this weekend, sparking speculation it may raise output beyond plans.\nCanada\u2019s S&P Global Manufacturing PMI slipped to 47.7 in September 2025 from 48.3 in August, signaling a continued contraction in factory activity. This marked the eighth straight month of decline in the manufacturing sector.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact o"

Oil prices fall as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, known as OPEC+, signaled a larger output increase for next month, while uncertainty over a potential US government shutdown raised concerns about economic activity and fuel demand.\nHowever, the US Dollar (USD) faces challenges after the latest jobs figures from the United States (US), which boosted the likelihood of further Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in 2025. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in nearly a 97% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and a 76% possibility of another reduction in December. Traders are likely to await September\u2019s US ADP Employment Change and ISM Manufacturing PMI data later in the day, though their release could be disrupted by the government shutdown.\nThe US government has entered a shutdown, leaving about 750,000 federal employees furloughed after Congress failed to pass funding bills.

Despite the mixed bag of bullish...\nQuick overview\n- USD/CAD has traded sideways above 1.3910 for two consecutive days amid mixed market factors.\n- The Canadian Dollar is under pressure from weak crude oil prices and expectations of further rate cuts by the Bank of Canada.\n- The US Dollar is facing its own challenges with anticipated Fed rate cuts and potential government shutdown risks.\n- Technically, USD/CAD is consolidating below 1.3960, with a bullish outlook if it breaks above 1.3963.\nUSD/CAD traded sideways for the second day in a row in Europe, holding above 1.3910. Despite the mixed bag of bullish and bearish factors, the bigger picture suggests higher in the medium term.\nThe Canadian Dollar is being pressured by weak crude oil prices, with Brent and WTI near multi-month lows as traders price in an OPEC+ production boost. Since oil is Canada\u2019s number one export, its underperformance hits the Loonie directly.\nAnd adding to the pressure, expectations of more BoC rate cuts are gaining traction. Governor Tiff Macklem recently said policies to shield growth while managing inflation, which means the Loonie could see more downside ahead.\nDollar Deals with Fed Cuts and Shutdown Risks\nOn the US side, the Greenback is capped by its own issues. Markets expect the Fed to cut rates twice this year and the risk of a US government shutdown is still out there. These have kept the US Dollar Index (DXY) near weekly lows.\nBut traders are eyeing upcoming data releases like ADP private payrolls and ISM Manufacturing PMI. Stronger than expected could give the dollar a short term boost and allow USD/CAD to extend its move.\nKey takeaways:\n- Oil prices are weighing on CAD.\n- BoC easing expectations support USD/CAD.\n- US Fed cut bets and shutdown fears cap dollar strength.\nUSD/CAD Technical Outlook: Bulls Eye 1.4000\nTechnically, USD/CAD is consolidating just below 1.3960 after the big rally from mid-September. The pair is respecting the ascending trendline, a series of higher lows.\n- 50-EMA (1.3878) has held as support.\n- 100-EMA (1.3829) underpins the bullish structure.\n- Resistance at 1.3963 and 1.3977 with 1.4000 as the target.\n- RSI at 54 is cooling but not in bearish divergence.\nIf buyers can close above 1.3963, the way to 1.4000 is clear.

The yen\u2019s strength has been reinforced by rising speculation of Bank of Japan (BOJ) tightening after two policymakers dissented at the latest meeting, while the Tankan survey showed resilience across manufacturing and services. With the dollar under pressure and the yen leading FX majors, traders are watching Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report for the next catalyst.\nView related analysis:\n- ASX 200 Morning Outlook: October Brings Bullish Bias and High Volatility\n- Gold Outlook: Rising Implied Volatility on Path to $4000\n- Australian Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, GBP/AUD\n- Japanese Yen Price Action Setups: USD/JPY, AUD/JPY, GBP/JPY\nUSD/JPY Slides As Yen Strength Meets US Dollar Weakness\nADP Jobs Data Pressures the US Dollar\nA weak ADP private payrolls report sparked fresh bets of a Fed cut, weighing on the US dollar and yields. The -32k print marked the fastest contraction since March 2023, while August\u2019s figure was revised down sharply to -3.5k from 54k. However, some concerns were tempered after it emerged that missing September data inputs meant the calculations had a much \u201ccoarser granularity than in previous years\u201d.\nEven so, the employment trend is clearly weakening, helping set the tone for Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report. The US dollar clawed back some of its earlier ADP-driven losses but remains under pressure ahead of NFP.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: ADP, LSEG\nBOJ Dissents Fuel Japanese Yen Rally\nThe Japanese yen has extended its rally this week on renewed expectations of Bank of Japan (BOJ) tightening. While the BOJ kept rates unchanged, two board members dissented, signalling growing appetite for policy shifts. The quarterly Tankan survey also highlighted resilience, with the large manufacturers\u2019 index climbing to 14 and the services outlook reaching a four-decade high of 28.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: Bank of Japan (BOJ)\nYen Outperforms Across FX Majors\nThe Japanese yen is currently the strongest FX major this week, while the US dollar is the weakest. USD/JPY has dropped -1.6% from Monday\u2019s open, while CHF/JPY is down -1.9% from last week\u2019s multi-year high. EUR/JPY is tracking a weekly bearish engulfing pattern, down -1.4%, and the Canadian dollar has fallen to a 13-week low against the yen. Even the Australian dollar has lost ground, with AUD/JPY turning lower after yesterday\u2019s sharp selloff.\nWith the prospects of a BOJ hike returning alongside economic data potentially forcing the Fed\u2019s dovish hand, I can revisit my earlier bias of a major high forming on USD/JPY.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: LSEG\nUSD/JPY Weekly Technical Outlook: US Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nThe rally from the April low on the USD/JPY weekly chart continues to look corrective, pointing to an eventual move to fresh lows. A shooting star candle beneath the March high in late July signalled weakness, and USD/JPY now appears on track to form a lower high followed by a bearish engulfing week.\nThe 50-week SMA has acted as resistance since early July, capping momentum. Bears may look to fade minor rallies, with the September low at 145.48 as the first target. A break beneath this level exposes the 143.87 high-volume node (HVN). Should the corrective phase from the April low be complete, USD/JPY could trade below 138.50 in the coming weeks or months.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nUSD/JPY Daily Levels To Watch\nUSD/JPY has now declined for a fourth consecutive day, with daily ranges expanding into the lows. This raises the risk of late sellers being caught short near support, suggesting bears may prefer to wait for a period of consolidation or a corrective bounce before re-engaging.\nThe 200-day EMA and the monthly pivot point "

Subscribe here to unlock access to InvestingPro\u2019s AI-selected stock winners.\nThe US dollar index has come under pressure this week, with USD/JPY emerging as one of the strongest performers across FX market. The latest leg lower in US dollar has been fuelled in part by falling US bond yields, while a slide in oil prices, which tends to benefit energy importers like Japan, has also helped to support the yen.\nBut more to the point, it is the US government shutdown which is keeping the US dollar under pressure across the board. Markets are now weighing up the prospect of an extended stalemate, which could sap consumer confidence and deepen concerns over job security.\nUS Dollar Faces Uncertainty From Both Washington and Data\nThe US dollar index has been edging lower in recent days, with traders keeping one eye on the budget standoff in Washington. Overnight, the greenback took another knock, slipping in the wake of Washington\u2019s failure to avert a government shutdown. Truth be told, this was mostly expected, but the fact that it has happened means there would be a delay for the release of critical jobs data this week, leaving the Fed flying blind on the labour market.\nConsequently, any near-term US dollar recovery attempts could fade.\nRate expectations have already shifted. Traders are pricing around two rate cuts by year-end and over 100 basis points by 2026. This is still slightly less than what markets expected earlier this month. That repricing reflects a tug-of-war between an improving near-term US data pulse and lingering doubts over labour market strength. This means that the risks are tilted to further downside for the US dollar in the event of data disappointment this week.\nConsumer confidence drops\nYesterday, the focus was on the JOLTS job openings data, with expectations for little change. However, it showed a bit of improvement to 7.23m from 7.18m the month before. Nonetheless, the US dollar fell further, possibly because of shutdown fears and the fact that the day\u2019s other data releases were soft.\nIndeed, the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence figures, which were seen ticking lower, were confirmed, but the drop was bigger than expected at 94.2 vs. 96.0 eyed and 97.8 previous. On top of this, the Chicago PMI disappointed at 40.6 vs. 43.3 expected, and down from 41.5 previously.\nYen Finds Tailwinds\nThe Japanese yen appears to be the primary beneficiary of the latest government shutdown, which officially began overnight, and hopes of a quick resolution appear slim. The USD/JPY has dropped to 147.00 handle. Democrats appear to be bracing for a longer fight, positioning themselves as defenders of healthcare ahead of next year\u2019s mid-terms, while Republicans, with control of the congressional agenda and the backing of the White House, show little appetite to compromise.\nThe main concern here is that with an already-weakening consumer confidence and a gloomier jobs outlook, the shutdown could exacerbate these trends if it lasts more than just a few days. If President Trump follows through on threats to dismiss non-essential staff, then as many as 150,000 layoffs could distort upcoming payroll data, with October\u2019s NFP in particular at risk. In the meantime, regular economic reporting will also be disrupted.\nWhile the US dollar struggles, the yen is quietly gaining across the board. The GBP/JPY, for example, has slipped to 198.00 after failing to hold the psychological 200.00 level and amid budget uncertainty in the UK, while the CAD/JPY is under pressure as oil prices extend their slide since the start of the week.\nWhat\u2019s "

This fall in yields increases the price of the bond or fixed income security, making your earlier purchase more attractive.\nOther Fresh Trades By Marjorie Taylor Greene\nAlongside the large government debt purchase, Greene also bought smaller stakes, each between $1,001 and $15,000, in ten different companies and funds.\nThese included tech giants like Alphabet Inc. Class C and Adobe Inc., cybersecurity firmCrowdStrike Holdings Inc., and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.\nMany of the assets in the new filing are familiar names in Greene's investment history. Previous reports from 2025 noted her purchases of both Alphabet and the iShares Bitcoin ETF.\nOne past trade in Alphabet was particularly well-timed, occurring just five days before a favorable court ruling caused the company's stock to rise. This new filing marks at least her third purchase of the Bitcoin ETF this year.\nBuilding a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\nFor those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\nMoomoo isn't just for trading \u2014 it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock\u2014but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\nSoFi Alt Investments\nSoFi gives membersaccess to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.\nRange Wealth Management\nRange Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planni"

Despite trading far below its 52-week high of $46.50, MSTY continues to dominate conversations with an eye-watering 179.88% trailing twelve-month yield. With $4.68 billion in assets, the ETF attracts income-hungry investors willing to trade off NAV erosion for relentless cash flow. Its fate remains tightly bound to MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and, by extension, Bitcoin (BTC-USD), now trading at $117,600 after ETF inflows of over $400 million this week.\nHow MSTY Generates Extreme Yields Through Option Premiums\nMSTY delivers oversized income by writing synthetic covered calls on MicroStrategy\u2019s equity, capturing high option premiums fueled by MSTR\u2019s extreme volatility. Those premiums are distributed monthly, with the latest payout of $1.0105 per share still substantial, though below the $2.28 peak early in 2025. Since inception in February 2024, MSTY has returned over $27 per share in distributions annually, offsetting the 36% decline in share price. Even investors who entered at $43.00 in March 2024 have already recouped a significant portion of capital through cash payouts.\nTotal Returns Still Outpace Broader Market Despite Price Collapse\nMeasured purely on price, MSTY has been a capital-eroding machine. But factoring distributions, its total return since inception stands at 214%, dwarfing the S&P 500\u2019s 36% gain through VOO and SPY. Year-to-date, MSTY has returned +8.89%, while its one-year performance has soared +64.19%, far ahead of its derivative income peers averaging 12.12%. This divergence underscores that MSTY is not designed for appreciation\u2014it is an engineered yield vehicle extracting value from MSTR\u2019s volatility and Bitcoin\u2019s correlation spikes.\nMicroStrategy and Bitcoin Linkage: The Double-Edged Sword\nMSTY\u2019s core exposure is MicroStrategy, which itself holds more than 640,000 Bitcoin worth $72 billion at current spot levels. While BTC has firmed above $117K on the back of record U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, MicroStrategy\u2019s stock has corrected over 35% from April highs, pressured by dilution and tax uncertainty. This decoupling drags MSTY\u2019s NAV lower, but paradoxically boosts its option premium income, as volatility spikes inflate the pricing of calls it sells. With a beta well above 1.5, MSTY behaves like a leveraged bet on both MicroStrategy and Bitcoin ETF momentum, amplifying gains and losses alike.\nRead More\n-\nChevron Stock Price Forecast - CVX Shares at $154 Balances Oil Weakness with Guyana Growth and 4.3% Dividend Yield\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs XRPI and XRPR Surge as $2.94 XRP Price Rides ETF Flows, SEC Ruling, and Institutional Demand\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - (NG=F) Breaks Higher to $3.35 as Pipeline Cuts Pressure Waha and Winter Demand Rises\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nStock Market Today - Stock Market Falls as Shutdown Hits Jobs Data, S&P 500 at 6,670, Nasdaq 22,582, Dow 46,369\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveMarkets\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen Slumps to 147.00 as BoJ Tightening Bets Rise and U.S. Shutdown Hits Dollar\n01.10.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nDistribution Risks: Falling Payouts Could Trigger Rotation\nThe biggest investor concern is sustainability.

                "body": "Ethereum Future Runs On Stablecoins And Tokenized Assets \u2014 Here\u2019s What To Know\nThe narrative surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future has fundamentally shifted, and is rapidly solidifying its role as the global, compliant settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). This strategic transformation is inextricably linked to the dominance of Stablecoins and the explosive growth of Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs).\nNetwork Effects Of Stablecoins And RWA On Ethereum\nIn a recent post on X, the Token Terminal highlighted a key insight focusing on why Stablecoins and RWAs matter for the Ethereum market cap. To date, Stablecoins and RWAs are crucial for ETH, as the market capitalization of tokenized assets on ETH acts as the floor for ETH\u2019s market cap.\nThe reasoning is that as more assets are tokenized on the ETH blockchain, including the massive market of stablecoins and the growing sector of RWAs, the total value locked and secured by the network increases, and the more Ethereum\u2019s market cap benefits.\nA Host and Producer of The Edge_Pod, known as DeFi_Dad, has reflected on how rewarding it feels to finally see stablecoins cementing credibility for Ethereum and the decentralized finance (DeFi).\nFor years, explaining crypto in real life carried negative associations, which were often tied to price speculation or hype. Meanwhile, the narrative has shifted, and stablecoins have provided a clear, relatable entry point, with investors focused on investing in digital money applications using Stablecoins.\nHowever, the expert pointed out that the stablecoins are now so mainstream in the media that even government officials and traditional media are taking them seriously. Unlike Bitcoin, which many people only associate with volatile price action, stablecoins provide practical utility and a way to earn 5\u201310% yields on-chain.\nAccording to DeFi_Dad, most of it is built on ETH and stablecoins, which are like Fundstrat and the ChatGPT moment for crypto, a breakthrough product that clicks instantly for the masses. From there, stablecoins would become the stepping stone into DeFi yield and broader digital asset exposure.\nA Stronger Foundation For Future Development\nAmid the Ethereum advancements, the new Go-Pulse v3.3.0 has officially been released, a major rebase that is going to make the ETH network even faster and more robust. Richard Heart mentioned that the update from the old Go-Ethereum (GETH) v1.13.13 has gone all the way up to the new v1.16.3, which would deliver substantial performance and efficiency improvements.\nHeart credited ETH\u2019s role in the process, noting that the Ethereum mainnet serves as the ultimate testing ground. By proving stability on the ETH, PulseChain is the first to integrate and is the most reliable and optimized software enhancements into its own ecosystem."

Its lowest valuation of the day was US$112,819, while its highest was US$116,808.\nBitcoin price performance, October 1, 2025.\nChart via TradingView.\nBitcoin has struggled to hold support near the US$111,600 to US$113,000 range amid renewed seller pressure and earlier long liquidations during the last days of September.\nAfter that weakness, Bitcoin rebounded into the mid-six figures and was trading around US$116,000.\nBitcoin and other digital assets jumped early on Wednesday as markets digested the fallout from the US government shutdown. While S&P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX) futures slid 0.55 percent overnight and the US dollar briefly tumbled before clawing back losses, Bitcoin rallied more than 2 percent to reach US$116,400, underscoring its safe-haven appeal alongside gold, which spiked 1.1 percent to US$3,913.70 per ounce.\nTrader Ted Pillows noted that Bitcoin climbed above US$116,500 as gold hit a new all-time high. He linked the rally to expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve following the US government shutdown.\nBitcoin dominance in the crypto market is 55.6 percent, showing a slight rise week-on-week.\nEther (ETH) is also performing well, up 3.1 percent over 24 hours to US$4,298.07. Ether opened at its lowest daily valuation, US$4,095.64, before peaking at US$4,315.74 so far.\nPillows argues that Ether must close a strong weekly candle above US$4,000 to confirm upward momentum.

Are we witnessing a long-term trend in cryptocurrency or merely a speculative spike? This recent activity has been attributed to a surge in both transaction volume and active users interacting with decentralized applications (dApps), benefiting from institutional interest and a stronger DeFi ecosystem.\nWhy Are Institutions Finally Paying Attention to Solana?\nRecently, there has been a growing interest from institutional investors, which has contributed to the price increases. Institutions are increasingly likely to invest in projects beyond Bitcoin, but this comes with a caveat: potential regulatory scrutiny. As interest in Solana builds, large players are looking to diversify their portfolios, possibly even amid regulatory uncertainty.\nAre DeFi and NFT Projects Influencing Solana's Momentum?\nIndeed, Solana's decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT markets are gaining traction. With its low transaction fees and significant user engagement, it's poised to capitalize on increased activity. Are these sub-sectors helping build SOM liquidity while generating real value?\nHow Are Technical Improvements Changing the Game?\nSolana's Alpenglow upgrade has boosted network speeds and reliability. Simply put, if you are a developer or a user, improved transaction speeds make a big difference for developers and users, who are now more likely to churn out projects based on the blockchain. Does the enhanced experience offer a competitive edge?\nWhat Are the Regulatory Challenges Ahead?\nRegulatory challenges will likely remain, especially for European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) utilizing crypto payroll. Upcoming EU regulations require compliance with specific KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) protocols. Can Solana's users navigate the murky waters and prevent compliance problems?\nHow Is Solana Tied to Crypto Payroll Projects?\nCrypto payroll is gaining traction, especially in Asia, where fintechs aim to make payment technologies more accessible. Entry of companies like Astra Fintech into Solana currently positions it to facilitate easy conversion and access to fiat currencies. This could radically transform payroll for startups and investors, especially in Asia."

The Solana-native protocol delivers a Solana-native stablecoin that gives all users permissionless access to institutional grade yields via Solstice\u2019s YieldVault.\nUSX and YieldVault bring a new category of stablecoin \u2013 purpose-built for composability, transparency, and native yield through Solstice\u2019s protocol \u2013 to Solana with over $160 million in locked capital (TVL) at launch, backed by Galaxy Digital, MEV Capital, Bitcoin Suisse, Auros and Deus X Capital. Solstice enters this launch with a battle-tested strategy which has historically generated a 13.96% Net IRR with no recorded month-over-month losses since inception.\n\u201cLegacy stablecoins maintain majority market share, yet not a single leading stablecoin was born natively on Solana and no dominant yield-native stablecoins currently exist in the ecosystem. We see stables often being bridged to other chains for best-in-class yield \u2013 that\u2019s stable TVL leaving our ecosystem to try and earn elsewhere. We built USX addressing this market gap on day one, a stablecoin that maintains all of the frictionless transaction benefits while giving access to institutional-grade yields that are native to the protocol,\u201d said Ben Nadareski, CEO and Co-Founder of Solstice.\n\u201cSolstice is driving real, sustainable onchain revenues within the Solana ecosystem and the launch of USX and YieldVault unlocks new opportunities for builders, users, and investors,\u201d said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation.\nA deeper look into Solstice\u2019s ecosystem:\n- USX: A synthetic stablecoin designed for velocity of capital and transparency, backed 1:1 by stable collaterals with real-time Proof of Reserves via Chainlink.\n- YieldVault: As Solstice\u2019s flagship yield engine, YieldVault offers institutional-grade returns generated from proven delta-neutral trading strategies. YieldVault\u2019s returns maintain a trusted three-year track record with 21.5% performance in 2024 and zero months of negative returns since inception.\n- SLX: Solstice\u2019s future native utility token is driven by a community-first distribution model with no VC-backing to align long-term protocol success with community incentives.\n- The Team: Solstice core contributors consist of 30+ crypto and TradFi veterans across 10 countries, with deep experience from Solana Labs, Coinbase, Galaxy Digital, Standard Chartered, Deloitte, UBS, NAB, BlackRock, UXD, ConsenSys, and more.\nUSX holders are now able to access Solstice\u2019s YieldVault by locking their USX into the protocol, receiving eUSX, which represents their share of the underlying net asset value of the licensed yield generating fund.\n\u201cSolstice Labs is now working with over 30 partners in the ecosystem for integration with a sole focus on the Solana ecosystem. We\u2019re excited to finally have USX live and in the market, bringing the best-in-class yield to everyone. Whether you\u2019re managing $5 or $50 million, Solstice unlocks delta-neutral, institutional-grade returns in a transparent and fully permissionless way.\u201d Nadareski continued.\nUSX is now live on Solana and available to all users. To learn more or access USX today, users can visit https://solstice.finance or follow @solsticefi on X.\nAbout Solstice Finance\nSolstice Finance is a decentralised finance protocol developed by Solstice Labs AG, a Deus X Enterprise company, in partnership with the Solstice Foundation. Collectively they are reimagining asset management for the onchain era.

The NASDAQ led with a 0.42% rise, showing that sentiment toward technology shares remains robust. Both the S&P 500 and DOW Jones Industrial Average also advanced, reaching new record highs and reflecting resilience across sectors despite lingering political and economic uncertainties.\nThe gains were modest, yet the upward movement across the board hinted at a stabilizing market mood after a period of volatility. Investors appeared reassured by solid earnings momentum and improving macroeconomic signals, which together underpinned the cautious rally.\nShutdown Fears Ease, but Data Disruptions Loom\nThe threat of a US government shutdown had little impact on Wall Street as markets largely assumed that lawmakers would reach a resolution without major economic disruption. Trading desks remained focused on earnings and the macro backdrop rather than political wrangling.\nHowever, the shutdown will delay key economic reports, with the government closed tomorrow for the Jewish holiday. As a result, the much-anticipated US jobs report scheduled for Friday is unlikely to be released on time, and weekly jobless claims data will also be postponed. The absence of fresh labor market figures may leave investors navigating without crucial data points in the near term.\nClosing Levels \u2013 Major US Indices\nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA):\n- Gained 43.21 points (+0.09%), finishing at 46,441.10.\n- The blue-chip index held steady as investors balanced optimism about upcoming earnings with lingering macroeconomic uncertainties.\nS&P 500:\n- Advanced 22.74 points (+0.34%) to close at 6,711.20.\n- Growth stocks provided most of the lift, with tech and consumer discretionary sectors showing resilience.\nNASDAQ Composite:\n- Rose 95.15 points (+0.42%) to end at 22,755.16.\n- The tech-heavy index outperformed, boosted by renewed buying in mega-cap technology stocks and AI-related names.\nRussell 2000 (Small Caps):\n- Added 5.86 points (+0.24%), closing at 2,442.35.\n- Gains were modest but notable, as small-cap stocks continued to lag behind their large-cap peers amid persistent rate and growth concerns.\nThe Road Ahead\nToday\u2019s session showed broad-based participation, suggesting that market confidence is gradually improving. Still, analysts caution that the sustainability of the rally will depend on whether earnings continue to impress and whether macroeconomic conditions remain supportive.\nDespite lingering political uncertainty in Washington, the day\u2019s strong close underscored the market\u2019s resilience. The coming weeks will test whether this renewed optimism can hold as investors digest delayed data releases and watch for further guidance from both companies and policymakers.\nDow Jones Live Chart\n- Check out our free forex signals\n- Follow the top economic events on FX Leaders economic calendar\n- Trade better, discover more Forex Trading Strategies\n- Open a FREE Trading Account"

                "body": "London's benchmark FTSE 100 index (LSE: UKX) defied global headwinds on October 1, 2025, surging to an unprecedented intraday record high of 9,423.24 points. This landmark achievement underscores a period of robust performance for UK equities, driven by strong sectoral gains and domestic economic tailwinds. The milestone stands in stark contrast to the more subdued sentiment gripping Wall Street, where the commencement of a US government shutdown cast a shadow over market futures, highlighting a divergence in investor confidence between the two major financial hubs.\nThe record-breaking ascent of the FTSE 100 signals a renewed optimism in the British economy and its corporate giants, particularly those in the pharmaceutical sector. While US markets grappled with political uncertainty, the UK index demonstrated resilience, pushing past previous peaks and setting a new benchmark for future performance. This divergence not only provides a fascinating study in market dynamics but also prompts a deeper analysis into the underlying factors propelling each market.\nA New Zenith for British Equities: Unpacking the FTSE 100's Record Run\nThe FTSE 100's historic climb on October 1, 2025, was a culmination of several powerful catalysts. The index, which had already closed at a new high of 9,350.43 points the previous day, extended its gains, breaching the 9,400-point mark for the first time ever. The primary drivers behind this surge were the pharmaceutical heavyweights. Companies such as AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK), and GSK (LSE: GSK) saw significant rallies in their share prices, contributing substantially to the index's upward momentum. This pharmaceutical boost followed news of a significant deal between the Trump administration and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), which included provisions for a government-run website enabling consumers to purchase drugs directly from manufacturers at discounted rates, alongside a three-year reprieve on planned tariffs.\nBeyond the pharmaceutical sector, broader economic indicators also lent considerable support to UK equities. Positive housing data released recently provided a further boost to investor sentiment, suggesting underlying strength in the domestic economy. Concurrently, a strengthening British pound added another layer of support, making UK assets more attractive to international investors. The FTSE 100\u2019s performance in the third quarter of 2025 was exceptional, recording a 6.7% gain \u2013 its best quarterly showing since late 2022. The index also posted a respectable 1.8% increase in September and an impressive 15% year-to-date gain by the end of Q3 2025, setting the stage for its record-breaking start to October.\nIn stark contrast, the mood across the Atlantic was more cautious. While US indices like the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) and Nasdaq 100 (NASDAQ: QQQ) had also enjoyed a robust third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 7.8% and the Nasdaq 100 surging 11.2%, the commencement of a US government shutdown at midnight on September 30, 2025, immediately impacted investor confidence. On October 1, 2025, US futures pointed lower, with S&P 500 futures falling by 0.7% and Nasdaq futures down between 0.25% and 0.68%. This political deadlock raised concerns over potential delays in crucial economic data releases and broader economic uncertainty, leading to a more muted response on Wall Street compared to London's celebratory mood. The FTSE 100's ability to largely shrug off these US-related jitters underscored its unique position and the specific drivers influencing its performance.\nCompanies Poised to Win or Lose in the Evolving Market Landscape\nThe FTSE 100's record high, particularly its reliance on pharmaceutical and other resilient sectors, creates a distinct set of winners and losers. Companies heavily weighted in the index, especially those that drove the recent rally, are clear beneficiaries. Pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), GSK (LSE: GSK), and Hikma Pharmaceut"

                "body": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Tiptree (NASDAQ:TIPT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Tiptree with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\nHow Fast Is Tiptree Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\nOver the last three years, Tiptree has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Outstandingly, Tiptree's EPS shot from US$0.83 to US$1.48, over the last year. It's a rarity to see 78% year-on-year growth like that.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of Tiptree's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note Tiptree achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 6.1% to US$2.0b. That's a real positive.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nSee our latest analysis for Tiptree\nWhile profitability drives the upside, prudent investors always check the balance sheet, too.\nAre Tiptree Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nMany consider high insider ownership to be a strong sign of alignment between the leaders of a company and the ordinary shareholders. So those who are interested in Tiptree will be delighted to know that insiders have shown their belief, holding a large proportion of the company's shares. Owning 39% of the company, insiders have plenty riding on the performance of the the share price. This should be a welcoming sign for investors because it suggests that the people making the decisions are also impacted by their choices. That means they have plenty of their own capital riding on the performance of the business!"

Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\nWix.com's Improving Profits\nWix.com has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. In impressive fashion, Wix.com's EPS grew from US$1.30 to US$2.99, over the previous 12 months. It's a rarity to see 129% year-on-year growth like that.\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Wix.com shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 2.3% to 7.7% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Wix.com?\nAre Wix.com Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$10b company like Wix.com. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$316m. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Wix.com, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m."

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like BGC Group (NASDAQ:BGC). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\nHow Fast Is BGC Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\nEven with very modest growth rates, a company will usually do well if it improves earnings per share (EPS) year after year. So it's no surprise that some investors are more inclined to invest in profitable businesses. It's good to see that BGC Group's EPS has grown from US$0.25 to US$0.31 over twelve months. This amounts to a 24% gain; a figure that shareholders will be pleased to see.\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Our analysis has highlighted that BGC Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. BGC Group maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 21% to US$2.5b.

He pioneered \"gonzo journalism\", in which the writer was an essential part of the story.\nHis 1971 novel, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - a semi-autobiographical story about the counterculture of the 1960s - was later adapted into a film starring Johnny Depp.\nThe novel became a classic, telling the story of Thompson's drug-hazed road trip across the western US in search of the American Dream.\nOther books he penned include Hells Angels and Generation of Swine.\nColorado officials said they did not have a timeline for the investigation into Thompson's death and would provide an update once it was complete.\nThompson died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound while speaking on the phone with his wife.\nHis son later found his body in the kitchen, according to news reports.\nAn investigation into his death found no evidence of foul play."
