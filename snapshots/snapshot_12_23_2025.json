Its status as a reliably high-value commodity that can be transported easily and sold anywhere offers a sense of safety when everything else is in turmoil.\nInvestors flocked to bullion in 2025, in particular gold-backed exchange-traded funds, driven by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, his threats to the independence of the US Federal Reserve, geopolitical tensions and concerns over ballooning government debt. Central banks also continued to add to their gold reserves."

The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday.\nFor 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts.\nUnlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand.\nSeparately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.\nThe price of Brent crude rose $1.31 to $61.78 a barrel, while US oil was up $1.25 at $57.77. However, both measures look set to end 2025 at prices lower than where they started the year."

The consensus stands despite the fact that some of the world\u2019s biggest storage hubs are far from overflowing. Now, many forecast even more production coming into this oversupplied market. It would only hasten the inevitable rebalancing.\nKpler reported earlier this month that the amount of oil on tankers had gone up to the highest since 2020, reaching 1.3 billion barrels. But storage hubs in the Caribbean and South Africa are sitting half-empty, and inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, are at their lowest since 2007. This is because, per Bloomberg, \u201cthe oil futures curve doesn\u2019t currently make it profitable.\u201d\nWhat this seems to suggest is that demand might not be as weak as perceived, otherwise storage hubs would be seeing a lot of action right now. Instead, the oil sits on tankers, ready to set sail once it finds a buyer\u2014and oil is finding buyers, including sanctioned oil.\nIndia, for instance, continued to import Russian crude at a rate of over 1 million barrels daily this month, despite U.S. sanctions on the two biggest exporters that came into effect in late November. Reuters reported last week that the average daily so far this month has stood at 1.2 million barrels. That\u2019s down from 1.77 million barrels in November, ahead of the sanctions, but nowhere near the sharp drop that many analysts forecast. Shipments to China are also on the rise, with the total for the four weeks to December 7 at 3.68 million barrels daily per data cited by Bloomberg.\nRelated: Oil Prices Jump 2% on Fear of Supply Disruptions in Russia and Venezuela\nIranian exports of crude, meanwhile, are on course to book the highest annual since 2018, Bloomberg reported last week, and even Venezuelan exports are on the rise\u2014or at least they were, until the U.S. started seizing and blocking tankers. In the meantime, non-sanctioned oil production is also on the rise, fueling the perceived glut, at least for the time being.\nGuyana has seen a surge on oil shipments since it started producing oil commercially, suggesting demand is rather healthy, glut and all. Brazil hit a new high in production in November, at 4 million barrels daily, again in defiance of the glut forecasts, and Canada is also ramping up, despite sliding prices. Production started growing in earnest following the launch of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, leading to a record high output this June. Production is set for further growth, to reach an estimated 6 million barrels daily by 2030, according to the Bank of Montreal\u2014apparently regardless of prices.\nSpeaking of prices, most analysts expect them to remain weak in 2026, likely dropping even further down, especially if the war in Ukraine ends. This, however, will only hasten production adjustments to rebalance the market. Bloomberg suggested in its report from last week that Brent could see an average of below $60 next year for the first time since 2020 and the pandemic lockdowns. At the same time, the report said that low oil prices would at some point start hurting producing countries\u2014and prompt a production adjustment reaction.\nOPEC+ is a case in point here. The group decided to pause its production builds for the first three months of the new year in response to price weakness. More importantly, however, OPEC+ approved a new mechanism to reassess the maximum sustainable production capacities of all its producers, which will be used as a baseline for the 2027 production quotas.\nOPEC+ and its leader, Saudi Arabia, say the new mechanism to assess how much any given producer can pump for a sustainable period of time is more transparent and fair for determining production levels from 2027 onwards. The context for the decision is plans by some OPEC producers to boost their oil production capacity in the coming years, apparently regardless of international prices.\nThis could mean one of two things.

Other bullish factors included the weaker dollar and the stronger stock market. Crude prices had carry-over support from last Friday's news from Baker Hughes that active US oil rigs fell to a 4.25-year low, which implies reduced US crude oil production.\nThe Venezuelan situation is supportive of crude prices. President Trump last week ordered a \"total and complete blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers\" going into and leaving Venezuela. The US Coast Guard on Saturday boarded the non-sanctioned Centuries tanker in the Caribbean. Also, US forces are in pursuit of tanker Bella 1, which is on its way to Venezuela.\nOil prices also have support after Ukraine hit a Russian shadow oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea with drones for the first time.\nVortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days fell -7% w/w to 107.15 million bbl in the week ended December 19.\nUkrainian drone and missile attacks have targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past three months, limiting Russia's crude oil export capabilities and reducing global oil supplies. Also, since the end of November, Ukraine has ramped up attacks on Russian tankers, with at least six tankers attacked by drones and missiles in the Baltic Sea. In addition, new US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have curbed Russian oil exports.\nCrude also garnered support after OPEC+ on November 30 said it would stick to plans to pause production increases in Q1 of 2026. OPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members will raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus. The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026. OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore. OPEC's November crude production fell by -10,000 bpd to 29.09 million bpd.\nLast month, OPEC revised its Q3 global oil market estimates from a deficit to a surplus, as US production exceeded expectations and OPEC also ramped up crude output. OPEC said it now sees a 500,000 bpd surplus in global oil markets in Q3, versus the previous month's estimate for a -400,000 bpd deficit. Also, the EIA raised its 2025 US crude production estimate to 13.59 million bpd from 13.53 million bpd last month.\nLast Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of December 12 were -4.0% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.4% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -5.7% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending December 12 fell -0.1% w/w to 13.843 million bpd, just below the record high of 13.862 million bpd from the week of November 7.\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ended December 19 fell by -8 to a 4.25-year low of 406 rigs. Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

                "body": "EUR/USD started the week posting gains of more than 0.4% in favor of the euro, marking a renewed bullish bias toward the close of 2025. For now, buying pressure has managed to hold, as central bank dynamics in the United States and Europe have supported a weaker outlook for the U.S. dollar, allowing the euro to continue regaining ground in the short term. As long as this environment remains in place, buying pressure is likely to become more relevant for EUR/USD over the coming trading sessions.\nCentral Bank Dynamics\nWe are now in the final weeks of 2025, and the main central bank decisions have already been announced, beginning to shape expectations for 2026. First, the European Central Bank decided to keep interest rates in neutral territory in its final decision of the year and indicated that this stance could extend into 2026 under a policy of sustained neutral rates. In fact, in the days following the decision, the ECB Watch probability table shows that for the February 3, 2026 meeting there is an 83.9% probability that the current 2.00% deposit rate will remain unchanged, reinforcing the ECB\u2019s neutral outlook as it continues to assess employment and inflation data.\nSource: ECBWATCH\nOn the other hand, the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve, has followed a somewhat more uncertain path. To close 2025, the institution decided to cut its policy rate from 4.00% to 3.75%. However, recent inflation and employment data have delivered mixed signals, which for now do not point to a clear stance between maintaining neutral rates or considering additional cuts to support economic stability. Currently, CME Group probabilities assign an 80.1% chance that rates will remain unchanged at the January 28, 2026 meeting. However, for the March 18 meeting, probabilities remain closely split, with readings above 40% for both a rate cut and a hold, reinforcing the sense of indecision with which the Federal Reserve has ended the year.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nIn this context, as long as Federal Reserve indecision persists, the outlook for stable interest rates in the European Union could continue to stand out relative to the United States. This dynamic appears to be restoring short-term appeal to euro-denominated investments, supporting foreign capital inflows and reinforcing demand for the euro. If this trend holds and markets begin to anticipate lower rates in the United States, the euro\u2019s relative attractiveness could sustain persistent buying pressure in EUR/USD over the coming sessions.\nIs the Dollar Still Weak?\nIt is important to note that changes in probabilities regarding future Federal Reserve decisions have also begun to affect the dollar\u2019s strength in recent sessions. The DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s performance against other currencies, continues to display a downward slope, with bearish moves approaching the 98-point area, corresponding to the October lows. This behavior points to a short-term structural weakness in the U.S. dollar.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nIt is important to note that changes in probabilities regarding future Federal Reserve decisions have also begun to affect the dollar\u2019s strength in recent sessions.

Since mid-June, EUR/USD has traded within a wide consolidation range, capped at 1.18202 and supported near 1.15104. Recent price action has once again moved closer to the upper boundary of the range, which coincides with the highest levels of the year.

                "body": "EUR/USD climbed to 1.1760, up 0.42% to 1.1757, rebounding from 1.1706 as the Dollar weakened due to easing speculation. The Federal Reserve\u2019s potential policy easing impacted the Dollar amidst a lack of economic data from both sides of the Atlantic.\nMarket attention was drawn to Fed officials discussing CPI irregularities and rate cut predictions, with the first expected in June 2026. Meanwhile, ECB policymakers downplayed aggressive signals, with European nations awaiting crucial GDP figures.\nUS Dollar Weakness and Euro Considerations\nThe US Dollar Index fell 0.45% to 98.27, supporting the Euro\u2019s strength as officials discussed the 43-day government shutdown\u2019s effect on CPI data. US November inflation eased to 2.7% year-on-year, affected by the shutdown.\nTechnical indicators suggest EUR/USD consolidation around 1.1700-1.1750, with resistance at 1.1800 and technical support levels identified below. The Euro, the second-most traded currency, significantly influences global finance, with the ECB managing monetary policy to maintain price stability.\nThe Eurozone\u2019s inflation data and economic health, measured by GDP and other statistics, determine the Euro\u2019s strength. A positive trade balance enhances the Euro\u2019s value, making economic data critical for assessing the currency\u2019s future movements.\nGiven the current momentum, we see the US dollar weakening on expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates next year. Derivative strategies should be positioned for a potential continued rise in the EUR/USD pair, especially as markets are pricing in a high probability of a rate cut by June 2026. Futures markets, such as the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool, were indicating over a 70% chance of a 25-basis point reduction by that June meeting, reinforcing the dovish sentiment.\nTechnical Analysis and Market Strategies\nHowever, we must proceed with caution as Fed officials themselves have flagged irregularities in the November CPI report due to the government shutdown experienced earlier in the year. This uncertainty means any upcoming data, particularly the US Q3 GDP and consumer confidence figures due this week, could cause sharp reversals. A decisive break below the 98.00 level in the US Dollar Index (DXY) would give us more confidence in a sustained euro rally.\nOn the European side, the ECB is not providing a strong, independent reason for the euro\u2019s strength, with policymakers downplaying hawkish rhetoric. Recent data we saw from the German IFO Business Climate index earlier in December 2025 showed a slight improvement but remained in pessimistic territory, underscoring ongoing concerns about Eurozone growth. This suggests the current EUR/USD rally is primarily a story of US dollar weakness, not euro strength.\nFrom a technical standpoint, options traders should watch the 1.1800 level closely, as a sustained break above it could trigger further buying and open a path toward the yearly high. On the downside, the 1.1700 level is a key support, with strike prices for put options likely clustered around the 20-day moving average near 1.1679. The current consolidation offers opportunities to construct range-bound strategies like iron condors if conviction for a breakout is low.\nAs we head into the holiday-thinned markets of late December and early January, we must remember that liquidity will be significantly lower than usual. We\u2019ve seen in past years how this environment can lead to exaggerated price swings on relatively small news or order flows. Implied volatility from options pricing suggests traders are bracing for movement, so protecting positions against sudden gaps is a prudent measure."

                "body": "Asia stocks rise tracking Wall St gains; RBA minutes, Japan FX stance in focus\nAt its meeting on 18 December, the European Central Bank (ECB) left all key interest rates unchanged, maintaining the deposit facility rate at 2.0%. The decision was widely anticipated, offering no fresh catalyst for meaningful euro movement. While headline inflation for the eurozone remained close to target at 2.15% in November, the ECB\u2019s updated projections saw a slight upward revision for the coming years, primarily driven by persistent price growth in the services sector.\nConcurrently, the ECB improved its GDP growth forecast for 2025\u20132027. However, with the decision fully priced in, it provided neither additional support nor pressure to the single currency.\nThe primary driver for EUR/USD now stems from US monetary policy. The recent Federal Reserve rate cut from 4.00% to 3.75% has narrowed the yield differential between the dollar and the euro. This reduces the dollar\u2019s interest rate advantage and makes euro-denominated assets relatively more attractive, providing a moderate tailwind for the euro.\nLooking ahead, medium-term dynamics will hinge on relative expectations for central bank policy. Should markets continue to price in a more aggressive easing cycle from the Fed compared to the ECB, the euro is likely to find further support. Conversely, any signs that the ECB is preparing to proactively ease policy in response to eurozone economic weakness would limit the euro\u2019s upside potential.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD\nH4 Chart:\nOn the H4 chart, the pair is consolidating near the breakdown level of the previous growth channel\u2019s lower boundary. We anticipate a downside breakout from this range and a resumption of the third decline wave, with an initial target at 1.1650.\nThe MACD indicator technically confirms this bearish outlook. Its signal line is below zero and pointing decisively downward, reflecting sustained bearish momentum and potential for further downside.\nH1 Chart:\nOn the H1 chart, the market completed another decline wave to 1.1702, followed by a correction to 1.1737. A new downward impulse towards 1.1650 is currently forming. A sustained break below this level would signal the potential for an extended third wave, targeting the 1.1645 area as a local objective.\nThis scenario is supported by the Stochastic oscillator, with its signal line below the 50 level and trending firmly downwards.\nConclusion\nThe euro\u2019s trajectory remains more sensitive to shifting US policy expectations than to the ECB\u2019s predictable stance. While the narrowed interest rate differential offers near-term support, the technical structure appears bearish. A decisive break below the current consolidation range could trigger a renewed move towards the 1.1650\u20131.1645 support zone.\nBy RoboForex Analytical Department\nDisclaimer: Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author\u2019s particular opinion.

                "body": "GBP/USD knocks ten-week highs ahead of holiday slowdown\n- GBP/USD climbed back above 1.3450 for the first time since October.\n- The BoE\u2019s path forward on interest rates has become exceptionally cloudy.\n- Wobbly economic metrics mix dangerously with haphazard new BoE policy approach.\nGBP/USD found room on the high side on Monday, kicking off a holiday-shortened trading week with a fresh spat of Greenback weakness, bolstering the Pound Sterling (GBP) into its highest bids in ten weeks. Pound traders are largely brushing off the latest interest rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE) as the UK\u2019s central bank policy strategy leaves the water murky for rate-cut watchers.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) own third straight rate cut recently has sapped support from the US Dollar (USD), sending the Greenback broadly lower across the board as markets head into an early closure this week for the holidays.\nUS ADP Employment change and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth figures are due on Tuesday and will serve as the final spurt of US economic data before the holiday shutdown. The ADP 4-week average last clocked in at a relatively disappointing 16.25K, implying that ongoing weakness in the US labor market is likely to continue. On the growth front, Annualized US GDP for the third quarter is expected to slow to 3.2% from 3.8%, flying in the face of Trump administration staff who have been suggesting that American growth could accelerate to 4-5% heading into the end of the year.\nThe Boe\u2019s newfound policy approach of emphasizing \u201calternative scenarios\u201d rather than a direct economic forecast and policy outlook will put pressure on rate-watchers moving forward. The nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will also directly disclose their personal interest rate outlook and policy approaches on a per-meeting basis. The BoE famously produces dissenting, or at least loud, policy opinions from its central planning members, especially compared to its more contemporary peer the Fed, which is famous for appearing to approach something similar to policy alignment in its statements.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release "

                "body": "The GBP/USD pair increased by 0.59% to trade at 1.3450 after the UK economy grew by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter and 1.3% year-on-year in Q3. Despite expectations of Bank of England policy easing in 2026, Sterling strengthened due to the growth data amid thin pre-Christmas trading.\nUK\u2019s inflation recently eased, prompting BoE Governor Andrew Bailey to support rate cuts, with markets anticipating 37 basis points of easing in 2026. In the US, Fed officials expressed differing views on inflation, with November\u2019s CPI potentially underestimating yearly increases.\nTechnical Analysis\nTechnical analysis shows GBP/USD reclaimed the 200-day SMA and reached a new monthly high of 1.3457. The pair might test the October 1 high of 1.3527 if it surpasses 1.35, while a drop below 1.3400 might lead to testing the 100-day SMA at 1.3369.\nThe British Pound (GBP) showed strong performance this month, particularly against the Japanese Yen. Percentage changes for major currencies indicate GBP increased by 2.45% against the Yen and 0.58% against the USD, while other currencies like the Euro saw smaller percentage changes.\nThe current jump in the pound above 1.3400 is a direct reaction to stable UK growth figures. With many traders away for the holidays, this thin liquidity is exaggerating the move higher. We should consider this a short-term reaction rather than a fundamental shift in the market.\nMarket Sentiment and Volatility\nWe are facing a classic disconnect between current price action and future expectations. While today\u2019s data is supportive, the market is pricing in 37 basis points of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England for 2026. This view is heavily influenced by the recent November inflation data, which we saw drop to 3.9% from 4.6% in October.\nUncertainty from the US side is adding to the choppy conditions. While Cleveland\u2019s Fed President Hammack worries about inflation, the latest US CPI print for November showed inflation at 3.1%, giving dovish members like Governor Miran reason to suggest rate cuts are coming. This internal Fed debate means the dollar\u2019s direction is not clear, creating volatility for the pair.\nFor the next week or two, we can use this upward momentum. Buying short-dated call options with a strike price around 1.3500 could capture further gains if this holiday rally continues towards the October high of 1.3527. This is a tactical play on the current thin market conditions, which we have seen before, such as during the sharp but short-lived spikes in late 2022.\nHowever, we must prepare for the other side of this trade as we enter the new year. Buying put options dated for February or March 2026, or even selling futures contracts, would position us for the expected downturn once the market refocuses on the Bank of England\u2019s easing cycle. These fundamental stories eventually dominate price, much like the rate hike cycle did throughout 2023.\nThe key will be timing the shift in sentiment as full trading volume returns in January. We could look to close out any short-term bullish positions and initiate bearish ones if the price stalls near the 1.3500-1.3530 resistance area. Given the conflicting signals, strategies that profit from a spike in volatility, such as a long straddle, could also be effective as the market decides on a clearer direction."

                "body": "During early European trading, the US Dollar Index (DXY) slipped to around 98.60, easing after three consecutive sessions of gains. Markets are now focused on Tuesday\u2019s release of US Q3 GDP (annualised), expected at 3.8%, up from the earlier 3.2% estimate. The data will be closely watched for confirmation of economic resilience.\nThe US dollar remains constrained as investors assess the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy path. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said rates are likely to remain on hold while policymakers evaluate the impact of 75 basis points of rate cuts delivered earlier this year.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets now assign a 79% probability that rates will remain unchanged at the January meeting, up from 75.6% last week. Expectations for a 25-basis-point cut have declined to 21%.\nMeanwhile, comments from potential future Fed leadership added nuance. Fed Governor Christopher Waller noted inflation remains elevated and suggested any easing would proceed cautiously.\nWeaker consumer data has also weighed on the dollar. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 52.9 in December, while inflation expectations edged higher to 4.2%, signaling persistent cost concerns alongside fragile confidence.\nAttention now turns to upcoming GDP and inflation readings, which will help shape expectations for Fed policy and near-term USD direction.\nThe US Dollar Index remains under pressure, trading near 98.60 after failing to sustain a rebound above its descending channel. Price action continues to respect the broader downtrend, with rallies capped near the 50-EMA and the upper channel boundary around 99.20\u201399.30.\nRecent candles show limited follow-through buying, suggesting the rebound from 97.85 was corrective rather than the start of a trend reversal. The 100-EMA above 99.40 remains a key ceiling, reinforcing the bearish medium-term structure.\nMomentum indicators offer little relief for dollar bulls. RSI is hovering near 50\u201355, signaling neutral momentum but lacking the strength typically seen ahead of sustained upside moves. As long as DXY holds below 99.30, downside risks remain dominant.\nA break below 98.20 would expose 97.85, followed by 97.50, keeping pressure on dollar-sensitive assets. Only a sustained close above the descending channel would challenge the bearish bias.\nGBP/USD is trading near $1.3415, consolidating within a well-defined rising channel on the 4-hour chart. The broader trend remains constructive, supported by consistent higher highs and higher lows since late November.\nPrice is holding above the former support zone at $1.3350\u2013$1.3370, with the rising 50-EMA providing near-term dynamic support. The 100-EMA near $1.3285 continues to underpin the medium-term bullish structure. Recent candles show reduced volatility, pointing to consolidation rather than trend exhaustion.\nMomentum indicators remain balanced, with RSI stabilising around the 55\u201358 range, suggesting steady buying interest without overheating. A sustained break above $1.3450 would open the path toward $1.3500, while a move below $1.3330 would weaken the bullish setup.\nEUR/USD is consolidating near $1.1720 after easing from recent highs, while holding firmly within an ascending channel on the 4-hour chart. The broader structure remains constructive, supported by a series of higher highs and higher lows.\nPrice is holding above the former breakout zone at $1.1705, now acting as near-term support. The rising 50-EMA continues to underpin price action, while the 100-EMA near $1.1645 reinforces the medium-term bullish bias. Recent candles suggest consolidation rather than distribution, indicating a pause after the move toward $1.1800.\nMomentum has moderated, with RSI drifting toward the 50\u201355 range without signaling trend reversal. A break above $1.1760 would refocus attention on $1.1805, while a sustained move below $1.1675 would weaken the bullish outlook.\nArslan is a finance MBA and also holds an MPhil degree in behavioral finance."

Australian Dollar was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Australian Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent AUD (base)/USD (quote).\nThis section was published on December 22 at 22.36 GMT as a preview of the RBA Minutes release.\nThe RBA Minutes Overview\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will publish its minutes of its monetary policy meeting on Tuesday at 00.30 GMT. It provides a detailed record of the discussions held between the RBA\u2019s board members on monetary policy and economic conditions that influenced their decision on adjusting interest rates and/or bond buys, significantly impacting the AUD.\nThe minutes also reveal considerations on international economic developments and the exchange rate value.\nHow could the RBA Minutes affect AUD/USD?\nAUD/USD trades on a positive note on the day in the lead up to the RBA Minutes. The pair gathers strength as the US Dollar (USD) weakens amid expectations for a dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy path into 2026.\nIf the RBA is hawkish about the inflationary outlook for the economy, it could lift the Australian Dollar (AUD), with the first upside barrier seen at the December 11 high of 0.6680.

                "body": "The AUD/USD moved higher on Monday, reaching the 0.6660 region after a recent decline, as the US Dollar showed weakness. Upcoming holiday closures will affect global markets, with major exchanges closing by late Wednesday. Early on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will release meeting minutes, which are expected to impact Australian Dollar traders.\nDespite a recent dip, the Australian Dollar reached a 14-month high last week. The RBA is expected to raise interest rates at least twice in 2026. This supports the AUD as the US Federal Reserve plans potential rate cuts over the next one to two years. US GDP growth figures are due on Tuesday, likely showing a drop to 3.2% for Q3, from the previous 3.8%.\nKey Factors Affecting The Australian Dollar\nKey factors affecting the Australian Dollar include RBA interest rates, iron ore prices, and the Chinese economy\u2019s health. The RBA aims for a 2-3% inflation rate via interest rate adjustments. China, Australia\u2019s main trading partner, influences the AUD\u2019s value when it increases imports from Australia. Iron Ore, Australia\u2019s largest export, valued at $118 billion annually, impacts the AUD\u2019s strength, with higher prices boosting the currency. The Trade Balance also influences the AUD, with a surplus strengthening the currency.\nThe recent bounce in AUD/USD presents a clear opportunity for us, driven by a growing policy split between the US Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia. We see this divergence as the primary driver for a sustained rally in the Aussie dollar moving into 2026. This setup suggests that any short-term dips are buying opportunities.\nThe RBA is providing a solid floor for the currency, with at least two rate hikes widely expected for 2026. We remember how persistent inflation was back through 2024, when the annual CPI rate struggled to fall below 3.5%, and the RBA is signaling it will not ease policy prematurely this time. The meeting minutes this week should confirm this hawkish outlook.\nUS Federal Reserve And Economic Outlook\nOn the other hand, the US Federal Reserve is preparing for an accelerating pace of rate cuts. This follows the trend of cooling inflation we observed throughout 2024 and 2025, which has allowed the Fed to shift its focus towards supporting a slowing economy. The US Q3 GDP figures due this week are expected to confirm this economic cooling, further justifying the Fed\u2019s dovish stance.\nWe also see strength coming from Australia\u2019s key export, iron ore, which has remained firm above $130 a tonne. This price stability is supported by ongoing stimulus measures in China, which are finally gaining traction and boosting demand for industrial commodities. A healthy Chinese economy, which grew around 5% in 2024, is fundamental to Australia\u2019s positive trade balance and the Aussie\u2019s strength.\nGiven this backdrop, we should consider positioning for further AUD/USD strength by buying call options with expiry dates in early 2026. Trading volumes will be low over the holiday week, so we can build positions gradually. The strategy is to be ready for the pair to move higher as markets return to full strength in the new year."

The Australian Dollar (AUD) took a lifeline thrown by broad-market Greenback flows that see the safe-haven US Dollar (USD) on the retreat heading into the holiday shutdown.\nGlobal markets will be going dark early this week, with major exchanges shuttered as early as late Wednesday as investors take the holidays off. The Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) latest rate call meeting minutes will drop early on Tuesday, giving Aussie traders a look into where the RBA is steering the interest rate ship.\nDespite a near-term walkback, the Aussie traded into 14-month highs as recently as the week before, putting pressure on Australian businesses. The RBA is broadly expected to raise interest rates at least twice in 2026, putting a firm floor under the AUD as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) faces an accelerating pace of interest rate cuts moving forward over the next year or two.\nUS Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth figures are also due on Tuesday, and are expected to show a general decline in headline growth during the third quarter. Q3 US GDP is expected to cool to 3.2% QoQ compared to the previous quarter\u2019s 3.8% print.\nAUD/USD daily chart\nAustralian Dollar FAQs\nOne of the most significant factors for the Australian Dollar (AUD) is the level of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Because Australia is a resource-rich country another key driver is the price of its biggest export, Iron Ore. The health of the Chinese economy, its largest trading partner, is a factor, as well as inflation in Australia, its growth rate and Trade Balance. Market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 is also a factor, with risk-on positive for AUD.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) influences the Australian Dollar (AUD) by setting the level of interest rates that Australian banks can lend to each other. This influences the level of interest rates in the economy as a whole. The main goal of the RBA is to maintain a stable inflation rate of 2-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively high interest rates compared to other major central banks support the AUD, and the opposite for relatively low. The RBA can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former AUD-negative and the latter AUD-positive.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner so the health of the Chinese economy is a major influence on the value of the Australian Dollar (AUD). When the Chinese economy is doing well it purchases more raw materials, goods and services from Australia, lifting demand for the AUD, and pushing up its value. The opposite is the case when the Chinese economy is not growing as fast as expected. Positive or negative surprises in Chinese growth data, therefore, often have a direct impact on the Australian Dollar and its pairs.\nIron Ore is Australia\u2019s largest export, accounting for $118 billion a year according to data from 2021, with China as its primary destination. The price of Iron Ore, therefore, can be a driver of the Australian Dollar. Generally, if the price of Iron Ore rises, AUD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Iron Ore falls. Higher Iron Ore prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance for Australia, which is also positive of the AUD.\nThe Trade Balance, which is the difference between what a country earns from its exports versus what it pays for its imports, is another factor that can influence the value of the Australian Dollar. If Australia produces highly sought after exports, th"

                "body": "USD/JPY forecast: Here\u2019s why the Japanese yen is soaring today\nThe Japanese yen rebounded for the second consecutive day as investors reacted to the ongoing divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The USDJPY exchange rate retreated to a low of 156.30, down sharply from the year-to-date high of 157.83. It has also formed a risky chart pattern pointing to more downside in the near term.\nUSDJPY technical analysis points to a retreat\nThe daily timeframe chart shows that the USDJPY exchange rate has pulled back in the past two consecutive days. This retreat happened after the pair formed a double-top pattern at 157.83 with a neckline at 154.37.\nA double-top pattern is one of the most common bearish reversal chart patterns in technical analysis.\nA closer look shows that the pair has formed a bearish divergence pattern as the MACDA and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continued to move downwards. A bearish divergence happens when these oscillators drop when a currency pair is in an uptrend.\nTherefore, a combination of a double-top pattern and a bearish divergence means that the USDJPY pair will continue falling, with the next key target being at 154.45, the neckline of this pattern. A move below that price will point to more downside, potentially to the psychological level at 150.\nBoJ and Fes divergence\nThe Japanese yen rose for the second consecutive day after Japan\u2019s Finance Minister, Satsuki Katayama, said that the government was prepared to take bold actions if it moves out of line with its fundamentals.\nHis statement came a few days after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) delivered its interest rate decision, which was in line with expectations.\nThe bank hiked interest rates by 0.25% and delivered a muted forward guidance, with analysts expecting the bank to deliver one or two hikes next year. It is doing that since inflation has remained at an elevated level in the past few months. A report released on Friday showed that inflation rose to 3.0%.\nThe BoJ has taken other hawkish policies that have pushed bond yields to the highest level in years. For example, it is considering selling ETFs worth over $500 billion and had already ended its quantitative tightening policy.\nThe Federal Reserve has taken the opposite approach as it embraced a dovish tone. It slashed interest rates for the third consecutive meeting this month and some Fed officials are hinting of more cuts in the coming meetings.\nIn a statement on Monday, Governor Stephen Miran warned that the Federal Reserve risked a recession without cutting interest rates. He said:\n\u201cThe unemployment rate has poked up potentially above where people thought it was going to go. And so we\u2019ve had data that should push people into a dovish direction.\u201d\nThe most recent data showed that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, reflecting the number of government employees who took Donald Trump\u2019s early retirement offers. Another report showed that US inflation cooled in November.\nHowever, James Williams, the head of the New York Federal Reserve, warned that there was no urgency to cut interest rates again, recommending a continued pause.\nLooking ahead, the US will publish some important data later on Tuesday. The key numbers to watch that may move the USDJPY exchange rate will be the upcoming US consumer confidence report, GDP, industrial, and manufacturing numbers."

Mimura said authorities are prepared to take \u201cappropriate actions against excessive moves,\u201d a phrase that traders widely view as hinting at intervention should the yen\u2019s advance become disorderly.\nThe yen\u2019s bounce this week comes as the Bank of Japan continued normalising policy last week, raising its policy rate to 0.75%, a three-decade high, and narrowing the rate differential with the Federal Reserve. In the aftermath of the Friday BoJ decision markets focused on BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s cautious forward guidance, which lacked clear hints of an imminent further tightening sequence, leaving JPY vulnerable.\nMimura's rhetoric was reinforced later on Monday by Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama, who told Bloomberg that Japan has a \u201cfree hand\u201d to address excessive yen volatility and distinguished recent moves from fundamental drivers. She said the latest swings were largely speculative, signalling that authorities are closely watching exchange-rate behaviour and will act if necessary.\nThe growing chorus of official warnings has come against a backdrop of broader market dynamics, safe-haven flows and intervention speculation have lent support to the yen, while traders also remain attentive to evolving Fed rate expectations and geopolitical drivers. A break below 156.20 for USD/JPY has drawn attention, with market participants viewing it as a key level that could usher in further yen strength if official warnings translate into actual market operations.\n-\nADDED:\nFinance Minister Katayama has declined to comment on forex levels or interest rates. She did say, however, that Japan will take appropriate action and reiterated that they have a \"free hand\" to respond to excessive moves in JPY."

Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls.

As the market's bets on further rate cuts increase, the overall performance of the US Dollar Index has been weak, dragging down the dollar's performance against major currencies.\nThe latest statements from Federal Reserve officials have reinforced this expectation. Related comments indicate that policymakers are more inclined to reduce economic downside risks by gradually easing financial conditions, which has somewhat weakened the dollar\u2019s interest rate differential advantage and limited its rebound potential.\nThe market is awaiting the release of the annualized growth rate data for the US third-quarter GDP. Although expectations suggest the economy remains relatively robust, the slowdown itself is already being viewed as an important basis for monetary policy to continue shifting towards easing.\nIn the absence of significant upside surprises, the impact of a single data point on boosting the dollar may be relatively limited, with short-term movements in the dollar remaining more susceptible to policy expectations and risk sentiment.\nIn contrast to the dollar, the Canadian dollar has shown relatively strong performance recently. As a typical commodity currency, the Canadian dollar has benefited from the recovery in international oil prices. Current oil prices, supported by geopolitical tensions, remain at high levels with fluctuations, positively impacting Canada, a major crude oil exporter.\nMeanwhile, news of damage to energy infrastructure in some regions has heightened market concerns over supply chain security, driving capital flows into currency assets highly correlated with energy prices, further strengthening the relative advantage of the Canadian dollar.\nAgainst the backdrop of simultaneous strength in precious metals and energy prices, market risk appetite has become more cautious. Safe-haven funds have flowed more into assets like gold rather than the dollar itself, temporarily weakening the dollar's traditional safe-haven status. This shift has also become an important factor contributing to the continued pressure on USD/CAD.\nFrom the perspective of the daily chart structure, USD/CAD continues its downward trend from recent highs, with prices consecutively breaking below short-term moving average support, indicating a significant weakening of upward momentum. The exchange rate is currently trading below the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, with short-term averages beginning to turn downward, exerting downward pressure on prices.\nThe RSI has retreated to near 50, reflecting a balance of bullish and bearish forces, but tilting towards the downside. Below, attention focuses on the key support level around 1.3700, which corresponds to the lower boundary of the previous consolidation range; if effectively broken, further downside space may open up.\nInitial resistance above is located in the 1.3820\u20131.3850 region, and until the price re-stabilizes within this range, the overall trend remains biased towards a weaker, volatile pattern.\nEditor\u2019s View:\nOverall, the current decline in USD/CAD is more attributable to the combined effect of the weakening US dollar and external commodity factors, rather than a significant improvement in the fundamentals of the Canadian dollar. Against the backdrop of unchallenged expectations for Fed easing and resilient oil prices, the exchange rate remains under downward pressure in the short term.\nHowever, if US economic data shows a notably stronger-than-expected performance, or geopolitical risks ease temporarily, USD/CAD may experience a technical rebound. Nevertheless, a trend reversal would require stronger fundamental signals for support."

                "body": "The Canadian Dollar is gaining ground on the US Dollar as the USD/CAD pair trades around 1.3740, down by approximately 0.40%. The US Dollar struggles to gain momentum due to expectations for a dovish Federal Reserve policy into 2026. The USD Index is at 98.22, having retreated from a recent high.\nUS data shows cooling inflation and a softening labour market, with two interest rate cuts expected next year despite the Fed\u2019s indication of one cut. The Fed reduced the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December, with Chair Jerome Powell stating that future policies depend on economic data.\nLeadership Change At The Fed\nA leadership change at the Fed is possible, as Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026, with President Trump potentially choosing a new chair early January. This could influence expectations of future policy easing.\nThe Bank of Canada may consider a future rate hike, although a near-term change is unlikely. It kept rates at 2.25%, citing inflation near target and resilient economic activity. Economic releases focus on Canada\u2019s GDP data and several US economic reports, important for currency valuation.\nCanada\u2019s GDP measures economic activity, where high readings often strengthen the Canadian Dollar, while low readings can weaken it. The next release is scheduled for December 23, 2025, with expectations at -0.3%, compared to the previous 0.2%.\nThe diverging policy paths between a dovish Federal Reserve and a more neutral Bank of Canada are keeping USD/CAD under pressure. We are watching the pair closely as it trades near its September 2025 lows around 1.3740. This policy difference is the main story traders are focused on as we head into the final weeks of the year.\nEconomic Data And Political Uncertainty\nThe case for a weaker US dollar is being supported by fresh economic data. We saw the last Non-Farm Payrolls report for November 2025 come in at a weaker-than-expected 110,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%. This confirms the softening labor market narrative and emboldens those betting on at least two Fed rate cuts in 2026.\nAdding to this is the political uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve\u2019s leadership. An announcement on the new Fed chair is expected from President Trump in the first week of January, and his preference for lower rates could introduce even more dovish sentiment. This political factor is a significant reason why holding long US dollar positions feels risky right now.\nOn the other side of the pair, the Bank of Canada is holding firm at 2.25%, creating a notable rate differential with the US. However, a major test comes tomorrow with the release of Canadian GDP data for October, where the market expects a contraction of 0.3%. A surprisingly negative number could challenge the Canadian dollar\u2019s recent strength and cause a short-term rebound in the pair.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests preparing for continued downside in USD/CAD, but with caution around key data points. Short-term implied volatility has already increased to 7.8% ahead of tomorrow\u2019s releases, making options strategies attractive. Traders might consider buying put options or establishing put spreads to position for further weakness while clearly defining their risk."

                "body": "GBP/JPY advances as UK growth data boosts GBP, Yen steadies on safe-haven demand\n- The Pound Sterling strengthens in light trading after confirmation of steady UK growth in the third quarter\n- Gross domestic product data support the British currency despite persistent expectations of Bank of England easing in 2026\n- The JPY remains supported by its safe-haven status and by prospects of gradual monetary policy normalization in Japan\nGBP/JPY trades around 211.10 on Monday at the time of writing, up 0.10% on the day, in a context of reduced liquidity linked to public holidays across several financial centers. The pair benefits from renewed interest in the Pound Sterling (GBP) following the release of UK macroeconomic data in line with expectations, helping to offset the impact of speculation over further rate cuts in the medium term.\nData published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirm that the UK economy posts quarterly growth of 0.1% in the third quarter, following 0.2% growth in the previous quarter. On an annual basis, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rises by 1.3%, unchanged from the prior period. In terms of sectoral contributions, activity is supported by services and construction, while the production sector continues to weigh on overall growth. Although the figures point to some loss of momentum, they reinforce the idea of an economy showing resilience in the face of a tighter monetary environment.\nFrom a monetary policy perspective, these data do not materially alter the near-term outlook for the Bank of England (BoE). The central bank delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut last week, while stressing that future decisions will depend closely on the evolution of inflation and economic activity. Following the recent easing in inflation, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has adopted a more dovish tone, fueling expectations of further easing in 2026. Money markets now price in around 37 basis points of rate cuts next year, according to the Capital Edge rate probability tool.\nAt the same time, the Japanese Yen continues to benefit from specific supportive factors. The currency retains its safe-haven appeal amid persistent geopolitical tensions and concerns surrounding global fiscal conditions. Comments from Atsushi Mimura, Japan\u2019s Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs, have revived speculation about possible official intervention against moves deemed excessive in the foreign exchange market, helping to limit downside pressure on the Japanese Yen.\nOn the monetary policy front, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) recently raised its policy rate to 0.75%, the highest level in several decades, while keeping the door open to further tightening if growth and inflation evolve in line with forecasts. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda remains deliberately cautious on the timing and pace of additional hikes, emphasizing a strictly data-dependent approach tied to economic, price and financial conditions. According to an analysis from ING, further rate increases are expected, but not in the near term, with a potential timeline extending into 2026.\nJapanese authorities have also continued to signal vigilance against what they describe as one-sided currency moves. Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama recently stated that the country is fully prepared to act to stabilize the JPY, in coordination with existing bilateral agreements. This combination of factors helps cap gains in GBP/JPY, despite the support provided to the Pound Sterling by the latest UK macroeconomic data.\nPound Sterling Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today. British Pound was the strongest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other.

                "body": "The Bank Of England\u2019s Influence\nThe Bank of England\u2019s hawkish stance provided support for the Pound, helping to offset Yen gains against it. The Monetary Policy Committee recently voted 5-4 to lower interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75%. The close vote followed a surprise inflation report, leading to scaled-back expectations for significant easing next year.\nInvestors await the UK\u2019s final Q3 GDP results amidst thin trading volumes due to the holiday season. Meanwhile, caution is advised before confirming a top in GBP/JPY near 211.00. The Yen showed strength against major currencies, particularly against the US Dollar.\nGiven the GBP/JPY cross is trading just below the multi-year peak of 211.00, we are seeing some profit-taking. The pair\u2019s slight downturn is fueled by a modest demand for the safe-haven Japanese Yen amid ongoing geopolitical risks. However, this downward pressure is weak and lacks strong conviction.\nThe primary risk for anyone holding long positions is intervention by Japanese authorities, a fear that grows stronger as the currency weakens. We\u2019ve seen verbal warnings from the Ministry of Finance intensify last week after USD/JPY pushed past 168, making the threat of direct market action very real. This is why the Yen is showing some strength against major currencies today.\nPossible Risk Factors\nOn the other side, the British Pound remains supported by a hawkish Bank of England. The recent 5-4 vote to cut rates to 3.75% was incredibly close, signaling deep divisions and a reluctance to ease policy further, especially after November\u2019s CPI data showed inflation unexpectedly holding at 3.1%. This suggests the BoE will be slow to cut rates again in early 2026.\nFor derivative traders, this creates a tense setup where the uptrend could violently reverse. Buying GBP/JPY put options with a strike price around 208.00 or 207.00 could be a prudent way to hedge against a sudden drop caused by intervention. This strategy allows for participation in further upside while capping the potential losses from a sharp Yen appreciation."

                "body": "In recent days, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed substantial outflows, exceeding $142 million in just one day. This is the third consecutive day marked by withdrawals. The funds linked to the largest issuers, including Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale, all experienced notable outflows. However, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stands apart, having attracted $6.1 million in inflows. This situation raises pertinent questions about market dynamics and investor sentiment.\nWhy is BlackRock\u2019s IBIT Doing Well in a Tough Market?\nAmidst this downturn, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT emerges as an outlier, consistently attracting investments while others falter. One prominent reason is that BlackRock commands significant brand reputation and trust among investors. When market volatility hits, these qualities become invaluable, drawing in investors looking for a safe haven. The positioning of IBIT as a long-term investment vehicle resonates well with institutional investors, who are more focused on sustainable growth rather than immediate profits.\nBlackRock's promotion of IBIT as a strategic bet on the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin rather than a mere profit-chasing vehicle adds to its allure. This long-term focus has attracted significant inflows, even as Bitcoin\u2019s price remains under pressure.\nWhat Opportunities Lie Ahead for Smaller Crypto Funds?\nThe massive outflows from larger Bitcoin ETFs hint at a cooling phase for the industry, yet present opportunities for smaller crypto funds. As institutional investors pivot away from mainstream ETFs, there's a growing appetite for alternative assets and smaller funds tracking cryptocurrencies such as Solana and XRP. As Bitcoin ETFs face record withdrawals, other crypto ETFs are experiencing inflows, indicating a shift in investor priorities.\nWith Bitcoin's volatility compounding, smaller funds that present unique value propositions could find themselves in a favorable position, drawing capital away from traditional BTC-focused ETFs.\nHow Can Fintech Startups Adapt?\nFintech startups can draw important insights from these trends. Prioritizing regulatory compliance and building investor trust should be foundational elements of any crypto venture. Startups aiming to break into the crypto scene must emphasize trust-building measures, like products adhering to regulations, which in turn protects against custody risks.\nThe success shown by BlackRock's IBIT emphasizes the need for a strong brand presence and investor relationships within neobanks or fintechs. The current landscape beckons innovative solutions, particularly in realms like crypto payroll, which could gain traction as firms adapt to market swings.\nWhat Should Investors Keep in Mind?\nAs Bitcoin ETF dynamics continue to shift, investors must remain vigilant. Continuous monitoring of ETF flow data provides insights into market sentiment and future capital allocations. Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s price movement is likely to influence ETF dynamics directly.\nLong-term strategies should consider both current volatility and individual fund performance. While short-term flow data might be a cause for concern, the broader trend suggests that reputation and credibility will increasingly dictate investor flows. Diversifying portfolios to include established funds like BlackRock\u2019s IBIT, as well as innovative smaller crypto products, could present lucrative opportunities.\nIn Summary\nRecent trends in Bitcoin ETF flows depict a complex and shifting landscape. While major funds facing substantial outflows struggle, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT exemplifies resilience, underscoring the importance of institutional trust and brand strength. Understanding these dynamics will be crucial for investors looking to navigate the evolving cryptocurrency market."

This marks a sharp change from a year ago, when Curve\u2019s share stood near 1.6%.\nFees data shows Curve pulling ahead on Ethereum\nEthereum remains one of the most competitive DeFi markets, dominated by stablecoins, ETH pairs, and wrapped BTC rather than short-lived trading trends like memecoins. That makes fee data a useful measure of where real activity is happening.\nDeFiLlama figures show Curve ranking among the top Ethereum DEXs by fees over the last 30 days, overtaking several long-standing leaders. The attached chart highlights this shift clearly. Curve posted roughly $15.1 million in fees over 30 days, placing it just behind Uniswap while operating with a more focused asset mix.\nThis rise reflects increased usage, not protocol profit. Fees paid by traders do not equal yield distributed to liquidity providers or DAO revenue. Still, they point to sustained demand for Curve\u2019s pools.\nTwo areas stand out. Trading around crvUSD has expanded sharply, making the stablecoin a key source of volume. At the same time, Curve has become home to some of the deepest on-chain Bitcoin liquidity in DeFi, following its integration with Yield Basis. Three BTC pools on Curve now rank at the top by both depth and TVL.\nDAO decisions and ecosystem moves support activity\nGovernance and development have moved alongside this growth. The Curve DAO recently rejected a governance proposal to allocate 17.4 million CRV tokens, worth about $6.2 million, to the DEX\u2019s development team.\nAn amended proposal has since been submitted. Several proposals to add liquidity gauges for new or existing pools are also live.\nRecent deployments on X Layer and Plasma have widened Curve\u2019s footprint. crvUSD adoption continues to grow, reinforcing Curve\u2019s role as a base layer for stablecoin swaps and yield strategies.\nCurve\u2019s team has pointed to a shift in user behavior, with traders favoring protocols built around steady revenue and transparent mechanics rather than short-term speculation. The data now backs that view."

                "body": "BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR) is ending Monday, Dec. 22, 2025 with investors focused on one core question: is BMNR trading like an \u201cEthereum treasury proxy,\u201d or is dilution and governance risk starting to dominate the narrative?\nAfter the closing bell, BMNR\u2019s price action looked relatively contained compared with the stock\u2019s recent swings \u2014 but today\u2019s news flow was anything but quiet, highlighted by a fresh Ethereum holdings milestone and a key proxy amendment that could shape how shareholders vote on the company\u2019s requested share authorization increase.\nBMNR stock after the bell: where it closed and where it traded post-market\nBMNR closed the regular session at $31.09 at 4:00 p.m. ET, after trading in a wide intraday range. Data tracked by StockAnalysis shows Dec. 22 open $32.68, low $30.50, and close $31.09, with heavy turnover (over 40 million shares). [1]\nIn after-hours trading, quotes varied by timestamp: MarketWatch showed BMNR flat at $31.09 around 5:18 p.m. ET with about 2.08 million shares traded after hours at that point. [2] StockAnalysis later showed BMNR around $31.37 near 8:00 p.m. ET, implying a modest late post-market uptick versus the close. [3]\nWhy that matters for tomorrow (Dec. 23): even a \u201cquiet\u201d after-hours session can turn quickly for BMNR because the stock often responds to (1) crypto price moves, and (2) treasury/disclosure headlines.\nWhat changed today: BitMine says it now holds 4.066 million ETH\nThe biggest catalyst on Dec. 22 was BitMine\u2019s treasury update, released in the morning and also filed with the SEC on Form 8\u2011K. [4]\nThe headline numbers (as of Dec. 21 at 3:00 p.m. ET)\nAccording to the company, its combined crypto + cash + \u201cmoonshots\u201d totaled $13.2 billion, consisting of:\n- 4,066,062 ETH, valued at $2,991 per ETH (Coinbase reference price)\n- 193 Bitcoin (BTC)\n- $1.0 billion in cash\n- A $32 million stake in Eightco Holdings (labeled \u201cmoonshots\u201d) [5]\nBitMine also said its Ethereum position equals 3.37% of ETH supply (the company referenced 120.7 million ETH supply) and noted it added 98,852 ETH over the past week. [6]\nInvesting.com framed the same update as BMNR moving closer to a stated goal of acquiring 5% of total ETH supply, and noted that BitMine\u2019s market capitalization \u201cclosely mirrors\u201d the reported holdings at the time of publication. [7]\nWhy investors care: BMNR is increasingly valued like a crypto \u201ctreasury company\u201d\nBitMine\u2019s messaging continues to position BMNR less as a traditional mining/tech operator and more as a public-market vehicle for Ethereum exposure, similar to how Strategy (MSTR) is frequently discussed as a Bitcoin-treasury proxy. The company explicitly called itself the largest ETH treasury and the #2 global crypto treasury behind Strategy. [8]\nThat framing sets up a simple (but volatile) valuation driver for tomorrow:\nIf ETH moves meaningfully overnight, BMNR often reacts \u2014 sometimes more than ETH itself.\nThe proxy amendment filed today: why it matters for dilution risk\nAfter the bell, another filing deserves attention heading into Tuesday: a DEFR14A (Definitive Proxy Statement amendment) dated Dec. 22, 2025.\nWhat the amendment says \u2014 in plain English\nIn an explanatory note, BitMine\u2019s amendment clarifies that the Charter Amendment Proposal (the proposal to increase authorized shares) is considered a \u201croutine\u201d matter under applicable rules, meaning brokers/banks/nominees may exercise discretionary voting authority on that proposal if beneficial owners do not give instructions. [9]\nWhy this is important for BMNR stock:\n- \u201cRoutine\u201d treatment can materially affect vote math, because uninstructed shares held at brokerages may still be voted.\n- For traders, that raises the probability the authorization increase passes \u2014 and with it, the probability of future share issuance.\nWhat the underlying proxy says about the share authorization proposal\nIn the company\u2019s definitive proxy statement (filed earlier in December), BitMine outlines that approval o"

                "body": "Where Will Be in 5 Years?\nEthereum, the powerhouse of decentralized applications and smart contracts, has seen dramatic ups and downs. After hitting an all-time high near $4,900 earlier in the cycle, it\u2019s currently trading significantly lower amid market volatility. But for long-term investors, the question remains: where will cryptocurrency Ethereum be in 5 years? In this in-depth analysis, we\u2019ll explore Ethereum\u2019s strengths, growth drivers, challenges, and realistic price predictions for 2029.\nThe Current State of\nEthereum (ETH) remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trailing only Bitcoin. Despite a sharp correction\u2014down over 40% from its peak\u2014ETH holds strong fundamentals. The crypto market\u2019s cyclical nature means dips like this are common, but history shows recoveries can lead to new highs.\nKey stats as of late 2023:\n- Market dominance in DeFi and NFTs\n- Robust developer ecosystem\n- Transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) completed via The Merge\nWith ongoing upgrades like Dencun and Prague, Ethereum is scaling efficiently through Layer 2 solutions, reducing fees and boosting throughput. This positions it for massive adoption in the coming years.\nEthereum\u2019s Unmatched Dominance in Blockchain\nWhat sets Ethereum apart? It\u2019s not just size\u2014it\u2019s the ecosystem.\nFirst-Mover Advantage in Smart Contracts\nEthereum pioneered smart contracts in 2015, enabling decentralized apps (dApps). This head start has attracted the largest developer community: over 5,200 full-time developers, per recent reports\u2014more than triple Solana\u2019s count.\nDeFi and Stablecoin Leadership\nEthereum powers 63% of total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, worth tens of billions. It\u2019s also home to 54% of stablecoins, a market currently at $310 billion. Forecasts from major firms like Citigroup predict stablecoins exploding to $1.9\u2013$4 trillion by 2030. As DeFi matures into real-world finance\u2014lending, trading, yield farming\u2014Ethereum\u2019s network effects will amplify.\nPro Tip: Stablecoin growth isn\u2019t hype. With regulatory clarity emerging, they\u2019re set to underpin global payments, remittances, and tokenized assets on Ethereum.\nFuture Catalysts: What Could Drive ETH to New Heights\n- Scaling Solutions: Layer 2 rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum are slashing gas fees, making Ethereum usable for everyday transactions. Expect 100x throughput improvements by 2029.\n- Enterprise Adoption: JPMorgan, Visa, and others are building on Ethereum. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) could add trillions in value.\n- ETFs and Regulation: Spot Ethereum ETFs (approved in some regions) will bring institutional money. Clearer U.S. regs could unlock billions more.\n- Web3 Expansion: Gaming, social media, and AI on blockchain\u2014Ethereum leads here too.\nChallenges and Risks Facing Ethereum\nNo crystal ball is perfect. Ethereum faces hurdles:\n- Competition: Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon offer faster, cheaper alternatives. Solana\u2019s developer growth is impressive, but Ethereum\u2019s security and decentralization win for high-value apps.\n- Bitcoin Underperformance: ETH has lagged BTC in some cycles. Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018digital gold\u2019 narrative provides stability.\n- Market Cycles: Bear markets can last 1\u20132 years. Regulatory crackdowns or macro events (recessions) could delay recovery.\n- Technical Risks: Upgrades carry bugs, though Ethereum\u2019s battle-tested.\nPrice Prediction for 2029: Bull, Base, and Bear Cases\nPredictions vary, but here\u2019s a data-driven outlook:\nThese align with analyst consensus from firms like VanEck and Standard Chartered, factoring historical 4-year cycles.\nIs Now the Time to Buy ?\nCurrent prices offer a potential entry point for patient investors. Diversify with Bitcoin for resilience. Dollar-cost average to navigate volatility. Ethereum\u2019s network effects and innovation pipeline suggest it\u2019ll reclaim highs\u2014and surpass them\u2014by 2029.\nFinal Thought: In the words of Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum is \u2018the world computer.\u2019 As blockchain goes mainstream,\nWhat do you think\u2014bullish on ETH?

                "body": "Solana Mobile ended Saga security patches, exposing owners to a critical wallet risk you can\u2019t ignore\nThe company warned that app compatibility \"cannot be guaranteed\" anymore, leaving private keys vulnerable on unpatched devices.\nSolana Mobile has ended software update and security patch support for its Saga smartphone.\nThe company warned that compatibility with new software or services \u201ccannot be guaranteed,\u201d and that Saga-specific customer support is now limited to general inquiries, according to Solana Mobile\u2019s help-center notice.\nSolana Mobile said the change \u201cdoes not affect Seeker devices,\u201d which will continue to receive updates and patches.\nWhat ending Saga support signals for Solana Mobile\u2019s next phase\nThe move sets a time limit on the first wave of \u201ccrypto-native phone\u201d adoption as Solana Mobile seeks to expand from a single handset into a distribution layer for apps, identity, and token incentives.\nEnding patches for a key-carrying endpoint creates a straightforward tradeoff: a smaller long-tail footprint to maintain, and a larger trust burden to carry into the Seeker era.\nIn that next phase, users are being asked to place more daily signing and custody behavior on-device.\nSupport duration is also colliding with the broader direction of the phone market.\nApple\u2019s service policy sets \u201cvintage\u201d status at 5\u20137 years from when a product was last distributed for sale, and \u201cobsolete\u201d after 7 years.\nGoogle says Pixel 8 and later receive 7 years of OS and security updates.\nSamsung has pledged 7 years of updates for the Galaxy S24 line.\nQualcomm and Google have pushed Android\u2019s ecosystem toward longer lifecycles on newer Snapdragon programs.\nAgainst that backdrop, a phone positioned around custody and signing faces a higher bar than a typical Android device.\nWhy long-term software support matters for crypto-first smartphones\nThe downside of unpatched software is not only app breakage, but also potential exposure of keys, approvals, and wallet workflows.\nSolana Mobile is attempting to shift the narrative away from \u201cdevice lifecycle\u201d and toward \u201cplatform lifecycle.\u201d\nIts disclosures are designed to anchor that pivot.\nAt Breakpoint 2024, the company said Seeker had surpassed 150,000 preorders across 57 countries, according to its blog post. Solana Mobile later said Seeker would start shipping worldwide on Aug. 4, 2025.\nThat framing recasts Saga\u2019s end-of-support as a controlled handoff from an early cohort to a larger install base.\nThe company\u2019s next lever is SKR, an incentive layer that ties hardware ownership and usage to token distribution.\nOver time, that system is also intended to support a governance and review model that Solana Mobile calls \u201cGuardians.\u201d\nSolana Mobile said SKR is planned to launch in January 2026 with a total supply of 10 billion tokens and an allocation that includes 30% earmarked for airdrops.\nThe post also said \u201cover $100M in economic activity\u201d has flowed through 175+ dApps during \u201cSeeker Season\u201d over the past few months.\nThat positions the phone as an alternative distribution rail rather than a one-time hardware sale.\nWhat the SKR airdrop math suggests for Seeker holders\nThose figures allow setting expectation ranges without relying on token price assumptions.\nIf 30% of SKR supply is reserved for airdrops, that implies 3 billion SKR designated for distribution, based on Solana Mobile\u2019s published allocation.\nIf 150,000 Seeker preorder holders were eligible on equal terms, that would be 20,000 SKR per device.\nIf eligibility were limited to \u201cactive\u201d devices and 60% qualified, that rises to about 33,333 SKR per active device.\nIf allocations include developers, non-device users, or multiple campaigns, the per-device figure declines accordingly.\nA parallel range can be sketched for platform throughput using Solana Mobile\u2019s \u201cSeeker Season\u201d activity claim.\nIf \u201cpast few months\u201d is interpreted as three to five months, $100 million equates to roughly $20 million to $33 million per month flowing through participating "

This organization supports Raydium, a major automated market maker and liquidity platform on the Solana blockchain. While the specific terms of the agreement remain confidential, the parties have outlined immediate operational steps that reflect the agreement\u2019s intent and scope.\nAs part of the agreement, Utherverse\u00ae\ufe0f, owner of the \u201cRAYS\u201d trademark, has granted a license to Raydium, resolving the conflict created by the similarity between digital asset symbols and the uncertainty it posed for exchanges, listing services, and token holders. Utherverse\u00ae\ufe0f has also increased liquidity support for its digital asset by adding new capital and expanding liquidity pools, the on-chain token reserves that enable direct trading between assets. This agreement includes a new pool that allows users to purchase Utherverse\u2019s digital asset directly with Raydium\u2019s digital asset.\nThese trades occur on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which are on-chain platforms that enable token swaps without intermediaries, meaning third parties that would normally execute or control trades, all operating on the Solana blockchain, a high-performance network designed for fast, low-cost decentralized transactions.\nThis agreement also coincides with Utherverse\u2019s dismissal of lawsuits previously filed against CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The litigation and its resolution have contributed to broader industry clarity around how token symbols and trademark rights intersect across the digital-asset landscape.\n\u201cWe are pleased to have reached a constructive resolution that supports the Radium and Utherverse\u00ae\ufe0f token holders, as well as organizations participating in the Solana ecosystem,\u201d said Brian Shuster, CEO of Utherverse\u00ae\ufe0f.\n\u201cAs Web3 matures, legal infrastructure will be essential for reducing regulatory uncertainty and unlocking value for builders and users,\u201d said Aaron Wright, Professor at Cardozo School of Law and Co-Founder of OpenLaw (Decrypt, September 2022, SourceOpens). Furthermore, he said, \u201cWe need frameworks that provide clarity and flexibility so DAOs can experiment while protecting participants and staying compliant\u201d (Bankless Podcast, Jan. 2023).\nThis development comes amid heightened scrutiny of trademark governance, token identity standards, and liquidity-pool transparency, issues that have gained greater visibility across blockchain communities following recent regulatory commentary and shifts in the broader digital-asset market.\nAbout Utherverse\nUtherverse\u00ae\ufe0f is a pioneer in 3D internet and metaverse technology, known for creating one of the earliest large-scale virtual worlds. Since 2005, Utherverse has served millions of users and supported thousands of virtual businesses. Utherverse continues to advance immersive technology through its proprietary XAEON\u2122\ufe0f Metaverse Engine, a platform built for high-fidelity virtual interaction and commercial scalability.\nAbout Raydium\nRaydium is a high-performance automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity protocol built on the Solana blockchain. It provides on-chain liquidity for decentralized exchanges and enables fast, low-cost token swaps, yield strategies, and market-making across the Solana ecosystem. Raydium powers trading infrastructure for numerous decentralized applications and serves as a core liquidity engine supporting the broader Solana DeFi landscape.\nAbout the Raydium Foundation\nThe Raydium Foundation supports Raydium, a core automated market maker and liquidity protocol on the Solana blockchain. The Foundation oversees development, ecosystem coordination, and community participation to maintain secure, efficient on-chain liquidity and trading infrastructure across the Solana ecosystem.\n###\nFor more information about Utherverse, contact the company h"

According to CryptoRank data, industry leaders used these stages to outline priorities that extend beyond price cycles.\nCollectively, these discussions point toward structural changes shaping crypto markets through 2026. Besides speculation, the focus now centers on real utility, institutional readiness, and user expansion. Consequently, five themes stand out as potential drivers of the next crypto era.\nStablecoins Move Into the Financial Core\nStablecoins emerged as the strongest shared narrative across all three ecosystems. Binance CEO Richard Teng emphasized their growing role in global payments and institutional settlement rails.\nHence, stablecoins now act as bridges between crypto networks and traditional finance systems. Solana strengthened this trend by supporting new dollar-linked assets such as jupUSD and USDGO.\nAdditionally, USD+ expands Solana\u2019s appeal for on-chain commerce and treasury operations. Coinbase advanced the concept further by unveiling custom stablecoins for enterprises.\nThese products allow companies to issue branded digital dollars with flexible backing models. Consequently, stablecoins now function as programmable financial infrastructure rather than simple trading tools.\nTokenization Expands Beyond Theory\nReal-world asset tokenization also gained momentum across the conferences. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao engaged in a public debate around digital gold concepts and trust assumptions.\nHowever, the broader industry focus shifted toward execution rather than philosophy. Solana-backed initiatives accelerated this shift through large-scale deployments. Keel launched a $500 million program to tokenize real-world assets directly on Solana.\nMoreover, Bhutan introduced TER, a sovereign-backed gold token for global markets. JPMorgan added credibility by settling a short-term bond issuance on Solana. Coinbase plans to consolidate these efforts through its upcoming Coinbase Tokenize platform. Hence, tokenization now moves from experimentation toward regulated institutional use.\nRegulation, AI, and New Market Formats Converge\nRegulatory alignment appeared as a shared strategic priority. Binance and Solana highlighted growing corporate inflows and structured TradFi partnerships. Meanwhile, Coinbase doubled down on compliance-first product design to attract institutions. Additionally, prediction markets gained renewed attention despite limited stage time.\nYZi Labs backed multiple prediction-focused startups this month. Solana wallets now integrate prediction tools through Kalshi partnerships. Coinbase also rolled out Kalshi-powered prediction markets inside its app. AI integration further reinforced platform differentiation.\nBinance announced AI-driven trading and risk tools targeting 2026. Solflare launched Magic AI for conversational on-chain actions. Coinbase introduced Coinbase Advisor, offering in-app financial guidance powered by AI.\nSignificantly, user growth strategies tied these trends together. Binance Junior targets younger audiences through controlled crypto education. Moreover, Solana DEX trading will soon integrate directly into the Coinbase app. Consequently, crypto platforms now prioritize accessibility, compliance, and real-world functionality over hype-driven expansion."

This comes as trading remains light due to the holiday-shortened week leading up to Christmas.\nUS index futures are benefiting from previous strong gains on Wall Street, spearheaded by technology stocks. In Friday\u2019s session, the Dow Jones increased 0.38%, the S&P 500 went up 0.88%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.31%, supported by optimism in AI-related shares.\nMarket Caution And Fed Policy\nMarket caution persists due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s careful policy stance. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack noted that policy is equipped to pause, evaluating the impact of 75-basis-point rate cuts in the first quarter, according to Bloomberg.\nThe CME FedWatch tool shows a 78.0% probability of no rate change at the Fed\u2019s January meeting, up from 75.6% the previous week. The chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut decreased to 22.0% from 24.4%.\nTraders await US Q3 Gross Domestic Product data, corporate profits, and industrial production figures, following data that suggested possible future Fed rate cuts.\nWe are seeing positive momentum in index futures, primarily driven by optimism around artificial intelligence stocks. However, with this being a holiday-shortened week, we anticipate light trading volumes which can sometimes exaggerate market moves. This suggests that while the trend is upward, any positions should be managed with caution.\nUnderstanding Tech Sentiment\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s measured outlook introduces a note of caution for us. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack\u2019s recent comments about pausing to assess the economy reinforce this view. The market is now pricing in a 78% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady in January, which means the easy gains from anticipating rate cuts may be behind us for now.\nThe bullish sentiment in tech is understandable, especially after key players in the semiconductor space reported earnings beats of over 15% in November 2025, boosting guidance on strong AI-related demand. Yet, we must weigh this against the latest Consumer Price Index data, which showed inflation at 3.4% year-over-year, slightly above consensus expectations. This persistent inflation explains the Fed\u2019s hesitant stance on further easing.\nLooking back, the market\u2019s strong performance this year has been fueled by the 75 basis points in rate cuts we saw from the Fed in the first quarter of 2025. Now, we are in a period of assessment, with the central bank trying to gauge if those cuts have reignited price pressures. This dynamic suggests that volatility could pick up as new data on GDP and corporate profits is released this week.\nGiven the low trading volumes and optimistic mood, short-dated call options on tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq 100 could be a way to participate in a potential year-end rally. Conversely, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) currently trading near a yearly low of 13.5, purchasing protective puts is relatively inexpensive as a hedge against any unexpected negative news. These low volatility levels can present opportunities, but they also signal a degree of market complacency."

                "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 December 22, 2025 (10:14 a.m. ET) \u2014 The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) traded higher in mid\u2011morning action as Wall Street opened a holiday\u2011shortened week with a risk\u2011on tone. The Dow hovered around 48,326, up about 191 points (+0.40%), with the broader market also firmer as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite advanced. (Market quotes are delayed by at least 15 minutes.) [1]\nEarlier in the session, Reuters reported that by 9:36 a.m. ET the Dow was up about 180 points at roughly 48,315, supported by renewed enthusiasm in technology\u2014especially AI\u2011linked and semiconductor names\u2014alongside strength in materials and energy. [2]\nBelow is what\u2019s driving the Dow right now, the biggest headlines shaping sentiment on 12/22/2025, and the key forecasts and levels traders are watching into year\u2011end.\nWhy the Dow is up today: AI optimism spreads beyond the Nasdaq\nThe early gains are being framed less as a \u201cchasing momentum\u201d day and more as a continuation of the late\u2011week rebound led by tech and semiconductors. Reuters highlighted several AI\u2011adjacent catalysts that helped keep buyers active at the start of the week, including:\n- Micron extending gains after strong guidance, helping lift semiconductor peers and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index early Monday. [3]\n- Nvidia rising as traders digested a Reuters report that the company aims to ship a powerful AI chip to China ahead of the Lunar New Year period. [4]\n- A broader narrative that last week\u2019s pullback in many high\u2011profile names is being treated as a buy\u2011the\u2011dip opportunity, reinforced by earnings resilience, according to comments Reuters attributed to a major wealth manager. [5]\nThis matters for the Dow Jones even though the index is more industrial and value\u2011tilted than the Nasdaq: when tech leadership stabilizes overall risk appetite, it can support cyclical Dow constituents (industrials, banks, energy) through improved sentiment and broader participation.\nTesla, Nvidia, and other headline movers shaping the tape\nSingle\u2011stock stories were also doing heavy lifting in an otherwise quiet pre\u2011Christmas session:\n- Tesla jumped after Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court restored Elon Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package, a decision that was widely cited as a key driver of the stock\u2019s early move. [6]\n- Warner Bros. Discovery rose on news tied to acquisition financing support involving Larry Ellison and a bid dynamic around Paramount Skydance. [7]\n- Clearwater Analytics surged after announcing an $8.4 billion take\u2011private transaction. [8]\nIn holiday trading, these idiosyncratic headlines can have an outsized effect on index behavior\u2014not because they \u201cchange the economy,\u201d but because lighter liquidity can amplify moves, especially in widely held mega\u2011caps.\nCommodities are a second tailwind: oil jumps, gold and silver hit records\nWhile tech grabbed attention, commodities were also part of Monday\u2019s story:\n- The Associated Press reported that oil prices jumped after news connected to U.S. Coast Guard action involving another sanctioned oil tanker linked to Venezuela. [9]\n- Gold and silver set new record highs in the same coverage, reinforcing the idea that investors are still positioning for an environment where rate cuts remain plausible\u2014even as risk assets grind higher. [10]\nThis commodity strength dovetails with Reuters\u2019 observation that materials and energy were leading sector gainers in early Monday trade. [11]\nDow movers: Chevron and Merck among the biggest point contributors\nBecause the DJIA is price\u2011weighted, individual components with higher share prices can have disproportionate influence on the index\u2019s point moves.\nMarketWatch\u2019s intraday read noted that Chevron and Merck were among the largest positive contributors in the morning, along with support from other heavyweight names. It also emphasized how price moves translate into index points (a reminder of how the Dow\u2019s mechanics differ from market\u2011cap weighted benchmarks).

                "body": "S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones futures trade near flat line as US stock futures see little change after Wall Street makes a positive start to the holiday-shortened trading week\nSynopsis\nWall Street opened the holiday week on a positive note. Major indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones ended the day in positive territory. Technology and banking sectors drove the gains. Nvidia and JPMorgan saw significant increases. Uber and Lyft also advanced. The market anticipates a calm holiday week.\nThe gains were broad and were led by technology companies and banks. Industrial companies also gave a strong push to major indexes. The S&P 500 rose 43.99 points, or 0.6 percent, to 6,878.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 227.79 points, or 0.5 percent, to 48,362.68. The Nasdaq Composite rose 121.21 points, or 0.5 percent, to 23,428.83.\nTechnology companies, especially those focused on artificial intelligence, have been the main force behind the market's oscillations. The direction of AI-related stocks will likely determine whether the market closes out December with gains or losses.\nNvidia, which has had a big role in driving the broader tech sector higher in 2025, increased 1.5 percent. JPMorgan was among the bigger winners in the banking sector with a 1.9 percent gain. Uber rose 2.5 percent, and Lyft rose 2.7 percent after announcing plans to bring robotaxi services to London next year.\nALSO READ: Wall Street kicks off Christmas week on a high as Tech, banking stocks boost gains, Gold and silver prices rise - Here\u2019s how S&P 500, NASDAQ and Dow performed; check top gainers and losers\nParamount Skydance rose 4.3 percent.

                "body": "London\u2019s equity market heads into the Christmas week with a very different feel from the one investors have grown used to in recent years: the FTSE 100 is sitting close to record territory after a powerful 2025, but the domestic economic backdrop is deteriorating, and liquidity is thinning fast as the holiday break approaches. [1]\nEarly indications on Monday, 22 December 2025, point to a cautious start for UK stocks. FTSE 100 futures were signalling a modest dip (around -0.2%), as traders balance a late-year \u201cSanta\u201d mood in global risk assets against downbeat UK surveys and fresh economic data that underlines how sluggish growth remains. [2]\nFTSE 100 and FTSE 250: the starting point for UK shares this morning\nBy the end of last week, the UK market had put in one of its strongest bursts in months. On Friday, the FTSE 100 finished up 0.61%, wrapping a 2.6% weekly gain\u2014its best week since mid-October\u2014helped by strength in miners and defence names amid a data-heavy stretch and a Bank of England rate cut. [3]\nThe latest widely quoted \u201cmarket overview\u201d readings still reflect that closing position: FTSE 100 at 9,897.42 and FTSE 250 at 22,312.71 (delayed). [4]\nInto today\u2019s open, the tone is more measured. Reuters\u2019 morning \u201cfactors to watch\u201d note the FTSE 100 is seen opening lower, while Proactive Investors flagged the index being called about 10 points down after last week\u2019s jump. [5]\nWhy this \u201cpause for breath\u201d matters\nThis is a classic year-end setup: big moves can happen on thin volumes, and even modest headlines can provoke outsized reactions\u2014especially in sectors like miners, oil & gas, and large-cap defensives that dominate the FTSE 100. IG also warned that reduced holiday liquidity can amplify swings across asset classes. [6]\nUK economy: GDP stays at 0.1%, but the message is still \u201cstagnation\u201d\nThe biggest scheduled UK macro headline today is the confirmation that the economy hasn\u2019t found momentum. The Office for National Statistics said UK GDP grew 0.1% in Q3 (July\u2013September 2025), unrevised, while Q2 growth was revised down to 0.2%. On the year, GDP was 1.3% higher than a year earlier (and 0.9% higher per capita). [7]\nThat\u2019s not a recession print\u2014but it\u2019s not a growth story, either. The Bank of England has already been signalling that the economy is weak: last week, it said it expected zero growth in Q4, even as it judged underlying growth to be modestly positive. [8]\nThe external position improved\u2014but trade remains a drag\nAlongside GDP, the ONS also published balance of payments detail showing the current account deficit narrowed to \u00a312.1bn (1.6% of GDP) in Q3, and the \u201cunderlying\u201d measure excluding precious metals narrowed to \u00a310.5bn (1.4% of GDP). [9]\nHowever, the same release underlines the UK\u2019s persistent structural challenge: the trade deficit excluding precious metals widened to \u00a34.6bn (0.6% of GDP), with the goods deficit at \u00a357.4bn even as the services surplus rose to \u00a352.8bn. [10]\nFor UK equities, this mix matters because the FTSE 100 is globally exposed (many constituents earn revenues in dollars and euros), while the FTSE 250 is more domestically sensitive\u2014and therefore more directly tied to UK demand, hiring, and household confidence. [11]\nBusiness surveys turn gloomier: CBI signals a weak handover into 2026\nIf the GDP release is \u201cstagnant but stable,\u201d the forward-looking surveys are more uncomfortable reading. The CBI\u2019s latest Growth Indicator pointed to a private-sector downturn into year-end, with its weighted balance falling to -30% in December and weakness reported across sectors. [12]\nProactive Investors reported the same CBI finding as part of today\u2019s market setup, noting that the survey implied no growth expected this quarter or next and echoed the Bank of England\u2019s own staff forecasts for a flat finish to 2025. [13]\nJobs: vacancies keep shrinking even as pay pressures persist\nThe labour market narrative is also splitting in two. Adzuna data cited in UK reporting showed vacancies fell again in November\u2014dow"

                "body": "Reports of Nvidia planning H200 shipments to China lifted sentiment in early trading on Tuesday, December 23. The latest developments in the US-China trade reboot highlighted easing trade tensions, lifting risk sentiment.\nThe Nvidia news coincided with rising bets on a March Fed rate cut, boosting demand for high-capex tech stocks. US stock futures were steady during the Asian session, consolidating overnight gains.\nMeanwhile, 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) and US Treasury yields pulled back, bolstering demand for risk assets. However, the yen was on intervention watch. USD/JPY dropped 0.46% to 156.301, capping gains for the Nikkei 225.\nImproving US-China trade relations and rising bets on a Fed rate cut support a constructive bias for US equity futures.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the key market drivers, the medium-term outlook, and the key technical levels traders should watch.\nA shift in US trade policy lifted risk sentiment on Tuesday, December 23, as reports circulated of the Trump administration allowing Nvidia to resume H200 shipments to China. CN Wire reported:\n\u201cNvidia has told Chinese clients it plans to ship H200 AI chips to China before the mid-February Lunar New Year, sources said. [\u2026] It follows a Trump administration policy shift allowing H200 sales to China with a 25% fee, reversing an earlier ban.\u201d\nThe latest trade developments followed upward revisions to China\u2019s GDP growth projections. Goldman Sachs raised China\u2019s 2025 GDP growth forecast from 4.5% to 5.0%, matching Beijing\u2019s GDP growth target.\nPositive trade developments coincided with renewed hopes for a March Fed rate cut. Lower borrowing costs would increase company earnings and share prices. Cooling US inflation and a softer labor market have fueled speculation about a more dovish Fed rate path.\nUS unemployment rose from 4.4% in October to 4.6% in November, while headline inflation unexpectedly dropped from 3.0% in September to 2.7% in November. (There was no October CPI report because of the government shutdown.)\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a March cut increased from 51% on December 15 to 52.9% on December 22.\nCrucially, expectations of a more dovish incoming Fed Chair have raised expectations of further Fed policy easing, in contrast with the Dot Plot\u2019s one-rate cut projection.\nUS futures were steady during the Asian morning session on Tuesday, December 23. The Nasdaq 100 E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini advanced 28 points and 5 points, respectively, while the Dow Jones E-mini was flat.\nLater on Tuesday, US economic data will influence demand for US stock futures, with GDP and labor market figures in focus.\nAccording to first-estimate data, the US economy expanded by 3.2% quarter-on-quarter (Q3) in Q3, cooling from 3.8% GDP growth in Q2. A lower GDP reading would likely raise expectations of a March Fed rate cut, reinforcing the bullish short- to medium-term outlook for US equity futures.\nMeanwhile, the ADP will report weekly employment figures, following last week\u2019s jobs report. The Kobeissi Letter commented on a weakening US labor market, stating:\n\u201cThe US economy lost 983,000 full-time jobs in October and November, bringing the total down to 134.2 million, the lowest since December 2021. As a result, just 78.2% of the labor force is now employed full-time, the lowest since June 2021. This percentage has now declined 2.5 points since the June 2023 peak. In the past, such a trend has usually been seen during recessions. [\u2026] The labor market needs more rate cuts.\u201d\nDespite a steady Asian-session performance on Tuesday morning, the Dow Jones E-mini, the Nasdaq 100 E-mini, and the S&P 500 E-mini remained above their 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The EMAs indicated a positive medium-term bias.\nNear-term trends will hinge on US data, Fed rhetoric, and Bank of Japan chatter. Key levels to monitor include:\nDow Jones\nNasdaq 100\nS&P 500\nIn my opinion, the short-term outlook remains bullish given the alignment of technical indicators and fundamenta"

                "body": "Why a Fed rate cut could lead to bad news for Big Tech stocks\nInvestors are looking for an interest rate cut \u2014 but the market may not respond as expected when it comes.\n\"I think that the market's going to have to come to grips with the Fed is going to cut rates, and is it going to be the right move for the Fed to make now?\" Jim Bianco of Bianco Research said on Opening Bid.\nJuly's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed core inflation rose 0.3%, the largest increase in six months.\n\"Last year they cut rates, and the market decided it wasn't the right move,\" Bianco added. \"And it shot yields on the 10 [year Treasury] and the 30-year up over 100 basis points.\"\nBianco said the real inflationary pressure is building due to Trump's tariffs, and the impact could be significant. While some of the costs may be eaten by exporters or corporations, others will be passed on via price hikes.\n\"There's about an extra $250 to $300 billion of tariffs that are going to be collected over the next year ... tariffs were running around $8 billion a month. Now they're running nearly $30 billion a month,\" he noted.\nBianco expects Fed Chair Jerome Powell to provide some clarity at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium later this month. And if Powell signals a September cut isn't coming, the backlash could be intense \u2014 including renewed political pressure from President Trump, who has previously floated the idea of firing the Fed chair.\nAdvertisement\n\"If he says he's not going to cut rates, I would then put Trump firing him back into the play,\" Bianco said.\nThe Fed's decision could also have an outsized impact on megacap tech stocks. The largest 10% of US companies now account for 76% of total market capitalization, the highest concentration on record, according to market data platform Barchart.\nThe concentration makes the entire market vulnerable to shifts in interest rates. As yields go higher, money could move out of stocks and into bonds. Bianco warned that if 10-year Treasury yields hit 5%, it could trigger profit-taking in Big Tech stocks.\nBianco advised investors to stay cautious when chasing the market's most popular names. \"If you want to play some of these Mag 7s, you have to be prepared for big gains and big losses,\" he said. \"Some think it's all a one-way street ... until it isn't.\"\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

                "body": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s final meeting of 2025 has delivered exactly what Wall Street expected on paper \u2013 a third quarter\u2011point rate cut \u2013 but the message around it is anything but simple. Stocks have pushed toward fresh highs, bond yields are slipping, and index futures are flashing a more cautious tone as investors digest what many are calling a classic \u201chawkish cut.\u201d\nOn Thursday, December 11, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were trading near record levels, even as futures on those same indexes pointed modestly lower earlier in the day and tech stocks lagged. [1]\nAt the center of the move: a divided Fed, delayed economic data after a historic government shutdown, and growing political pressure ahead of a leadership change at the U.S. central bank. [2]\nWhat the Fed Just Did \u2014 And Why It\u2019s Being Called a \u2018Hawkish Cut\u2019\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point, bringing the federal funds target range down to 3.50%\u20133.75%. It was the third rate cut of 2025, aimed at supporting a softening labor market after months of slowing job growth. [3]\nBut the details of the decision made it clear this was no simple pivot back to ultra\u2011easy policy:\n- Split vote: The decision featured rare open disagreement. Two policymakers voted against cutting rates, arguing there was no need to ease now, while another dissented because he wanted a larger, half\u2011point move. [4]\n- A pause signal: New projections show Fed officials see only one additional quarter\u2011point cut in 2026 and one more in 2027, effectively signaling a pause after this move unless the data deteriorate. [5]\n- Inflation still \u2018somewhat elevated\u2019: The Fed\u2019s statement pointedly noted that inflation remains above target, even as the labor market shows downside risks, underscoring the narrow path between fighting price pressures and avoiding unnecessary damage to jobs. [6]\nComplicating the picture: the Fed is flying partially blind. A 43\u2011day U.S. government shutdown delayed key indicators, pushing the November jobs report to December 16 and inflation data to later in the month. [7]\nFed Chair Jerome Powell stressed that another rate hike is \u201cnot the base case,\u201d but he also refused to pre\u2011commit to further cuts, telling markets the path ahead will depend heavily on incoming data once the statistical fog lifts. [8]\nWall Street\u2019s Two\u2011Day Whiplash: Rally First, Then a Softer Open\nWednesday: Relief Rally After the Decision\nOnce the Fed announcement hit and Powell\u2019s press conference began, markets did what they often do when uncertainty clears \u2014 they rallied.\n- The Dow jumped about 1.05%, or nearly 500 points, to roughly 48,058.\n- The S&P 500 gained around 0.67% to just under 6,887.\n- The Nasdaq Composite climbed roughly 0.33%. [9]\nAt the same time, Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar fell, as investors cheered a cut that seemed supportive of growth without hinting at an imminent policy reversal. [10]\nOne portfolio manager described it as \u201cmusic to both the bond market and the stock market\u2019s ears,\u201d reflecting relief that the Fed wasn\u2019t shutting down the prospect of future easing altogether, even while projecting just one cut in 2026. [11]\nThursday Morning: Futures Turn Lower\nBy Thursday morning, however, the sugar high was fading.\nFutures on major U.S. indexes slipped as investors shifted from celebrating \u201ca cut\u201d to parsing the implications of \u201ca hawkish cut\u201d:\n- Dow futures were about 0.1% lower.\n- S&P 500 futures fell roughly 0.5%.\n- Nasdaq 100 futures dropped close to 0.8%. [12]\nThis pullback came after cash indexes had already approached or set record highs, suggesting traders were locking in gains and reassessing the Fed\u2019s relatively stingy 2026 outlook.\nCorporate news added its own twists. A disappointing earnings report from Oracle and concerns about stretched AI valuations dragged the Nasdaq and several big\u2011name tech stocks lower, even as blue\u2011chip Dow components like Visa, Home Depot and UnitedHealth extended their gains.

                "body": "Vice President Vance says people who attack his wife 'can eat s---'\nHe was asked about Nick Fuentes, who has made racist comments about Usha Vance.\nVice President JD Vance said that anyone who attacks his wife, second lady Usha Vance, \"can eat s---\" during an interview with UnHerd over the weekend.\nThe comments came after he was asked whether he disavows right-wing podcaster Nick Fuentes, who has made multiple racist comments about Vance's wife and children for their Indian identities. Fuentes' recent comments, including using a racial slur to refer to Usha Vance, have drawn backlash from Republicans such as Vivek Ramaswamy.\nVance also called out former Biden White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who now is a host on MS NOW. Psaki recently speculated on Vance's marriage during an appearance on the \"I've Had It\" podcast, and while talking about Vance\u2019s presidential ambitions, suggested that Usha Vance may need to be saved.\n\"The think the little Manchurian candidate, JD Vance wants to be president more than anything else. I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife. Are you OK? Please blink four times. Come over here, we'll save you. And that he's willing to do anything to get there,\" Psaki said on the show.\nVance told UnHerd: \"On Fuentes, I\u2019ve criticized him in the past, but let me be clear: anyone who attacks my wife, whether their name is Jen Psaki or Nick Fuentes, can eat s---. That\u2019s my official policy as vice president of the United States. And my attitude towards anybody, again, who is calling for judging people based on their ethnic heritage, whether they\u2019re Jewish or white or anything else, it's disgusting. We shouldn't be doing it.\"\nVance being asked to disavow Fuentes also comes days after Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator, called on conservative leaders to disavow Fuentes during his AmericaFest speech.\nUsha Vance is the first Indian American second lady in U.S. history. Prior to her husband being elected vice president, she was a lawyer at a firm involved in civil litigation. She and JD Vance met at Yale Law School. They share three children.\nOn the 2024 campaign trail, Usha Vance faced racist online backlash from far-right social media posts.\nIn October, Vice President Vance defended comments about his faith and marriage after critics accused him of throwing his wife's Hindu religion \"under a bus\" during a Turning Point USA event.\nAt the event, Vance spoke about his conversion to Catholicism and said he hopes \"eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.\"\n\"But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me,\u201d the vice president said.\nResponding to online backlash to his comments, Vance wrote in a post on X, \"My Christian faith tells me the Gospel is true and is good for human beings. My wife -- as I said at the TPUSA -- is the most amazing blessing I have in my life. She herself encouraged me to reengage with my faith many years ago. She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage -- or any interfaith relationship -- I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife.\"\nABC News' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report."

                "body": "It takes a special kind of leader to spend $2.5 billion on a weapons system, never use it, alienate his most important allies, get kicked out of the world\u2019s most advanced fighter jet program, endure years of sanctions \u2014 and then ask the seller for a refund.\nYet here we are. Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised the possibility of returning Russia\u2019s S-400 air defense system during his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Turkmenistan last week, according to Bloomberg. The Kremlin has denied any such request was made, which tells you something about how Moscow views the optics of this diplomatic volte-face. Even Putin, not known for sparing the blushes of supplicants, seems embarrassed on Erdogan\u2019s behalf.\nThe Turkish leader\u2019s predicament is a case study in the perils of allowing domestic political considerations \u2014 and personal pique \u2014 to override foreign policy and national security. The S-400 saga has been, from start to finish, a monument to poor judgment. And now the bill is coming due.\nCast your mind back to 2017, when Erdogan signed the deal with Moscow. Turkey was in the grip of post-coup paranoia, with the president accusing his NATO allies \u2014 the Americans especially \u2014 of supporting the plotters of the failed 2016 coup attempt to overthrow him. The accusations served his domestic purposes, stoking nationalist resentment and justifying his pivot toward Moscow. Relations with Washington had curdled during the Obama years, and Erdogan nursed a particular grievance over the failure to secure Patriot missiles on terms he found acceptable.\nThe S-400 purchase was his riposte: a defiant middle finger to the Western alliance. Turkish pro-government media celebrated it as an assertion of sovereignty, proof that Ankara would not be dictated to by Washington. Nationalist constituencies, whose support Erdogan needed to maintain his grip on power, ate it up. Never mind that the Russian system was incompatible with NATO\u2019s integrated air defenses. Never mind that it couldn\u2019t actually cover Turkey\u2019s air defense gaps.\nNever mind that it would cost Turkey its place in the F-35 program, for which Turkish companies were manufacturing more than 900 components and would have earned over $9 billion over the life of the project, according to estimates by the Pentagon. The symbolism was what mattered. And symbols, as any student of Turkish politics knows, are Erdogan\u2019s stock in trade.\nThe trouble with symbols is that they make for terrible strategic assets. The S-400 batteries arrived in 2019 and have sat largely idle ever since. Turkey conducted a single test firing near Sinop in 2020, then quietly mothballed the system. It has never been operationally deployed. The \"sovereignty\" that Erdogan purchased has manifested as several billion dollars worth of Russian hardware gathering dust.\nThe costs have been devastatingly real. In 2019, Washington kicked Turkey out of the F-35 consortium, halting delivery of jets Ankara had already paid $1.4 billion toward. In Dec. 2020, the Trump Administration imposed sanctions on Turkey, cutting off its defense procurement agency from U.S. financial institutions, military hardware, and sensitive technology. Turkish defense companies that had been integral to the F-35 supply chain found themselves frozen out.\nFor six years, Erdogan tried to have it both ways \u2014 keeping the Russian missiles while lobbying for a return to America\u2019s good graces. As recently as September, Turkish officials were floating the idea of a \"technical military mechanism\" to supervise the S-400s in some controlled fashion, hoping Donald Trump might find a legislative loophole to let them keep the hardware while regaining F-35 access.\nWashington wasn\u2019t buying. Ambassador Tom Barrack, a close Trump ally, made clear this month that Turkey must abandon the S-400 entirely if it wants back into the F-35 family. The message finally seems to have penetrated: there is no clever workaround, no face-saving half-measure. Erdogan must eat his words or f"
