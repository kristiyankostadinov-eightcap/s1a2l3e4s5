While coordinated OPEC+ production cuts offset non-OPEC gains in 2024, global output rebounded in 2025, rising an estimated 2.2 MMbpd. Non-OPEC producers contributed about 1.7 MMbpd of that increase, with Brazil, Guyana and Argentina responsible for roughly 28% of total global growth.\nIn Brazil, crude oil output surged in 2025 following the start-up of new FPSOs in deepwater developments. Production exceeded 4.0 MMbpd for the first time in October, supported by the October start-up of Equinor\u2019s Bacalhau field and additional capacity additions earlier in the year. The EIA forecasts Brazilian crude production will average about 4.0 MMbpd in 2026, supported by two additional FPSOs scheduled to come online at Petrobras\u2019 Buzios field.\nGuyana continues to post one of the fastest oil production growth rates globally, with output rising nearly tenfold since 2020. Production averaged an estimated 750,000 bpd in 2025, driven by developments in the Stabroek Block operated by ExxonMobil, alongside partners Hess and CNOOC. The EIA noted that ExxonMobil\u2019s Yellowtail project reached full capacity in late 2025, pushing Guyana\u2019s production above 900,000 bpd in November. The start-up of the Uaru project in 2026 is expected to add 250,000 bpd, helping Guyana surpass 1.0 MMbpd by 2027.\nIn Argentina, crude production growth is being driven by the Vaca Muerta shale play, one of the few unconventional oil basins outside the U.S. producing at scale. Argentine output is forecast to rise from about 740,000 bpd in 2025 to roughly 810,000 bpd in 2026, with Vaca Muerta accounting for more than 60% of national production.\nThe EIA said combined growth from Brazil, Guyana and Argentina will remain a key factor shaping global supply balances as non-OPEC production continues to expand into 2026."

                "body": "It\u2019s a busy stretch for global markets, with multiple macro catalysts converging at once. Lots of central banks are meeting in Europe, including the European Central Bank, while from the US we have CPI and jobless claims to look forward to. These events will put the EUR/USD forecast firmly in focus, as investors start to look forward to 2026.\nECB preview: Bar for policy adjustment high\nThe threshold for any policy shift from the European Central Bank remains firmly elevated, yet talk of a rate hike in 2026 is premature. The ECB is expected to lean once again on its familiar \u201cgood place\u201d narrative at today\u2019s meeting, leaving both rates and forward guidance unchanged. However, recent market repricing towards the prospect of a rate cut next year will put greater focus on the updated staff projections, broader communication and the Q&A at President Christine Lagarde\u2019s press conference. While the ECB will maintain its data-dependent stance, Lagarde may subtly signal that policy rates are likely to remain on hold for an extended period.\nWatch out for some changes in the ECB\u2019s forecast. I anticipate upward revisions to the central bank\u2019s economic growth forecasts following the slight improvement in survey-based, forward-looking, data and the recent upside surprise in GDP. CPI inflation projections may well be nudged lower thanks to softer energy prices.\nEven so, the ECB appears comfortable with its current policy stance and with market pricing that implies stable rates through next year. The bar for any policy adjustment at forthcoming meetings in early parts of 2026 will be high. But any downside risks to inflation dominating next year, then talks of a rate cut would resurface. A stronger euro should weigh on imported inflation too.\nUS CPI: important, but far from decisive\nAfter the ECB rate decision, attention will quickly shift to US inflation data, before the ECB press conference starts. Disruptions related to the government shutdown have affected data collection, meaning this CPI print offers a less complete picture than usual. Several monthly components are either missing or delayed, limiting the conclusions policymakers and markets can realistically draw.\nHeadline CPI for November is expected to rise to 3.1% year-on-year, up from 3.0% previously. A result in line with expectations would reinforce the narrative of inflation proving sticky rather than re-accelerating. Crucially, however, it is unlikely to meaningfully alter the Fed\u2019s policy outlook. One data point \u2014 particularly an incomplete one \u2014 is unlikely to outweigh broader trends in labour market cooling.\nRecent Fed communication supports this view. Fed Governor Chris Waller struck a broadly dovish tone earlier this week, highlighting emerging labour market softness and suggesting rates remain 50\u2013100bp above neutral. That said, there was no urgency to cut, and markets continue to price only a modest chance of a January move, with March seen as the more realistic starting point for easing.\nEUR/USD forecast: Europe may matter more for the dollar than US data\nToday\u2019s US data is unlikely to be a gamechanger for the dollar unless jobless claims deliver a major upside surprise. Instead, attention is increasingly shifting toward Europe and how policymakers there frame the outlook for 2026. Guidance from the ECB and BoE could have a much larger influence on FX pricing than today\u2019s US releases. If the ECB is perceived as being less concerned about medium-term inflation risks than markets expect, that could provide the catalyst for renewed euro buying.\nEUR/USD technical analysis and key levels\nFrom a technical perspective, the EUR/USD forecast remains in a bullish trend. This is reflected in rising moving averages, a short-term bullish trend line, and price action that has continued to post higher highs and higher lows in recent weeks. Against this backdrop, it remains difficult to take a bearish view on EUR/USD exchange rate.\nThat said, price has eased back slightly from the 1.18 "

                "body": "The GBP/USD pair managed to recover more than 0.3% today in favor of the British pound, maintaining an intact bullish bias, even though the Bank of England announced a new rate cut in its latest decision. Part of this resilience may be due to the fact that the decision was not unanimous, which softens the interpretation of a fully dovish shift, and also because of the ongoing weakness of the U.S. dollar, which has allowed the pound to remain firm. As long as these factors persist in the market, a more relevant bullish pressure could continue to shape short-term movements in the pair.\nBOE Decision Day Arrives\nDuring today\u2019s session, December 18, the Bank of England announced its interest rate decision, cutting the rate by 0.25%, from 4.00% to 3.75%, marking a new dovish stance toward the end of the year.\nThe recent decision was driven by essential factors in the behavior of the labor market, which has begun to show a consistent slowdown over the past few months, as well as the behavior of inflation data in the UK, which now shows a decline from the year\u2019s peak observed in September\u2014when the annual rate stood near 3.8%\u2014to the data published for November, which revealed a decrease toward 3.2%. This has led the central bank to believe there is more room for lower rates and has, in part, influenced the decision to cut the interest rate at the end of the year.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nWith this in mind, under normal circumstances, a decline in interest rates would be expected to reduce the attractiveness of pound-denominated investments, weakening demand for the currency. However, this was not the case, as the vote was not unanimous: 5 votes in favor and 4 against, highlighting growing internal indecision within the Bank of England. Over time, this does not guarantee that the lower-rate outlook will be sustained through the early months of 2026, especially if this disagreement among committee members persists. It is also important to note that post-decision comments emphasized acting with caution, since inflation remains well above the 2.00% target, raising doubts about the possibility of maintaining a consistently dovish stance.\nThus, despite today\u2019s rate cut, the weakness in the British pound was not significant, as the market interprets that this stance may not persist in upcoming decisions. As long as there is no clear confirmation of lower interest rates for 2026, bullish pressure may continue to dominate GBP/USD in the near term.\nWhat Is Happening with the U.S. Dollar?\nAnother key factor favoring the pound is the structural weakness that the U.S. dollar continues to show in the short term. The DXY index, which measures the strength of the dollar against other major currencies, maintains a bearish outlook and has fallen consistently below the 100-point zone, even reaching the 98-point area\u2014levels not seen since October. This reflects a persistent decline in demand for U.S. dollars in the final weeks of 2025.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nGiven this weakness, as the DXY continues to show lower oscillations, the British pound may continue to gain ground in the short term. This persistent decline in the dollar has also prevented the pound from weakening following the BOE\u2019s rate cut. If DXY levels continue to fall, a steady bullish pressure on GBP/USD could remain in the coming sessions.\nGBP/USD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- The downtrend is at risk: The downtrend is at risk: since June 30, movement in GBP/USD has been predominantly bearish, following a descending trendline that has guided the price up to now. However, the recent bullish momentum is once again approaching this line, and if buying pressure manages to remain strong in the upcoming sessions, a break of the downtrend could occur, opening room for a more consistent bullish bias toward year-end.\n- RSI: The RSI shows rising oscillations above the neutral 50 level, suggesting that buying momentum has begun to dominate the average of the last 14 sessions.

                "body": "GBP/USD steadies below 1.3400 as traders digest BoE policy update and US inflation data\n- GBP/USD steadies following the previous day\u2019s volatile price swings and an intraday pullback.\n- The BoE\u2019s hawkish support the GBP and spot prices, though the lack of USD selling caps gains.\n- The broader fundamental backdrop and acceptance above the 200-day SMA favor bullish traders.\nThe GBP/USD pair stalls the previous day's pullback from the vicinity of mid-1.3400s and a nearly two-month high, though it struggles to attract meaningful buyers during the Asian session on Friday. Spot prices currently trade around the 1.3380-1.3385 region, up only 0.05% for the day, amid mixed cues.\nThe British Pound (GBP) draws support from the Bank of England's (BoE) hawkish rate cut on Thursday, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor acting as a tailwind for the GBP/USD pair. As was expected, the BoE MPC voted 5-4 to lower the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75%. A close vote split, however, revealed differences within the committee, especially after this week's inflation surprise. This, in turn, forced investors to scale back their expectations for more aggressive easing next year.\nApart from this, the emergence of some intraday US Dollar (USD) selling following the release of softer US consumer inflation figures provides an additional boost to the GBP/USD pair. Data published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that the headline US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% from a year earlier in November, falling short of the 3.1% expected. Moreover, the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also missed expectations and rose by 2.6% YoY last month.\nThe crucial data reaffirmed market bets for more interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026 and weighed on the USD. The initial market reaction, however, turned out to be short-lived, which, in turn, prompted some intraday selling around the GBP/USD pair. Meanwhile, dovish Fed expectations keep the USD bulls on the defensive and assists the currency pair to defend a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This, in turn, backs the case for a further appreciating move.\nBoE FAQs\nThe Bank of England (BoE) decides monetary policy for the United Kingdom. Its primary goal is to achieve \u2018price stability\u2019, or a steady inflation rate of 2%. Its tool for achieving this is via the adjustment of base lending rates. The BoE sets the rate at which it lends to commercial banks and banks lend to each other, determining the level of interest rates in the economy overall. This also impacts the value of the Pound Sterling (GBP).\nWhen inflation is above the Bank of England\u2019s target it responds by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is positive for the Pound Sterling because higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls below target, it is a sign economic growth is slowing, and the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit in the hope businesses will borrow to invest in growth-generating projects \u2013 a negative for the Pound Sterling.\nIn extreme situations, the Bank of England can enact a policy called Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the BoE substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. QE is a last resort policy when lowering interest rates will not achieve the necessary result. The process of QE involves the BoE printing money to buy assets \u2013 usually government or AAA-rated corporate bonds \u2013 from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Pound Sterling.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE, enacted when the economy is strengthening and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the Bank of England (BoE) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to encourage them to lend; in QT, th"

The pair traded at 1.3410, up 0.28%, boosted by a softer US Consumer Price Index, which decreased to 2.7% year on year in November.\nThe US core inflation fell to 2.6% from 3%, reflecting moderated price pressures. Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending December 13 decreased to 224K, surpassing expectations of 225K. Despite these economic indicators, expectations for a 2026 Federal Reserve rate cut remained largely unchanged at 62 basis points.\nImpact of the BoE Rate Cut\nThe BoE\u2019s rate cut from 4% to 3.75% propelled GBP/USD higher. The minutes from the BoE meeting indicated uncertainty about future interest rates, citing inflation persistence data that showed both positive signs and potential risks.\nLooking ahead, US economic data on Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index and Michigan Consumer Sentiment will be significant. In the UK, traders will monitor November\u2019s Retail Sales for a possible increase from 0.2% to 0.9% year on year.\nGBP/USD technical analysis reveals bullish momentum is waning, with possible support at 1.3361 and resistance at 1.3460. A close below 1.3400 could lead to testing lower prices, while a rally above 1.3460 could target the 1.3500 level.\nThe Bank of England\u2019s split-vote rate cut gives us a reason to be bullish on Sterling, as it signals reluctance to ease policy further. However, the soft US inflation numbers are questionable due to the recent 43-day government shutdown. This creates significant uncertainty heading into year-end trading.\nVolatility and Trading Strategies\nWe must be cautious about this US CPI print, as the data collection was incomplete. Looking back, we saw similar data reliability issues during the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019, which led to sharp market reactions later. All eyes should now be on the upcoming PCE inflation data to either confirm or contradict this week\u2019s soft reading.\nGiven this level of doubt, implied volatility on GBP/USD options seems unusually low, especially compared to the spikes above 20% we saw during the UK\u2019s 2022 fiscal crisis. This suggests buying volatility through strategies like straddles could be prudent. Such positions would profit from a large price swing in either direction once the true inflation picture becomes clearer.\nFor those leaning bullish on the pound, the failure to break the 1.3455 resistance level is a major warning sign. Instead of buying calls outright, a bull call spread would allow for upside participation while limiting the cost. This is a more capital-efficient way to express a view that the pair will grind higher but may not break out explosively.\nOn the other hand, the fading momentum on the RSI and strong US jobless claims provide a case for a pullback. A drop below the 1.3400 level would target the key moving averages near 1.3350. A bear put spread is a defined-risk way to position for this potential short-term weakness in the cable."

AUD/USD weakened as global risk sentiment deteriorated, with falling equity markets weighing on risk-linked currencies.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about copy trading platforms? Check our detailed guide-\nThe Aussie has tracked Wall Street closely in recent months. This link showed again as global equities slid on renewed selling in technology stocks. Concerns about rising corporate debt, driven by heavy investment in artificial intelligence, prompted investors to seek safer assets, thereby reducing demand for the Australian dollar.\nMeanwhile, rate expectations continue to offer some support. Markets still price in at least one Reserve Bank of Australia rate hike next year. A February move carries a 25% probability, rising to about 40% in March and nearly 70% by May. The Australian government\u2019s upward revision to its inflation outlook earlier this week reinforced the view that the RBA may keep policy tight, limiting downside pressure on the currency.\nThe focus now shifts to the minutes from the RBA\u2019s December meeting, which are due to be released next week. Traders will look for signals on how concerned policymakers remain about inflation and whether further tightening remains under discussion. Any firm stance on inflation risks could help stabilize the Aussie after its recent pullback.\nAttention also turns to the US CPI report due later today. Headline and core inflation are both expected near 3.0% YoY. A softer reading could weigh on the US dollar, easing pressure on AUD/USD, while firmer inflation would likely support the greenback and extend the pair\u2019s decline.\nIn the near term, AUD/USD remains driven by equity market moves and inflation data, with risk sentiment setting the tone.\nAUD/USD Technical Price Analysis: Buyers Fading Near 0.6600\nThe AUD/USD price has dropped below the demand zone around 0.6610, with immediate support at 0.6600, a round number confluence by 100-period MA. Meanwhile, the RSI above the oversold area suggests cushion for more weakness. The price could test the horizontal level at 0.6580 ahead of the 200-period MA at 0.6550.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about scalping forex brokers?

                "body": "The Australian Dollar (AUD) has weakened against the US Dollar (USD) for six consecutive days, trading below 0.6600. The AUD/USD pair may gain temporary support from markets anticipating a rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) amidst rising inflation expectations, which reached 4.7% in December.\nThe RBA is expected to tighten monetary policy sooner, as suggested by major banks, with a 28% chance of a rate hike in February increasing to nearly 41% by March. The price of Iron Ore, inflation rates, and Australia\u2019s economic ties with China also influence the AUD\u2019s value. The US Dollar remains steady with the Dollar Index trading around 98.40, ahead of the delayed US Consumer Price Index report.\nFederal Reserve Interest Rates Approach\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to interest rates is cautious, with a 75.6% chance of maintaining rates at the upcoming January meeting. Recent US economic indicators, such as a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.6% and flat retail sales, highlight a cooling labour market. Other influencing factors include China\u2019s mixed economic data and the Australian Bureau of Statistics reporting a stable unemployment rate of 4.3% in November.\nThe AUD/USD technical analysis suggests the pair is trading below its nine-day EMA, indicating weak short-term momentum. If the pair falls, it could reach 0.6500, but resistance near 0.6619 could spark a rebound towards higher levels.\nWe are seeing the Aussie dollar continue its slide against the US dollar, now on its sixth straight day of losses and trading below the 0.6600 mark. This downward momentum suggests that short-term bearish strategies could be favored. The break below the ascending channel trend is a significant signal of this weakening bias for now.\nThe key tension to watch is the diverging central bank outlooks, which could create significant volatility in the coming weeks. While we see markets pricing in a 41% chance of a Reserve Bank of Australia rate hike by March 2026, the CME FedWatch Tool shows a high 75.6% probability of the US Federal Reserve holding rates steady in January. This policy difference is creating a fundamental tug-of-war for the currency pair.\nChina\u2019s Economic Influence\nThe Fed\u2019s patient stance is backed by weakening US economic data, which we need to monitor closely. The US unemployment rate hitting 4.6% is a high we haven\u2019t seen since the post-pandemic recovery phase of 2021, indicating a clearly cooling labor market. This trend, combined with flat retail sales last month, dampens the case for a stronger US dollar in the medium term.\nA significant risk for any bullish AUD position is the recent poor economic data out of China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner. The disappointing figures in retail sales and industrial production suggest a slowdown that directly impacts demand for Australian exports. Reports this week show iron ore prices, a key Australian export, have also slipped from their recent highs to below $110 per tonne, further pressuring the Aussie.\nGiven these conflicting signals, traders might consider strategies that profit from increased volatility rather than a clear directional bet. Options strategies like straddles or strangles could be effective, with the AUD/USD caught between strong technical support around the 0.6500 psychological level and resistance near the three-month high of 0.6685. The implied volatility in AUD/USD options reflects this uncertainty, having risen over 5% in the past month as these central bank narratives diverged."

                "body": "Over the past seven trading sessions, USD/JPY has lost nearly 1% of its value, with movements favoring the Japanese yen and weighing on the U.S. dollar. A new wave of short-term selling pressure has begun to form as the market awaits the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision, as well as the recent U.S. inflation data, which continues to project a weak outlook for the dollar in the near term. If the BOJ does not surprise with an unexpected decision, the selling pressure that is just beginning to build in USD/JPY may gain relevance toward year-end.\nWhat to Expect from the Bank of Japan?\nBetween today\u2019s session and tomorrow\u2019s, the Bank of Japan will release its monetary policy decision. For now, market consensus expects the institution to raise its interest rate from 0.5% to 0.75%, which would make the BOJ the only major central bank hiking rates in the final stretch of 2025.\nThe possibility of a more aggressive BOJ stance is supported by recent inflation data in Japan, which now shows an increase toward 3.00% annually, rising steadily from 2.7% recorded in August of this year. This confirms that inflationary pressure has once again become relevant and could become a serious issue if the BOJ decides to keep rates too low in the short term.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nIt is important to consider that throughout 2025, the BOJ has had one of the lowest interest rates in the world, and a shift toward a more aggressive stance could break the alignment seen with other major central banks, which have opted for neutral or lower-rate policies. Over time, this shift could narrow the interest-rate differential between Japan and other developed economies, increasing the perception that yen-denominated investments may become more attractive and eventually driving stronger demand for the yen from foreign capital.\nThus, if the Bank of Japan does not introduce unexpected changes in its upcoming decision and reaffirms the possibility of adopting a more aggressive stance for next year, it could become a key catalyst for a more consistent wave of selling pressure in USD/JPY.\nWhat Happened with U.S. Inflation Data?\nToday, the U.S. annual CPI was released, and the result partially surprised the market. A reading of 3.1% had been expected, but the actual figure came in at 2.7%. This suggests that inflationary pressure in the U.S. is beginning to moderate, at least according to November\u2019s data, and could become a crucial factor for the Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions next year.\nFollowing this release, the Fed\u2019s probability table adjusted quickly. At this moment, there is a 73.4% probability that the January 28, 2026 decision will maintain the interest rate at 3.75%. However, for March 18, there is now a 45.8% probability of a new cut to 3.5%, something that had initially been expected for late April. This shift suggests that a rate cut could be closer than anticipated.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nTaking this into account, the new inflation data may reshape market expectations for the Federal Reserve in 2026. If this lower-rate scenario persists, it could generate broad weakness in U.S. Treasury yields, limiting foreign capital inflows and reducing demand for the U.S. dollar. This relationship could maintain a structural weakness in the dollar, allowing the Japanese yen to strengthen steadily and contributing to the development of continued selling pressure on USD/JPY in the short term.\nUSD/JPY Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- The Long-Standing Uptrend Loses Momentum: For several months, USD/JPY has maintained consistent bullish oscillations, allowing the long upward trendline to remain intact on the chart. However, recent selling pressure has begun to generate steady indecision, pulling the price away from recent highs and bringing it closer to the 50-period moving average. If selling pressure continues to strengthen, the bullish momentum may weaken further, giving way to a more relevant bearish bias as we approach the final movements of 2025.\n- RSI: The RSI line curr"

However, the pair has slightly gained despite an upbeat national CPI in Japan.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about copy trading platforms?

Investors are awaiting clarity, which is reducing trading activity.\nThe BoJ is expected to increase its policy rate to 0.75% from 0.50%. This would be the highest in nearly 30 years, if confirmed. The action would suggest that inflation and wage growth are sufficiently high to warrant stricter policy. Recent inflation statistics support this, as Japan\u2019s national CPI increased by 2.9% in November. Meanwhile, core CPI, which excludes fresh food, stood at 3.0%.\nThe USD/JPY remains choppy ahead of the meeting. The pair has partially erased the losses, but the selling pressure has appeared in gradual steps, implying a strategic positioning rather than a panic-driven response.\nUS data has also played a role. The November CPI was reported as 2.7% YoY, which is significantly lower than the expected 3.1% while core CPI slowed to 2.6%. The price gain was only 0.2% per month. The statistics alleviated concerns about inflation, allowing the Fed to maintain its easing policy in 2026. The Treasury yields fell, pushing the greenback lower against most of its peers.\nThe policy divergence between the US and Japan is evident, influencing the USD/JPY trades. Japan is heading towards a rate hike, while the US is looking to ease further in 2026. The narrowing yield gaps support the yen, devaluing the dollar.\nUSD/JPY Technical Forecast: Awaiting a Breakout\nThe USD/JPY price remains technically supported by the confluence of 20- and 200-period MAs, while wobbling around the 50- and 100-period MAs.

Treasury yields fell, and the U.S. dollar declined against its peers. The longer-term positioning remains mixed, yet the near-term momentum is evidently dampened.\nThe dollar stays pressured by political developments as well.

Oil prices have also boosted the Canadian dollar, also known as the loonie.

That said, the outlook isn\u2019t all rosy. Trade negotiations with the US are stalled, with American officials reviewing tariffs on Canadian goods like steel, autos, and lumber. Plus, the looming mid-2026 review of USMCA hangs over both countries, but BMO expects most hurdles could be dealt with through limited sector quotas rather than dramatic trade changes.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency stability shapes investment outlook.\nA stronger Canadian dollar is a welcome shift for equities and companies that are sensitive to currency movements. Not only does this help reduce import costs, but it could also attract more foreign investment from those chasing steady returns. Still, the uncertainty around US trade talks means industries like natural resources and manufacturing remain on watch, with exporters and commodity-linked shares likely to see the most movement from new tariff headlines.\nThe bigger picture: Trade friction guides Canada\u2019s economic path.\nCanada\u2019s economic prospects are still tightly linked to its partnership with the US. Large-scale disruption to the USMCA isn\u2019t expected any time soon, but targeted tariffs could shake up critical sectors. As both sides face key policy reviews, Canada\u2019s long-term growth depends on a careful balance\u2014steady central banking paired with constructive, measured cross-border trade.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "USD/CAD remains below 1.3800 amid Fed rate cut bets\n- USD/CAD struggles as softer November CPI boosts expectations of US Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n- US President Trump said the next Federal Reserve chair will strongly favor much lower interest rates.\n- Canada\u2019s Retail Sales are expected to be flat at 0% MoM in October.\nUSD/CAD remains subdued for the second successive session, trading around 1.3780 during the Asian hours on Friday. The pair faces challenges as the US Dollar (USD) struggles amid rising expectations of US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts following the unexpectedly cooled US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in November. Traders will likely observe the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for December later in the day.\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released on Thursday that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) eased to 2.7% in November. This reading came in below the market consensus of 3.1%. Meanwhile, the US core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6%, missing the expectation of 3.0%. This figure marks the slowest pace since 2021.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the next chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be someone who believes in lower interest rates \"by a lot.\" Trump further noted that he will soon announce a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) kept interest rates unchanged at 2.25% last week and said the current policy setting is \u201cabout the right level,\u201d citing inflation close to target and signs of resilience in economic activity. Traders will likely observe the upcoming Retail Sales data from Canada.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the "

Spot react stick to strong intraday gains after the highly-anticipated Bank of Japan (BoJ) decision and currently trade around the 208.70-208.75 region, up 0.25% for the day..\nAs was widely expected, the BoJ decided to hike interest rates to 0.75%, or a three-decade high, amid still sticky inflation in Japan. In fact, data released earlier today showed that Japan's National Consumer Price Index (CPI) remains well above the central bank's 2% target. The Japanese Yen, however, struggles to attract any meaningful buyers as bulls opt to wait for more cues about the BoJ's appetite for further policy tightening going into 2026. Hence, the focus remains on BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments during the post-meeting press conference, which will play a key role in influencing the JPY price dynamics and provide some meaningful impetus to the GBP/JPY cross.\nHeading into the key central bank event risk, a generally positive risk tone is seen as another factor undermining the safe-haven JPY. The British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, continues to draw support from the Bank of England's (BoE) hawkish rate cut on Thursday. As was expected, the BoE MPC voted 5-4 to lower the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75%. A close vote split, however, revealed differences within the committee, especially after this week's inflation surprise. This, in turn, forced investors to scale back their expectations for more aggressive easing next year, which is seen acting as a tailwind for the GBP and the GBP/JPY cross.\nNevertheless, the BoE is still expected to lower borrowing costs next year. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to hawkish BoJ expectations. This would result in a further narrowing of the rate differential between Japan and other major economies, which should benefit the lower-yielding JPY and cap gains for the GBP/JPY cross. Nevertheless, spot prices remain on track to end on a positive note for the sixth straight week, though the fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before positioning for further appreciation.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoJ Interest Rate Decision\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) announces its interest rate decision after each of the Bank\u2019s eight scheduled annual meetings. Generally, if the BoJ is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is bullish for the Japanese Yen (JPY). Likewise, if the BoJ has a dovish view on the Japanese economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is usually bearish for JPY.\nRead more.Last release: Fri Dec 19, 2025 03:00\nFrequency: Irregular\nActual: 0.75%\nConsensus: 0.75%\nPrevious: 0.5%\nSource: Bank of Japan\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

                "body": "The GBP/JPY pair nudged higher following the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) recent policy decision. The BoE implemented a 25 basis points rate reduction, bringing it down to 3.75%, although a close 5-4 vote revealed differences within the committee. The British Pound saw a slight strength against the Japanese Yen, trading near 208.40 after dipping to 207.87.\nWith the BoE\u2019s decision, expectations for future rate cuts have moderated. Market expectations revised downwards, pricing around 39 basis points of easing for the next year, compared to about 69 basis points previously. The focus is now on the Bank of Japan\u2019s upcoming interest rate announcement.\nBank Of Japans Meeting Anticipation\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s meeting on Friday is anticipated to result in a rate hike to 0.75% from the previous 0.50%. In currency movements, the British Pound has shown varied performance against major currencies, being particularly strong against the New Zealand Dollar. The heat map reflects these shifts, providing a snapshot of the British Pound\u2019s percentage changes relative to major currencies like the US Dollar, Euro, and others for the day.\nThe Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut rates was expected, but the narrow 5-4 vote is the key takeaway for us. This split shows a strong reluctance to ease policy too quickly, suggesting future cuts are far from guaranteed. The market is now pricing in only about 39 basis points of easing for all of next year, a significant drop from yesterday.\nWe should not ignore the data that influenced the dissenting voters on the Bank\u2019s committee. The latest UK Consumer Price Index report for November 2025 showed headline inflation at 3.1%, stubbornly above the 2.9% forecast and still a long way from the 2% target. This inflation persistence supports the view that the BoE\u2019s easing cycle may be very shallow and slow.\nAll eyes must now turn to the Bank of Japan\u2019s meeting tomorrow. A rate hike to 0.75% is almost fully priced in, driven by Japan\u2019s own inflation figures, with core CPI staying above the 2% target for 20 consecutive months. The real market-moving event will be the BoJ\u2019s forward guidance and whether they signal more hikes are coming in early 2026.\nTrading Environment And Strategies\nThis creates a complex trading environment where two major central banks are moving in opposite directions, tightening the interest rate differential that has favored the Pound for so long. We saw a similar dynamic between the US Federal Reserve and the BoJ back in 2022 and 2023, which led to historic volatility and huge directional moves in the currency pair involved. This history suggests we should prepare for significant price swings in GBP/JPY over the holiday period and into the new year.\nGiven the uncertainty, using options to manage risk and express a view is a sensible approach. One-week implied volatility for GBP/JPY has already spiked to over 14%, reflecting the market\u2019s anticipation of a sharp move following the BoJ announcement. Buying straddles could be an effective way to profit from a large price swing, regardless of the direction.\nFor those with a conviction that the narrowing rate differential will eventually weigh on the pair, buying GBP/JPY put options for January or February 2026 offers a defined-risk way to position for a downturn. This protects against the Pound\u2019s current surprising strength while maintaining exposure to the fundamental shift in monetary policy. This strategy allows us to wait for the current market noise to settle and the longer-term trend to take hold."

For decades, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintained ultra-loose conditions, turning the Japanese yen into the world\u2019s primary funding currency. Global investors borrow cheaply in JPY and deploy capital into higher-yielding assets such as equities, bonds, and cryptocurrencies.\nBecause of this structure, even a small shift in BoJ policy can trigger large cross-market reactions. The BoJ\u2019s interest rate decision on December 19 is therefore a high-impact macro event with potential consequences for forex, global equities, bonds, gold, and crypto markets.\nScenario 1: If the Bank of Japan Raises Interest Rates\nA rate hike would represent a historic policy shift and signal the early stages of monetary normalization.\nImpact on Forex (USD/JPY & JPY Pairs)\n* The Japanese yen (JPY) is likely to strengthen due to improved yield appeal\n* USD/JPY may face strong bearish pressure\n* Carry trades funded in JPY could unwind rapidly, increasing volatility\nJPY crosses such as EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, and AUD/JPY may also decline as risk exposure is reduced.\nImpact on Global Equity Markets\n*Japanese equities: Mixed to bearish bias due to a stronger yen hurting exporters\n*Asian markets: Short-term weakness as financial conditions tighten\n*US & European equities: Increased volatility and pressure on growth stocks\nOverall, a rate hike may trigger a short-term global risk-off reaction driven by liquidity repricing rather than economic deterioration.\nImpact on Crypto Markets (Bitcoin & Altcoins)\n*Bitcoin: Short-term bearish pressure and higher volatility\n*Altcoins: Likely underperformance due to higher risk sensitivity\n*Macro-driven selling could create longer-term accumulation zones once volatility settles\nImpact on Bonds, Gold & Risk Sentiment\n*Bonds: Japanese and global yields may rise\n*Gold: Short-term pressure from higher yields, medium-term support if risk aversion increases\n*Risk sentiment: Shift toward defensive positioning and reduced leverage\nScenario 2: If the Bank of Japan Does NOT Raise Interest Rates\nIf rates remain unchanged, markets may view the decision as continued policy caution.\nExpected Market Reactions\n*JPY: Continued weakness\n*USD/JPY: Bullish continuation\n*Global equities & crypto: Supported by ongoing liquidity\n*Risk sentiment: Risk-on behaviour likely to persist\nShort-Term vs Medium-Term Outlook\nShort-Term\n*Rate hike: Sharp volatility, risk-off moves\n*No hike: Relief rally in risk assets\nMedium-Term\n* Gradual tightening allows controlled market adjustment\n* Continued loose policy supports assets but increases structural risks over time\nMarkets typically shift from news reaction to trend confirmation within weeks.\nEducational Entry\u2013Exit Examples (Not Financial Advice)\nUSD/JPY (Rate Hike):\n* Bias: Bearish\n* Concept: Breakdown \u2192 pullback \u2192 continuation\n* Invalidation: Above recent swing high\nBitcoin (No Hike):\n* Bias: Bullish\n* Concept: Pullback after impulse\n* Risk Note: Reduced size during news volatility\nUS Indices:\n* Rate hike: Sell rallies near resistance\n* No hike: Buy dips in confirmed trend\nConclusion: Key Takeaways for Traders\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s December 19 interest rate decision is a major global liquidity event. A rate hike would favour the yen while pressuring risk assets, whereas a no-change policy would support equities, cryptocurrencies, and carry trades. Traders should prioritise volatility management, confirmation from price action, and cross-market correlations over predictions and forecasts.\nStay tuned!\nMoney_Dictators\nThank you :)\nIntroduction: Why Japan\u2019s Interest Rate Policy Matters\nJapan\u2019s monetary policy plays a critical role in the global financial system.

Vo either knew or was reckless in not knowing that the company could not meet the obligations tied to the hosting agreements.\nVo, 37, exercised complete authority over VBit, including its promotional materials, website content, and investor account information.\nThe SEC said the hosting agreements qualify as securities because investors relied on Vo and VBit\u2019s efforts to generate profits.\nSEC: Family members received misappropriated funds\nIn addition to the misappropriation, Vo allegedly transferred $5 million to family members, including his ex-wife, mother, brother, and sister, the commission said. He reportedly left the U.S. with the remaining misappropriated funds following his divorce in November 2021.\nSeveral family members are named as relief defendants in the lawsuit and have consented to disgorge the funds they received, pending court approval, per the SEC.\nVBit was acquired by Advanced Mining Group in 2022 and is now defunct. The action seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and a ban on Vo from participating in future securities offerings.\nThe lawsuit also comes as Congress debates federal measures to address cryptocurrency scams. A bipartisan proposal would create a dedicated task force to identify and address fraud in the digital asset sector.\nThe SEC said they want Vo\u2019s alleged conduct to be a reminder that investors should carefully evaluate claims of passive income from crypto and confirm that operations are transparent and verifiable."

                "body": "December 18, 2025\nThe owner of a former bitcoin mining company in Philadelphia allegedly stole more than $48.5 million from investors in a scheme that promised \"passive income\" for supporters of the firm's cryptocurrency network, a complaint filed Wednesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says.\nDanh C. Vo, 37, launched VBit Technologies Corp. in 2018 as a platform for investors to hold stakes in the company's computing power used to mine bitcoin. The cryptocurrency assets are created by networks of computer rigs that solve complex puzzles, allowing the entire bitcoin network to function securely while rewarding miners for their blockchain contributions.\nMORE: Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. found not guilty of abusing his teen daughter\nVo marketed his company as a \"turnkey solution\" for investors to profit from bitcoin mining without the responsibility and technical savvy needed to operate rigs. In most instances, instead of directly selling equipment to investors, VBit offered tiered \"hosting agreements\" that let investors choose how much processing power they wanted the company to operate on their behalf for bitcoin mining.\nBetween December 2018 and February 2022, Vo raised $95.6 million from about 6,400 VBit investors, SEC investigators said. The company pooled its computing power with third parties to mine about 425.2 bitcoin during that time, an amount now worth $36 million.\nSome investors received returns, but others suffered substantial losses and were misled by Vo about Vbit's operations and finances, the SEC complaint says.\nVbit allegedly operated only a small fraction of the mining rigs that it claimed to be running based on the number of hosting agreements the company secured. Despite lacking the computing capacity and equipment to fulfill contracts, Vo continued to take on new investors, SEC investigators said.\nVo allegedly transferred millions of dollars into personal bank accounts, using most of the money to gamble on other cryptocurrencies or funnel investors' assets to family and friends. Vo fled the country to Vietnam in November 2021, about a month after he learned about the SEC investigation.\nTo cover up his activities, Vo allegedly gave investors access to online accounts that reflected false bitcoin balances. Some of the investors were able to make withdrawals from the accounts, but most used the balances to pay down their hosting agreements. Vbit did not have enough money to back up the amounts shown in all of its investors' accounts, and Vo had sole control over the company's finances, investigators said.\nIn January 2022, Vo announced he had created a successor company, Advanced Mining Group, to purchase Vbit for $105 million. He called the new venture an \"Asian-based\" crypto company with a global scale and described the sale of Vbit as a way to give him \"peace of mind and freedom to focus on my health,\" the complaint says. Vbit investors were frozen out of their accounts and prevented from making withdrawals.\nInvestigators said Vbit and Advanced Mining Group were never registered with the SEC as required by law.\nVo is charged with multiple violations of SEC regulations. The agency is seeking a jury trial and a court order for Vo to return money that was misappropriated from investors. Vo's family and friends also are named as relief defendants for the money they received. The SEC also seeks an order for Vo to pay a civil penalty and to be barred from issuing securities.\nSEC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Vo is still residing in Vietnam or elsewhere.\nThe complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, where Vbit Technologies Corp. was incorporated. The company is now defunct, investigators said."

                "body": "The SEC has made a bold move by classifying Bitcoin mining hosting services as potential securities, and it's causing quite a stir in the crypto world. As they go after VBit for fraud, the industry is uniting to protect legitimate hosting practices. Let's break down what this means for compliance strategies and the future of Bitcoin mining hosting. It might just change the game for crypto startups and investors alike.\nWhat Are Bitcoin Mining Hosting Services?\nBitcoin mining hosting services are essential to the crypto ecosystem, providing the infrastructure miners need to work efficiently. Typically, these services involve clients buying hardware and electricity to mine Bitcoin, without having to manage the equipment themselves. But with the SEC's recent stance, questions about the classification of these services are on the table, especially after VBit's lawsuit.\nSEC's Classification\nThe SEC's lawsuit against VBit claims their hosting agreements are essentially investment contracts, thus making them securities under the Howey test. They assert that investors were expecting passive income and relied solely on VBit's efforts for profits, which fits the bill for securities. This classification throws a major compliance challenge at Bitcoin mining hosting services, potentially exposing them to strict regulatory demands.\nIndustry Reaction and Compliance Strategies\nIndustry leaders are stepping in to argue the difference between legitimate Bitcoin mining hosting and fraudulent operations. According to Mitchell Askew, head of Blockware Intelligence, legitimate hosted mining doesn\u2019t involve capital pooling or profit-sharing, which are key indicators of an investment contract. Clients buy the necessary equipment and electricity, maintaining control over their mining operations.\nTo adapt to the new regulatory reality, hosting providers will need to develop solid compliance strategies. This means being transparent, steering clear of anything that resembles investment contracts, and defining their services accurately. By focusing on technical and operational support rather than investment opportunities, hosting services can lessen the chances of being classified as securities.\nCrypto Payroll Compliance 101: Taxes and Regulations\nWith the regulatory landscape shifting, crypto startups must also consider payroll and compensation implications. As crypto payroll solutions gain traction, businesses need to navigate the complexities of tax compliance and reporting. Understanding the legal context surrounding crypto salaries is key for startups wanting to attract top talent.\nManaging Volatility: Handling Crypto Salary Fluctuations\nCrypto's volatility can be a headache for companies that hand out salaries in Bitcoin or digital assets. Startups should have measures in place to manage these fluctuations, ensuring fair compensation for employees while keeping payroll expenses in check.\nWhat This Means for Crypto Startups\nThe SEC's classification of Bitcoin mining hosting services as securities could have significant consequences for crypto startups. Increased compliance costs and regulatory challenges might deter new players from entering the market, while established companies may need to adjust their offerings to meet the SEC's standards.\nPractical Steps for Startups\n- Restructure Offerings: Focus on service-oriented models that don\u2019t have investment-like components.\n- Strengthen Contracts and Disclosures: Clearly define revenue flows and custody arrangements to lessen the risk of misclassification.\n- Implement AML/KYC Measures: Adopt effective anti-fraud measures and transparent reporting to gain trust from investors and regulators.\nSummary\nThe SEC's classification of Bitcoin mining hosting services as potential securities marks a significant turn in the regulatory landscape for the crypto industry. As startups navigate these changes, adopting compliance strategies that emphasize transparency and operational integrity will be crucial. By doing s"

CLOB DEXs have become increasingly popular following the success of Hyperliquid\u2019s fully onchain CLOB design.\nThe DEX will be supported by its Synthetix Liquidity Provider (SLP) vault, which serves as the exchange\u2019s market-making engine. Synthetix stablecoin (sUSD) holders can contribute sUSD to the SLP vault to earn, or lose, yield at the expense of perp traders on the other side of SLP\u2019s trades.\nCompeting perp DEXs have mostly opted to launch their own blockchain networks or join new and incentivized blockchains, but Synthetix is choosing to launch its product on Ethereum, and aims to become the mainnet's first successful CLOB perp DEX.\n\u201cThe last 2 months have seen Synthetix successfully execute 2 trading competitions featuring hundreds of the best perp traders, all of whom have put Synthetix through intense, high-volume trading scenarios,\u201d Benjamin Celermajer, Synthetix\u2019s head of strategy, said. \u201cWe\u2019re confident Synthetix is now poised to meet the demands of global traders and solidify ourselves as one of the leading platforms in the competitive perps space.\u201d\nPerp DEX Explosion\nSynthetix is the latest to launch in a long line of perp DEXs, contributing to the erosion of Hyperliquid\u2019s market dominance.\nThe top five perp DEXs by volume are each processing between $19 billion and $48 billion in weekly volume, more than double Hyperliquid\u2019s weekly average before its token launch in November 2024. The sector reached a new all-time high volume in the first week of November, when more than $340 billion were traded across all perp exchanges in just seven days.\nRelated Posts\nAdvertisement\nGet an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter\nKnow what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri\n90k+ Defiers informed every day.

                "body": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP: Which Crypto Will Shine the Most in 2026?\nCrypto markets are approaching 2026 after a year defined by sharp volatility, fresh all-time highs, profit-taking, and a visible phase of maturation.\nBitcoin strengthened its role as an institutional reserve asset, while Ethereum and XRP entered corrective phases following strong prior trends marked by uncertainty and rapid price swings.\nOn the macro side, the US Federal Reserve began its first rate cuts, labor market data showed early signs of cooling, and capital flows into digital assets became increasingly selective.\nAs a result, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP now sit near technically significant levels. The central question for 2026 is whether global liquidity expands or pauses\u2014and whether that liquidity flows decisively into cryptoassets.\nBitcoin BTCUSD Price Analysis and 2026 Outlook\nBitcoin reached a new all-time high above $126,000 in 2025, driven largely by sustained institutional adoption. Corporations and sovereign entities continued to add BTC to their reserves.\nMicroStrategy accumulated roughly 660,645 BTC, while El Salvador increased its holdings to 7,502 BTC.\nMeanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs kept absorbing supply, reinforcing Bitcoin\u2019s role as a long-term macro asset.\nFrom a technical perspective, Bitcoin\u2019s broader bullish structure remains intact despite losing the ascending channel that guided price action from March 2024 to November 2025.\nAfter setting its latest ATH, BTC corrected into a key demand zone near $80,000.\nResistance around $110,000 continues to cap upside attempts. Trading volume has slowed, a pattern typically associated with corrective phases rather than trend reversals.\nBullish Scenario\nA strong reaction from the accumulated demand zone near $75,000 could set the stage for a renewed long-term advance toward $150,000\u2013$170,000.\nA sustained breakout above the $100,000\u2013$115,000 resistance cluster would confirm trend continuation, supported by renewed retail and institutional participation.\nRange-Bound Scenario\nIf upside momentum remains limited, Bitcoin may spend much of 2026 trading between $70,000 and $110,000.\nThis would represent a prolonged accumulation phase within the broader cycle, marked by choppy price action and false breakouts while the market waits for clearer monetary catalysts.\nBearish Scenario\nA decisive loss of the $75,000\u2013$80,000 demand zone would open the door to a deeper correction.\nIn that case, $60,000\u2013$40,000 could act as a rebalancing zone without invalidating Bitcoin\u2019s long-term macro structure.\nEthereum ETHUSD Price Analysis and 2026 Outlook\nEthereum experienced a pivotal year in 2025, reaching a new all-time high near $4,955.\nNetwork upgrades such as Pectra and Fusaka improved scalability and efficiency, while spot Ethereum ETFs began gaining traction. Staking activity and DeFi usage continued to underpin Ethereum\u2019s fundamental value.\nOn the weekly chart, ETH remains within a broad long-term ascending channel. After printing new highs in August 2025, price corrected toward a relatively weak demand zone around $2,900.\nWhile the long-term structure remains constructive, momentum has slowed compared to previous expansion phases. Short- and medium-term structures still lean bearish.\nBullish Scenario\nA sustained recovery could allow Ethereum to target $5,700 and potentially $6,100, based on historical cycle extensions.\nA clean breakout above the channel resistance near $5,200 would reinforce Ethereum\u2019s position as a leading asset in 2026.\nConsolidation Scenario\nIf demand remains moderate, ETH could consolidate between $4,300 and $2,200. This range would signal equilibrium between buyers and sellers, framing 2026 as a transitional year rather than a breakout phase.\nBearish Scenario\nA breakdown below the channel support would expose Ethereum to a deeper move toward $2,250\u2013$1,600, an area that aligns with historical demand levels critical to preserving the long-term structure.\nXRP Price Analysis and 2026 Outlook\nRipp"

Each product carries a 1.9% management fee and is accessible through traditional investment platforms.\nBroadening Access to Enhanced Digital Asset Exposure\nThe launch of constant leverage certificates on Bitcoin and Ethereum represents another step in Valour\u2019s mission to make digital assets more accessible, transparent, and user-friendly for both retail and institutional investors. These offerings are designed for those who seek additional exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price movements while maintaining the safeguards and familiarity of traditional financial infrastructure.\nElaine Buehler, Head of Products at Valour, commented:\n\u201cBitcoin and Ethereum continue to be the most widely followed and held digital assets globally. By launching 2x ETPs, we\u2019re expanding the range of investment choices available to our clients, allowing for enhanced exposure within a secure, regulated format.\u201d\nJohanna Belitz, Head of Nordics at Valour, added:\n\u201cConstant daily leverage certificates, also known as Bull and Bear-certificates, have long been a part of the Nordic investment landscape. Many Nordic investors are already familiar with how these leveraged products function and what it takes to use them effectively. That foundation makes it easier to understand and engage with Valour\u2019s new Bull-certificates \u2014 especially with Bitcoin and Ethereum as the underlying assets.\u201d\nJohan Wattenstr\u00f6m, Chief Executive Officer of DeFi Technologies, said:\n\u201cLeveraged ETPs are a natural extension of Valour\u2019s platform as we expand beyond spot exposure and give investors more ways to express conviction through regulated, exchange traded products.

                "body": "What Forward\u2019s tokenized FWDI shares mean for Solana, DeFi, and Real-World Assets\nForward Industries [NASDAQ: FWDI] has become the first public company to place SEC-registered equity directly on a blockchain, specifically on Solana. The SEC-registered equity is usable as collateral in decentralized finance.\nThe move, executed through Superstate\u2019s Opening Bell platform, enables ex-US FWDI shareholders to post their tokenized stock as collateral on Kamino, one of Solana\u2019s largest lending protocols.\nUnlike existing \u201ctokenized stock\u201d products that rely on synthetic exposure or offshore wrappers, FWDI\u2019s onchain asset represents real common stock, recorded and updated in real time by Superstate\u2014a registered SEC transfer agent.\nIt is the first instance of regulated public equity interacting natively with live DeFi markets, marking a significant step for tokenization in the U.S. regulatory landscape.\nHow FWDI equity becomes onchain collateral\nThrough the integration:\n- FWDI shares are tokenized on Solana via Superstate\u2019s infrastructure\n- Ex-US holders can transfer shares to an allowlisted Solana wallet\n- Kamino accepts the tokenized equity as collateral\n- Pyth delivers real-time price feeds to secure onchain lending markets\nThis enables eligible investors to borrow stablecoins while maintaining exposure to the underlying NASDAQ-listed equity.\nThis is a capability not possible in traditional markets without intermediaries, delays, or derivative structures.\nKyle Samani, Chairman of Forward Industries, said the milestone shows \u201cthe next evolution of tokenized markets where real equity can function natively within DeFi,\u201d describing the initiative as a bridge between traditional markets and programmable financial systems.\nWhy Solana is central to this development\nSolana\u2019s selection is not incidental. Forward Industries is currently the single largest public company holder of SOL. CoinGecko data shows it holds 6.91 million tokens in its treasury\u2014more than any other public entity or government.\nFWDI\u2019s decision to tokenize its equity on Solana reinforces the company\u2019s strategic alignment with the ecosystem. Also, it underscores Solana\u2019s growing role in regulated financial integrations.\nSolana has already attracted major stablecoin, payments, and tokenization initiatives from Visa, Shopify, Paxos, Stripe and others.\nThis positions Solana as a leading candidate for the next wave of real-world asset tokenization and enterprise financial rails.\nWhat this means for crypto and tokenization\nFWDI\u2019s launch solves one of the tokenization sector\u2019s biggest credibility gaps: the lack of legally recognized, regulatorily compliant equity onchain. The precedent opens the door for:\n- public companies seeking programmable shareholder structures\n- new collateral classes in institutional DeFi\n- onchain cap tables that sync directly with transfer agents\n- real-time settlement and borrowing against regulated assets\nIt also hints at how the broader market may evolve. If public companies increasingly seek exposure to onchain liquidity, tokenized equity could become a standard complement to traditional exchange listings\u2014especially if liquidity, settlement, or capital efficiency improves.\nRobert Leshner, CEO of Superstate, described the development as unlocking \u201cthe full potential of DeFi for real public equity,\u201d signaling the company\u2019s intent to expand the model to additional issuers.\nFinal Thoughts\n- FWDI\u2019s move demonstrates that fully regulated U.S. equities can now operate within DeFi, creating a new category of onchain collateral with real legal standing.\n- Solana emerges as the early leader for regulated tokenization, with FWDI proving how public companies can plug directly into programmable financial markets."

                "body": "In today\u2019s rapidly developing global cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, investors\u2019 demand for efficient, low-cost, and scalable native tokens has never been more urgent. Solana, with its ultra-high throughput of tens of thousands of transactions per second, near-zero transaction fees, and millisecond-level confirmation speeds, has become a high-performance public chain favored by both institutions and retail investors. AQS Token is the core ecosystem token issued on the Solana blockchain, not only carrying all the transaction, incentive, and governance functions of the Astra Quant System 6.0 platform, but also positioned as a next-generation DeFi infrastructure-level asset. With its extreme performance, rich utility scenarios, and long-term value capture mechanisms, AQS Token is quickly becoming one of the most popular native tokens in the Solana ecosystem.\nThe greatest advantage of AQS Token lies in its innate perfect compatibility with Solana\u2019s high-performance network. Benefiting from the hybrid consensus of Proof of History (PoH) + Proof of Stake (PoS), the Sealevel parallel processing engine, and the Turbine data propagation protocol, AQS Token achieves sub-second transfers and smart contract executions, with single transaction costs of just a few cents. This means that whether for high-frequency quantitative strategies, liquidity mining, or daily payments, using AQS Token avoids the common congestion and high Gas fees on Ethereum. It is this extreme performance that gives AQS Token a first-mover advantage in the DeFi 2.0 era, making it the preferred settlement and incentive token for institutional funds and algorithmic trading teams.\nAs the core fuel of Astra Quant System 6.0, AQS Token has multi-dimensional, strongly bound, and high-frequency real-world use cases. First, it is the preferred payment method for all transaction fees on the platform, where users paying with AQS Token can enjoy up to 50% fee discounts, directly reducing trading costs. Second, AQS Token is the core collateral asset for the platform\u2019s liquidity pools and cross-chain asset swaps, where users providing LP including AQS can receive additional annualized rewards. Furthermore, AQS Token is used to unlock advanced platform features: including exclusive quantitative algorithms, real-time market sentiment analysis reports, smart investment advisors, and dedicated high-frequency trading channels, which can only be accessed by holding and staking a certain amount of AQS Token. This \u201cholding equals rights\u201d design tightly binds the token\u2019s value to deep platform usage, forming a strong internal value cycle.\nAQS Token adopts a classic and sustainable tokenomics model, with a fixed total supply of 1 billion tokens, never to be inflated. The allocation plan balances fairness and long-term incentives: 30% for community rewards and airdrops, 20% for staking rewards, 20% for development fund, 15% for team (1-2 year linear unlock), 15% for public sale. More crucially, AQS Token includes a transaction fee revenue sharing + automatic buyback and burn mechanism: a fixed proportion of each fee paid with AQS will be used for market buybacks and permanent burns, meaning that as platform trading volume grows, AQS Token will enter a continuous deflationary state, and long-term holders will directly benefit from the supply-demand imbalance leading to expected price increases.\nIn terms of governance, AQS Token grants holders true decentralized decision-making power. Any user holding AQS Token can submit proposals and participate in voting to decide on new feature launches, trading pair additions, reward mechanism adjustments, or even fund allocation directions. Voting weight is proportional to the amount held, with caps set to prevent whale dominance, ensuring community voices are truly heard. In the fourth quarter of 2025, AQS Token will officially launch an on-chain governance portal, at which point all major decisions will be collectively led by"

Forward pointed out one particular use case, posting FWDI as collateral on lending protocol Kamino, which will enable users to borrow stablecoins against their FWDI holdings. Thai integration is supported by Pyth\u2019s real-time price feeds.\n\u201cThis marks the first time regulated public equity can be used as collateral within a live DeFi market,\u201d Forward wrote.\n\u201cBy enabling FWDI stock to serve as collateral on Solana, we\u2019re unlocking a tangible bridge between traditional markets and the programmable financial systems that define the digital economy,\u201d Kyle Samani, Multicoin Capital founder and Forward chairman, said.\nUnder the arrangement, the tokenized shares will be held by a transfer agent under Superstate's name, which keeps track of stock ownership across the non-custodial DeFi landscape, and helps move the shares from \u201ca traditional brokerage account to an allowlisted Solana wallet.\u201d\nSuperstate also facilitates voting rights for tokenized FWDI holders.\nEquities experimentation\nThe move comes amid a period of experimentation with tokenized equities. In September, Galaxy tokenized its GLXY shares using Opening Bell.\nUnlike many real-world asset deployments, Opening Bell does not rely on wrapped tokens or synthetic derivatives that track exposure to an asset, often by holding assets in off-chain custody. Instead, Superstate\u2019s transfer agent unlocks direct tokenization, where token transfers are instantly updated on the official shareholder register onchain, making the tokens legally equivalent to traditional shares.\nNotably, leading tokenization firm Securitize is moving into onchain equities in the coming quarter with its Stocks on Securitize offering, which enables public firms to issue real stock on a blockchain. Superstate\u2019s Direct Issuance will also soon allow firms to issue new tokenized securities without an underwriter.\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

                "body": "US stock indices attempt to stabilize as the NASDAQ 100 rallies on strong earnings, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 test key technical levels. Broader trends remain constructive, with no immediate signs of deeper downside.\nThe NASDAQ 100 has rallied quite nicely in the early hours here on Thursday, led mainly by Micron jumping up 12% on a huge revenue beat. That gives us a little bit of life here in the NASDAQ 100. The question now is whether the market can recapture the 25,000 level. That level is very important at this point, and we will have to wait and see how the day plays out. If the market ends up above there, that could be a sign that it is ready to drift higher.\nWith CPI, central banks, and other catalysts during the day-to-day, it is almost impossible to get through the session cleanly. As things stand right now, however, the NASDAQ 100 does look like it is at least making an attempt to turn things around.\nThe Dow Jones 30 finds itself right at the crucial 48,000 level. This is a market that, given enough time, probably breaks above there and goes looking toward 49,000. It should be noted that it has generally been an outperformer lately in comparison to the other US stock indices. Even so, it is not something that looks attractive to short right now.\nThe S&P 500 has rallied a little bit during the pre-market as well. Much like the NASDAQ 100, it needs to do a bit more to prove itself. A move back above 6,800 would be preferred before getting overly excited, but the market is sitting right at the 50-day EMA. End-of-year buying may continue to support prices.\nWhen looking at the longer-term chart, the market looks like it has been in a steady uptrend until recently. Now it appears to be taking a bit of a breather. A little patience probably goes a long way here. There is no interest in shorting this market, and it is not until a breakdown below 6,500 that concern really starts to set in. For now, the outlook leans toward more of a grind higher.\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\nChris is a proprietary trader with more than 20 years of experience across various markets, including currencies, indices and commodities.

The move saw the pound strengthen and short-term UK government bond yields nudge higher, even as major stock indexes like the FTSE 100 finished flat. With inflation cooling unexpectedly fast and the economy showing early signs of stress, most experts saw the cut coming. But the market\u2019s somewhat hawkish reaction\u2014moving expectatio..\nns for the next cut from April to June\u2014showed lingering doubts about how quickly the Bank may act, especially if inflation remains in check and growth continues to wobble.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Uncertainty keeps investors on standby.\nWith the next rate cut now seen further off, traders may see the pound and UK stocks moving less dramatically in the weeks ahead. The initial cut boosted the currency and pushed government bond yields higher, but equity markets like the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 barely budged. Investors are set to watch key inflation and growth numbers to figure out when the Bank might make its next move.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks inch toward easier policy.\nGradual rate cuts could ease the squeeze on UK households and help businesses dealing with debts, especially if inflation heads toward the 2% target. By moving cautiously, the Bank is keeping in step with other major central banks, which are also weighing slower rate cuts to balance weak growth against persistent inflation risks around the globe.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "LONDON (5:15pm GMT, Thursday 18 December 2025) \u2014 UK shares ended higher on Thursday as the Bank of England delivered a widely expected interest-rate cut, while a softer-than-forecast US inflation print lifted global risk appetite and helped underpin a late-December rally in rate-sensitive sectors such as retail and hospitality.\nBy the London close, the FTSE 100 rose 0.7% to 9,841.55, its strongest finish in more than five weeks, and the domestically focused FTSE 250 climbed 0.7% to 22,314.34. [1]\nUK stock market close: FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 key levels\nLondon\u2019s session was ultimately defined by a \u201cmacro + micro\u201d mix: central-bank decisions and inflation data on the one hand, and company-specific catalysts on the other.\nAt a glance (London close):\nThe day\u2019s leadership was notable: retail and hospitality outperformed as investors leaned into the idea that lower borrowing costs can support discretionary demand\u2014especially important heading into the final stretch before Christmas. [4]\nBank of England cuts rates to 3.75% \u2014 and the market reaction turns \u201chawkish\u201d\nThe Bank of England cut Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, a near three-year low, but the market\u2019s immediate reaction wasn\u2019t a straightforward \u201crates down, pound down, yields down\u201d move.\nPolicymakers were split 5\u20134, and the narrow margin mattered. In markets, a close vote can signal reluctance to keep easing\u2014especially when inflation is falling but not yet back at target. [5]\nWhy sterling rose even after a rate cut\nImmediately after the decision, sterling strengthened and short-dated gilt yields rose, a classic sign that traders interpreted the cut as relatively cautious (or \u201chawkish\u201d) in tone.\nReuters reported the pound climbed to around $1.34 at its session high after the decision, while two-year gilt yieldsbriefly rose to roughly 3.77% as traders recalibrated expectations for how far and how fast rates can fall from here. [6]\nStrategists framed it as a \u201cpositioning\u201d event as much as a policy event: with the cut largely priced in, the surprise was the persistence of a hawkish bloc on the MPC\u2014and that helped keep sterling supported. [7]\nWhat this means for UK equities\nFor the FTSE 100, the rate cut can pull in opposite directions:\n- Supportive for domestic cyclicals (consumer-facing names, housebuilders, travel/leisure), because lower rates can ease financial pressure on households and businesses.\n- Less supportive for banks\u2019 net interest margins in a simple model (though bank shares can still rise if investors expect improved loan demand or fewer defaults).\n- A potential headwind for internationally exposed earners when sterling rises, since a stronger pound can reduce the value of overseas earnings when translated back to pounds.\nThursday\u2019s tape suggested the domestic side of that equation mattered more by the close, with retail and hospitality standing out. [8]\nTop UK share movers today: Whitbread, Currys, and a retail-led surge\nWhitbread jumps after activist Corvex presses for a strategic review\nWhitbread (Premier Inn owner) was among the day\u2019s biggest winners after activist hedge fund Corvex Managementdisclosed a stake of about 6% and called for a strategic review, including scrutiny of Whitbread\u2019s multi-year capital investment plan. [9]\nCorvex argued the market is not fully valuing Whitbread\u2019s assets (including property and its Germany exposure), and sought board representation. Whitbread shares rose sharply on the news. [10]\nCurrys surges on profit growth and a confident Christmas message\nOn the FTSE 250, Currys rallied after reporting a strong first half and reiterating expectations for full-year profit growth, saying it was well positioned for Christmas trading.\nReuters noted Currys\u2019 adjusted pre-tax profit more than doubled to \u00a322 million and revenue rose 8% to \u00a34.23 billion, with momentum across the UK & Ireland and Nordics.

                "body": "Markets Steady Ahead Of Bank Of England Rate Decision\nThe Bank of England (BoE) is widely expected to deliver a 25 basis point rate cut today, taking the base rate to 3.75%. Traders have priced in a roughly 96% probability of this move, which means the immediate market reaction is likely to be muted.\nThe focus will instead be on the accompanying guidance and the voting split among the Monetary Policy Committee. Any hints about the pace of future cuts could prove more consequential than today's decision itself.\nUK bonds, sterling and equities showed little movement in early trading, reflecting this high degree of certainty. The real interest lies in whether the Bank signals a more dovish or hawkish path ahead.\nWith inflation still above target but economic growth faltering, the BoE faces the familiar challenge of balancing price stability against supporting the economy. The decision itself matters less than what comes next.\nSterling steadies ahead of policy decisionThe pound was trading slightly weaker near $1.34 in early dealing, with traders positioning cautiously ahead of the announcement. However, the currency has held up relatively well given the certainty around a rate cut.\nAttention is increasingly turning to the euro-sterling relationship, particularly if the Bank adopts a more dovish stance than the European Central Bank. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to hold rates steady, potentially creating some divergence in monetary policy.\nSterling's recent resilience has been notable, with the currency managing to hold onto gains despite expectations of further easing. This suggests markets are looking beyond individual rate decisions to the broader economic picture.\nUK equities edge higher on energy strengthThe FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 were both up around 0.1% ahead of the BoE decision, with energy stocks providing support as oil prices firmed. However, healthcare names were among the laggards, limiting the overall advance.\nThe modest gains reflect a market that is largely comfortable with the expected policy move. There's little sense of anticipation or nervousness, suggesting traders have positioned themselves accordingly.\nBroader European equities were similarly muted, with investors waiting for a cluster of central bank decisions across the continent. Sweden and Norway are both expected to hold rates, adding to the sense of policy stability.\nBP's leadership change and Currys' surprise rallyBP shares were little changed following the announcement that Meg O'Neill will take over as chief executive. Analysts remain divided on the strategic implications of the appointment, particularly regarding the company's energy transition plans.\nThe muted reaction suggests investors are taking a wait-and-see approach. BP has struggled to convince the market of its strategy in recent years, and a new CEO brings both opportunity and uncertainty.\nIn contrast, Currys jumped as much as 15% after reporting profit figures ahead of expectations. This came despite management flagging a more challenging UK consumer backdrop, highlighting the low bar that had been set.\nThe electronics retailer's rally demonstrates how beaten-down stocks can surprise on the upside when expectations are sufficiently depressed. However, the company's cautious outlook suggests this may prove a brief respite rather than the start of a sustained recovery.\nCentral banks dominate global agendaToday's BoE decision is just one of several central bank meetings taking centre stage. The ECB is also expected to hold rates steady, maintaining its cautious approach to monetary easing.\nSweden and Norway are both forecast to keep policy unchanged as well, reflecting the varied pace of disinflation across different economies. This divergence in policy timing has become a key theme for currency markets.\nThe concentration of central bank decisions on a single day tends to amplify market moves, as traders digest multiple policy signals simultaneously. However, with most outcome"

That pause serves up welcome relief for markets, but also puts the spotlight on future data, as policymakers are keeping things flexible.

Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz fell by 0.67% after denying any updates to its \u20ac5 billion cost-cutting plan. All this points to investors rewarding business models seen as resilient and future-ready, despite pockets of market uncertainty.\nThe bigger picture: Cautious central banks, consolidating industries, steadying ground.\nThe ECB\u2019s steady hand underscores Europe\u2019s delicate balancing act between containing inflation and rekindling growth. Tepid export forecasts mirror persistent global headwinds, while we\u2019re seeing strategic moves behind the scenes: vehicle leasing giant Arval entering talks to acquire Athlon from Mercedes-Benz hints at consolidation in response to economic uncertainty. So while growth may be on a slow simmer, Europe\u2019s policy and industry leaders are focused on building longer-term stability.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8% while the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up by about 0.1%.\nMicron results came in well above expectations, showing data center demand for memory chips is strong.

                "body": "The Associated Press//December 18, 2025//\nThe Associated Press//December 18, 2025//\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 U.S. stocks are rising following an encouraging report on inflation that could help the Federal Reserve keep cutting interest rates next year. A strong profit report from Micron Technology also helped AI stocks halt their sharp slides Thursday, at least for now. The S&P 500 rose 1.1%, coming off its fourth straight loss. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 406 points, and the Nasdaq composite added 1.5%. Some relief came from a report showing that inflation was less bad last month than economists expected. Micron, the seller of memory and storage for computers, soared after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected.\nWall Street pointed toward gains before the opening bell Thursday, a day after declines for AI stocks dragged the U.S. market to its worst day in nearly a month.\nFutures for the S&P 500 gained 0.4%, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.2%. Nasdaq futures shot 0.8% higher.\nSome of the companies hit hardest on Wednesday were poised to regain some of those losses Thursday. Broadcom, Oracle and CoreWeave were all up a little more than 1% early Wednesday, possibly boosted by a strong earnings report from the chipmaker Micron.\nMicron jumped 12.8% early Thursday after it easily beat Wall Street\u2019s first-quarter profit and revenue targets. The Idaho company said that demand for AI accelerated last quarter, pushing its profit and revenue to record highs.\nAccording to Zacks Investment Research, Micron on Wednesday reported fiscal first-quarter profit of $5.24 billion. On a per-share basis, the company said it had net income of $4.60. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, came to $4.78 per share.\nFor the current quarter ending in February, Micron expects its per-share earnings to range from $8.22 to $8.62.\nThe company said it expects revenue in the range of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter.\nThe artificial-intelligence sector is being pressured by questions over whether Big Tech companies\u2019 share prices have shot too high. Micron\u2019s record quarter may temporarily ease some of the anxiety over AI and whether all the money being poured into it will turn into productivity and profit.\nOutside the tech sector, Lululemon jumped 7.4% on reports that activist investor Elliott Management has taken a more than $1 billion stake in the company and is pushing for a new CEO.\nTraders were waiting for an update later in the day on U.S. inflation, and on a decision Friday by Japan\u2019s central bank on interest rates. The Bank of Japan is expected to raise its key rate by 0.25 percentage point to tamp down price pressures, despite a contraction in the July-September quarter.\nThe Bank of England on Thursday cut its key interest rate for the first time in four months amid signs that the stubbornly high inflation that has plagued British consumers and businesses is beginning to ease. Policymakers at Britain\u2019s central bank voted to reduce the base rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.75%.\nAt midday in Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX edged 0.2% higher to 24,007.33, while the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.4% to 8,114.30. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 was up 0.3% to 9,800.00.\nIn Asian trading, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 lost 1% to 49,001.50, with technology shares leading the decline.\nTechnology and telecoms giant SoftBank sank 4%. Computer chipmaker Tokyo Electron lost 3.2% while chip testing equipment maker Advantest dropped 3.3%.\nHonda Motor Corp. fell 2.2% after reports said it was suspending production at some plants in Japan and China due to shortages of computer chips.\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi sank 1.5% to 3,994.51, also pulled lower by selling of shares in electronics companies and automakers. LG Electronics declined 3.1%, while Samsung Electronics lost 0.3%.\nChinese markets were mixed. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng bounced back from early losses to gain 0.1%, closing at 25,498.13.

Technology led the way: sector ETFs, including the Invesco QQQ Trust, rose between 1.8% and 1.9%, while Micron Technology\u2019s upbeat earnings set the tone for chipmakers, pushing semiconductor-focused funds up as much as 2.9%. In contrast, energy ETFs dipped 1..\n.2% despite a 0.9% rise in oil prices, reflecting a disconnect between commodity prices and fund returns. The same pattern played out with gold and silver funds underperforming spot prices, suggesting that investors remain a bit cautious in defensive areas. Cyclical sectors like consumer and industrial ETFs gained ground, healthcare funds were mixed, and crypto ETFs saw modest upticks.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Growth stocks take the driver\u2019s seat.\nLower inflation has reignited risk appetite, making technology and semiconductor ETFs top performers once again. This signals that, for now, investors are doubling down on innovation and growth-facing sectors. On the flip side, the lag from energy and commodity funds, even with rising underlying prices, suggests investors are skittish about ongoing volatility and potential profit-taking after recent gains.\nThe bigger picture: Inflation\u2019s cooldown could redraw the winners\u2019 map.\nA softer inflation outlook might prompt central banks to rethink their stance, potentially loosening financial conditions. That typically favors sectors geared toward growth, like tech and cyclicals, while more defensive plays\u2014think commodities and consumer staples\u2014can fall out of favor. So as market dynamics shift, expect more momentum for areas positioned for digital transformation and economic expansion.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

When the overtaxed systems lost pressure, fire hydrants ran dry.\n- Nearly a year later, residents and experts are weighing solutions that would make more water available for firefighting, including installing cisterns, tapping water from swimming pools, or even turning to mobile pumps and pipes that could quickly route water where it\u2019s needed.\nAs the flames of the Palisades fire licked at his home, Ricardo Kawamura stood in his front yard watching smoke pour out of a second-story window. He saw a fire engine parked next to a hydrant on his street, and called for help.\n\u201cThey told me they did not have enough water,\u201d Kawamura said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, there was nothing that they could do at that time.\u201d\nAfter two of the most destructive fires in the state\u2019s history, The Times takes a critical look at the past year and the steps taken \u2014 or not taken \u2014 to prevent this from happening again in all future fires.\nAs the fire spread, the water system quickly lost pressure as crews drew heavily on hydrants, residents ran sprinklers and hoses, and water gushed out of melted pipes. Hillside tanks ran out of water, and many hydrants, particularly in higher-elevation areas, lost pressure and ran dry.\nAn additional source of frustration for residents was the fact that one vital water asset \u2014 the Santa Ynez Reservoir \u2014 sat empty and dry as their neighborhoods burned.\nHow did entire communities find themselves in the midst of raging fires without enough water on hand to fight them?\nThe answers have exposed the weaknesses of Los Angeles\u2019 water systems and prompted widespread calls to redesign Southern California\u2019s water infrastructure. Water managers and experts said the water systems in Pacific Palisades and Altadena were never designed for wildfires that rage through entire neighborhoods, or for infernos intensified by climate change. In fact, their design effectively guaranteed that hydrants would lose pressure and fail during a giant fire.\nThe loss of pressure in hydrants had happened before in various wildfires, including the 2008 Freeway Complex fire, the 2017 Tubbs and Thomas fires, the 2018 Woolsey fire and the 2024 Mountain fire.\nBut the historic devastation of the Palisades and Eaton fires has led residents and experts to search urgently for ways to ensure more water is available next time.\nProposed ideas include installing emergency shutoff valves that can reduce the loss of water as buildings burn, designing new neighborhood systems with cisterns that store water for firefighting, encouraging the use of household firefighting equipment that draws on swimming pools, and having temporary pipes and pumps that can be deployed quickly when a fire erupts.\nSo far, however, local officials in Los Angeles and L.A. County appear to have taken few, if any, concrete steps toward major changes.\nWhen the flames began tearing through Pacific Palisades, the 117-million-gallon Santa Ynez Reservoir had been empty for nearly a year. In early 2024, a major tear was discovered in its floating cover. The contractor hired to do the repairs had not yet begun when the fire exploded.\nHaving this key piece of the water system empty at a time of high fire danger was inexcusable, said George Engel, an entertainment executive whose house was left standing while neighboring homes were destroyed.\n\u201cThe city wasn\u2019t prepared for it at all,\u201d Engel said. \u201cWe just basically had no support.\u201d\nThe Palisades fire killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of homes.\n\u201cThis should never happen again,\u201d Engel said. \u201cWe need to learn from this. We need to fix it.\u201d\nAfter a 10-month review, California officials concluded that it had been necessary to drain the reservoir to protect public health, and that even if the reservoir had been full, the system of pipes throughout the area \u201cwould have been quickly overwhelmed\u201d and lost pressure bec"

It came after earlier talks among Russian and Turkish officials.\nThe report came after the US ambassador to Turkey, Tom Barrack, said that Ankara and Washington were in talks about Turkey rejoining the US warplanes co-production system.\n\"The United States is in ongoing discussions with T\u00fcrkiye regarding their desire to rejoin the F-35 program and their possession of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system,\" Barrack wrote in a post on X.\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\nTurkey never operated the F-35, but was expelled from a co-production programme in 2019 after it purchased the Russian S-400 air defence system.\nThe US Congress was already angry at Turkey over several incursions into Syria and violations of Greek airspace, and it slapped penalties on Ankara over the purchase.\nIn 2020, it included an amendment in a defence bill that banned Turkey from receiving the F-35 unless the president certifies that Turkey no longer possess the S-400.\nAdditionally, Turkey was slapped with sanctions that have stifled defence cooperation between the US and Turkey's Defence Procurement Agency.\nErdogan\u2019s request that Russia take back the S-400 is a climbdown from Turkey\u2019s previous position, which sought to keep the S-400, potentially mothballing it, while still purchasing the F-35.\nOne of the potential compromises analysts discussed would have had Turkey keeping the S-400 in a warehouse and not activating it, as it is doing at the moment, but allowing Nato inspectors to continuously verify that.\nTurkey had earlier resisted sending the S-400 to a third country.\nRelations between the US and Turkey have improved under Trump, who has leaned on Turkish influence in Syria and also relied on Ankara to coax Hamas into agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza.\nAaron Stein, president of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, previously told Middle East Eye that Trump was eager to work with Turkey on a deal.\n\"The really big customers for F-35s are Turkey, the UAE and Saudi Arabia,\" he said. \"Trump wants nothing more than to sell F-35s to Turkey. I assume he would go against the Israelis. Forty jets is a big order,\u201d he said, referring to reports on the number of warplanes Ankara has discussed buying.\nMiddle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.

BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda will hold a news conference from 0630 GMT.\nA large majority of economists in a Reuters poll predicted the central bank would raise short-term interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5%, which would mark the first increase since January.\n\"Economic conditions arguably justified a hike ahead of the monetary committee's October meeting, and recent data only strengthens the case,\" James Brady, vice president at Teneo, said in a note.\n\"The Bank's long-sought 'virtuous cycle' of wage growth and 2% inflation now appear closer than at any point in decades.\"\nThe 10-year JGB yield (JP10YTN=JBTC) rose 1 basis point (bp) to 1.975%, taking it just below this week's 18-year high of 1.98%.\nThe 20-year yield (JP20YTN=JBTC) added 1 bp to 2.945%, edging back towards this month's record high of 2.955%.\nThe two-year yield (JP2YTN=JBTC), which tends to be the most sensitive to monetary policy expectations, was steady at 1.065%, just below an 18-year peak.\nOther tenors had yet to trade. Bond yields rise when prices fall.\nBenchmark 10-year JGB futures (2JGBv1) fell 0.05 yen at 133.29 yen."
