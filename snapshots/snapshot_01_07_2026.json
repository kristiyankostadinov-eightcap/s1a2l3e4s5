                "body": "Gold nears $4,500 as geopolitical fears trump rising yields, US Dollar\n- Gold and Silver hit fresh records as developments in Venezuela and Trump\u2019s rhetoric heighten geopolitical uncertainty.\n- Steady US PMIs reinforce expectations for lower rates, supporting Bullion despite rising Treasury yields.\n- Markets price nearly 56 bps of Fed cuts by end-2026 ahead of key US labor data.\nGold price (XAU/USD) rallies on Tuesday for the fourth straight day, shy of reclaiming the $4,500 figure even though US Treasury yields rise along with the Greenback, which is also gaining 0.20%. At the time of writing, XAU/USD trades at $4,487, up nearly 1%.\nBullion extends gains as Venezuela tensions fuel haven demand despite firmer yields and US Dollar strength\nPrecious metals traders continued to push Gold and Silver toward record high levels amid geopolitical uncertainty. The capture of the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and US President Donald Trump's verbal threats of extending those kinds of operations to other Latin American countries keep investors anxious, which has turned to Bullion\u2019s haven appeal.\nRecently revealed economic data in the United States prompted investors to buy the yellow metal following the release of nearly unchanged Purchasing Managers Indices (PMI) computed by S&P Global.\nUS business activity remains solid, yet it justifies the need for lower interest rates, according to Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who recently crossed the wires. Contrary to his opinion, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin stated that the Fed funds rate is within neutral levels, which neither stimulates nor restrains economic activity.\nDespite this, traders have priced in nearly 56 basis points of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve towards the end of 2026, according to Prime Market Terminal Data.\nThe US economic docket will feature US ADP Employment Change figures for December, along with ISM Services PMI for the same period, and JOLTS Job Openings for November.\nDaily digest market movers: Gold ignores US Dollar strength\n- December\u2019s S&P Global Services PMI showed that business activity is losing momentum in the US. The index eased from 54.1 to 52.5 while the Composite PMI dipped to 52.7 from 54.2.\n- Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said future rate decisions will need to be \u201cfinely tuned,\u201d given the competing risks to the labor market and inflation objectives. He added that the current policy rate sits within the neutral range and emphasized the need to monitor both sides of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate.\n- Earlier, Fed Governor Stephen Miran struck a dovish tone, saying the central bank is likely to adjust rates lower as incoming data point toward the need for easing. Miran added that he expects conditions to warrant up to 100 basis points of rate cuts in 2026.\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the buck\u2019s value against six other currencies, posted gains of 0.25% at 98.61, but failed to cap Gold gains.\n- Also, rising US Treasury yields have not prevented Bullion from surging higher. The US 10-year T-note yield rises two basis points to 4.179%. US real yields, which correlate inversely with Gold prices, are also up nearly one and a half basis points at 1.919%.\nTechnical analysis: Gold price on its way towards $4,500\nThe technical picture shows Gold\u2019s uptrend intact, approaching the $4,500 figure, with strong bullish momentum supporting the move. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, an indication that further upside is seen.\nThe first key resistance level is the previously mentioned $4,500 mark. Once cleared, the next stop would be the record high of $4,549, reached last December.\nOn the other hand, if XAU/USD trips below $4,450, this clears the path towards $4,400. A breach of the latter will expose the 20-day SMA at $4,381 ahead of $4,350.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange.

Venezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves \u2013 outpacing Saudi Arabia with 303 billion barrels, or about 20% of global reserves.\nIf this does eventuate \u2013 and that\u2019s a very big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 it would mark the end of an adversarial relationship that began nearly 30 years ago.\nYes, the Trump administration\u2019s military action in Venezuela was in many ways unprecedented. But it was not surprising given Venezuela\u2019s vast oil wealth and the historic relations between the US and Venezuela under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro.\nA long history of US investment\nVenezuela is a republic of around 30 million people on the northern coast of South America, about twice the size of California. During much of the early 20th century, it was considered the wealthiest country in South America due to its oil reserves.\nForeign companies, including those from the US, invested heavily in the growth of Venezuelan oil and played a heavy hand in its politics. In the face of US opposition, however, Venezuelan leaders began asserting more control over their main export resource. Venezuela was a key figure in the formation of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1960, and it nationalised much of its oil industry in 1976.\nThis negatively impacted US companies like ExxonMobil and has fuelled the recent claims by the Trump administration that Venezuela \u201cstole\u201d US oil.\nEconomic prosperity, however, did not follow for most Venezuelans. The mismanagement of the oil industry led to a debt crisis and International Monetary Fund (IMF) intervention in 1988. Caracas erupted in protests in February 1989 and the government sent the military to crush the uprising. An estimated 300 people were killed, according to official totals, but the real figure could be 10 times higher.\nIn the aftermath, Venezuelan society became further split between the wealthy, who wanted to work with the US, and the working class, who sought autonomy from the US. This division has defined Venezuelan politics ever since.\nCh\u00e1vez\u2019s rise to power\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez began his career as a military officer. In the early 1980s, he formed the socialist \u201cRevolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200\u201d within the army and began giving rousing lectures against the government.\nThen, after the 1989 riots, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s recruitment efforts increased dramatically and he began planning the overthrow of Venezuela\u2019s government. In February 1992, he staged a failed coup against the pro-US president, Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez. While he was imprisoned, his group staged another coup attempt later in the year that also failed. Chavez was jailed for two years, but emerged as the leading presidential candidate in 1998 on a socialist revolutionary platform.\nCh\u00e1vez became a giant of both Venezuelan and Latin American politics. His revolution evoked the memory of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the great liberator of South America from Spanish colonialism. Not only was Ch\u00e1vez broadly popular in Venezuela for his use of oil revenue to subsidise government programs for food, health and education, he was well-regarded in like-minded regimes in the region due to his generosity.\nMost notably, Ch\u00e1vez provided Cuba with billions of dollars worth of oil in exchange for tens of thousands of Cuban doctors working in Venezuelan health clinics.\nHe also set a precedent of standing up to the US and to the IMF at global forums, famously calling then-US President George W Bush \u201cthe devil\u201d at the UN General Assembly in 2006.\nUS accused of fomenting a coup\nUnsurprisingly, the US was no fan of Ch\u00e1vez.\nAfter hundreds of thousands of opposition protesters took to the streets in April 2002, Chav"

                "body": "After US special forces swooped into Caracas to seize Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and topple his government, US President Donald Trump said the United States will now \u201crun\u201d Venezuela, including its abundant oil resources.\nUS companies were poised to invest billions to upgrade Venezuela\u2019s crumbling oil infrastructure, he said, and \u201cstart making money for the country\u201d. Venezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves \u2013 outpacing Saudi Arabia with 303 billion barrels, or about 20% of global reserves.\nIf this does eventuate \u2013 and that\u2019s a very big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 it would mark the end of an adversarial relationship that began nearly 30 years ago.\nYes, the Trump administration\u2019s military action in Venezuela was in many ways unprecedented. But it was not surprising given Venezuela\u2019s vast oil wealth and the historic relations between the US and Venezuela under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro.\nA long history of US investment\nVenezuela is a republic of around 30 million people on the northern coast of South America, about twice the size of California. During much of the early 20th century, it was considered the wealthiest country in South America due to its oil reserves.\nForeign companies, including those from the US, invested heavily in the growth of Venezuelan oil and played a heavy hand in its politics. In the face of US opposition, however, Venezuelan leaders began asserting more control over their main export resource. Venezuela was a key figure in the formation of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1960, and it nationalised much of its oil industry in 1976.\nThis negatively impacted US companies like ExxonMobil and has fuelled the recent claims by the Trump administration that Venezuela \u201cstole\u201d US oil.\nEconomic prosperity, however, did not follow for most Venezuelans. The mismanagement of the oil industry led to a debt crisis and International Monetary Fund (IMF) intervention in 1988. Caracas erupted in protests in February 1989 and the government sent the military to crush the uprising. An estimated 300 people were killed, according to official totals, but the real figure could be 10 times higher.\nIn the aftermath, Venezuelan society became further split between the wealthy, who wanted to work with the US, and the working class, who sought autonomy from the US. This division has defined Venezuelan politics ever since.\nCh\u00e1vez\u2019s rise to power\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez began his career as a military officer. In the early 1980s, he formed the socialist \u201cRevolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200\u201d within the army and began giving rousing lectures against the government.\nThen, after the 1989 riots, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s recruitment efforts increased dramatically and he began planning the overthrow of Venezuela\u2019s government. In February 1992, he staged a failed coup against the pro-US president, Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez. While he was imprisoned, his group staged another coup attempt later in the year that also failed. Chavez was jailed for two years, but emerged as the leading presidential candidate in 1998 on a socialist revolutionary platform.\nCh\u00e1vez became a giant of both Venezuelan and Latin American politics. His revolution evoked the memory of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the great liberator of South America from Spanish colonialism. Not only was Ch\u00e1vez broadly popular in Venezuela for his use of oil revenue to subsidise government programs for food, health and education, he was well-regarded in like-minded regimes in the region due to his generosity.\nMost notably, Ch\u00e1vez provided Cuba with billions of dollars worth of oil in exchange for tens of thousands of Cuban doctors working in Venezuelan health clinics.\nHe also set a precedent of standing up to the US and to the IMF at global forums, famously calling then-US President George W Bush \u201cthe devil\u201d at the UN General Assembly in 2006.\nUS accused of fomenting a coup\nUnsurprisingly, the US was no fan of Ch\u00e1vez.\nAfter hundreds of thousands of opposition protesters took to the streets in April 2002, Chav"

                "body": "Over the past five trading sessions, EUR/USD price action has shown a consistent bearish bias, accumulating a short-term decline of close to 1%. One of the main drivers behind this growing weakness has been central bank dynamics, particularly in the United States, where new guidance could emerge following the release of key employment data scheduled for this week. As long as a clear scenario of U.S. rate cuts fails to materialize, this factor may continue to act as a relevant catalyst for a temporary recovery in U.S. dollar confidence. If this environment persists, the euro could continue to lose ground, allowing for more persistent selling pressure in EUR/USD over the coming sessions.\nWhat Is Expected from the United States?\nDuring the first days of January, expectations have been solidified that the Federal Reserve will maintain a neutral interest rate stance at its next two monetary policy meetings, scheduled for January 28, 2026, and March 18. At present, the market assigns an 83.9% probability that rates will remain unchanged in January and a 52.6% probability that this stance will also be maintained in March. This reinforces the perception that the U.S. central bank may begin 2026 with a stable monetary policy outlook.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nThis expectation of neutral rates has contributed to a short-term recovery in the U.S. dollar in recent sessions. The DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against other currencies, has advanced with a positive slope, reaching the 98.5-point area, moving closer to the psychological 100-point level. This move reflects how stability in rate expectations has helped stabilize U.S. Treasury yields and, in turn, sustain consistent demand for the dollar, limiting the euro\u2019s upside in recent sessions.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nThis week, markets are also awaiting the release of the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change and Non-Farm Payrolls, two key indicators of U.S. labor market dynamics for December. For the ADP report, expectations point to an increase of around 51,000 new jobs, compared with the previous reading of -32,000, while NFP is expected to come in at 62,000 new jobs, slightly below the prior 64,000. Employment trends have been a key pillar in Federal Reserve decision-making, and if both indicators deliver positive and consistent results, it could reinforce the view that the labor market is not slowing as previously expected. This would support a neutral rate outlook, favor the U.S. dollar, and keep downward pressure on EUR/USD in the short term.\nEUR/USD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- The broad sideways range remains the most relevant structure: Since mid-June 2025, EUR/USD has traded within a wide consolidation range, capped at 1.18231 and supported near 1.15090. So far, price action has not been strong enough to threaten this structure, leaving the range as the dominant technical formation in the short term. As long as key support and resistance levels remain intact, price is likely to continue oscillating within this range, without a clear directional trend.\n- RSI: The RSI has maintained a consistent decline, trading below the neutral 50 level, indicating that bearish momentum has begun to dominate recent price action. If the indicator continues to post lower readings, selling pressure could gain further relevance in the short term.\n- MACD: The MACD also shows a histogram below the neutral zero line, suggesting that short-term moving average momentum has turned bearish. As long as this behavior persists, it may reinforce more consistent selling pressure in EUR/USD.\nKey Levels:\n- 1.18231 \u2013 Key resistance: The upper boundary of the consolidation range and the 2025 highs. A sustained bullish breakout above this zone could invalidate the range structure and activate a broader bullish trend over the coming weeks.\n- 1.16377 \u2013 Nearby barrier: A neutrality zone aligned with the 50-period simple moving average. Price action around this level could favor an extension of th"

Meanwhile, data in the Eurozone shows that economic activity is decelerating in the bloc. The pair trades at 1.1690 after hitting a high of 1.1742.\nEuro tumbles on weak data; fading geopolitical risks offset mixed US numbers, dovish Fed tones\nThe US Dollar is trimming some of Monday\u2019s losses. Market participants shrugged off geopolitical risks after the US captured the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. Also, the lack of progress of peace talks to resolve the Ukraine-Russia conflict, keeps the shared currency pressured.\nIn the US, Purchasing Managers\u2019 Indices (PMI) weakened in December, compared to the previous month. Meanwhile, Fed Governor Stephen Miran was dovish as expected, while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin is leaning neutral-hawkish, as he acknowledged that policy is within neutral.\nIn Europe, PMIs revealed a slowdown in activity in the services sector. Inflation in Germany, the largest European economy dipped below the European Central Bank (ECB) 2% goal, a reaffirmation that the ECB\u2019s has concluded, unless economic growth is compromised.\nAhead, the EU economic docket will feature the EU\u2019s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for December, along with inflation figures on Italy and Retail Sales in Germany.\nOn the US front, traders focus would be on the ADP Employment Change figures, the ISM Services PMI, the JOLTS Job Openings and speeches by Fed officials.\nDaily digest market movers: Euro pressured by dip on German inflation\n- December\u2019s S&P Global Services PMI showed that business activity is losing momentum in the US. The index eased from 54.1 to 52.5 while the Composite PMI dipped to 52.7 from 54.2.\n- Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence noted that \u201cBusiness activity continued to expand in December, rounding off another quarter of robust growth, but the resilience of the US economy is showing signs of cracking.\u201d\n- Fed officials crossed the wires. Richmond\u2019s Thomas Barkin said future rate decisions will need to be \u201cfinely tuned,\u201d citing competing risks to the labor market and inflation. He added that the current policy rate sits within the neutral range and stressed the importance of monitoring both sides of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate.\n- Earlier, Stephen Miran struck a dovish tone, saying the central bank is likely to adjust rates lower as incoming data point toward the need for easing. Miran added that conditions could warrant up to 100 basis points of rate cuts in 2026.\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the buck\u2019s value against six other currencies, post gains of 0.25% at 98.61, but failed to cap Gold gains.\n- The Eurozone HCOB Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), dipped to 52.4 in December, down from a preliminary reading of 52.6 and after 53.1 in November.\n- German inflation data as measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) fell from 2.6% to 2% YoY.\nTechnical outlook: EUR/USD slumps below 1.1700\nTuesday dip changed the EUR/USD technical picture from neutral to upward biased, to neutral. Failure of printing a daily close above 1.1700 exerts downward pressure on the pair, which is 20-pips shy of hitting the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 1.1663.\nIn that outcome, the EUR/USD next support is the 100-day SMA, followed by the 50- and the 200-day SMAs, each at 1.1639 and 1.1553, respectively.\nFor a bullish resumption, bulls must clear the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 1.1729, ahead of 1.1750, which would"

                "body": "Eurozone Services PMI and German HICP\nEUR/USD is under pressure with current attention on German HICP data, retreating near 1.1700 after being rejected at 1.1740. December\u2019s Eurozone Services PMI has been revised down to 52.4 from 52.6, affecting the Euro negatively.\nThe currency pair\u2019s performance on Monday was helped by weak US economic data and dovish Federal Reserve commentary. The Euro had previously gained due to weaker US manufacturing data and Federal Reserve hints at potential easing.\nThe Eurozone Services PMI adjustment from 52.6 to 52.4, down from November\u2019s 53.1, has pressured the Euro. Awaiting German HICP data might influence the Euro\u2019s short-term direction.\nUS ISM Manufacturing PMI saw a drop, with new orders contracting and rising prices. Comments from Fed President Kashkari added to speculation of US monetary easing, weakening the Dollar.\nFurther US Dollar influences include Richmond Fed President Barkin\u2019s speech and upcoming US labour data, especially the Nonfarm Payrolls report. Euro showed strength against the Swiss Franc, but trading remains cautious due to technical resistance.\nFocus on Technical Analysis and Market Inertia\nTraders are focused on US labor reports to gauge Fed\u2019s monetary strategies. Technical analysis shows EUR/USD hesitating above 1.1700, with MACD suggesting improved momentum, while RSI is below neutral territory.\nExpectations for German HICP set at 2.2% for December, down from prior 2.6%, could impact the Euro. The market remains cautious, steered by economic indicators and geopolitical events.\nWe\u2019re seeing a familiar hesitancy in EUR/USD, which is currently pivoting around the 1.0850 mark. This situation feels very similar to what we saw around this time in January 2025, when the pair was also on the defensive near 1.1700. The market is once again waiting for a clear signal before committing to a direction.\nLast year, we saw downward revisions to the Eurozone Services PMI put pressure on the Euro. Today, we are seeing a similar conflict with recent data showing German industrial production fell by 0.7% in November 2025, yet the latest Eurozone Core CPI for December held firm at 3.4%. This puts the European Central Bank in a difficult position, much like the mixed signals did a year ago.\nOn the US side, the narrative of a cooling economy is also re-emerging, echoing the weak manufacturing data from January 2025. The latest JOLTS report showed job openings falling to 8.79 million, signaling a loosening labor market and fueling speculation about the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate path. Just as we did last year, all eyes are now turning to this Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report for confirmation.\nGiven the choppy trading and critical data releases ahead, we believe derivative plays are more prudent than outright directional bets. A long straddle or strangle on EUR/USD, centered around the current 1.0850 level with an expiry after the NFP release, could be an effective strategy. This approach allows us to profit from a significant price move in either direction, which is likely once the market digests the new labor data.\nFrom a technical standpoint, indicators like the RSI are hovering in neutral territory, suggesting a lack of conviction similar to the conditions in early 2025. Any rallies are likely to face resistance, while dips may find temporary support, reinforcing the idea of a market in a holding pattern. We anticipate this cautious sideways movement will persist until the key US employment figures provide a clearer catalyst."

Nevertheless, the data marked the eighth consecutive month of expansion in British private-sector activity.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after "

                "body": "The GBP/USD pair oscillates in a narrow range, around the 1.3500 psychological mark during the Asian session on Wednesday, and for now, seems to have stalled the previous day's retracement slide from its highest level since September 18. Moreover, the fundamental backdrop seems tilted in favor of bullish traders and suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the upside.\nThe US Dollar (USD) preserves the overnight gains, though it lacks bullish conviction on the back of dovish US Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations and ahead of a host of key macroeconomic indicators. Apart from this, the prevalent bullish sentiment across the global equity markets undermines demand for the safe-haven Greenback, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor acting as a tailwind for the GBP/USD pair.\nThe British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, continues to draw support from easing worries over the UK budget and a relatively hawkish Bank of England (BoE). The 5\u20134 narrow vote split to cut rates in December pointed to differences within the committee amid the recent inflation surprise, forcing investors to scale back their expectations for more aggressive easing in 2026. This could further support the GBP/USD pair.\nThe supportive factors validate the near-term positive outlook for the currency pair, though traders opt to wait for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. Hence, the focus remains on the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday. In the meantime, Thursday's release of the ADP report on the US private-sector employment, the US ISM Services, and JOLTS Job Openings might provide some impetus to the GBP/USD pair."

The prior three-month ceiling around 1.3520\u20131.3530 has flipped into intraday support, with price repeatedly defending that band after each shallow dip. The structure since mid-December is a clean series of higher lows and higher highs, and the latest push through 1.3525 and 1.3550 confirms that GBP/USD has transitioned from range trading into a genuine breakout phase, even if the move is now running into a thicker resistance belt around 1.3560\u20131.3600.\nThe daily GBP/USD chart shows an aggressive momentum profile, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index sitting around 69.3, only a fraction below the overbought threshold at 70. That reading matches what price is telling you: upside pressure is still there, but the risk of a pause or shallow pullback is rising as each new high adds froth to the move. On shorter timeframes, intraday ranges of roughly 40\u201350 pips between 1.3520 and 1.3560 highlight steady buying rather than disorderly short-covering, but the combination of extended RSI and repeated failures to hold above 1.3560\u20131.3570 warns that momentum is no longer cheap. The market remains pointed higher, yet anyone chasing GBP/USD above 1.3560 is paying up into stretched conditions and leaning on increasingly narrow risk-reward unless the pair can clear 1.3600 decisively.\nTrend and moving average alignment are unequivocally in favor of the Pound. On the daily chart GBP/USD trades above a rising 9-day exponential moving average near 1.3496, above the 50-day EMA around 1.3375, and above the 200-day simple moving average clustered close to 1.3385, with the 100-day SMA just under that at 1.3369. Short-term averages are stacked above the medium-term gauges, and all of them slope upward, a textbook bullish configuration. Price also rides along an ascending trendline drawn from the mid-December lows, with the line now intersecting around 1.3400, adding structural support beneath spot. Former resistance zones have been converted in sequence: 1.3473 acted as a key range cap late last year and is now part of a support band together with 1.3500 and 1.3520\u20131.3530. Deeper on the chart, the eight-month low around 1.3010 marks the line where the entire medium-term bullish narrative would be questioned; as long as GBP/USD remains comfortably above the 1.33\u20131.34 corridor and rides the 50- and 200-day averages, the path of least resistance stays higher.\nThe broader backdrop continues to tilt in favor of the Pound against the Dollar. The US Dollar Index is trading in the 98.2\u201398.6 region after a second consecutive daily decline, having slipped from resistance near 98.85 and now hovering just above technical support around 98.15. The driver is not geopolitics; markets have largely faded the latest US-Venezuela headlines, judging that the situation is not severe enough to trigger a lasting flight to safety in the USD. The real drag comes from the data and the policy narrative. US manufacturing is under pressure, with the ISM Manufacturing PMI falling to 47.9 in December, its third straight month in contraction and the weakest print since October. Services are still expanding but slowing, with the Services PMI easing to 52.5 and the Composite index slipping to 52.7, both modest downticks from November. That combination of sub-50 manufacturing and softening composite growth feeds the story that the US economy is cooling into 2026.\nOn the policy front, Federal Reserve communication is no longer hawkish. One influential policymaker describes the current stance as roughly neutral, flagging rising unemployment risks even as inflation drif"

The AUD/USD pair rises despite the easing of Australia's inflation in November. Traders now await the full fourth-quarter inflation report, due later this month. Analysts warned that a 0.9% or higher rise in core inflation could prompt the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to tighten at its February meeting.\nThe Australian Financial Review (AFR) suggested that the RBA may not be done tightening this cycle. The poll indicates that inflation is expected to remain stubbornly elevated over the coming year, fueling expectations of at least two additional rate hikes.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported on Wednesday that Australia\u2019s Consumer Price Index rose 3.4% year-over-year (YoY) in November, easing from 3.8% in October. The reading missed market expectations of 3.7% but remained above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target. It marked the lowest inflation since August, with housing costs increasing at the slowest pace in three months.\nAustralia\u2019s CPI was unchanged at 0% month-on-month (MoM) in November, matching October\u2019s reading. Meanwhile, the RBA\u2019s Trimmed Mean CPI rose 0.3% MoM and 3.2% YoY. Separately, seasonally adjusted Building Permits surged 15.2% MoM to a near four-year high of 18,406 units in November 2025, rebounding from a downwardly revised 6.1% fall previously. Annual approvals jumped 20.2%, reversing a revised 1.1% decline in October.\nUS Dollar declines ahead of ISM Services PMI\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is edging lower after registering modest gains in the previous session and hovering around 98.50 at the time of writing.\n- Traders await US economic data that could shape expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) policy. ISM Services Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) and JOLTs job openings will be eyed later in the day. The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report due Friday is expected to show job gains of 55,000 in December, down from 64,000 in November.\n- Fed Governor Stephen Miran said on Tuesday that the US central bank needs to cut interest rates aggressively this year to support economic momentum. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned of a risk that the unemployment rate could \u201cpop\u201d higher.\n- Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, a non-voter on the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee this year, said Tuesday that interest rate adjustments will need to be \u201cfinely tuned\u201d to incoming data, citing risks to both the Fed\u2019s employment and inflation objectives, according to Reuters.\n- According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, Fed funds futures continue to price in about an 82.8% probability that the US central bank will keep rates unchanged at its January 27\u201328 meeting.\n- The US launched a large-scale military strike against Venezuela on Saturday. US President Donald Trump said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife were captured and flown out of the country.\n- Venezuelan President Maduro, on Monday, pleaded not guilty to US charges in a narco-terrorism case, setting the stage for an unprecedented legal battle with major geopolitical implications, according to Bloomberg.\n- Traders expect two additional Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026.

A weaker US dollar and increasing speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia may not be done with its tightening cycle are supporting the AUD/USD pair. Australia\u2019s November Consumer Price Index data, due to be released on Wednesday, could be crucial for the short term.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about forex indicators? Check our detailed guide-\nA recent survey of top economists, reported by the Australian Financial Review, has strengthened support for the Australian dollar by indicating that inflation pressures in Australia are likely to remain high in 2026. According to the survey, at least two more RBA rate hikes are anticipated, aligned with the central bank\u2019s own statements. Governor Michele Bullock acknowledged that economic conditions requiring tighter policy were taken into consideration, maintaining hawkish expectations even though policymakers refrained from directly discussing a rate hike at the December meeting.\nAs markets reduce demand for safe havens, the US dollar has lost ground. Although geopolitical developments regarding Venezuela initially strengthened the greenback, investors have mostly ignored the situation and returned their attention to economic fundamentals. Weaker domestic data and cautious expectations from the Federal Reserve have caused the US Dollar Index to decline toward the 98.30 area.\nThe dollar came under more pressure after the release of US manufacturing data on Monday. A deeper decline in factory activity was evident in December as the ISM Manufacturing PMI dropped to 47.9, its lowest level since October 2024. The idea that US industrial momentum remains precarious was reinforced by the fact that declines in production and inventories outweighed slight increases in new orders. Although some officials advise patience if inflation continues to decline gradually, markets are still pricing in two additional rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2026.\nChina remains a significant swing factor for the Australian dollar. According to recent PMI data, manufacturing moved back into expansion territory while services activity slightly eased. Fears of a more severe slowdown in China, Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner, have been allayed despite the modest improvement.\nUpcoming data on both sides of the Pacific will continue to impact AUD/USD. While Friday\u2019s US Nonfarm Payrolls report may determine whether the dollar can regain traction, a stronger Australian CPI print could boost expectations of RBA tightening and maintain pair support. Currently, the odds appear to be slightly in Australia\u2019s favor.\nAUD/USD Technical Outlook: Lacking Follow-Through\nThe AUD/USD price managed to break above the major supply area around 0.6720, with eyes on further upside while staying above the key MAs. However, the momentum lacks conviction, staying flat above the broken level as the RSI hits the overbought zone.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about next cryptocurrency to explode?

On an annual basis, the new Complete Monthly CPI eased to 3.4% year-on-year in November, well below Westpac\u2019s 3.8% estimate and softer than market expectations.\nWestpac said the weaker-than-expected outcome introduces downside risk to its current December-quarter inflation forecasts, which sit at 0.6% quarter-on-quarter for headline CPI and 0.8% for the trimmed mean. If confirmed following a full review of the monthly detail, the bank believes the data should be sufficient to comfort the RBA ahead of its February meeting, reducing the likelihood of a rate hike.\nThe softer print was driven by a combination of weaker electricity prices and declines across several discretionary categories. Electricity prices rose far less than anticipated in the month, while household contents and services, clothing and footwear, and health all fell more sharply than Westpac had expected. Transport prices also rose more modestly. These declines were partly offset by firmer increases in food prices, rents, new dwellings and communications.\nEnergy rebates continued to play a significant role in shaping the inflation profile. Electricity prices were up 19.7% over the year to November, but Westpac noted this reflected the dampening impact of state and federal rebate schemes. Excluding those rebates, the ABS estimates electricity prices rose 4.6% year-on-year, slightly slower than in October and consistent with annual price resets by energy retailers in mid-2025.\nUnderlying inflation also edged lower. The trimmed mean rose 3.2% year-on-year in November, easing from 3.3% previously, while the monthly increase held steady at 0.3% \u2014 a pace Westpac notes has been consistent for several months.\nLooking ahead, Westpac expects the inflation pulse to continue moderating through 2026, outside of volatile items, administered prices and known supply shocks, reinforcing the case for the RBA to remain on hold in coming months.\nThe Australian dollar has added to recent gains after the data, trading above 0.6760.\n---\nReserve Bank of Australia meeting dates for the year ahead:"

                "body": "The S&P Global Japan Services PMI was in the spotlight, along with the Bank of Japan and USD/JPY, in early trading on Wednesday, January 7.\nService sector activity, labor market conditions, and price trends are key for the BoJ, given that the sector accounts for around 70% of Japan\u2019s GDP.\nThis week, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled further rate hikes if prices and the economy aligned with the Bank\u2019s projections. The BoJ Governor\u2019s comments followed last week\u2019s Summary of Opinions, which had a hawkish tone.\nThe prospect of further BoJ rate hikes and a dovish Fed rate path supports a bearish medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nThe S&P Global Japan Services PMI fell from 53.2 in November to 51.6 in December (prelim: 52.5), signaling a slight loss of economic momentum. However, sub-components of the PMI are likely to bolster expectations of a BoJ rate hike in the first half of 2026. Highlights from the December PMI survey included:\nTypically, tighter labor market conditions drive wage growth and consumer spending, fueling demand-driven inflation. Additionally, higher selling prices indicate a rise in inflationary pressure, supporting the BoJ\u2019s hawkish policy stance.\nThe BoJ\u2019s December rate hike, the Summary of Opinions, and the hawkish rhetoric have contributed to the sharp rise in Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields. 10-year JGB yields climbed to 2.138% this week, the highest since the 1990s. Increased risk of the BoJ\u2019s neutral interest rate, neither accommodative nor restrictive, being at the higher end of the Bank\u2019s 1% to 2.5% band has sent yields soaring.\nThe yen\u2019s weakness remains a headache for policymakers, who have raised concerns that higher import prices are eroding households\u2019 purchasing power. A higher neutral rate would enable the BoJ to raise interest rates aggressively, strengthening the yen.\nThese dynamics affirm the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nUSD/JPY briefly climbed from 156.707 to 156.720 before falling to a low of 156.540 after the release of the finalized Services PMI.\nLater on Wednesday, the highly influential ISM Services PMI will influence market bets on a March Fed rate cut. Economists expect the ISM Services PMI to fall from 52.6 in November to 52.3 in December. A lower reading, closer to the 50 neutral rate, would indicate slower economic activity, given that the sector contributes roughly 80% to US GDP. A loss of economic momentum would support a more dovish Fed rate path, weighing on the US dollar and USD/JPY.\nBeyond the headline PMI, traders should also consider the employment and prices sub-components, given the Fed\u2019s dual mandate. Crucially, the ISM Services PMI is likely to have a greater impact on USD/JPY than ADP employment change and JOLTs job openings figures, also out on Wednesday.\nToday\u2019s US economic indicators will be crucial for the near-term USD/JPY price trajectory. Softer bets on a March Fed rate cut countered expectations of BoJ rate hikes, sending the pair briefly through 157.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a March Fed rate cut fell from 51.1% on January 5 to 47.2% on January 6.\nNevertheless, expectations of further BoJ rate hikes, a new Fed Chair potentially favoring lower rates, and a deteriorating US labor market remain key drivers. These fundamentals reinforce the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, traders should closely monitor the technicals and the fundamentals.\nViewing the daily chart, USD/JPY remains above its 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), indicating a bullish bias. While technicals remained bullish, bearish fundamentals are evolving, countering the technical structure.\nA drop below the 50-day EMA and the 155 support level would signal a bearish near-term trend reversal, exposing the 200-day EMA. If breached, 150 would be the next key support level.\n"

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Forecast: Bears await ascending channel breakdown amid divergent BoJ-Fed bets\n- USD/JPY attracts some intraday sellers and is pressured by a combination of factors.\n- Intervention fears and the divergent BoJ-Fed outlooks continue to weigh on the pair.\n- The BoJ uncertainty and a positive risk tone keep a lid on the JPY, supporting spot prices.\nThe USD/JPY pair turns lower following an intraday uptick to the 156.80 area and looks to extend the overnight pullback from a nearly two-week high amid the prevalent US Dollar (USD) selling. In fact, the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, retreats further from a four-week top, touched on Monday, amid dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to prospects for further policy tightening by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which could benefit the lower-yielding Japanese Yen (JPY) and validates the near-term negative outlook for the currency pair.\nThe S&P Global reported on Monday that the US Manufacturing PMI held steady at 51.8, pointing to continued expansion. On the other hand, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Manufacturing PMI declined to 47.9 from 48.2 in November and indicated persistent contraction in the business activity. The data reaffirmed market bets that the Fed will lower borrowing costs in March and deliver one more interest rate cut by the end of this year. Moreover, expectations that the Trump-aligned new Fed chair will push for aggressive action, which keeps the USD on the defensive and exerts downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair.\nMeanwhile, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Monday that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates if economic and price developments move in line with its forecasts. The outlook pushed yields on the rate-sensitive two-year and the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGB) to their highest level since 1996 and 1999, respectively. The resultant narrowing of the rate differential between Japan and other major economies could support the JPY amid fears of government intervention. This further validates the near-term negative outlook and suggests that the path of least resistance for the USD/JPY pair is to the downside.\nInvestors, however, remain uncertain about the likely timing of the next interest rate hike. This, along with fiscal concerns and a generally positive risk tone, might keep a lid on any meaningful gains for the safe-haven JPY. Traders might refrain from placing aggressive directional bets and opt to wait for the release of the closely-watched US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday. Apart from this, other important US macroeconomic indicators scheduled this week might offer cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. This, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and provide a fresh impetus to the USD/JPY pair.\nUSD/JPY 1-hour chart\nTechnical Analysis:\nShort-term moving averages slope downward and cap intraday rebounds, while broader averages flatten, reflecting a soft tone. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) hovers around the zero line with a flat histogram, reinforcing a neutral momentum backdrop. RSI at 41 stays below the midline, suggesting modest bearish pressure after bouncing from the low-30s. The ascending channel from 155.46 remains intact, with support near 156.16; a firm bounce off this floor could stabilize the USD/JPY pair, whereas a close beneath it would expose further downside.\nSpot prices currently trade near the channel\u2019s lower boundary, keeping bears attentive as rallies stall below declining averages. A sustained MACD turn higher with a widening positive histogram would improve the upside outlook, while an RSI push through 50 would shift momentum toward recovery. Losing 156.16 would put the focus on the channel\u2019s origin at 155.46, whereas holding above the floor could allow a corrective move toward the topside of the structure.\n(The technical a"

Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has"

                "body": "Anticipating US Economic Data\nMarket participants are anticipating important US economic data releases, particularly the Nonfarm Payrolls report, which is expected to show an increase of 55,000 jobs. The Canadian Dollar faces possible pressure due to US and global access expectations to Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves impacting Canadian Oil demand, compounded by speculation of future Venezuelan output potentially affecting Oil prices.\nCanadian Dollar movements can be attributed to factors including the Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate decisions, Oil prices, and macroeconomic data. Economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and employment heavily influence the CAD, with a strong economy suggesting potential interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada, thereby supporting the CAD, whereas weaker data could lead to a depreciation.\nAs we see USD/CAD holding near 1.3760, we are caught between two opposing forces. The recent US ISM manufacturing data from December 2025 showed a faster contraction, which should weaken the US dollar. However, the Canadian dollar is facing significant pressure from geopolitical events that are impacting oil prices.\nThe major development remains the new access to Venezuelan crude reserves, which continues to weigh on the oil market. WTI crude has already fallen over 9% since the mid-December 2025 highs, now trading near $68 a barrel, as the new interim government in Caracas has announced a target of restoring production to 1.2 million barrels per day by the end of 2026. This structural shift in supply is a powerful headwind for the Canadian dollar.\nFocus on US Nonfarm Payrolls Report\nThis week\u2019s primary focus will be the upcoming US Nonfarm Payrolls report, which could cause a significant move. The consensus forecast for a meager 55,000 jobs, following a downward revision to the November 2025 numbers, suggests the US economy is slowing down considerably. A much weaker-than-expected print could temporarily knock the US dollar lower and send USD/CAD down to test the 1.3700 level."

Spot prices, however, lack follow-through selling and currently trade around the 211.20 area, down just over 0.10% for the day.\nAgainst the backdrop of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish outlook, rising geopolitical tensions benefit the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) amid fears about government intervention and act as a headwind for the GBP/JPY cross. In fact, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Monday that the central bank will continue raising rates if economic and price developments move in line with its forecasts.\nMeanwhile, geopolitical tensions escalated after the US launched land strikes on Venezuela. Adding to this, US President Donald Trump openly signaled that Colombia and Mexico could also face US military action as part of a widening campaign against criminal networks and regional instability. Moreover, the White House said on Tuesday that Trump is discussing options for acquiring Greenland.\nThe JPY bulls, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets amid the uncertainty over the likely timing of the next BoJ rate hike and concerns about Japan's fiscal situation. The British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, draws support from a softer US Dollar (USD) and reduced bets for more aggressive policy easing by the Bank of England (BoE) this year. This, in turn, could support the GBP/JPY cross.\nIn the absence of any relevant market-moving economic releases, the supportive fundamental backdrop backs the case for the emergence of dip-buying at lower levels and warrants caution for bearish traders. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling to confirm that the GBP/JPY cross have topped out in the near-term and positioning for any meaningful corrective slide.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

At the time of writing, the cross is trading around 211.45 after briefly climbing above the 212.00 psychological mark earlier in the Asian session.\nThe economic calendar is light on both sides on Tuesday. In the United Kingdom (UK), weaker Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data added mild pressure on the Sterling after final S&P Global figures showed the Composite PMI easing to 51.4 in December from 52.1 in November. The Services PMI also came in at 51.4, down from 52.1.\nTim Moore, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said that lacklustre growth in UK service-sector activity persisted toward the end of 2025, with the pace of expansion coming in weaker than indicated by the earlier flash estimate for December. He also noted that inflationary pressures across the services economy strengthened, as input costs rose at the fastest pace in seven months and output charge inflation rebounded from November\u2019s recent low, despite a subdued demand environment.\nFor the Bank of England (BoE), softer activity supports a more cautious growth outlook, but sticky services inflation suggests policymakers may remain reluctant to ease policy too quickly. This fits with guidance from the December meeting, where officials signalled that Bank Rate is likely to continue on a gradual downward path.\nBy contrast, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is moving along a tightening path toward policy normalisation, with market expectations building around roughly 50 basis points (bps) of rate hikes through 2026.\nEven so, the broader GBP/JPY bias has stayed tilted to the upside, as investors continue to favour the Pound over the Yen amid the still-wide interest-rate differential between the UK and Japan."

According to the filing, the trusts would be designed to track the price of bitcoin, net of accrued fees and expenses. Both trusts would be sponsored directly by Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\nThis isn\u2019t Morgan Stanley\u2019s first foray into cryptocurrency. In October, the firm expanded crypto investing to all client accounts, including retirement plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Morgan Stanley previously only offered crypto investing to clients in taxable brokerage accounts with aggressive risk tolerances and who held over $1.5 million in assets.\nNow, Morgan Stanley\u2019s filing is the newest in a string of asset managers who have deepened their standing in cryptocurrency.\nFirms including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, and others have all embraced crypto investments in the past months to years, as regulation on the digital assets eases up. President Donald Trump, a proponent of alternative funds, has been a staunch supporter of incorporating cryptocurrencies in retirement investments throughout his term.\nHis keenness for crypto has cleared the way for federal agencies to reduce regulation surrounding the investments. In May, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) announced that it would rescind a 2022 compliance release that formerly discouraged fiduciaries from including crypto options in retirement plans, adding that previous guidance was an \u201coverreach\u201d by the Biden Administration.\nLater in July, Trump signed The Guide and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS), intended to expand the usage of stablecoins, a cryptocurrency tied to the value of other currencies like the U.S. dollar.\nDespite the push, retirement plan advisors and plan sponsors remain skeptical of utilizing crypto investments in retirement funds, with many hesitant and leery of the funds\u2019 volatile nature and future regulatory uncertainty.\nAmanda Umpierrez is the Managing Editor of 401(k) Specialist magazine.

Much of that growth has flowed into bitcoin-only products from firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s entry signals a shift by large banks from distributing third-party crypto products toward issuing their own.\nUntil recently, U.S. banks largely limited their role to custody and brokerage services, citing regulatory uncertainty and risk controls. That stance has begun to change as federal agencies clarified how banks can engage with digital assets.\nIn December, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said banks may act as intermediaries for crypto transactions, narrowing the divide between traditional finance and digital markets. The SEC has also adjusted listing standards for spot crypto ETFs, smoothing the approval path for new issuers.\nMorgan Stanley steps deeper into bitcoin\nThe proposed bitcoin trust would be sponsored by Morgan Stanley Investment Management. Shares would be created and redeemed in large blocks by authorized participants, either in cash or in kind.\nThe fund\u2019s net asset value would be calculated daily using a pricing benchmark based on activity across major spot bitcoin exchanges. Retail investors would trade shares on a secondary market through standard brokerage accounts.\nFor Morgan Stanley, the filing builds on steps taken last year to expand crypto access across its wealth management business. In October, the bank widened eligibility for crypto investments to include all clients and account types.\nBy offering a proprietary bitcoin ETF, the firm can integrate the product directly into client portfolios and retain management fees that might otherwise go to rival issuers.\nThe move also reflects the economics of the bitcoin ETF market. Spot bitcoin funds have become some of the fastest-growing products in the U.S. ETF industry, with steady inflows even during periods of price volatility. BlackRock\u2019s bitcoin ETF emerged as one of the firm\u2019s top revenue contributors within its first year.\nMorgan Stanley also filed paperwork for a similar fund tied to Solana, but bitcoin remains the core focus of institutional demand. Most assets in U.S. crypto ETFs are concentrated in bitcoin products, while funds linked to other tokens have drawn limited capital."

                "body": "Ethereum\u2019s staking queues have cleared and that changes the ETH trade\nWith queues cleared and staking yields near 3%, the \u201csupply shock\u201d narrative is fading even as Ethereum remains the largest DeFi base layer.\nWhat to know:\n- Ethereum's validator queues have nearly collapsed to zero, indicating episodic rather than persistent staking demand.\n- Staking rewards have compressed to around 3%, limiting incentives for significant changes in staking activity.\n- Ethereum's DeFi TVL remains fragmented, with ecosystems like Solana and Base capturing incremental growth, affecting ETH's value capture.\nEthereum\u2019s staking queues have emptied out and the network can now absorb new validators and exits almost in real time.\nThis means the rush to lock up ETH has faded for now and staking is settling into a steady-state instead of a scarcity trade.\nQueues are simply the time spent to start or stop staking on the Ethereum network, acting as a sentiment gauge and a liquidity gauge.\nIn one sense, the lack of queues is a feature, not a bug, as these are proof Ethereum can handle staking flows without locking up liquidity for weeks.\nAt the same time, staking rewards have compressed toward 3% as total staked ETH grew faster than issuance and fee income, limiting incentives for renewed surges in either direction and leaving queues near zero even as overall staking participation remains elevated.\nLower yield can reflect crowding, but also a higher \u2018trust premium\u2019 \u2014 more ETH is choosing to sit in staking rather than on exchange order books.\nWhat this means in plain terms is that \u201cstaking pressure\u201d is no longer a daily narrative.\nWhen queues are long, ETH supply is effectively being locked faster than the network can onboard validators, and that can create a sense of scarcity.\nWhen queues sit near zero, the system is closer to neutral. People can stake or unstake without waiting weeks, which makes staking feel less like a one-way door and more like a liquid allocation.\nThis changes the psychology around the ether trade.\nStaking still reduces immediate sell pressure, but it is not the same as coins being stuck. With withdrawals functioning smoothly, ETH behaves less like a forced lockup asset and more like a yield-bearing position that can be resized when sentiment shifts.\nOverall, Ethereum's staking supply is at around 30%, well below the 50% that Galaxy Digital predicted at the end of 2025. Expectations Galaxy had that ETH would sustain prices above $5,500 thanks to staking-induced supply shock, and that layer-2s would overtake layer-1s in economic activity, failed to materialize.\nETH all-time highs could be a while away\nEthereum\u2019s DeFi TVL sits around $74 billion, well below its roughly $106 billion peak in 2021, even as daily active addresses have nearly doubled over the same period, according to DeFi Llama.\nThe network still accounts for close to 58% of total DeFi TVL, but that share masks a more fragmented reality.\nIncremental growth is increasingly being captured by ecosystems such as Solana, Base, and bitcoin-native DeFi, allowing activity to expand across the Ethereum orbit without translating into the same concentration of value or demand for ETH itself.\nThat fragmentation matters because Ethereum\u2019s strongest bull arguments used to be simple. More usage meant more fees, more burns, and more structural pressure on supply.\nThe 2021 TVL peak was also a leverage era; a lower TVL today doesn\u2019t necessarily mean less usage, just less froth.\nIn the current regime, however, a meaningful chunk of user activity can happen on layer-2 networks where fees are cheaper and experience is smoother, but the value capture that accrues back to ETH can be less obvious to spot markets at the moment.\n\"One way to frame it is that Ethereum has lost directional clarity,\" shared DNTV Research founder Bradley Park in a note to CoinDesk. \"If ETH is treated primarily as a trust asset to be staked rather than actively used, it weakens the burn mechanism: less ETH gets burned,"

                "body": "Ethereum Goes Eco: How the Merge Has Improved Sustainability\nFew people would suggest that the advent of blockchain technology was anything less than revolutionary. Blockchain networks have followed this path and continue to reshape finance, investment, and applications. They also affect areas such as digital identification, supply chain logistics, and art verification. These changes have influenced the market's value. For instance, the Bitcoin price USD, $92,567 at the time of writing, fluctuates as blockchain networks evolve. More investors are recognizing how Ethereum's sustainability progress could influence broader market trends and adoption in other sectors.\nThe reasons for this change are rather well-known. Blockchain is no different from other industries that are trying to evolve while using less energy. To cut down on energy use, Ethereum has recently switched from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus method to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) one.\nThese ongoing developments, along with the goal of greater energy efficiency, have made the Ethereum blockchain network\u2014and, by implication, digital assets\u2014more appealing to investors. Markets have reacted in a way that shows how blockchain innovation is still having an effect.\nPoW to PoS: Understanding the Transition\nThe move to a PoS consensus mechanism has helped to solidify Ethereum as an energy-friendly blockchain network. No longer reliant on the mining hardware necessary for PoW validation, some estimates point to a massive reduction in energy consumption. This \u201clong-awaited revamp, which is known as \u2018The Merge,\u2019 will reduce Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by nearly 99.95%.\u201d\nThese estimates proved to be accurate as Ethereum\u2019s carbon footprint was reported to be reduced following the 2022 Merge. Rather than relying on the labor-intensive computational process, users seemed to appreciate the shift towards sustainability. Through the PoS mechanism, validators may create new blocks, with bad actors being promptly punished for any attempts to cheat the system.\nBy making any malicious actions so financially draining, the shift to a PoS consensus mechanism helps to add a layer of security, too. Bad actors may see their tokens revoked or \u201cslashed,\u201d helping to ensure ethical validations.\nImpacts on Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\nEthereum has long served as the underlying blockchain network for wide swaths of the DeFi ecosystem. Any changes to Ethereum, or in this case, considerable upgrades, are bound to impact the DeFi applications relying on the network.\nThe upgraded network has served to enhance transaction speeds while driving down the cost of gas fees. At a time when many are paying more for less, Ethereum has managed to do the opposite, resulting in greater access for both blockchain newcomers and long-time network fans.\nEnergy Efficiency and Environmental Concerns\nAs many industries turn towards sustainability, Ethereum is poised to lead the way. Ethereum\u2019s shift towards a more energy-conscious model demonstrates how blockchain networks can follow suit in reducing their consumption.\nThis leadership has helped Ethereum distinguish itself to newer and more environmentally conscious investors, too. Many skeptics have rightfully noted the outsized impact and sizable carbon footprint that the digital world has made in a relatively short time. These eco-conscious moves from Ethereum have helped make the network a more attractive investment option for some. Ethereum\u2019s evolution in turn has made waves across the cryptocurrency markets.\nSecurity and Network Decentralization\nThe PoS mechanism is hailed as secure in part due to its ability to punish bad actors. A few years after the Merge, Ethereum can offer the data necessary to support that claim. Since the 2022 Merge, Ethereum has been able to effectively defend against consensus-level attacks. Furthermore, the network has maintained strong network uptime since the Merge, supported by its slashing deterrents.\nMoreover, the PoS move has helped to"

The token is down 13% this year\u2014sliding from $2.09 at the start of the year to $1.88\u2014even after Ripple beat the SEC and XRP ETF inflows topped $1 billion. While XRP's (CRYPTO: XRP) 2025 performance outperformed Bitcoin (-18%) and Ethereum (-27%), the decline confused investors who expected gains from regulatory clarity and institutional validation.\nWhy did XRP fall despite major breakthroughs? Three factors explain the disconnect: macro headwinds overwhelming crypto markets, aggressive profit-taking after the $125 million SEC settlement, and stiff competition from faster blockchains. XRP's 2025 proved regulatory wins don't guarantee price gains in bear markets\u2014but 2026 could tell a different story.\nXRP 2025 Price Performance: From $2.09 to $3.40 Down to $1.88\nXRP's 2025 performance trajectory started with sky-high expectations. After ending 2024 around $0.50, pent-up demand and hopes for a U.S. spot XRP ETF approval fueled a massive rally. The token opened at roughly $2.09 in January 2025 and surged more than 60% to a 2025 peak above $3.40 in July\u2014with some intraday prints touching $3.65. By late July, XRP had gained over 580% from its bear-market lows.\nBut the rally didn't last. As macroeconomic headwinds grew and traders took profits, the XRP price decline accelerated steadily through autumn. Prices held around $2.15 in September, but the market broke lower when President Donald Trump's October tariff announcements triggered a broader flight from risk. By late November, the XRP price decline from its July highs reached roughly 40% and the token traded around $2.05. XRP now trades around $1.88, down about 13% in 2025.\nWhile negative returns disappointed investors expecting gains from Ripple\u2019s regulatory clarity and ETF launches, the XRP 2025 performance held up relatively well compared to the broader crypto market. Bitcoin and Ethereum suffered deeper losses as macro conditions deteriorated. XRP's 13% decline beat both major cryptocurrencies, showing resilience even as fundamental wins failed to produce the expected price appreciation.\nWhy XRP's SEC Settlement Failed to Boost Price in 2025\nA central narrative in XRP's 2025 performance was Ripple's lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In August 2025, the case ended when a federal judge approved a $125 million SEC settlement after both parties dismissed their appeals. The court affirmed that selling XRP on public exchanges does not constitute a securities sale, providing long-sought Ripple regulatory clarity. Many exchanges relisted the token, and bulls expected the price to surge.\nThe SEC settlement became a classic case of \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\" Investors who accumulated XRP expecting a favorable ruling took profits once it arrived. New buyers stayed away because macro conditions remained shaky. The SEC settlement resolved regulatory risk while leaving fundamental issues untouched\u2014competition from faster blockchains and slowing network usage remained.\nThe XRP price decline continued steadily after the court de"

This institutional-grade integration enables XRP holders to access Solana's decentralized exchanges, lending markets and yield protocols while maintaining 1:1 redemption rights to native XRP.\nKey Takeaways\n- Wrapped XRP (wXRP) is a custody-backed version of native XRP that operates on Solana and other supported blockchains.\n- Practical applications of wXRP span multiple DeFi categories, each unlocking different forms of utility\n- Wrapped assets introduce counterparty dependencies. In this case, reliance on Hex Trust's custody operations and LayerZero's cross-chain messaging.\nHex Trust and LayerZero have officially launched wrapped XRP (wXRP) on Solana. This move marks XRP's evolution from a payment-focused asset into a multi-chain DeFi participant, backed by institutional custody and positioned to tap into Solana's impressive transaction throughput and liquidity infrastructure.\nThis deployment connects XRP's proven reliability and market liquidity with Solana's high-performance architecture, which consistently processes over 30 million daily transactions with sub-second finality. It enjoyed more than $100 million in initial liquidity across leading Solana protocols.\nWhat is Wrapped XRP and why Solana?\nWrapped XRP (wXRP) is a custody-backed version of native XRP that operates on Solana (and other supported blockchains), with each token maintaining a 1:1 backing with XRP held in regulated custody by Hex Trust, a digital asset custodian. This structure ensures that every wXRP in circulation corresponds to real XRP reserves, with full redemption rights available 24/7 through authorized merchants who handle the compliance side.\nThe technical implementation relies on two critical infrastructure components. LayerZero provides the cross-chain messaging layer through its Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard, which processed over 85 million cross-chain messages throughout 2025. This protocol avoids many risks associated with traditional bridge designs, which is a crucial consideration given that bridges historically account for over 50% of major cross-chain exploits.\nHex Trust handles the custody and issuance process. When users deposit XRP, Hex Trust mints an equivalent amount of wXRP, and upon redemption, the wXRP gets burned and the native XRP returns to the holder. This mint-and-burn mechanism maintains supply integrity across chains while ensuring regulatory compliance.\nThe choice of Solana as the initial deployment chain appears to make sense. Solana's total value locked stands at circa $5.7 billion with 24-hour DEX volumes exceeding $3.9 billion, in stark contrast to XRP Ledger's $6.78 million in DEX volume. In other words, there\u2019s a massive liquidity advantage gained by wXRP by bridging into Solana's ecosystem.\nSolana's infrastructure offers several specific advantages that align with XRP's expansion goals:\n- Throughput and speed \u2013 Solana frequently exceeds 50,000 transactions per second with minimal transaction fees, enabling high-frequency trading and real time liquidity operations that would be too expensive on many other networks. This performance attracted over 2,500 monthly active developers and spawned more than 500 DeFi protocols by late 2025.\n- Liquidity depth \u2013 Solana's DEX ecosystem processed over $40 billion in monthly volume during Q4 2025, while the network's lending markets held approximately $1.4 billion in borrowed value. These established liquidity pools allow wXRP to integrate into functioning markets from day one rather than requiring lengthy bootstrapping periods.\n- Ecosystem vitality \u2013 Solana hosts over 15 million active wallets, and the network's total value locked expanded 320% year-over-year through late 2025.\nAt the Solana Breakpoint 2025 conf"

With just $1.7 billion in assets, it's small enough to fly under the radar, yet its 24-year track record and roughly 4% dividend yield have kept it quietly relevant. The ETF recently trades around $99, up 3% year-to-date through mid-December, significantly trailing the broader market's double-digit gains. For income-focused investors, 2026 could mark a turning point if the Federal Reserve continues its rate-cutting cycle.\nThis infographic provides a concise overview of the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR), detailing its operational mechanics, most suitable use cases, and a balanced perspective of its pros and cons for potential investors.\nThe Rate Catalyst That Could Reshape REIT Valuations\nInterest rates are the single most important macro variable for RWR heading into 2026. Goldman Sachs Research (NYSE:GS) forecasts the Fed will deliver two more rate cuts next year, bringing the federal funds rate down to 3% to 3.25% from the current 3.75% to 4% range. Lower rates create a double benefit for REITs: they reduce borrowing costs for property acquisitions and development, directly improving cash flows, and make REIT dividend yields more attractive relative to Treasury bonds, potentially driving capital into the sector.\nMonitor the Fed's quarterly Summary of Economic Projections and post-meeting statements, typically released eight times per year following FOMC meetings. Pay particular attention to the dot plot, which shows individual policymakers' rate expectations. Any acceleration in cuts beyond Goldman's forecast could provide meaningful upside for RWR, while a pause or reversal would likely pressure share prices.\nAdvertisement\nWhat's Inside: Quality Holdings With Valuation Questions\nRWR's top two holdings reveal the micro-level dynamics at play. Welltower Inc (NYSE:WELL), the healthcare REIT comprising 11.5% of the portfolio, trades at 131x trailing earnings despite a 44% year-over-year decline in quarterly earnings. That premium valuation reflects investor optimism about aging demographics driving demand for senior housing, but leaves little room for disappointment. Meanwhile, Prologis Inc (NYSE:PLD), the industrial logistics giant at 11% of assets, trades at a more reasonable 37x earnings with superior profit margins of 35%.\nThe dividend mechanics matter here. RWR's quarterly distributions fluctuate significantly, ranging from $0.61 to $0.99 per share in 2025 alone. This variability stems from the underlying REITs' own distribution schedules and amounts. Review RWR's quarterly fact sheet on State Street's website, typically updated within days of quarter-end, to track distribution trends and any shifts in sector allocations among the fund's diversified mix of healthcare, industrial, data center, and residential properties.\nA Larger Alternative With Lower Costs\nThe iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:USRT) offers a compelling comparison. With $3.3 billion in assets and an expense ratio of just 0.08% compared to RWR's 0.25%, USRT provides similar broad REIT exposure at one-third the cost. It holds nearly identical top positions, including Welltower and Prologis, but with slightly different weightings. The larger asset base also means tighter bid-ask spreads and better liquidity for investors trading larger positions.\nIf the Fed delivers on rate cuts and REIT fu"

                "url": "https://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/article/marketminute-2026-1-6-dow-jones-hits-historic-49000-milestone-the-blue-chip-renaissance-ignites-wall-street-in-2026",
                "body": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shattered records on Tuesday, January 6, 2026, crossing the psychological 49,000 threshold for the first time in history. This milestone marks a blistering start to the new year, driven by a powerful rotation into \"old economy\" sectors and a surge in energy and industrial stocks. As of midday trading, the blue-chip index hovered just above the 49,100 mark, signaling a robust \"Blue-Chip Renaissance\" that has analysts recalibrating their year-end targets for the 130-year-old benchmark.\nThe ascent to 49,000 represents more than just a numerical achievement; it reflects a fundamental shift in market leadership. While the previous two years were dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven\" and pure-play AI semiconductor firms, the current rally is characterized by a broadening market. Investors are increasingly betting on traditional industrial titans and financial giants that have successfully integrated \"Agentic AI\" to drive margin expansion, coupled with a stabilizing interest rate environment that has revitalized the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) landscape.\nThe Road to 49,000: Geopolitics and the \"Agentic AI\" Pivot\nThe final push over the 49,000 line was catalyzed by an unexpected geopolitical shift over the first weekend of 2026. What traders are calling the \"Venezuela Shock\"\u2014reports of a major leadership transition in Caracas\u2014ignited a massive rally in the energy sector. Investors moved quickly to price in a future where Western energy majors might regain access to the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves. This sent shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX) up more than 5% in a single session, providing the heavy-weighted momentum necessary to lift the price-weighted index to its new heights.\nThis milestone is the culmination of a two-year \"melt-up\" that began in earnest during the second half of 2024. After crossing 40,000 in May 2024, the Dow navigated a series of structural changes, including the high-profile addition of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to the index. These moves modernized the Dow\u2019s composition, allowing it to capture the growth of the cloud and AI hardware sectors. However, the 2025-2026 leg of the rally has been fueled by the \"AI Adopters\"\u2014companies like Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON)\u2014which have moved beyond the hype of 2024 to demonstrate tangible productivity gains through autonomous supply chains and AI-optimized manufacturing.\nThe timeline leading to this moment was punctuated by over 50 record closes in 2025 alone. Following the Federal Reserve\u2019s pivot to a \"neutral\" rate stance in late 2025, the Dow accelerated past the 45,000 mark in December, setting the stage for the current January surge. The market sentiment on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange today is one of cautious exuberance, as the \"soft landing\" narrative of 2024 has officially transformed into a \"sustained expansion\" narrative for 2026.\nWinners and Losers: The Industrial Surge vs. Big Tech Fatigue\nThe primary beneficiaries of the 49,000 milestone are the industrial and financial heavyweights that anchor the Dow. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) has emerged as a clear winner, with its stock price buoyed by a resurgence in investment banking activity. As interest rates settled into a range of 3.50%\u20133.75%, the dormant M&A market of the previous years has roared back to life, directly padding the bottom line of Wall Street's premier dealmakers. Similarly, UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) has seen a dramatic recovery from its 2025 lows, as AI-driven claims processing and stabilized medical cost inflation restored investor confidence in the healthcare giant.\nConversely, the \"Big Tech\" components of the Dow are facing a different set of challenges. While Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) remains a cornerstone of the index, trading near $490, it has begun to experience \"CapEx fatigue.\" Investors are now scrutinizing the massive capital expenditures required to maintain AI infrastructure, leading to a perio"

The Dow added 484.90 points, or 1%, to 49,462.08; the S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 6,944.82 and the Nasdaq climbed 0.6% to 23,547.17. AP News\nFor investors, the round-number break puts immediate focus on whether the index can hold those levels and make a run at 50,000. With earnings season nearing, traders are looking for proof that the latest rally has enough follow-through to survive the next wave of data and guidance.\nThe Dow is up about 2.9% so far in 2026, outpacing the Nasdaq\u2019s roughly 1.3% gain. Markets have swung on shifting views of interest rates, with labor readings seen as the quickest route to a clearer path for Federal Reserve policy.\nChip and healthcare stocks led Tuesday\u2019s advance, with Moderna up nearly 11% after BofA Global Research raised its price target. The PHLX semiconductor index, a widely watched gauge of chipmakers, hit an all-time high, and a strategist flagged the earnings backdrop: Jed Ellerbroek, a portfolio manager at Argent Capital, said he expects \u201ca very strong earnings season for Big Tech\u201d and higher capex \u2014 short for capital spending \u2014 tied to AI demand. Reuters\nData-storage names led the biggest gains: Sandisk, Western Digital and Seagate surged 28%, 17% and 14%, respectively. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices fell on the day after their chief executives spoke at CES \u2014 the Consumer Electronics Show \u2014 in Las Vegas and outlined new AI chips and related developments. Investopedia\nAMD\u2019s presence at CES underscored the competitive push behind the AI buildout. CEO Lisa Su previewed the MI500 line and said it would deliver 1,000 times the performance of an older version, with chips expected to launch in 2027, while Nvidia has touted its Vera Rubin platform and said it is in full production ahead of a debut later this year. Reuters\nThe Dow\u2019s record run gathered steam on Monday, when energy and bank stocks jumped after a U.S. military strike captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, lifting oil-linked names. \u201cEnergy stocks are really benefiting,\u201d said Rob Haworth of U.S. Bank Wealth Management; markets were pricing in about 60 basis points of Fed easing for 2026, according to LSEG data \u2014 a basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Reuters\nBut fresh highs leave little room for disappointment. A strong payrolls reading or firmer Fed rhetoric could pressure rate-cut expectations and weigh on equities, while elevated valuations make earnings guidance a sharper trigger for pullbacks.\nNext up: the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Wednesday, Jan. 7 at 10:00 a.m. ET, followed by the U.S. employment report for December on Friday, Jan. 9 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

                "body": "The FTSE 100, the index of the leading companies by market capitalisation in the United Kingdom, has made new records at the start of the year 2026, which is a good indication of the continuation of the boom of the previous year, as well as evidence of a high level of investor confidence in the financial markets of London.\nAccording to data from TradingEconomics, the index moved above the 10,000-point mark on 6 January, after extensive gains in commodity, defence and retail equities.\nHistoric Heights: What Happened?\nEarly trading has also seen the FTSE 100 reach an all-time high of more than 10,000 points, the first time it has broken the symbolic 10,000 mark by more than one session since its inception in the 1980s.\nThis milestone followed a very memorable 2025, in which the index recorded its most successful annual performance since 2009, increasing by over 20 per cent and ranking it ahead of most of its contemporaries worldwide.\nMarket commentators largely credit this development to a blend of sector leadership, global equity movement, and macroeconomic prospects, which are the key drivers.\nWhat is Propelling the Surge?\n- Good Corporate Earnings and Upgrades\nNext plc's positive trading update was one of the most direct catalysts at the start of 2026, driving its share price higher and improving market sentiment. This high street retailer raised its profit expectations after a strong Christmas trade, with analysts reporting that sales were higher than expected. Next's performance has been cited as one of the key factors driving the FTSE's progress in the Monday session.\nGood retail stores like this one show that consumer-driven companies managed to create tremendous trading momentum even amid the overall economic uncertainty.\n- Sectoral Momentum, Energy, Defence and Commodities.\nThe demand has not been restricted to the retail sector. Reuters states that profits in energy and defence stocks have contributed the most towards record highs in the FTSE. Rising crude oil prices have driven the gains of oil majors like Shell and BP, whereas buyers in defence contractors have made significant purchases in response to geopolitical events.\nEquity mining has also strengthened the rally, as the ongoing demand for raw materials globally has continued to drive share prices and investor appetite. This aligns with the general market analysis, which points to mining and metals as among the best in the FTSE by the end of 2025.\n- Global Market Momentum\nThe strength of the London market is also a reflection of an extended rise in global equities, with US and European indices at record or near-record highs alongside the FTSE. Live reporting by The Guardian has noted that the worldwide rallies on the eve of the New Year boosted confidence in markets.\nThe investors are spreading their risk appetite across international markets, including the United Kingdom, despite the variability in economic fundamentals. As an example, technology earnings and positive macro data have helped support overall market momentum, with major US indices being substantial investments.\n- Wage and Salary Expectations and Valuations\nThe market members are also responding to the anticipation of monetary easing. The end of inflationary pressures in some regions of the developed world is an opportunity that central banks, such as the Bank of England, are expected to consider interest-rate reductions or even to keep policy easy, as a positive breeze behind equities relative to fixed-income securities.\nThe FTSE, with its extensive coverage of the sector and relatively high valuations, is another reason given by investors that has seen capital flow, and mostly more so than expensive technology stocks found in the US. The stocks that are in other indexes today.\n- Safe Haven and Defensive Rotation\nIn the atmosphere of geopolitical uncertainty, with military action in Venezuela affecting oil supply expectations, some funds have shifted to more defensive areas, such as the dominance "

We examine why this liquidity burst matters, how it connects to DAX flows, and what it means for short-term traders and longer-term holders.\nPre-market volume spike: EXIC.F stock price action\nThe immediate fact is a volume surge in pre-market trading on XETRA. EXIC.F stock opened at \u20ac4.92 and hit a pre-market high of \u20ac4.98. The 50,000 shares traded compare with an average daily volume of 161. That makes the current trade interest roughly 310.56x typical activity. High relative volume often precedes stronger intraday moves and signals institutional attention or rebalancing ahead of the cash open. Traders should note the day low \u20ac4.92 and day high \u20ac4.98 as early support and resistance levels.\nWhat the quoting and fundamentals say about EXIC.F stock\nEXIC.F stock tracks the 30 largest German Prime Standard companies on XETRA. The ETF shows a market cap of \u20ac6,578,518,013.00 and current price \u20ac4.98. Key metrics: EPS \u20ac0.34, PE 14.70, dividend yield 2.40% and shares outstanding 1,321,518,283.00. The 50-day average price is \u20ac6.02 and the 200-day average is \u20ac5.66. Year high is \u20ac6.41 and year low is \u20ac4.92. These fundamentals imply the ETF offers income plus broad German large-cap exposure, with valuation nearer mid-cycle levels.\nTechnical and Meyka grade review of EXIC.F stock\nTechnically, price sits below the 50-day average and around the 200-day mean. That gives mixed momentum signals for quick traders. Meyka AI rates EXIC.F with a score of 68.46 out of 100 | Grade: B | Suggestion: HOLD. This grade factors in S&P 500 benchmark comparison, sector performance, financial growth, key metrics, and analyst consensus. The grade is informational only and not financial advice. For trading, watch a confirmed break above \u20ac5.66 for bullish follow-through.\nMarket context and sector implications for EXIC.F stock\nThe ETF sits in the Financial Services sector as a fund vehicle but tracks DAX constituents across sectors. Germany and XETRA trade dynamics matter. The wider Financial Services sector YTD performance is 9.39%, while Technology and Industrials have driven DAX swings recently. A volume spike in EXIC.F stock can indicate reallocations into German large caps after global rotation. Investors should watch macro headlines and DAX futures at the open for confirmation.\nTrading implications and strategy for EXIC.F stock\nWith a strong pre-market volume signal, short-term traders can use tight stop-losses. Entry near \u20ac4.95\u2013\u20ac5.10 targets a first resistance at \u20ac5.66 and a second at the year high \u20ac6.41. Conservative investors may treat EXIC.F stock as a core DAX exposure and focus on dividend yield 2.40% and cost efficiency. Liquidity is typically high on XETRA during normal hours, but pre-market spikes require caution on spreads and execution.\nNews, data sources and next catalysts for EXIC.F stock\nThere is no single earnings announcement for this ETF. Watch DAX constituent reports and macro releases for new catalysts. For broader ETF news, see coverage on major outlets such as Yahoo Finance and Investing.com. Monitor DAX rebalancing, German CPI, and ECB commentary as likely near-term drivers for EXIC.F stock.\nFinal Thoughts\nKey takeaways: EXIC.F stock is trading at \u20ac4.98 on XETRA on 07 Jan 2026 with a pre-market volume spike of 50,000 shares. That represents a relative volume of 310.56x and signals rotation interest into German large caps. Short-term technical resistance sits at \u20ac5.66 and \u20ac6.41. Meyka AI\u2019s forecast model projects a one-year price of \u20ac10.18, implying an upside of 104.52% versus the current price \u20ac4.98. Meyka AI\u2019s projections are model-based and not guarantees. The Meyka grade for EXIC.F is B (68.46) with a HOLD suggestion. T"

Destatis\u2019 preliminary numbers showed headline inflation cooled to 1.8% in December 2025 from 2.3%, while core inflation eased to 2.4% from 2.7% \u2013 both softer than expected. That keeps the ECB\u2019s \u201crate cut\u201d conversation alive, even if analysts like ING see inflation drifting back up later in 2026. But growth looked shakier: the final S&P Global/HCOB composite PMI slipped to 51.3 from 52.4, meaning activity is still expanding, just more..\nslowly. Put together, it\u2019s the classic dilemma \u2013 easing price pressure, but fading momentum.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Disinflation is good news until earnings start to wobble.\nA 1.8% inflation print gives policymakers more room to avoid overtightening, which usually supports bonds and rate-sensitive stocks. But softer PMIs often show up next in company guidance \u2013 especially for cyclical industries tied to manufacturing, transport, and capital spending. If demand keeps cooling, investors may pay up for firms with steadier cash flows and clearer pricing power.\nZooming out: Single stock moves can be a reminder that narratives shift fast.\nadidas fell 3.83% after BofA double-downgraded it to underperform and cut its price target to \u20ac160 from \u20ac213. The bank pointed to slower late-2025 sales growth, less cost leverage, and a tougher road to a double-digit EBIT margin. Even when inflation is easing, equity stories still live or die on whether growth is accelerating or merely settling into something softer.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

ALTS stock shows heavy volume at 8,258,075.00 shares traded versus a 50-day average of 4,525,429.00, signaling heightened interest. Investors will watch revenue and guidance after a mixed August 12, 2025 print where revenue beat but EPS missed. This earnings spotlight explains the key metrics, Meyka AI grade, and price forecasts to use for trading and risk planning.\nEarnings context and recent results for ALTS stock\nThe last reported quarter (Aug 12, 2025) delivered revenue $6,378,000.00 versus estimates $5,900,000.00, but EPS missed at -0.49 versus estimate -0.13. That mixed result explains why ALTS stock is volatile ahead of the Jan 07, 2026 report. The company now reports after the close on Jan 07, 2026 on NASDAQ in the United States.\nPrice action and market signals for ALTS stock\nALT5 Sigma (ALTS) opened $1.31 and traded between $1.29 and $1.55 intraday, with market cap at $185,071,794.00. Technicals show RSI 33.38 and CCI -105.79, indicating near-oversold conditions that traders may see as a short-term entry. Volume of 8,258,075.00 versus average 4,525,429.00 raises the odds of larger intraday swings.\nFundamentals and valuation in ALTS analysis\nALT5 Sigma reports trailing EPS -0.94 and a negative PE -1.61, while price-to-book sits at 0.86, reflecting a low book valuation relative to price. Revenue per share TTM is 1.20 and cash per share TTM is 0.52, but free cash flow per share is negative -0.24. The company operates in Technology, Software \u2013 Application, and faces growth and profitability challenges.\nMeyka AI grade and model for ALTS stock\nMeyka AI rates ALTS with a score out of 100: 75.12 | Grade: B+ | Suggestion: BUY. This grade factors in S&P 500 benchmark comparison, sector performance, financial growth, key metrics, and analyst consensus. Use this grade as one input among financial and risk checks; it is not investment advice.\nCatalysts, risks, and sector context for ALTS stock\nKey catalysts include tomorrow\u2019s earnings and any update on ALT5 Prime or ALT5 Pay adoption. Risks include negative margins, long days-sales-outstanding (332.51), low current ratio 0.88, and limited liquidity in normal hours despite today\u2019s spike. The broader Technology sector sentiment and crypto-market moves may amplify ALTS price swings.\nTechnical outlook and practical trading levels for ALTS stock\nShort-term technical support sits near the recent low $1.08 and intraday pivot $1.31; resistance is near the 50-day average $1.73 and the day high $1.55. Traders may watch a break above $1.73 for momentum, or a close below $1.08 for downside confirmation. Volatility indicators ATR 0.16 and Bollinger middle $1.42 suggest expected intraday moves of about $0.16.\nFinal Thoughts\nKey takeaways: ALTS stock trades at $1.51 on NASDAQ in the United States with heavy intraday volume 8,258,075.00 as the market prices in Jan 07, 2026 earnings after the close. Past quarterly data showed revenue strength but EPS weakness, so look for margin commentary and adoption metrics for ALT5 Prime and ALT5 Pay. Meyka AI\u2019s forecast model projects monthly $1.09, implying -27.81% versus the current price; forecasts are model-based projections and not guarantees. For scenario planning, conservative price target $1.80 (upside 19.21%), base target $3.50 (upside 131.13%), and bull target $7.00 (upside 363.58%) capture different outcomes depending on growth signals and guidance. Remember the Meyka AI grade B+ (75.12) flags a BUY suggestion based on multiple metrics, but risks like negative EPS, low current ratio 0.88, and long receivables cycle remain. Use earnings reaction and sector trends to set risk limits and position size, and consult SEC filings and primary sources before acting.

                "body": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Acorn Energy (NASDAQ:ACFN). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. Commendations have to be given in seeing that Acorn Energy grew its EPS from US$0.46 to US$2.66, in one short year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Acorn Energy shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 12% to 20%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\nSince Acorn Energy is no giant, with a market capitalisation of US$48m, you should definitely check its cash and debtbefore getting too excited about its prospects.\nAre Acorn Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nIt's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own Acorn Energy shares worth a considerable sum. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$15m. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. As a percentage, this totals to 31% of the shares on issue for the business, an appreciable amount considering the market cap.\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Acorn Energy, with market caps under US$200m is around US$587k.\nAcorn Energy offered total compensation worth US$334k to its CEO in the year to December 2024. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.\nShould You Add Acorn Energy To Your Watchlist?\nAcorn Energy's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. The sweetener is that insiders have a mountain of stock, and the CEO remuneration is quite reasonable. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Acorn Energy is certainly doing some things right and is well worth investigating. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for Acorn Energy that you should be aware of.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in th"

Her children were with her when she started to journey to the Grand Reunion. She was residing at Bay Harbor of LaCrescent aka Springbrook Village in LaCrescent, MN.\nShe was born on March 18, 1922 to Rudy and Elsie (Boldt) Mark in Mound Prairie Township on South Ridge. She was their third child. Around the age of 3, the family moved to LaCrosse, WI., where she grew up and went to school.\nShe met Edwin J. Schumacher on a blind date arranged by her cousin, Ray Boldt. I was told they went bowling on that date...and bowling was in their lives for many decades. They were married on March 6, 1948. After their marriage they moved to South Ridge and lived with his brother and wife, George and LaVonne, until they purchased the South Ridge General Store in November, 1953 which ran until 1966 when it was closed.\nArlene then went to work at the LaCrescent Nursing Home, in many different areas. Her last position was as Historian and other office tasks. She had tried retiring at 65. That lasted only a couple of months. \u201dYou can only dust so much\u201d so she went back to the Nursing Home and they were thrilled to have her back. She turned in her resignation a couple of times and it was returned unaccepted until the year she turned 80, it was finally granted.\nArlene could always find something to keep her busy. Her mornings began early, so she had quiet time to read her Bible and devotionals. Then when the newspaper arrived with the mail delivery, the crossword puzzle was high on the priority list. Which was worked on while taking a little time out for \u201cThe Price is Right\u201d.\nSome of her other enjoyments were bowling on league, Wednesday nights, at the Shamrock Lanes in LaCrescent until its closing.

                "body": "Wall Street reaches more records on gains by Big Tech\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Broad gains led by technology stocks pushed Wall Street to more records on Tuesday.\nThe gains mirror much of the action from the previous year, when big technology stocks often drove the market to a series of records.\nTechnology stocks led the gains, but several other sectors assisted in the broader market\u2019s advance. Health care companies, retailers and industrial firms broadly gained ground. Roughly three out of every four stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index rose.\nThe S&P 500 rose 42.77 points, or 0.6%, to 6,944.82, setting a record on just the third trading day of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 484.90 points, or 1%, to 49,462.08, hitting a record for a second-straight day. The Nasdaq composite rose 151.35 points, or 0.6%, to 23,547.17.\nSmall company stocks outpaced their larger counterparts. The Russell 2000 jumped 1.4% and is now just below its record set in December.\nThe most notable action remained in the tech sector. Amazon, which has reach into both retail and technology, surged 3.4%. It is one of the most valuable companies in the world and its outsized stock valuation helped counter losses elsewhere in the market, including a 1.8% loss from Apple.\nMicron Technology surged 10%, also helping to lift the market. Microsoft rose 1.2%\nNvidia, which is often the biggest force behind the market\u2019s direction, wavered throughout the day and finished 0.5% lower.\nSandisk surged 27.6% for the market\u2019s biggest gain. The stock\u2019s value has jumped more than 800% since spinning off from Western Digital last February. The gains have been driven by artificial intelligence and the resulting demand for data-storage hardware. Western Digital rose 16.8%.\nTechnology companies, especially those focused on artificial intelligence, are being closely watched this week during the industry\u2019s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas.\nAI advances helped propel the broader market to a series of records in 2025. Investors will be watching companies for any updates that could shed more light on the big corporate investments in AI technology.\nThe price of benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 2% to $57.13 per barrel, pulling back from sharp gains a day prior when the market reacted to U.S. forces capturing Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a weekend raid. The price of Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.7% to $60.70 per barrel.\nTreasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.16% from 4.15% late Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves more closely with expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, rose to 3.46% from 3.45% late Monday.\nGold prices rose 1% and silver prices rose 5.7%. Such assets are often considered safe havens in times of geopolitical turmoil. The metals have notched record prices over the last year amid lingering economic concerns brought on by conflicts and trade wars.\nMarkets in Europe gained ground.\nOutside of company announcements, Wall Street is preparing for several updates on the U.S. labor market this week, along with reports on the services sector and consumer sentiment. They will help paint a clearer picture of how vital parts of the economy closed out 2025 and the direction they could take in 2026.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. government will release its report on job openings for November. The October report showed that U.S. job openings had barely budged. Weekly unemployment data will be released on Thursday and the broader monthly employment report, for December, will be released on Friday.\nThe Institute for Supply Management will also release its latest services sector update on Wednesday, while the University of Michigan will release its latest consumer sentiment survey Friday. They are both widely monitored because the services sector makes up the bulk of the U.S. economy, and consumer sentiment has been shaky under the weight of higher prices and economic uncertainty.\nThe Fed "
