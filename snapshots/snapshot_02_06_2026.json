Two major central banks held rates unchanged, yet the Bank of England (BoE) signals that further easing is coming. At the time of writing, XAU/USD trades at $4,880, down 1.75%.\nXAU/USD extends losses despite weak US labor data as profit-taking and central bank signals favor the Greenback\nBroad US Dollar strength and traders booking profits sent the precious metals diving for the second consecutive day day. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the BoE maintained the status quo, with the former set to remain on hold, while the latter is poised to reduce rates twice in 2026.\nData in the United States (US) revealed weakness in the labor market. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report for December revealed a low hiring environment. Jobless Claims for the previous week exceeded estimates, while the Challenger Job Cuts for January rose sharply, indicating companies are reducing their workforce.\nGiven the backdrop, Bullion prices should be higher, but the Greenback remains strong for the second straight day.\nRecently, Atlanta Federal Reserve (Fed) President Raphael Bostic said that inflation is too high for too long, and that the Fed is going to do its job well, as it has to think about issues over the long run.\nAside from this, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that whether to sue Kevin Warsh over Fed rates policy is up to US President Trump, and added that he does not favor 0% tariffs on Canada, following their deal with China.\nDaily market movers: US Dollar advances amid soft US jobs data\n- The US Challenger, Gray & Christmas report showed that companies announced 108.435K layoffs in January, marking a 118% increase from a year earlier, while hiring intentions fell by 13%.\n- Initial Jobless Claims released by the Department of Labor rose sharply to 231K in the week ending January 31, missing expectations of 212K.\n- The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for December underscored growing caution among employers, with job openings dropping to 6.542 million from 6.928 million in November, well below forecasts of 7.2 million.\n- Despite this, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the buck\u2019s performance against six currencies, is up 0.11% at 97.75, a headwind for Gold and Silver prices.\n- Contrarily, US Treasury bond yields are plunging. The US 10-year Treasury note yield is dropping six basis points to 4.183% as investors grow confident that the Federal Reserve will ease at least twice in 2025.\n- Money markets ramped up expectations from 50 to 56 basis points of Fed easing towards the year-end, according to Prime Market Terminal data.\n- Easing geopolitical tensions weighed on Gold prices.

                "body": "Gold and Silver Prices Decline Amidst Hawkish Federal Reserve Signals\nGold and silver prices experienced a significant decline following indications from the United States Federal Reserve that it may persist with its aggressive interest rate hikes. This news has unsettled financial markets globally, creating a ripple effect in commodity prices.\nThe Federal Reserve's stance, which leans towards a hawkish approach, suggests that higher interest rates could be on the horizon, as the central bank works to tame inflation. When interest rates rise, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold and silver increases, leading to decreased demand. As a result, many investors have shifted their focus to interest-bearing assets.\nOn the day of the announcement, gold fell sharply, pricing itself down by over 1.5%, while silver too faced losses of approximately 2%. Analysts noted that the expectation of higher interest rates emanating from the Fed's policies is expected to continue affecting these precious metals in the near term.\nMarket experts cited that previous rallies in gold and silver, seen prior to the Fed\u2019s statements, have now been countered by this renewed cautious sentiment among investors.\nInvestor sentiment is now fraught with uncertainty as they grapple with the Fed's potential tightening of monetary policy amidst ongoing economic challenges. A market analyst commented, \"The Fed's direction has created a challenging environment for commodities, and until there\u2019s clarity on economic stability, precious metals may continue to feel the pressure.\"\nAs trading continues, investors are closely monitoring forthcoming economic indicators to gauge the Fed\u2019s future moves and potential impacts on the commodities market. The fluctuations in gold and silver prices illustrate the broader implications of monetary policy decisions and their immediate effects on investment landscapes worldwide."

                "body": "Published on: 2026-02-06\nSilver is trading near $71 after one of the most violent price resets the market has seen in years. Spot silver recently printed a 52-week high of $121.67, and it has since been hit by forced selling, a stronger dollar, and rapid position unwinds that tend to show up first in silver because the market is smaller and less liquid than gold's.\nThe question now is straightforward but not easy: does silver have the fuel to rebound, and can it realistically reclaim $100? The answer depends on two factors that do not always change in unison.\nThe first is the fundamental backdrop, where industrial demand remains structurally essential. The second is the macro and positioning backdrop, where liquidity and leverage can overpower fundamentals for weeks at a time.\nThe speed of the move is the story. Data shows silver reached $121.67 on January 29, 2026, and then fell sharply into early February, including a massive one-day drop on February 5.\nSpot silver: about $71.21/oz (bid)\nRecent peak: about $121/oz\n52-week range (futures reference): $29.115 to $121.785\nThe fall was roughly 35% from the late-January peak to early-February lows, after a run that was already unusually steep.\nThis is important for the $100 debate because a market that has dropped from $120 to $70 doesn't bounce back in a straight line. Typically, it needs to rebuild liquidity, fix its positioning, and establish new support levels before entering the next significant upward movement.\nRegardless, a rise from $71 to $100 is roughly a 41% increase. That is a significant move for most assets, but silver has already demonstrated that it can move that distance quickly in both directions during volatile periods.\nSilver already showed it can trade well above $100 during the late-January spike.\nThe harder question is whether it can reclaim $100 and hold it without needing another speculative squeeze.\nFor that to happen, three conditions usually need to align.\nA market can rally with high volatility, but it rarely holds a new plateau while daily ranges stay extreme. Currently, the volatility backdrop remains elevated.\nIf the dollar stabilizes and yields stop pressuring metals, silver can start to trade its own supply story again. The recent downdraft was closely tied to macro risk rotation and dollar dynamics, suggesting the market is still trading silver like a high-beta macro asset.\nThe Silver Institute data describes a multi-year deficit and record industrial demand.\nPrice tends to respond more durably when the tightness is visible in availability, delivery timing, or sustained investor allocation, not only in annual balance tables.\nA move to $100 requires milestones. Traders often watch these round-number zones because they influence behaviour and stop levels.\n$75 to $80: first recovery zone, where sellers often reappear\n$90: psychological level, often tied to media coverage and momentum\n$100: major headline level, where profit-taking can be aggressive\nThis is not a prediction; instead, it describes how markets frequently behave around significant numbers.\nSilver's smaller market size makes it prone to sharp swings, and investors were reducing risk as money rotated elsewhere.\nThat dynamic is familiar: when margin pressure hits, silver often becomes the \"sell what you can\" metal before it becomes the \"sell what you want\" metal.\nSilver's downdraft also relates to a stronger dollar impulse, which mechanically pressures metals priced in dollars and changes hedging behavior across commodities.\nEven if the long-term case for metals remains intact, a short-term dollar bid can still trigger fast de-risking in futures and leveraged products.\nAdditionally, liquidation selling from China was part of the explanation for the late-week drop, with futures sliding as much as 13% at one point.\nFor example, China's export-related policy headlines and the risk of market fragmentation have contributed to extreme price behavior.\nFinally, the recent surge in gold and silver "

Excluding gold, core inflation remained stable at 2.6% in December, underscoring that underlying price pressures outside the precious metals segment continue to be muted.\n\"The slight upward revision in the inflation outlook is primarily due to increase in prices of precious metals, which contribute about 60-70 basis points,\" the MPC statement by the RBI said.\nExcluding precious metals, the RBI stressed that underlying inflation pressures remain low, with risks evenly balanced and headline inflation still expected to stay near the target over the coming quarters.\nThe central bank expects food inflation to remain under control in the near term, supported by healthy kharif output, adequate foodgrain buffer stocks and favourable rabi sowing. Core inflation, barring potential volatility driven by precious metals prices, is expected to remain range-bound.\nFind Key Takeaways from the RBI MPC 2026-27 here\nHowever, the RBI cautioned that geopolitical uncertainty, energy price volatility and adverse weather events pose upside risks to inflation.

The central bank observed that while crude oil prices tend to be the most sensitive to global shocks, gold has shown a strong upward long-term trend, with notable surges during periods of systemic stress such as the global financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIndia\u2019s exposure to precious metals is amplified by its structural dependence on imports. The country meets the bulk of its gold demand through overseas purchases, making domestic prices sensitive to global price movements and currency fluctuations. A weaker rupee further raises the local cost of gold and silver, feeding into household consumption and investment demand.\nStrong investor interest has also led to rising allocations to gold-linked financial products. Inflows into gold exchange-traded funds have surged in recent years, reflecting growing demand for hedging against inflation, currency depreciation and global uncertainty. Analysts expect this trend to continue as long as macroeconomic risks remain elevated.\nIndia remains one of the world\u2019s largest consumers of gold, driven by cultural preferences, investment demand and its role as a store of value. With households holding a significant stock of gold and imports accounting for a large share of domestic supply, movements in precious metals prices have a more direct bearing on inflation dynamics than in many other economies.\nThe latest Economic Survey has also flagged that gold and silver prices are likely to remain elevated unless geopolitical tensions ease and trade-related uncertainties subside. Against this backdrop, the RBI\u2019s decision to explicitly factor precious metals into its inflation assessment reflect"

The major currency pair attracts slight bids as the US Dollar ticks down amid an improvement in speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could cut interest rates in the March policy meeting\nAs of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades 0.1% lower to near 97.85. Still the DXY is close to its weekly high of 97.98 posted on Thursday.\nThe odds of the Fed reducing interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.25%-3.50% in the March policy meeting have increased to 22.7% from 9.4% seen on Wednesday, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nFed dovish projections have accelerated, following the release of job market-related economic data this week, which pointed to soft labor demand. The US JOLTS Job Openings data for December showed on Thursday that employers posted 6.542 million fresh jobs, significantly lower than estimates of 7.2 million and the previous reading of 6.928 million.\nOn Wednesday, the ADP reported that the private sector created 22K jobs in January, lower than 37K in December.\nMeanwhile, the Euro (EUR) is broadly under pressure even as the European Central Bank (ECB) has shrugged off the recent dip in the Eurozone inflation in the policy meeting on Thursday, where it left interest rates steady, as expected. In the updated assessment, the ECB reconfirmed that inflation should stabilise at its 2% target in the medium term and warned of an uncertain geopolitical environment.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial in"

                "body": "3 reasons why Bitcoin is falling\nGBP/USD Falls to 1.36 Ahead of the BoE Rate Decision\nThe Bank of England will deliver its first monetary policy decision of 2026 at midday today. Expectations are that the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged at 3.75% after cutting rates by 25 basis points at the December meeting.\nThe December rate count was a narrow vote of five to four. Highlighting how finely balanced the debate about further rate cuts has become. The message from policymakers was still cautiously dovish, with a gradual downward path for rates, meaning that further cuts would be harder to justify as policy moves closer to neutral.\nGrowth momentum is showing signs of fading, with the economy expected to flatline in Q4. The central bank expects inflation to return to the 2% target by spring, despite CPI rising to 3.4% in January.\nThere are signs, however, that the labour market is cooling, with the unemployment rate 5.1% percent. PMI data from yesterday showed that the employment subcomponent fell sharply in January, continuing a trend that began in October 2024, marking the longest period of job shedding in the UK service sector in 16 years.\nFurther weakening in the jobs market would put downward pressure on wage growth and pull service sector inflation lower. Wage growth and service-sector inflation are currently too high for the Bank of England to be comfortable with further rate cuts, or to be consistent with inflation back at 2%.\nThe focus will be on the vote split, which is expected to be 7-2. A more dovish vote could put pressure on the pound. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s comments will be in focus, and dovish commentary would be pound-negative.\nMeanwhile, the US dollar is rising as it nears a 2-week high amid market pricing in a slower pace and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nFederal Reserve governor Lisa Cook emphasised concerns over sticky inflation rather than the cooling labour market, suggesting that she was not supporting a rate cut until there are further signs of inflation easing.\nData yesterday showed the ISM services index remained at 53.8 in January, aligning with the previous month\u2019s figure and exceeding expectations from a client of 53.5. However, prices paid also increased to 66.6 from 65.1, signalling rising inflationary pressures. Attention will now turn to U.S. initial jobless claims, which are expected to rise modestly to 212K, up from 209 K.\nGBP/USD Forecast \u2013 Technical Analysis\nGBP/USD trended higher from 1.30 before running into resistance at 1.3870. GBP/USD rebounded lower from here and is testing support at the 1.36 zone, the round number, horizontal and trendline support.\nA break below here exposes the 200 SMA at 1.3420. A break below 1.3350 creates a lower low, bringing 1.32 into focus.\nShould the support hold, buyers will look to rise above 1.37. A rise above here brings 1.3870 back into play.\nEUR/USD Steadies Around 1.18 Ahead of the ECB Rate Decision\nEUR/USD has fallen back to 1.18 ahead of the ECB rare decision at 13:15 GMT where the central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 2% (deposit rate). The ECB last cut rates in June last year. However, inflation hovering around the 2% target led policymakers to consider monetary policy to be in a good place.\nHowever, this meeting comes after data yesterday showed inflation cooled by more than expected to 1.7% YoY in January, down from 1.9% in December and further from the ECB\u2019s 2% target, reopening the debate over whether the ECB will cut again this year.\nA stronger EUR, - EUR/USD rose to a 4-year high above 1.20 in late January, and cheap Chinese exports, which have flooded the eurozone, exert deflationary pressure and, if this persists, could amplify dovish calls within the ECB.\nGiven that no rate cut is expected, the focus will be on the tone of President Lagarde\u2019s press conference as the near-term catalyst for the EUR.\nA stronger USD and a slightly more dovish ECB could pull EUR/USD back tow"

                "body": "While the market anticipates a \"wait-and-see\" hold, any guidance from President Lagarde on the Euro\u2019s recent breakout will be the primary driver for the pair\u2019s next leg.\nAs the EUR/USD tests the 1.1850\u20131.2000 resistance zone, all eyes are on today\u2019s ECB meeting. Traders are looking for clarity in a situation defined by cooling eurozone inflation and a surge in Euro strength.\nRead our previous article Can Lagarde Push the EUR/USD Higher? (Part 1) to get insights into the eurozone inflation and growth dynamics.\nAfter having gained around 13.50% in 2025, the EUR/USD currency pair surged to a more-than four-year high late in January (up around 4.34% in about a week), hitting levels not seen since April 2021. This rally was primarily driven by a broad-based selloff in the dollar as investors became increasingly concerned about the erosion of institutional norms in the United States.\nPresident Trump\u2019s public desire to acquire Greenland, while seemingly unrelated to monetary policy, contributed to a broader narrative of unpredictability that rattled currency markets. More significantly, Trump\u2019s comments questioning Federal Reserve independence and his administration\u2019s threat to criminally indict Fed Chair Jerome Powell in January weighed on the U.S. Dollar shockwaves through financial markets.\nThe prospect of a less independent Federal Reserve \u2013 one that might set looser monetary policy than economic conditions warrant due to political pressure \u2013 prompted investors to reassess their dollar holdings. If the Fed were to adopt an inappropriately dovish stance under political influence, it would likely lead to higher U.S. inflation, lower real interest rates, and a weaker dollar.\nThe nomination of on January 30, 2026, has acted as a stabilizing force for the U.S. Dollar. Warsh\u2019s reputation as an inflation hawk helped the greenback claw back some of its losses, as markets interpreted the choice as suggesting the Fed\u2019s long-term commitment to price stability might remain intact despite near-term political pressures.\nIn mid-January, the ECB joined other major central banks in a rare display of solidarity with Chair Powell, issuing a collective statement that identified institutional independence as a non-negotiable requirement for price and financial stability. This coordinated defense of autonomy highlighted the global central banking community\u2019s growing alarm regarding political encroachment on monetary policy.\nFor the ECB, the euro\u2019s appreciation presents a complex challenge. On one hand, a stronger currency helps suppress inflation by reducing import costs, particularly for energy. On the other hand, it weakens European export competitiveness at precisely the wrong moment.\nEuropean exporters are already under pressure from cheap Chinese goods pricing their products out of key markets. A significantly stronger euro compounds this problem by making European exports even more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially dampening growth and employment in the eurozone\u2019s export-oriented economies.\nECB policymakers recently expressed increasing worries about the Euro\u2019s strength, fearing that further appreciation could drive inflation even deeper below their 2% target. While this concern briefly sparked speculation of a rate cut, those bets cooled as the EUR/USD retreated from its recent peak.\nSome analysts emphasize that ECB officials monitor the speed and magnitude of currency shifts rather than fixed psychological levels like 1.20. Furthermore, the trade-weighted Euro\u2014which tracks the currency against a broader basket of partners\u2014remains relatively stable, suggesting the recent rally is more a result of Dollar weakness than an overheating Euro.\nThe key question for forex traders is whether today\u2019s ECB meeting and President Lagarde\u2019s press conference will provide the catalyst to push the EUR/USD pair decisively through the 1.20 level.\nIf Lagarde downplays concerns about euro strength, emphasizes the ECB\u2019s comfort with current inflation trends, "

                "body": "GBP/USD drops to two-week low, around 1.3500 amid dovish BoE and firmer USD\n- GBP/USD attracts sellers for the third straight day and is pressured by a combination of factors.\n- The risk-off impulse and expectations for a less dovish Fed continue to lend support to the USD.\n- The BoE\u2019s dovish signal on Thursday undermines the GBP and also contributes to the offered tone.\nThe GBP/USD pair adds to the previous day's dovish Bank of England (BoE)-inspired heavy losses and drifts lower for the third straight day on Friday. The downward trajectory is sponsored by sustained US Dollar (USD) buying and drags spot prices to a two-week low during the Asian session, with bears now awaiting a break below the 1.3500 psychological mark before placing fresh bets.\nThe nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve (Fed) chair fueled speculations that the US central bank will be less dovish than expected. This, along with a rise in volatility, benefits the USD's status as the global reserve currency. In fact, the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, climbs to a fresh high since January 23 and turns out to be a key factor exerting pressure on the GBP/USD pair.\nThe British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, is undermined by the 5-4 MPC vote split to leave rates unchanged at the end of the February policy meeting on Thursday and the BoE's dovish outlook. In fact, the central bank signaled a future cut if inflation continued to slow. Moreover, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey, addressing reporters during the post-meeting press conference, said that inflation is set to reach the target level sooner than expected.\nTraders were quick to react and are now pricing in a 50 basis points (bps) rate cut by the BoE this year, which further contributes to the offered tone surrounding the GBP/USD pair. Meanwhile, the US Fed is also expected to lower borrowing costs two more times in 2026. This, in turn, holds back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and offers some support to the currency pair, though the fundamental backdrop backs the case for further losses.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound S"

                "body": "RBA\u2019s Bullock: Central bank needs tighter policy as capacity constraints lift inflation risks\nReserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Bullock said on Friday that the board lifted the Official Cash Rate (OCR) because the economy is more capacity constrained than previously judged, meaning policy needed to be tighter. Bullock added that the RBA needs to dampen demand growth unless supply capacity can expand faster.\nKey quotes\nWe need to dampen the growth of demand unless the supply side of the economy can expand a little quicker.\nBased on its assessment that the economy is more capacity constrained, the board judged that monetary policy needed to be tighter.\nMuch of the recent increase in inflation is judged to be temporary but some of it seems to be persistent.\nBoard will be monitoring closely the extent to which the stronger inflation we have observed is persistent or temporary.\nMarket reaction\nAt the time of writing, the AUD/USD pair is trading 0.95% lower on the day to trade at 0.6930.\nRBA FAQs\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for Australia. Decisions are made by a board of governors at 11 meetings a year and ad hoc emergency meetings as required. The RBA\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means an inflation rate of 2-3%, but also \u201c..to contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people.\u201d Its main tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will strengthen the Australian Dollar (AUD) and vice versa. Other RBA tools include quantitative easing and tightening.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for currencies since it lowers the value of money in general, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Moderately higher inflation now tends to lead central banks to put up their interest rates, which in turn has the effect of attracting more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in the case of Australia is the Aussie Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data gauges the health of an economy and can have an impact on the value of its currency. Investors prefer to invest their capital in economies that are safe and growing rather than precarious and shrinking. Greater capital inflows increase the aggregate demand and value of the domestic currency. Classic indicators, such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can influence AUD. A strong economy may encourage the Reserve Bank of Australia to put up interest rates, also supporting AUD.\nQuantitative Easing (QE) is a tool used in extreme situations when lowering interest rates is not enough to restore the flow of credit in the economy. QE is the process by which the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) prints Australian Dollars (AUD) for the purpose of buying assets \u2013 usually government or corporate bonds \u2013 from financial institutions, thereby providing them with much-needed liquidity. QE usually results in a weaker AUD.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the RBA stops buying more assets, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It would be positive (or bullish) for the Australian Dollar.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

Bendigo argues the recent Aussie dollar rally has arrived sooner than it expected \u2013 after the RBA itself tightened earlier than the bank had penciled in. The bank now thinks another hike is unlikely unless underlying inflation jumps above 3.5%. But the labor market complicates that call: unemployment fell t..\no 4.1% in December 2025, and a tight jobs market can keep wage growth and services inflation stubbornly high.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: The exchange rate is doing some of the heavy lifting.\nIf the Australian dollar stays firm, it could cap imported inflation and reinforce the case for a long pause in rates. Bendigo\u2019s \u201cwatch this\u201d level is underlying inflation above 3.5% \u2013 especially if jobs stay tight. Housing is the other swing factor: higher rents and expensive new builds can keep price pressures alive even if goods inflation fades.\nThe bigger picture: A soft landing hinges on jobs and housing costs.\nThis is a reminder that central banks don\u2019t just watch headline CPI \u2013 they\u2019re balancing currency moves, labor-market heat, and shelter inflation at the same time. If Australia can cool housing-driven inflation without a big jump in unemployment, rates can stay steady for longer. But if housing costs keep climbing, the RBA may have to choose between protecting growth and finishing the inflation fight.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "USD/JPY reclaims 157 as Japanese election polls show the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Japan Innovation Party (JIP) heading for a landslide win on Sunday, February 8.\nOn February 8, a landslide victory would strengthen Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s position, enabling her to roll out her stimulus spending plans uncontested. Concerns over Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s spending plans and Japan\u2019s 240% debt-to-GDP ratio have been a root cause for the yen\u2019s weakness since October.\nMeanwhile, Japanese economic data fueled speculation about an H1 2026 Bank of Japan rate hike.\nDespite USD/JPY briefly reclaiming 157, the medium-term outlook remains bearish. Monetary policy divergence and prudent fiscal spending plans are likely to boost demand for the yen.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nAs the Japanese election approaches, the polls suggest Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party could win a simple majority (233 seats) in the Lower House. Crucially, some polls indicate the LDP-JIP coalition could take 310 seats in the Lower House, a supermajority. A supermajority would allow an LDP-JIP coalition to override vetoes from the Upper House and pass fiscal spending legislation.\nGiven market concerns about Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s fiscal spending plans, a landslide victory would be a bullish short-term trigger for USD/JPY. However, an LDP simple majority would also mean that Prime Minister Takaichi is less dependent on JIP for Lower House legislation. JIP would lose its position to push its own fiscal policies, potentially a positive for the yen over the medium- to longer-term.\nFor context, USD/JPY rallied from an October 3 low of 147.056 to a January 14 high of 159.454 in response to Takaichi becoming the leader of LDP.\nWhile Sunday\u2019s election remains the key driver for the yen, Japanese economic data continues to fuel speculation about an H1 2026 BoJ rate hike. On Friday, February 6, Japanese household spending tumbled 2.6% year-on-year in December, after rising 2.9% in November.\nThe pullback in spending may cool bets on an H1 2026 BoJ rate hike. Weaker spending dampens demand-driven inflation. Furthermore, a slump in spending would affect the economy, given that private consumption accounts for around 55%-60% of Japan\u2019s GDP. These factors would support a more dovish BoJ policy stance.\nHowever, the latest slump in household spending could reflect the effect of a weaker yen on import prices. The BoJ has signaled a need to address yen weakness to combat rising import prices. Higher import prices erode households\u2019 purchasing power while lifting consumer prices.\nNotably, the weaker-than-expected household spending report weakened the USD/JPY pair in early trading. A more hawkish BoJ policy stance would support the bearish medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nWhile Japanese data and the upcoming election influence yen demand, US economic data will affect buying interest in the US dollar.\nLater on Friday, US consumer sentiment numbers will take center stage, given the delay to the US jobs report. Economists forecast the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index to fall from 56.4 in January to 55.0 in February. Waning consumer sentiment could signal a pullback in consumer spending and a softer inflation outlook. Cooling inflation would support a more dovish Fed rate path, weighing on US dollar demand.\nA more dovish Fed policy stance and a more hawkish BoJ rate path would indicate a narrowing in US-Japan rate differentials. Narrowing rate differentials in favor of the yen would be bearish for USD/JPY.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a March Fed rate cut increased from 13.4% on January 29 to 24.3% on February 4. Meanwhile, the probability of a June cut jumped from 61.8% to 82.3%.\nFor USD/JPY price trends, traders should assess technical indicators, incoming economic data, central bank chatter, and political developments.\nOn the daily chart, US"

Traders remain on high alert amid the possibility of a coordinated Japan-US intervention to stem the JPY's decline. This, along with a turnaround in the global risk sentiment, benefits the JPY's safe-haven status. Moreover, hawkish Bank of Japan (BoJ) expectations turn out to be another factor that assists the JPY to snap a five-day losing streak.\nMeanwhile, data released earlier today showed that Japan\u2019s Household Spending fell sharply in December, underscoring the drag from higher prices on consumer activity and reinforcing expectations for an early rate hike by the BoJ. However, growing concerns over Japan's fiscal situation and political uncertainty hold back the JPY bulls from placing aggressive bets ahead of the snap lower house election on February 8. The USD, on the other hand, remains on track to register strong weekly gains and might further contribute to limiting losses for the USD/JPY pair.\nJapanese Yen bulls seem reluctant as fiscal and political woes counter hawkish BoJ bets\n- Data released earlier this Friday showed that Household Spending in Japan declined 2.6% YoY in December 2025, marking a sharp contraction after a 2.9% rise in the previous month. This suggests that elevated living costs are weighing on consumption, reinforcing the Bank of Japan's resolve to counter inflation and backing the case for an early interest rate hike.\n- In fact, the Summary of Opinions from the BoJ's January meeting, released earlier this week, showed that policymakers debated mounting price pressures from a weak Japanese Yen. Moreover, board members judged that further interest rate increases were appropriate over time. This assists the JPY to gain some positive traction during the Asian session on Friday.\n- Asian stocks extended losses into a second day as a selloff on Wall Street intensified amid a global rout in tech equities, and also benefited the safe-haven JPY. The US Dollar, on the other hand, consolidates its recent gains to a two-week peak and prompts traders to lighten their USD/JPY bullish bets ahead of Japan's snap lower house election on Sunday, February 8.\n- Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) looks set for a big victory. This would give Takaichi a greater grip on Japan's parliament and more headroom to carry out her pro-stimulus macro policies much more forcefully. The market seems worried that expansionary fiscal plans may hurt Japan's already strained public finances quite badly.\n- From the US, the US Department of Labor reported on Thursday that the number of citizens submitting new applications for unemployment insurance rose to 231K for the week ending January 31 from the previous week\u2019s 209K. The reading was also higher than the 212K initial estimates and comes on top of dismal private-sector employment details released Wednesday.\n- Adding to this, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) revealed that the number of job openings on the last business day of December stood at 6.542 million compared to the previous month's downwardly revised print of 6.928 million. This pointed to labor market weakness and strengthened the case for more interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.\n- In fact, traders are currently pricing in the possibility that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs two more times in 2026. This, in turn, keeps a lid on the recent strong US "

Speaking to business leaders in western Japan, Masu argued that additional rate hikes will be required to complete the normalisation of monetary policy after decades of ultra-easy settings.\nThe remarks highlight a shift within the BoJ toward greater vigilance on inflation risks, driven by sustained wage growth, persistently high food prices and a weak yen. Masu warned that currency depreciation could amplify import costs and feed into inflation expectations, a channel policymakers are watching closely as the yen remains under pressure.\nMasu said particular attention should be paid to processed food prices, noting that sharp rises in rice prices may have made households more accepting of broader food price increases. That dynamic, he suggested, could play a decisive role in determining whether underlying inflation stays contained or drifts higher.\nThe BoJ raised its short-term policy rate to 0.75% in December. At its January 'on hold' meeting one member voted for a further hike, to 1%. Masu\u2019s comments add to evidence of a growing hawkish bloc within the nine-member board.\nAt the same time, Masu stressed the need for caution. While Japan has clearly entered an inflationary phase, he said excessive tightening risks undermining the nascent virtuous cycle between wages and prices. That balancing act remains central to the BoJ\u2019s strategy.\nGovernor Kazuo Ueda has echoed the need for care, arguing that underlying inflation driven by domestic demand and wages has not yet firmly reached 2%. Markets, however, are increasingly focused on the risk that yen weakness accelerates import-driven inflation, with pricing reflecting roughly a 60% chance of another rate hike as early as April."

                "body": "USD/CAD pulls back to near 1.3700 as Oil prices rebound\n- USD/CAD eases as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar strengthens on recovering Oil prices.\n- WTI upside may be capped as the US and Iran agreed to hold talks in Oman on Friday.\n- The US Dollar Index stays near two-week highs as markets price a slower pace of potential Fed rate cuts.\nUSD/CAD remains steady after paring daily gains, trading around 1.3700 during the Asian hours on Friday. The pullback reflects support for the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) as Oil prices recover. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price has rebounded to around $63.50 at the time of writing, though upside may be capped after the United States (US) and Iran agreed to hold talks in Oman on Friday.\nTehran is expected to focus discussions on its long-running nuclear dispute with Western powers, while Washington wants talks to also cover Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, regional proxy support, and human rights issues.\nThe USD/CAD pair may regain its ground as the US Dollar Index (DXY) remains near two-week highs, supported by the slowing pace of potential Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. Fed Governor Lisa Cook said she would not back another cut without clearer evidence that inflation is easing, stressing greater concern over stalled disinflation than labor market weakness.\nInvestors also weighed the implications of Kevin Warsh\u2019s nomination as Fed chair, citing his preference for a smaller balance sheet and a less aggressive approach to rate reductions. The nomination also eased concerns about the Fed\u2019s independence.\nMeanwhile, a run of US labor data this week signaled a cooling job market, reinforcing dovish Fed expectations. Markets now price two rate cuts this year, starting in June, with another possibly in September.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar.

                "body": "The Canadian dollar is expected to give back some recent gains over the coming months, but the currency could then re-establish its uptrend if the Bank of Canada shifts to raising interest rates and the greenback faces broad-based selling pressures, according to a Reuters poll.\nThe median forecast of 35 foreign exchange analysts in the Jan. 30 to Feb. 4 poll predicted the Canadian dollar would weaken 0.9 per cent to 1.38 per U.S. dollar, or 72.46 U.S. cents, in three months, matching the forecast in a survey last month.\nIn 12 months, the loonie was expected to gain 1.3 oer cent to 1.35, also matching the previous forecast.\n\u2018Corrective bounce\u2019\n\u201cWe are expecting a bit of a corrective bounce toward 1.3800 before the downtrend in our USD-CAD forecast profile resumes again,\u201d said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cWe see risks of BoC tightening potentially being brought forward from 2027 to H2 2026, which would provide some support to CAD.\u201d\nLast week, the Bank of Canada held its benchmark interest rate at 2.25 per cent and Governor Tiff Macklem said a high level of trade uncertainty made it difficult to predict when and how rates might next change. The Canada-United-States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) , which has shielded much of Canada\u2019s exports from U.S. tariffs, is set for review by a July 1 deadline.\nInvestors expect no change in rates this year, but are leaning toward the next move being a hike, swap market data shows.\nThe loonie has strengthened 3.3 per cent from its low point in November.\n\u201cWhile investors may not want to exit their overweight U.S. holdings, worries over U.S. geopolitical and geoeconomics policy will see them hedge their USD exposure more actively in order to insulate themselves from further downside in the USD,\u201d Davis said.\nDollar recovery expected to be short-lived\nThe U.S. dollar\u2019s recent recovery will be short-lived, holding steady before resuming a broader decline later in the year, according to the same Reuters poll of currency strategists, as markets cling to interest rate cut expectations amid concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence.\n\u201cOur year-end forecast for USD-CAD of 1.34, which was below market consensus, is likely to be met sooner rather than later,\u201d Mirza Baig, a foreign exchange strategist at Desjardins, said in a note.\n\u201cWhen the U.S. is the source of macroeconomic shocks, it is difficult for the U.S. dollar to behave as a safe-haven currency. This means our confidence about the direction is high, but the precise magnitude and speed of the move is harder to predict.\u201d\n(Reporting by Fergal Smith; Polling by Indradip Ghosh and Nushaiba Iqbal; Editing by Alex Richardson)"

Bulls have pushed the pair back above 214.00 at the time of writing, on track to a five-day rally and with the 16-year high, at 215.00 coming closer.\nInvestors, however, are likely to remain cautious ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) monetary policy decision, due later on Thursday.\nThe bank is widely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3.75% as inflation remains stubbornly high and economic growth shows signs of improvement. The voting split is expected to show two dissenters calling for a quarter-point rate cut; anything below that will be seen as hawkish and is likely to boost the Pound across the board.\nThe Yen, on the other hand, remains vulnerable with investors holding their breath ahead of next weekend's snap elections. Markets are wary that Prime Minister Takaichi might obtain a stronger parliamentary support to extend her expansive policies and boost an already high fiscal deficit.\nA newspaper report released earlier this week revealed that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) might get as many as 300 of the 450 seats in the lower house, a landslide victory that would allow the Prime Minister to rule without a coalition, the most feared scenario for the market.\nEarlier on Thursday, a 30-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) auction closed with stronger demand than usual, which calmed markets and provided some support to the Yen. The yield of the 30-year note eased to 3.5% from all-time highs at 3.65%, and the 20-year yield eased to 3.13% from highs near 3.20% before the auction.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoE Interest Rate Decision\nThe Bank of England (BoE) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the BoE is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is usually bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP). Likewise, if the BoE adopts a dovish view on the UK economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is seen as bearish for GBP.\nRead more.Next release: Thu Feb 05, 2026 12:00\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 3.75%\nPrevious: 3.75%\nSource: Bank of England\nEconomic Indicator\nBoE MPC Vote Rate Unchanged\nInterest rates are set by the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

That\u2019s a whopping $10 billion-plus in notional value.\nTo put it in perspective, that smashed the old record of 169.21 million shares from Nov. 21 by a massive 169%.\nThe record volume came as IBIT plunged 13% to under $35, the lowest since Oct. 11, 2024, extending the year-to-date loss to 27%.

The fund has been a preferred alternative investment vehicle for institutions seeking exposure to cryptocurrency through regulated products.\nCapitulation hints\nThe combination of record volume and price crash often signals capitulation \u2013 long-term holders throwing in the towel and liquidating their holdings at a loss.\nIt marks the bear market's peak selling phase, potentially signaling the start of a slow, painful bottoming process.\nIBIT options trading on Thursday told the same story. Longer duration put options. or contracts used to hedge against downturns, reached a record premium of over 25 volatility points above call options (bullish bets), according to data from MarketChameleon.\nThat kind of heavy put bias often signals peak fear as well.\nThat said, nothing's guaranteed, as bear markets can drag on longer than even dip buyers can stay liquid."

                "body": "TRON takes the lead! What Ethereum\u2019s slip in USDT dominance means for DeFi\nStablecoin dominance is basically the first step to DeFi dominance. The logic is simple \u2013 Networks with more stablecoins locked on-chain have deeper liquidity, which enables smoother trading, lending, and borrowing.\nNotably, with Tether [USDT] alone accounting for 60% of the stablecoin market, it gives the networks that host it a relatively stronger foundation. Looking at L1s, it\u2019s clear that they are strategizing around this advantage.\nAccording to DeFiLlama, TRON [TRX] has officially overtaken Ethereum [ETH] in USDT dominance, capturing 44.97% versus ETH\u2019s 44.56%. This has reinforced the idea that stablecoins are becoming a critical battleground.\nZooming out, TRON\u2019s growing USDT share is even more obvious. Over the past month, TRX\u2019s USDT supply jumped by 3.62%, hitting 83.49 billion. All while Ethereum saw a 5.6% drop over the same period, falling to 82.74 billion.\nWhat makes this interesting is the timing. TRON\u2019s USDT growth is happening in a risk-off market, where major assets are correcting. Ethereum, for example, slid by 15.36% over the month to multi-month lows.\nBy comparison, TRX has limited its losses to 2.6%, raising the question \u2013 Is TRON positioning itself as a more resilient DeFi hub, one that can weather volatility better than ETH thanks to its growing stablecoin base?\nTRON emerges as a DeFi rail amid the stablecoin race\nLiquidity is what really drives DeFi dominance.\nAnalysts are calling it a \u2018stablecoin war\u2019 between L1s. TRON is making moves, grabbing more USDT dominance, but Ethereum\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) of $58 billion still dwarfs TRON\u2019s $4 billion.\nIn other words, Ethereum remains the go-to hub for overall \u201cliquidity.\u201d That said, locked TRX just hit a record 46.2 billion, or 48% of the total supply \u2013 A sign that TRON is quietly building a strong and resilient DeFi base.\nBy comparison, Ethereum\u2019s locked supply sits at just around 30%.\nFrom a technical perspective, TRON\u2019s higher staking rate cuts down circulating supply pressure, helping it hold up better in volatile markets. At the same time, more stablecoins are flowing through its ecosystem.\nTogether, high staking and USDT liquidity create a flywheel \u2013 Staked tokens cap volatility, while stablecoin dominance pulls in more users. As a result, TRON is quietly becoming the DeFi rail, running through Justin Sun now.\nFinal Thoughts\n- TRON captured 44.97% of USDT vs. Ethereum\u2019s 44.56%, highlighting the growing importance of stablecoins in DeFi.\n- With 48% of TRX locked and rising USDT flows, TRON is building a DeFi flywheel that reduces volatility and attracts users."

                "body": "- Ethereum Foundation awarded its maximum bounty for finding a bug.\n- Trust Security identified an attack vector in ERC4337.\n- The security firm also received almost $60,000 from DeFi apps that rely on the protocol.\nThe Ethereum Foundation has awarded a $50,000 bug bounty, its maximum award, to researchers who identified a \u201chigh-severity\u201d attack vector impacting the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe previously unseen attack vector, disclosed by the foundation on Thursday, affected ERC4337, the protocol that powers a feature called account abstraction.\nIt allowed a malicious actor to intentionally cause certain account-abstraction transactions to revert and pay for gas, even though they were valid and correctly signed.\n\u201cHuge thanks to the EF for handling the issue responsibly and granting us a $50k bounty, the maximum high-severity award,\u201d Trust Security, the firm that identified the attack, said in an X post.\n\u201cThis is a censorship and griefing vector, not a fund-theft vector,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation said in a blog post, adding that the attack had been patched in its latest release.\nAt the time of discovery, use of the specific vulnerable ERC4337 transaction type was small, so the attack vector\u2019s real-world impact was limited.\nEthereum users sent around 1.7 million vulnerable ERC4337 transactions over the past week, according to crypto data platform BundleBear.\nThat\u2019s around 9% of all Ethereum transactions made during that period.\nThe issue was important to address before broader adoption amplifies its effects, the Ethereum Foundation said.\nBug bounties\nThe code that underpins the vast majority of the $135 billion DeFi sector is open source, meaning that anyone can inspect, modify, or enhance it freely.\nThis open-source ethos is viewed favourably by most crypto enthusiasts, as it enables community-driven audits, makes it easier for developers to collaborate, and allows users to verify that the code does what it is supposed to do.\nBut it\u2019s also a double-edged sword.\nAny vulnerabilities in open-source code are also visible to attackers, who could exploit them to steal funds or harm users.\nThat\u2019s why bug bounties \u2014 rewards offered to people who identify errors or vulnerabilities in code \u2014 are critical to the security of open source code.\nImmunefi, the largest crypto bug bounty platform, has paid out over $125 million in total, according to its website.\nIn addition to the $50,000 bounty from the Ethereum Foundation, Trust Security said it accepted an additional $59,500 in bounties from DeFi apps that rely on ERC4337.\nSafe, the multi-signature wallet provider, and Biconomy, a crypto bridge, are among the biggest users of the vulnerable ERC4337 transaction type, though Trust Security has not yet said which apps it accepted bounties from.\nRoot cause\nAccount abstraction is a concept in Ethereum that enables programmable transactions, making features like scheduled payments possible.\nThe root cause of the problem was a hidden assumption in the ERC4337 code.\nDevelopers assumed that all account abstraction transactions would run cleanly, isolated, and uninterrupted, just like normal Ethereum transactions.\nIn fact, an attacker could frontrun certain pending account abstraction transactions that interact with protocols with reentrancy protection, or that can be reverted through temporary state changes.\n\u201cThis would cause the inner transaction to revert while paying for the spent gas, griefing account abstraction users,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s blog post said.\nTo fix the issue, developers required that certain contract functions be called only from non-account abstraction wallets.\nProtocols that use ERC4337 should upgrade to the newest release as soon as possible, the foundation said.\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

(Nasdaq: DFDV) released a January 2026 recap highlighting expansion of its Solana-first treasury strategy, new yield partnerships and DeFi integrations, governance strengthening, and a UK revolving credit facility.\nKey facts: 2.22 million SOL treasury (~0.0743 SOL per share), new deployments with Hylo, Solstice YieldVault, RateX Mooncake, listing of dfdvSOL on Jupiter Lend, and appointment of Hadley Stern to the board.\nPositive\n- Treasury holdings of approximately 2.22 million SOL reported at month-end\n- New treasury-yield partnerships and integrations with Hylo and Solstice YieldVault\n- Leveraged-market integration via RateX\u2019s Mooncake platform implemented\n- dfdvSOL listed on Jupiter Lend, increasing token liquidity options\n- Revolving credit facility established with UK affiliate to support corporate liquidity\n- Appointment of Hadley Stern to the Board of Directors, strengthening governance\nNegative\n- None.\nKey Figures\nMarket Reality Check\nPeers on Argus\nDFDV fell 11.7% while peers were mixed (e.g., AMBR up 6.68%, GRRR down 5.7%), pointing to stock-specific dynamics rather than a broad sector move.\nPrevious Crypto Reports\nCrypto-themed news for DFDV has produced mixed reactions, with several neutral events followed by downside moves and only infrastructure/yield updates showing positive alignment.\nOver recent weeks, DFDV has focused on its Solana-centric digital asset treasury and ecosystem engagement. A YieldVault partnership on Jan 13, 2026 drew a 9.09% gain, while a Needham conference appearance on Jan 8, 2026 saw a 4.85% rise. By contrast, community-oriented X Spaces events on Jan 28 and Feb 4, 2026 and the launch of DisclaimerCoin on Jan 22, 2026 were followed by declines. Today\u2019s January recap continues the crypto-treasury narrative seen across these prior updates.\nHistorical Comparison\nPast crypto-tag news saw an average move of -0.68%, with modest gains on infrastructure updates and declines around community events.\nCrypto-tag history shows evolution from conference visibility to yield infrastructure, memecoin experimentation, and recurring community updates.\nMarket Pulse Summary\nThis announcement underscores DFDV\u2019s Solana-centric treasury strategy, with 2.22 million SOL held and 0.0743 SPS reported at January month-end, plus new DeFi integrations and UK structuring. Recent crypto-tag history mixes positive reactions to yield infrastructure with weaker responses to community events.

Wall Street faced sharp losses on Thursday as technology stocks fell and bitcoin plunged. The S&P 500 dropped 1.2%, the Dow Jones fell 592 points, and the Nasdaq sank 1.6%. Weak job reports, including rising unemployment claims and the lowest number of job openings in five years, added pressure. Investors reacted to earnings and forecasts from major companies like Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Estee Lauder. Meanwhile, gains were seen in McKesson and Broadcom as strong earnings supported their shares.\nWhy are S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq down today and who are US stock market big crash losers and gainers?\nThe S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq fell sharply due to weak technology earnings, a bitcoin drop, and disappointing job reports. Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Estee Lauder were among the biggest losers. McKesson and Broadcom gained after reporting strong profit and revenue, benefiting from AI investments and healthcare demand.\nWhy are S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq down today?\nWall Street indexes fell because technology stocks lost value and bitcoin prices dropped. Weak job reports added pressure. Treasury yields fell after unemployment claims rose and job openings reached a five-year low. Investors reacted to signs of slowing economic growth and rising layoffs.\nWall Street drop explained\nWall Street dropped sharply on Thursday. Falling technology stocks and bitcoin losses contributed to the decline. The S&P 500 fell 1.2% to 6,798.40, marking its sixth loss in seven days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 592 points to 48,908.72. The Nasdaq composite sank 1.6% to 22,540.59.\nFalling tech stocks and weak job reports\nWhy are S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq down today? Several reports from the U.S. job market weakened investor confidence. Treasury yields also fell. Unemployment claims rose more than expected last week. Layoffs announced by employers surged to 108,435, the highest January total since 2009. Job openings in December fell to the lowest level in more than five years.\nImpact on companies and stock market losers\nQualcomm fell 8.5% despite beating profit and revenue expectations.

Estee Lauder fell 19.2% even after raising fiscal year guidance. Crypto-related stocks also fell. Coinbase dropped 13.3%, and Strategy fell 17.1% as bitcoin lost over 12% in value.\nStock market winners and gainers\nCompanies that benefit from AI and technology spending gained. Broadcom added 0.8%. McKesson jumped 16.5% after beating profit and revenue expectations and raising full-year profit guidance. Investors favored firms with strong earnings momentum amid tech weakness and crypto losses.\nWho are US stock market big crash losers and gainers?\nMajor losers included Qualcomm, which fell 8.5%, Alphabet, which dropped 0.5%, and Estee Lauder, down 19.2%. Coinbase and Strategy also fell sharply after bitcoin losses.

                "body": "News Corp CEO Robert Thomson highlighted the success of the books that inspired \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d as its book publishing division posted record quarter revenue of $633 million.\n\u201cIce hockey stereotypes are melting away as players pursue each other and a puck,\u201d Thomson said in a conference call with investors on Thursday.\nThe boost in publishing came as News Corp also saw second-quarter revenue increases in its Dow Jones division, including subscription increases at the Wall Street Journal and Barron\u2019s, and its real estate company Move.\nThe company\u2019s stock was up 2.2% in after-hours trading.\nOverall, revenue rose 6% to $2.36 billion while net income slipped 21% to $242 million. When stripping out one-time items, adjusted per-share earnings were 40 cents.\nAnalysts projected earnings of 37 cents per share and revenue of $2.3 billion, according to Yahoo Finance.\nIn a note to investors, Thomson said the company was proud of its results and believed its third-quarter results would be \u201causpicious.\u201d\nWithin Dow Jones, the company saw a 13% increase in digital-only Wall Street Journal subscriptions to reach 4.3 million subscribers. The Journal now has roughly 4.7 million subscribers, an 11% increase from the year prior. Barron\u2019s also saw a 6% increase in digital subscribers to reach 1.42 million, while its total subscribers jumped 4% to 1.51 million.\nNews Corp\u2019s news media division saw its revenues flat compared to last year, as lower ad revenue offset higher circulation and subscription revenues. Its segment EBITDA decreased by 5% due to lower contributions from News Corp Australia and the company\u2019s investment in the New York Post ahead of last month\u2018s debut of the California Post. The West Coast edition launched Jan. 26.\nThe California Post, Thomson said on the investor call, would bring an \u201ceditorial enlightenment\u201d to the state and was based on the \u201crenewed profitability of the New York Post.\u201d The company expects to make more \u201cmodest\u201d investments in the new outlet during its third quarter.\nMultiple News Corp outlets\u2019 digital subscriber bases increased during the quarter compared to the prior year.\nNews Corp Australia\u2019s base jumped to 1.168 million compared to 1.126 million, while the Times of London and the Sunday Times saw its subscribers increase to 659,000 from 616,000 the year prior. The New York Post saw fewer unique users in December 2025 (85 million) compared to December 2024 (90 million), while the Sun saw 70 million unique users during both periods.\nNet income: $242 million, down 21% compared to $306 million last year. News Corp said the drop stemmed from its division REA Group\u2019s sale of PropertyGuru the year prior.\nRevenue: $2.36 billion, up 6% year over year, compared to $2.3 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance.\nEarnings per share: 34 cents per share on a diluted basis. On an adjusted basis, EPS was 40 cents, compared to 37 cents per share expected by analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance.\nFor book publishing, the company saw its revenues increase by 6% to $633 million, 38 million, which it attributed to boosts by marquee titles such as \u201cWicked\u201d author Gregory Maguire\u2019s visual companion ahead of \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d and Republican Sen. John Kennedy\u2019s book of political observations, \u201cHow to Test Negative for Stupid.\u201d Christian books also helped boost its revenues, as well as a $15 million impact from acquisitions. Its digital sales increased by 2%.\nAs he did in the last quarter, Thomson targeted the concerns over AI and said the impact of the technology has evolved and that News Corp\u2019s audiences understand the need to pay more for higher-quality work.\n\u201cWhat is the point of acquiring cutting-edge semiconductors if they\nare being deployed to repurpose gormless, factless, feckless content sets?\u201d he said. \u201cWe do believe an increasing number of insightful companies understand this content contradiction and will indeed pay a premium for our premium content.\u201d\nThomson praised the success of its real estate division Move"

                "body": "FTSE 100 LIVE: UK Stocks Trade Sideways Ahead of BoE, ECB Decisions\nToday\u2019s FTSE 100 trading session in London has been muted and directionless as investors await key Bank of England (BoE) and European Central Bank (ECB) policy decisions later in the day. The UK\u2019s benchmark index has been moving sideways, with gains in some sectors offset by losses in others, leaving the overall market in a state of caution and uncertainty.\nWith interest rate expectations and inflation data in focus, traders are reluctant to take large positions ahead of the central bank announcements. Both the BoE and the ECB are widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged for now, but their commentary on future economic conditions, inflation trends and monetary policy direction will be closely analysed by markets.\nFTSE 100 Eyes Central Bank Decisions\nThe FTSE 100 has been trading nearly flat, reflecting a lack of clear market direction as participants wait for signals from the BoE and the ECB. This cautious mood is typical when major monetary policy announcements are imminent, especially when inflation and growth concerns remain mixed and global risk factors like technology sector volatility persist.\nAt present, the BoE\u2019s policy rate stands at 3.75 percent, and most futures markets anticipate that it will be held steady, with only a small probability assigned to a rate cut. Investors will pay attention to the BoE\u2019s guidance on how it plans to manage inflation and growth in the coming months.\nIn Europe, the ECB is also expected to maintain current interest rates amid subdued inflation pressures, although any commentary indicating a shift in policy could influence European markets, including the FTSE 100. Analysts believe that central banks may emphasise caution due to uneven global economic prospects.\nSector Performances Keep Index Sideways\nUK stocks in the FTSE 100 have shown mixed sector performance early in the session. Energy stocks have been under pressure after recent weak earnings reports from major companies, with some sliding modestly on earnings misses. Other sectors like telecoms and consumer staples have also faced headwinds, mitigating gains from more defensive or resilient segments.\nFor example, energy giant Shell posted lower\u2011than\u2011expected quarterly profit figures, which weighed on its share price and added to the sideways pressure on the FTSE 100. At the same time, other blue\u2011chip names such as BT reported mixed results, reinforcing the cautious stance among investors.\nIn contrast, some banking and financial stocks have shown modest strength, reflecting confidence in their recent stress\u2011test results and capital positions. This has helped balance out weakness elsewhere, contributing to the overall lack of strong directional movement in the index today.\nMacroeconomic Data and Policy Expectations\nInvestors are watching UK inflation figures and economic activity data closely as these will inform BoE policy decisions. Recent data indicated that prices were rising at a pace above target, supporting the view that the BoE may remain cautious before signalling potential future cuts. Market participants see the BoE\u2019s stance as key to UK economic stability in the near term.\nMeanwhile, the ECB\u2019s policy decision will also be crucial for investors in European markets. With inflation having moderated in some parts of the eurozone, the ECB is expected to hold rates steady, but any indications of future cuts or tightening could influence risk sentiment and capital flows across UK financial markets.\nThe interplay of these central bank decisions, combined with mixed corporate earnings updates and external economic signals, is keeping the FTSE 100 in a narrow trading range today. This is a common occurrence when markets await clear policy guidance, as investors prefer to reduce risk exposure until there is greater clarity.\nGlobal Market Context\nGlobal markets have recently experienced volatility due to a mix of factors including renewed concerns about techno"

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell 0.2%.\n(ES=F)\nThe overnight moves followed a sharp sell-off during Thursday\u2019s regular session, led once again by technology stocks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have now slipped into negative territory for 2026.\nAnd after the bell, Amazon (AMZN) added to the gloom. Shares plunged over 10% in after-hours trading after the company posted earnings per share that missed Wall Street estimates and projected capital expenditures of $200 billion for the year, raising concerns about the extent of AI spend.\nThe risk-off tone extended beyond equities. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued sliding, touching levels not seen since 2024, while silver (SI=F) resumed its decline after a recent surge fueled by retail investor interest. Strategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by bitcoin's sell-off, sending shares down.\nEarnings also drove Reddit (RDDT) upward after reporting a quarterly earnings beat, issuing upbeat guidance, and announcing a stock buyback program. Roblox (RBLX) shares also surged. Looking ahead, investors will focus on earnings from Toyota (TM) and Philip Morris (PM), due before Friday\u2019s opening bell.\nMeanwhile, the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week following the resolution of the federal government shutdown. But other data this week has shown fresh signs of trouble for the labor market, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.\nLIVE 1 update"

On the other hand, Reddit popped more than 3% after the social media platform announced an earnings beat, strong guidance and a stock buyback program.\nThursday night's action followed a rough day on Wall Street, with the market once again bogged down by technology stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank roughly 1.6%, hampered in particular by Qualcomm's 8.5% post-earnings drop.\nSoftware stocks continued sliding, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) losing another 5%. The software sector fund has dropped more than 11% this week, on track for its biggest weekly decline since 2008 amid mounting concerns over the threat artificial intelligence poses to the sector.\nThe Dow and S&P 500 each shed 1.2% in Thursday's session, bringing the latter into the red for 2026 alongside the Nasdaq. The Dow is sitting around flat for the week, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have slid roughly 2% and 4% respectively.

With Rob Lowe.\" \"We've got people in front of the camera, behind the camera who are all veterans. They work, man. And that, the pipeline of like going from military to the film and television industry is \u2014 it's such a great outlet for these guys.\n\"Cause they are just like, they just get s--- done. You know? If you ask, \u2018Hey handle this.\u2019 They're like, \u2018Got it.\u2019 You don't have to follow up the next day. And they're not like, 'Oh, actually, it's kind of like, I think stuff's going on. Like, first of all, you have to understand what happened.' It's like, \u2018No, they just get s--- done.\u2019 It's amazing.\"\nCHRIS PRATT ADMITS \u2018MONEYBALL\u2019 DIRECTOR TOLD HIM TO STOP BEING 'SUCH AN A--HOLE' ON SET\nPratt stars as James Reece, a highly trained U.S. Navy SEAL lieutenant commander, in \"The Terminal List.\" He also has served as an executive producer on the series.\nPratt explained how impressive it was to watch the former Navy SEALs transfer their specific training and skills to the film industry.\n\"What they're capable of doing, it's very specific and kind of narrow in terms of application, unless you're gonna go do private security for somebody where you need to be on your toes and be willing and capable of delivering lethal force to protect something.\n\"To see them using their training \u2014 but in service of art \u2014 it's been amazing to see this sort \u2026 this catharsis, because these are guys who have millions of dollars worth of training pumped into each one of them. And then to put that training into making actors know how to handle weapons systems [and] move properly.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

The slate includes tech and telecom (SoftBank Group and SoftBank Corp), autos and industrials (Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Kawasaki Heavy Industries), and health care and finance (Eisai, Terumo, ORIX, Tokio Marine). A separate batch of full-year results from names like Shiseido and Japan Tobacco can..\nalso reset expectations heading into the next fiscal year. In other words, it\u2019s less about any one headline and more about whether guidance lines up across sectors.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A sector-by-sector checkup for Japan\u2019s rally.\nWith so many index heavyweights reporting in a tight window, leadership can rotate quickly if guidance surprises. Watch the tone from globally exposed firms \u2013 especially automakers and factory-automation players \u2013 since their outlooks can sway broader sentiment toward Japanese equities and the yen.\nZooming out: Timing and guidance can move prices as much as profits.\nReuters flags whether results land before the open, during the day, or after the close, because that affects liquidity and how quickly markets reprice. A few quirks, like unclear time stamps for some releases and an off-cycle report from Mercari, are a reminder to focus on the sequence of updates \u2013 each one can nudge forecasts for an entire industry.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"
