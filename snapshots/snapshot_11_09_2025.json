Other precious metals followed suit: silver, platinum, and palladium all declined, pointing to a broader retreat. The main driver is a firm US dollar, which tends to make gold and its peers less appealing to international investors. Uncertainty around Fed rate cuts isn\u2019t helping either\u2014after two cuts earlier this year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has cautioned that another isn\u2019t a done deal. According to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, the odds of a cut in December have fallen to 65% from over 90% before recent Fed comments. On top of that, improving US-China trade relations and delays in official economic data\u2014thanks to a government shutdown\u2014are clouding gold\u2019s appeal as a classic safe-haven.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Safe havens show their cracks.\nGold\u2019s stellar 53% rise this year has hit a rough patch, with other precious metals also on the back foot: silver slipped 1.3%, platinum fell 1.1%, and palladium dropped 2.8%. This across-the-board pullback highlights just how quickly market sentiment can pivot when the dollar strengthens or Fed policy feels less predictable. As investors look for direction, many are waiting for employment and PMI data to provide clues for the Fed\u2019s next moves, but the ongoing government shutdown is making reliable signals hard to come by.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks and currencies on center stage.\nThe outlook for gold and other precious metals is now tied closely to central banks and currency moves. With the Fed pumping the brakes on rate cuts and the dollar holding firm, demand for safe-haven assets might cool off, especially as US-China relations seem to improve. That means investors will be laser-focused on macroeconomic signals and central bank decisions as they search for stability in a shaky environment.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Gold prices extended losses for the third consecutive week as a strong US dollar and cautious remarks from Federal Reserve officials weighed on investor sentiment, analysts said.\nThe sustained firmness in the dollar and a wait-and-watch approach from the US Federal Reserve have dampened demand for the safe-haven asset, keeping bullion prices in a narrow trading range through the holiday-shortened week, they added.\nOn the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for December delivery slipped by Rs 165, or 0.14%, during the past week, to settle at Rs 1,21,067 per 10 grams on Friday.\nThe yellow metal largely hovered near Rs 1.21 lakh per 10-gram level, which is still about Rs 11,000 below its October 17 peak of Rs 1.32 lakh per 10 grams.\nIn the international market, Comex gold futures for December delivery rose by USD 13.3, or 0.33%, in the past week. It had settled at $4,009.8 per ounce on Friday.\nAlso Read: 'May Entail Significant Risk': SEBI Warns Investors Against Digital Gold Trading On Online Platforms\nAnalysts said the metal started the week firm, briefly trading above the $4,000 mark before a stronger dollar dragged prices lower. Renewed risk-aversion in the mid-week provided limited support, helping gold trim its losses.\n\"Gold traded in a tight consolidation range through the week. While bargain-buying emerged on mid-week dips, the strong directional momentum that was visible in October has tapered.\n\"The market currently appears to be in a pause-and-assess phase, with participants waiting for clearer cues from the US dollar and Treasury yields before committing to larger positions,\" Chirag Doshi, CIO of Fixed Income Assets, LGT Wealth India, said.\nNS Ramaswamy, Head of Commodity & CRM, Ventura said, 'Gold prices continue to remain firm, supported by a softer US dollar and expectations of another Federal Reserve rate cut.\n\"The dollar index has been lodged within the trading range of 98-99-100 since August,\" he said, adding that a softer dollar could provide near-term relief for bullion.\nRamaswamy pointed out that the prolonged US government shutdown, entering the second month, has delayed the release of key economic reports of employment and inflation data, creating a 'data vacuum' and heightening uncertainty.\n\"Private reports indicate signs of weakness in the labour market, leading the Federal Reserve to ease policy rates sooner than believed. Lower interest rates tend to support gold,\" he said.\nAccording to Chirag Doshi, a stronger dollar and higher yields initially weighed on precious metals. Renewed risk aversion later in the week lent some support.\n\"A key negative catalyst came from China, which reduced its VAT exemption on certain retail gold purchases, likely cooling physical demand sentiment in Asia,\" Doshi said.\nSilver underperforms as industrial sentiment softens amid global slowdown fears: Silver prices also eased during the week, reflecting a similar consolidation seen in the yellow metal.\nOn the MCX, the white metal futures for December delivery declined by Rs 559, or 0.38%, in the holiday-shortened week. It had closed at Rs 1,47,728 per kilogram on Friday.\nComex silver futures for December delivery edged lower last week. It had settled at USD 48.14 an ounce on Friday.\n\"Silver continued to exhibit high-beta behaviour, moving more sharply than gold on both upswings and pullbacks,' said Doshi, adding that 'short bursts of festive and industrial demand triggered quick rallies, but these were often met with equally fast profit-taking, indicating that short-term traders are driving price action, rather than long-term investors building strategic positions\".\nHe added that exchange-traded funds (ETF) outflows have removed a key cushion, making domestic prices more sensitive to global fluctuations.\n\"However, because the rupee remained weak, the downside in MCX prices was limited -- resulting in consolidation rather than a sharp correction,\" Doshi said."

Thursday\u2019s gains\u2014up $31.70 to $4,024.60 for December contracts\u2014tracked weakness in the ICE dollar index, now down to 99.82, along with lower Treasury yields at 3.588% for two-year notes and 4.113% for ten-years. Typically, gold struggles when the dollar is strong and yields are climbing, but fresh payroll numbers showing 42,000 new private-sector jobs in October flipped the market\u2019s mood. With labor demand cooling but not collapsing, the jobs data reassured investors that recession risks are easing\u2014helping gold hold its ground even without rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, according to Saxo Bank.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Sentiment shifts for safe haven plays.\nGold\u2019s breakout hints at changing risk appetites among investors. When yields slip and the dollar softens, traders often pivot to commodities like gold for stability. As central banks weigh their next moves, the Fed\u2019s cautious tone may keep price swings lively, with markets closely eyeing upcoming inflation and employment data for more cues.\nThe bigger picture: Monetary moves drive global demand.\nLower US yields and a softer dollar spotlight central banks treading carefully to balance growth with inflation.

And that makes this week\u2019s update worth digging into.\nabout 6 hours ago \u2022 4 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nOPEC\u2019s Monthly Oil Market Report offers a detailed snapshot of the global oil market. It covers supply and demand trends, price moves, production changes, and the broader economic forces that affect energy markets. More importantly, it offers a glimpse into what the oil cartel might do next. And with OPEC meeting later this month to map out its 2026 strategy, it\u2019s especially relevant right now.\nSince 2022, the group of oil-producing countries had been trying to rebalance the market with a string of cuts to its output \u2013 only to see non-OPEC players like the US, Brazil, Canada, and Guyana sweep in and fill the gap. And eventually, OPEC got tired of seeing its grip on the market loosen.\nSo earlier this year, it started reversing some of those output cuts, hoping to grab its market share back. Analysts warned the move could drag prices lower, but OPEC\u2019s leaders have insisted that it reflects \u201chealthy market fundamentals\u201d and lean inventory levels. And with oil prices \u201conly\u201d down 14% this year, even as they crank out almost three million more barrels a day, they seem to have a point.\nStill, the whole backdrop\u2019s getting trickier. China\u2019s demand has been cooling, and output across the Americas keeps climbing \u2013 a combination that\u2019s tilting the market toward oversupply. Major trading houses like Trafigura have been counting tankers filled with unsold oil and say the glut is already real. And the International Energy Agency (IEA) is forecasting that supply could outpace demand by over three million barrels a day this quarter \u2013 and could potentially balloon into a record overshoot next year.\n\u25b6 That\u2019s why the next monthly oil report (due Wednesday) could be so important. OPEC tends to keep its forecasts sunny, but if this update sounds more cautious, it could be a sign that the group\u2019s preparing to tap the brakes on its plan to ramp up production before the market drowns in excess oil.\nUS\nEurope\nCompanies laid off 153,000 US workers in October, nearly triple the number from a year ago, with tech and warehouse jobs seeing the biggest cuts. That brought the number of layoffs so far this year to over one million \u2013 the most since the pandemic \u2013 with AI growing more confident and the consumer growing more cautious. And it\u2019s not just pink slips affecting the job market: hiring plans haven\u2019t been this weak since 2011. Together, that suggests the employment picture might be darkening faster than the Federal Reserve expected.\nTesla\u2019s global sales slammed on the brakes again in October, with deliveries falling by 50% in key European markets and 10% in China. While US figures aren\u2019t in yet, analysts aren\u2019t expecting a great ride \u2013 especially with the tax-credit-fueled rush now over. Still, Tesla\u2019s stock has been driving in a different lane: it\u2019s up 12% this year, boosted by CEO Elon Musk\u2019s long-term bets on self-driving tech and robotics. It\u2019s why shareholders approved an eye-watering $1 trillion pay package for him just last week \u2013 a vote of confidence despite signs of weakening demand.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) hit pause on its run of interest rate cuts, holding its key lending rate at 4%, after a close vote. The move wasn\u2019t altogether surprising: consumer prices rose 3.8% in September compared to a year ago, far faster than the central bank\u2019s 2% target pace. The BoE said that it\u2019ll keep rates on a \u201cgradual downward path\u201d \u2013 and traders took the hint, upping their bets on a December cut.\nNovo Nordisk lowered its outlook for a third time this year, after another underwhelming quarter. Sales growth slowed, and profit was light. Meanwhile, rival Eli Lilly has continued sprinting ahead, lifting its outlook as it rides the same obesity-drug wave. That\u2019s had Novo trying to catch up \u2013"

Patrick DeHaan is the senior petroleum analyst with Gasbuddy.com.\n\u201cIt's really a balance of new Russian sanctions that President Trump announced in the last couple of weeks, with those sanctions potentially curbing the flow of oil out of Russia. On the other side of the seemingly same equation on oil production, OPEC met over the weekend and decided to again increase oil output for the month of December. Now, before we all start jumping up and down at how great that might be for pushing oil lower, the group also agreed that they were going to pause further increases that would have taken effect in January, February, and March of 2026.\u201d\nDeHaan said one thing that could move this oil price stalemate is a trade agreement between the U.S. and China. He says if trade increases because of a reduction in tariffs, that could push global oil demand up slightly on the potential that it could improve both the American and Chinese economies.\n\u201cBut for now, you know, the seasonal downturn in gas prices is really being checked by some of the potential for sanctions. Overall, gas prices are largely pretty quiet across the country. The national average at about $2.99 a gallon this morning. It likely will perk back above the three-dollar mark.\u201d\nAgain, that\u2019s Patrick DeHaan of GasBuddy."

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $59.75 per barrel, up 0.54%, while Brent (BZ=F) closed at $63.63, a modest 0.39% gain. Both benchmarks, however, still recorded weekly losses of roughly 2%, driven by elevated inventories and muted demand.\nHungary\u2019s exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian oil was later confirmed as indefinite, according to Foreign Minister Peter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, following direct negotiations in Washington. Hungary, which imports 86% of its crude and 74% of its gas from Russia, secured continued access to Druzhba pipeline supplies in exchange for $600 million in planned U.S. LNG purchases. The move triggered mixed reactions\u2014while offering temporary supply stability for Europe, it simultaneously undercut Washington\u2019s broader sanction pressure on Moscow.\nInventory Surplus and Demand Slowdown Undermine Short-Term Prices\nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a 5.2 million-barrel build in U.S. crude inventories, reigniting fears of a near-term oversupply. Domestic oil output remains strong at 13.65 million barrels per day, close to its all-time record, while imports climbed and refinery utilization fell by 0.8% week-over-week. Gasoline and distillate inventories declined, but not enough to offset overall supply pressure.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s partial shutdown of flight operations amid unpaid controller shortages cut jet fuel demand, deepening bearish sentiment. Analysts estimate lost demand at roughly 80,000 barrels per day for the week. Meanwhile, private data also showed U.S. labor market softening, reinforcing expectations of slower industrial and transport fuel consumption heading into winter.\nOPEC+ Policy Turns Mixed as Saudi Arabia and Russia Diverge\nOPEC+ members decided to raise output slightly for December but paused additional hikes through Q1 2026, wary of tipping the market into a supply glut. Saudi Arabia cut December crude selling prices to Asian buyers by over $2 per barrel, its steepest discount since mid-2024, reflecting weaker margins and competition for Asian refinery demand.\nRussia\u2019s exports, constrained by Western sanctions, remain rerouted mainly to China and India, where discounts average $8\u2013$10 per barrel to Brent. Yet China\u2019s October imports jumped 2.3% month-over-month and 8.2% year-over-year, reaching 48.36 million tons, offsetting part of the Western slowdown. UBS analysts suggest this surge \u201ckeeps barrels away from the OECD, preventing a deeper price collapse.\u201d\nNorth American Energy Diplomacy and \u201cPlan Mexico\u201d Shift Global Supply Flows\nBeyond near-term price swings, strategic alignment across North America is emerging as a counterweight to Chinese dominance in global energy chains. The Atlantic Council highlighted that the U.S.\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA) review in 2026 could reshape regional energy integration. Mexico\u2019s \u201cPlan Mexico\u201d\u2014led by President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2014aims to expand oil and gas infrastructure, EV manufacturing, and mineral supply chains, directly aligning with U.S. and Canadian nearshoring priorities.\nNorth America\u2019s combined export capacity\u2014U.S. LNG dominance, Canadian crude supply, and Mexico\u2019s emerging Pacific LNG terminals\u2014positions the bloc as the world\u2019s most influential democratic energy alliance.

And the International Energy Agency (IEA) is forecasting that supply could outpace demand by over three million barrels a day this quarter \u2013 and could potentially balloon into a record overshoot next year.\n\u25b6 That\u2019s why the next monthly oil report (due Wednesday) could be so important. OPEC tends to keep its forecasts sunny, but if this update sounds more cautious, it could be a sign that the group\u2019s preparing to tap the brakes on its plan to ramp up production before the market drowns in excess oil.\nUS\nEurope\nCompanies laid off 153,000 US workers in October, nearly triple the number from a year ago, with tech and warehouse jobs seeing the biggest cuts. That brought the number of layoffs so far this year to over one million \u2013 the most since the pandemic \u2013 with AI growing more confident and the consumer growing more cautious. And it\u2019s not just pink slips affecting the job market: hiring plans haven\u2019t been this weak since 2011. Together, that suggests the employment picture might be darkening faster than the Federal Reserve expected.\nTesla\u2019s global sales slammed on the brakes again in October, with deliveries falling by 50% in key European markets and 10% in China. While US figures aren\u2019t in yet, analysts aren\u2019t expecting a great ride \u2013 especially with the tax-credit-fueled rush now over. Still, Tesla\u2019s stock has been driving in a different lane: it\u2019s up 12% this year, boosted by CEO Elon Musk\u2019s long-term bets on self-driving tech and robotics. It\u2019s why shareholders approved an eye-watering $1 trillion pay package for him just last week \u2013 a vote of confidence despite signs of weakening demand.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) hit pause on its run of interest rate cuts, holding its key lending rate at 4%, after a close vote. The move wasn\u2019t altogether surprising: consumer prices rose 3.8% in September compared to a year ago, far faster than the central bank\u2019s 2% target pace. The BoE said that it\u2019ll keep rates on a \u201cgradual downward path\u201d \u2013 and traders took the hint, upping their bets on a December cut.\nNovo Nordisk lowered its outlook for a third time this year, after another underwhelming quarter. Sales growth slowed, and profit was light. Meanwhile, rival Eli Lilly has continued sprinting ahead, lifting its outlook as it rides the same obesity-drug wave. That\u2019s had Novo trying to catch up \u2013"

                "body": "SM Energy is acquiring Civitas in $13 billion oil and gas merger of near equals in the Permian Basin\nOil and gas producers SM Energy and Civitas Resources will combine in a $12.8 billion merger of near equals that will expand SM as a major producer in the booming Permian Basin.\nThe two Denver-based energy players said Nov. 3 they are combining forces as the oil and gas industry continues to consolidate, and the most prized assets are the needed inventory and scale to continue drilling wells for decades to come. The merger is the biggest U.S. oil and gas acquisition since crude oil prices plunged in the beginning of April following the onset of tariffs and increased production from OPEC.\nThe deal also will create one of the biggest oil and gas companies led by a woman: The combined entity will be led by SM president and COO Beth McDonald, with SM CEO Herb Vogel set to retire in March.\nNeal Dingmann, an energy analyst at William Blair, said in a note: \u201cWhile we think the Permian position has the ability to drive synergies and that there should be material debt refinancing gains, a merger like this with a lack of overlap across the remaining assets signals a continued need in the E&P (exploration and production) space for inventory anywhere it can be obtained.\u201d\nSM Energy focuses primarily on West Texas\u2019s Permian Basin, South Texas\u2019s Eagle Ford Shale, and Utah\u2019s emerging Uinta Basin. Civitas is concentrated in the Permian and Colorado\u2019s DJ Basin.\nSM Energy has maintained a steady growth mode of late after expanding into Utah by acquiring XCL Resources last year, while Civitas has struggled, cutting ties with CEO Chris Doyle in August.\nAdvertisement\nWhile SM is acquiring Civitas, Civitas shareholders actually will own 52% of the combined company after the all-stock deal. At the close of business on Oct. 31, SM held a $2.4 billion market cap compared with Civitas\u2019s $2.67 billion value. The deal holds a $12.8 billion enterprise value, including debt. However, SM board members will hold six board seats in the combined company while Civitas will have five seats. SM chairman Julio Quintana will continue as chair after the merger, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.\n\u201cThis merger combines two premier operators and establishes a company with transformative scale in the highest-return U.S. shale basins,\u201d McDonald said in the announcement. \u201cBy combining two complementary portfolios, we expect to unlock significant free cash flow to strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate stockholder returns, and position us for sustainable growth through every cycle.\u201d\nActivist investor Kimmeridge was Civitas\u2019s founding backer when it was created in 2021 through a series of mergers. Kimmeridge remains a major shareholder and has pushed for more industry consolidation in oil and gas.\n\u201cThe step change in scale coupled with identified operational synergies should enhance long-term value to all shareholders for years to come,\u201d said Kimmeridge cofounder and managing partner Ben Dell in a statement.\nSM, founded more than 115 years ago as the St. Mary Parish Land Co. in southern Louisiana, also is the only oil company named after the mother of Jesus.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

                "body": "Euro Forecast: EUR/USD\nEUR/USD has sequenced a clean series of lower-lows and highs since the FOMC rate cut on September 17th. But this week\u2019s test of 1.1500 pulled bears back, and the question now is whether the sell-off can gain traction below the big figure that\u2019s historically been a big sticking point in the pair.\nFor next week I\u2019m looking at the broader trend of strength in the USD which lines up with weakness in EUR/USD. But we\u2019re already at a big spot in EUR/USD with the 1.1593 Fibonacci level being tested, and there\u2019s another two areas of interest overhead that could invalidate the short-side trend if they\u2019re broken through in early trade next week.\nThe 1.1500 level holds historical importance in EUR/USD and that story draws back to a decade ago when EUR/USD was range bound for more than two years in an approximate 1,000 pip range that was cut off at resistance by the 1.1500 handle. As the Fed hiked rates in 2019 EUR/USD grinded back below but when Covid came into the picture, it was 1.1500 that capped the highs. And then when the Fed was preparing to go back into a rate-hike campaign, 1.1500 was the last look of lower-high resistance before sellers drove a dramatic sell-off.\nMore recently, that price held the highs in April as resistance and then shorter-term, as support on August 1st.\nThat price is what came into play as support last week and as I had highlighted in the Tuesday webinar, I would\u2019ve been surprised if sellers were able to just cut right through that price without any element of pullback.\nEUR/USD Monthly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nThe weekly chart adds some additional insight as the Fibonacci retracement produced by the 2021-2022 major move has continued to hold resistance at the 76.4-78.6% levels. Those started to come into play in June and initially led to a test below 1.1500, which quickly snapped back. But when bulls had an open door to run they failed to do so, including the episode where a fresh three-year high was set at the Fed\u2019s rate cut announcement on September 17th.\nSince then, it\u2019s been lower-lows and lower-highs that\u2019s led to the 1.1500 test last week.\nEUR/USD Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Daily\nThe daily chart further illustrates that recent build of lower-lows and lower-highs that started at the Fed\u2019s rate cut announcement on September 17th. Ahead of that, Christine Lagarde sounded upbeat at the ECB meeting on September 11th, saying that the disinflationary process was over and that the Eurozone economy was in a good spot. This gave the appearance that ECB rate cuts might be over if not nearing an end, but she sounded less upbeat at the bank\u2019s next rate decision that followed the FOMC rate cut on October 29th, that\u2019s what led to the five bar sequence of weakness that lasted through last week\u2019s open.\nThe bounce from below 1.1500 has already seen a resistance test at the \u2018r2\u2019 level looked at in the Tuesday webinar, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the May-September major move.\nThis retains a bearish bias from the daily chart as we go into next week.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\n--- written by James Stanley, Senior Market Analyst, Global Macro"

The U.S. government shutdown, now stretching into its 38th day, has paralyzed the release of key economic data \u2014 including nonfarm payrolls \u2014 amplifying uncertainty and forcing traders to price in earlier policy easing from the Federal Reserve. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slipped to 99.53, erasing weekly gains after touching a four-month high above 100.21 earlier, a level that proved unsustainable as yields softened and Wall Street extended its steepest decline in seven months. The euro, which had been battered in early autumn by weak manufacturing readings, has regained some footing as investors look for alternative liquidity havens outside of the dollar.\nThe market narrative has reversed sharply from last month\u2019s \u201cKing Dollar\u201d dominance. Traders who had positioned for a stronger greenback in response to high U.S. real yields are now unwinding those bets amid fears of prolonged fiscal dysfunction. The absence of new Treasury supply auctions during the shutdown, along with weaker consumer sentiment, has reduced demand for the dollar as a safe asset. EUR/USD is trading between 1.1500 and 1.1600, consolidating below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the May\u2013September downtrend at 1.1593. The pair\u2019s intraday range has tightened considerably, signaling compression ahead of a larger directional move.\nU.S. MACRO BACKDROP: WEAKER SENTIMENT AND RATE-CUT PRICING REINFORCE EURO\u2019S SHORT-TERM EDGE\nMacro indicators from the U.S. continue to show cracks forming beneath the surface. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for November dropped to 50.3, its lowest level since mid-2023 and sharply below consensus expectations of 53.2. Inflation expectations one year ahead ticked slightly higher to 4.7% from 4.6%, while five-year projections eased to 3.6% from 3.9%. In parallel, the New York Fed Consumer Expectations Survey reported one-year inflation forecasts easing to 3.2%, with both three- and five-year expectations steady at 3.0%. These figures reveal a nuanced shift \u2014 the short end remains sticky, but medium-term inflation is stabilizing, bolstering arguments for the Fed to begin cutting rates sooner.\nMarkets now assign a 66% probability of a December rate cut, up from 48% two weeks ago. U.S. Treasury yields have responded in kind: the 10-year yield fell to 4.09%, down nearly 17 basis points from the monthly peak. Vice Chair Philip Jefferson commented that the Fed should move \u201ccautiously\u201d given the data blackout caused by the shutdown, implying a pause before the next policy recalibration. That cautious stance weighed further on the dollar and revived short-term support for the euro, particularly as carry-trade flows into the dollar lost momentum.\nEUROZONE FUNDAMENTALS: TRADE SURPLUS SHRINKS, BUT SERVICES RESILIENCE LIMITS DOWNSIDE\nIn Europe, the fundamental picture remains mixed. Germany\u2019s September trade surplus narrowed to \u20ac15.3 billion, missing expectations of \u20ac16.8 billion, largely due to weaker exports to the U.S. and Asia. Nonetheless, the contraction in export volumes was partially offset by resilient service-sector growth and steady industrial orders from within the euro area. Retail sales for September declined 0.3% month-on-month, marking the second consecutive drop, though analysts note that the slide is less severe than the 0.6% fall registered in August.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) faces a delicate balance: inflation across the bloc stand"

The move stemmed from the US major data blackout amid a continued government shutdown.\nAs the Bank of England kept the rates unchanged at 4%, it came along with a readiness, instead of the previous cautiousness, to resume rate cuts from the December meeting. MPC members\u2019 vote revealed a 5-4 split, with the Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden also favoring the majority for a 25 bps rate cut, highlighting the growing concerns about the UK\u2019s sluggish growth and cooling inflation.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about XRP price prediction?

The shutdown has obstructed key data releases, causing limited visibility in the markets, with investors shifting to secondary data sources for near-term market clues.\nThe UoM Consumer Sentiment revealed that the consumer sentiment slipped to 50.3 from 53.6 in October.

                "body": "GBP/USD Rebounds from 1.3008 as Dollar Eases from Four-Month Highs\nGBP/USD (Cable) trades around 1.3124 after bouncing from a weekly low of 1.3008, recovering as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) retreats from its four-month peak of 100.21 to 99.53. This move followed deep oversold signals \u2014 the RSI dropped below 25 earlier this week, its lowest since September 2023 \u2014 which triggered aggressive short covering. Traders who pushed the pound to its weakest level in two months were forced to unwind positions as the greenback faltered amid an extended 38-day U.S. government shutdown and falling Treasury yields.\nThe rebound was reinforced by profit-taking in DXY and positioning ahead of next week\u2019s key data, including the delayed U.S. CPI report and UK GDP figures. The pair\u2019s recovery from the 1.30 handle marks a pivotal inflection zone: a sustained move above 1.3140 would signal a near-term bottom, while a reversal below 1.3008 risks targeting 1.2831, a 138.2% Fibonacci projection of the 1.3787\u20131.3140\u20131.3725 sequence.\nTechnical Setup: Resistance at 1.3247, Trendline Support Near 1.2780\nThe 1.3247 level \u2014 once strong support \u2014 now acts as a resistance ceiling. A clear breakout above it would confirm that the corrective fall from 1.3787 has ended, opening space toward 1.3350\u20131.3500. However, failure to break this barrier keeps the broader downtrend intact. The 55-week EMA, now at 1.3185, aligns with this resistance cluster and continues to cap rallies.\nOn the downside, traders eye the 1.2780 trendline as critical long-term support. A decisive close below it would expose 1.2474, corresponding to the 38.2% retracement of the 1.0351\u20131.3787 rally. That area marks the lower bound of the current macro consolidation phase.\nMomentum indicators suggest a fragile equilibrium:\n-\nRSI (daily) rebounded to 43 after hitting oversold lows.\n-\nMACD histogram shows contracting negative momentum.\n-\nVolume-weighted price around 1.3110 confirms accumulation zones near current levels.\nMacro Pressure: U.S. Shutdown Extends to 38 Days, Dampening Dollar Momentum\nThe extended U.S. shutdown has eroded investor confidence in the dollar\u2019s short-term strength. Economic visibility remains limited \u2014 crucial releases like non-farm payrolls and retail sales were postponed \u2014 forcing traders to rely on second-tier sentiment data. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to 50.3, a six-month low, while 1-year inflation expectations rose slightly to 4.7%.\nMeanwhile, Fed officials including Vice Chair Philip Jefferson signaled a pause in rate cuts, warning of \u201ccautious adjustments\u201d amid missing economic data. The market now prices a 66% probability of a 25-basis-point cut in December, a shift from 80% just two weeks ago. The Dollar Index\u2019s correction from 100.21 to 99.53 reflects this repricing, easing upward pressure on GBP/USD.\nUK Fundamentals: Domestic Data Mixed, but Services Stay Resilient\nIn the UK, the macro backdrop remains divided. Retail spending and manufacturing PMI remain weak, while services activity \u2014 particularly financial services and tourism \u2014 continue to stabilize. The Bank of England remains cautious but is expected to hold the Bank Rate at 4.75% through Q1 2026. Inflation has slowed to 3.9% YoY, but wage growth above 5% continues to anchor price stickiness.\nFiscal constraints also weigh on sentiment. The UK\u2019s Q3 GDP growth is forecast near 0.1%, with the trade deficit widening to \u00a33.8 billion. However, falling energy prices and stabilizing gilt yields (10-year at 3.94%) have softened pressure on the pound. The relative yield advantage of U.S. Treasuries narrowed slightly this week, reducing the dollar\u2019s appeal against the pound.\nDXY Weakness and Oversold Sterling Align for Technical Recovery\nThe broader dollar correction provides GBP/USD room for recovery. With DXY finding short-term support at 99.40, traders expect choppy conditions ahead of next week\u2019s data releases. The GBP/USD rally from 1.3008 to 1.3140 mirrors EUR/USD\u2019s move from 1.1"

                "body": "Why Spain is liberalizing its immigration rules?\nInvesting.com -- The yen\u2019s renewed weakness has reignited speculation that Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance (MoF) may step into the foreign exchange market, but BofA Global Research finds that \u201cintervention appears not imminent at 155.\u201d\nFollowing the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) decision to hold policy steady, USD/JPY resumed its upward climb, reaching roughly \u00a5154.\nAnalysts at BofA Securities note that \u201cabsent a sharp rise in speculative positioning or volatility, USD/JPY could test the 158 level before triggering a meaningful policy response,\u201d though the \u201crisk of an overshoot to 160 in 4Q25 has risen.\u201d\nThe U.S. dollar\u2019s advance has brought USD/JPY slightly above the average pre-intervention level of \u00a5153.6 observed since 2022.\nThe two-week and one-month rates of change stand at +2.2% and +4.7%, respectively, marginally above historical averages that preceded prior interventions. However, volatility remains subdued.\nThe brokerage points out that \u201cone-month implied volatility has dipped below 8%, marking its lowest level since June 2024.\u201d\nWhen Tokyo last intervened in July 2024, volatility was 8.5% and spot trading exceeded \u00a5160. These data suggest that the \u201cmarket remains orderly,\u201d mitigating the immediate case for official action.\nMarket resilience also tempers the urgency for intervention. BofA Securities observes that \u201cJapanese equities and government bonds are showing strength,\u201d with the Nikkei 225 continuing to post record highs and super-long JGB yields trending lower.\nSuch performance signals that yen depreciation has not yet imposed significant stress on domestic financial assets.\nDiplomatic dynamics further complicate Japan\u2019s calculus. On October 28, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote on X that \u201cthe government\u2019s willingness to allow the Bank of Japan policy space will be key to anchoring inflation expectations and avoiding excess exchange rate volatility.\u201d\nBofA interprets this as a \u201csubtle signal\u201d encouraging the BoJ to consider rate hikes, reflecting Washington\u2019s preference for monetary policy normalization over direct market intervention.\nThe brokerage notes that \u201cwhether FX intervention to counter the yen weakness would receive support or understanding from U.S. authorities remains uncertain,\u201d given Secretary Bessent\u2019s stance and the potential implications of yen-buying and dollar-selling operations for broader dollar markets.\nDomestic politics provide another moderating factor. The recently inaugurated Takaichi administration faces the challenge of balancing a weak yen and rising inflation while prioritizing fiscal expansion.\nBofA Securities writes that \u201cwithin the administration, it may take time to build consensus on FX policy.\u201d Google Trends data suggest \u201cpublic concern over yen depreciation and price hikes is not currently elevated,\u201d reducing political pressure for swift action.\nThe administration is also focused on passing a supplementary budget, its top legislative priority, which could delay policy coordination.\nMoreover, the government\u2019s plans to fund about half of its U.S. investment commitments from foreign exchange reserves under the recent U.S.-Japan investment agreement constrain its room to maneuver.\nBofA warns that \u201cprolonged FX intervention could deplete these reserves,\u201d potentially hindering Japan\u2019s ability to meet its external commitments and \u201cintroducing additional uncertainty into the yen market.\u201d\nBofA Global Research said that Japan may \u201cean into the move and intervene only once USD/JPY approaches more critical levels or speculative positioning builds up to maximize the effectiveness.\u201d\nFor now, low volatility, firm domestic markets, and a high political threshold suggest that any action would be delayed until the yen\u2019s slide approaches \u00a5158\u2013\u00a5160.\nWhich stocks should you consider in your very next trade?\nSuccessful investors know to check multiple angles before making their move.

                "body": "Japanese government intervention threats collided with US labor market data, which signaled a surge in job cuts, sending USD/JPY into the red. USD/JPY fell 0.38% to 153.412 in the reporting week ending Friday, November 7. Slowing Japanese wage growth and manufacturing sector woes capped the yen\u2019s gains. Meanwhile, US inflation expectations remained elevated, cushioning the downside for the greenback.\nJapanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama warned:\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing one-sided and rapid moves in the currency market. There\u2019s no change in our stance of assessing developments with a high sense of urgency.\u201d\nHer comments underscored concerns about yen weakness raising import costs and cutting household purchasing power. Notably, USD/JPY dropped back from an eight-month high of 154.483. Intervention warnings from Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama are likely to cap USD/JPY gains barring a shift in sentiment toward the US economy and the Fed rate path.\nLooking ahead, the US Senate impasse and key economic indicators will influence the BoJ and the Fed\u2019s policy stances. Furthermore, intervention threats and growing concerns about the global demand environment may also affect trends, given China\u2019s reported export slump.\nOn Monday, November 10, the Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions could be pivotal for the Japanese yen. The BoJ kept interest rates at 0.5% on October 30 and signaled a softer inflation outlook through H1 2026, cooling bets on a December rate hike.\nNotably, two policymakers continued to dissent, favoring an interest rate hike. The Summary of Opinions will give insights into the conditions needed to tighten monetary policy. Heightened concerns that yen weakness is lifting import prices may increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike, pushing USD/JPY lower.\nOn the other hand, growing concerns over US tariffs affecting demand for Japanese goods, price margins, and the labor market could signal a policy status quo, sending USD/JPY higher. Notably, Trump\u2019s tariffs are currently under review by the US Supreme Court.\nAlthough the Summary of Opinions will be key, Japanese producer prices will draw the BoJ\u2019s attention on Thursday, November 13. Economists expect producer prices to rise 2.5% year-on-year in October, down from 2.7% in September.\nA lower reading could signal a softer inflation outlook, supporting a more dovish BoJ rate path. Producers adjust prices subject to demand, passing on cost savings or higher prices to consumers.\nRising producer prices would indicate an upswing in consumer prices, potentially increasing expectations of a December BoJ rate hike.\nGiven the impact of US tariffs and weakening global trade, a softer print appears more likely, aligning with the BoJ\u2019s inflation outlook for H1 2026.\nBeyond the economic data and the BoJ\u2019s Summary of Opinions, traders should closely monitor BoJ speeches. Policymakers could deliver hawkish signals amid concerns over yen weakness and import price trends.\nHowever, policymakers\u2019 views on the 2026 wage outlook will also be crucial. Inflation continued to outpace wage growth in September, complicating the BoJ\u2019s policy stance. Real wages fell 1.4% year-on-year in September, while the so-called core core inflation rate eased from 3.3% in August to 3.0% in September.\nBoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has highlighted the need for more data and early indications from 2026 shunto wage negotiations. Japan\u2019s largest labor union, Rengo, is reportedly planning to demand a 5% wage hike in the 2026 shunto spring negotiations. UA Zensen, made up of unions in Japan\u2019s retail, textile, and other industries, reportedly announced plans to demand a 6% wage hike.\nSupport for 5-6% wage increases could fuel bets on a near-term BoJ rate hike, lifting demand for the yen. While the proposed 2026 wage hikes are not immediate, expectations could still affect market pricing in the near term.\nEven as the BoJ considers wage growth, import prices, and demand, the Japanese government will likely continue tracking USD/"

Spot reclaimed 153.00 as U.S. 10-year Treasuries steadied near ~4.6%, re-tightening the familiar link between the pair and front-end U.S. yields. The immediate map is explicit: first support sits near 153.00 with a softer shelf at 152.80; lose 152.80 and the 20-day SMA near 152.52 becomes the magnet, while the October 29 pivot at 151.53 is the deeper line that would mark a trend-tone shift if broken. Topsides are equally clean: 154.00 gates the November 4 peak at 154.48; above it, the psychological 155.00 is next, with 156.50 the stretch level if momentum re-accelerates.\nRates Correlation Is The Driver: Watch The Front End, Not The Headlines\nThe rolling correlation between USD/JPY and Fed cut pricing has been running hot, with a strongly negative coefficient as deeper 2026 cuts get priced, the pair tends to slip; fewer cuts and firmer near-term policy stances buoy the dollar. With the U.S. data calendar thinned by the shutdown, speeches and Treasury supply matter more than usual. Auctions of 3s, 10s and 30s bracket the week; strong demand that presses yields lower would ordinarily nudge USD/JPY down, while a soft bid-to-cover that cheapens the curve tilts back toward 154\u2013155. Risk appetite remains a secondary input: equities wobbled but the carry bid hasn\u2019t vanished, keeping dips shallow as long as U.S.\u2013Japan short-rate spreads refuse to compress decisively.\nJapan Side Risks: JGB Supply, BOJ Signaling, And The Politically Sensitive Line\nTokyo\u2019s 30-year JGB auction is a volatility wildcard; weak demand that cheapens the super-long end can bleed into broader term-premium dynamics, occasionally lifting USD/JPY via yield differentials. PPI later in the week offers a read on pipeline pressures that could color BOJ tolerance for gradual normalization talk. Messaging from BOJ board members has been sparse; any surprise hawkish tint\u2014inflation persistence, wage setting, or guidance on balance-sheet rhythm\u2014would lower topside pressure on USD/JPY. Prime Minister Takaichi\u2019s growth-first fiscal stance argues for policy patience at the BOJ, but it also raises the stakes around FX optics if depreciation looks disorderly.\nIntervention Thermometer: 155 Is Not A Tripwire\u2014158\u2013160 Is The Real Heat Zone\nMarket micro tells argue interventions are about speed and disorder, not round numbers. The last clean episode arrived north of 160 amid higher spot volatility. Today, spot vaulted back to ~153\u2013154 with far calmer tape. Policy chatter implies tolerance up to 158 and, in a disorderly overshoot, 160, especially if speculative positioning and options vol flare. Political calculus matters: domestic assets are not flashing stress, public focus on the weak yen is not acute, and reserves are already earmarked for strategic commitments abroad\u2014sustained yen-buying would carry an opportunity cost. Translation for traders: interventions are a tail risk below 158, a live risk into 158\u2013160, and a base case only on a fast, volatile spike.\nMomentum And Market Structure: RSI Support, Clean Levels, And A Narrow Runway\nMomentum gauges improved with the reclaim of 153.00; RSI flipped back to neutral-positive on intraday frames while daily MACD remains heavy enough to keep rallies honest below 154.50. The market is respecting structure: 153.00 as intraday pivot, 154.00/154.48 as ceiling, 155.00 as headline risk zone. A daily close above 154.48 opens a controlled push to 155.00, where options gamma often caps follow-through absent a fresh yield impulse. Failures back through 152.80 "

Canada\u2019s 10-year bond yield lagged behind its US counterpart, highlighting ongoing pressure from across the border.\nThe bigger picture: Growth faces global and domestic hurdles.\nCanada\u2019s economic momentum is a bright spot, but it is threatened by a ballooning deficit and strong US policy. The government\u2019s big spending package could boost productivity, but it raises concerns about long-term fiscal health. Plus, with the Fed showing no signs of easing rates soon, Canadian policymakers will have less wiggle room, leaving the loonie sensitive to global shifts.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "GBP/USD Rebounds from 1.3008 as Dollar Eases from Four-Month Highs\nGBP/USD (Cable) trades around 1.3124 after bouncing from a weekly low of 1.3008, recovering as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) retreats from its four-month peak of 100.21 to 99.53. This move followed deep oversold signals \u2014 the RSI dropped below 25 earlier this week, its lowest since September 2023 \u2014 which triggered aggressive short covering. Traders who pushed the pound to its weakest level in two months were forced to unwind positions as the greenback faltered amid an extended 38-day U.S. government shutdown and falling Treasury yields.\nThe rebound was reinforced by profit-taking in DXY and positioning ahead of next week\u2019s key data, including the delayed U.S. CPI report and UK GDP figures. The pair\u2019s recovery from the 1.30 handle marks a pivotal inflection zone: a sustained move above 1.3140 would signal a near-term bottom, while a reversal below 1.3008 risks targeting 1.2831, a 138.2% Fibonacci projection of the 1.3787\u20131.3140\u20131.3725 sequence.\nTechnical Setup: Resistance at 1.3247, Trendline Support Near 1.2780\nThe 1.3247 level \u2014 once strong support \u2014 now acts as a resistance ceiling. A clear breakout above it would confirm that the corrective fall from 1.3787 has ended, opening space toward 1.3350\u20131.3500. However, failure to break this barrier keeps the broader downtrend intact. The 55-week EMA, now at 1.3185, aligns with this resistance cluster and continues to cap rallies.\nOn the downside, traders eye the 1.2780 trendline as critical long-term support. A decisive close below it would expose 1.2474, corresponding to the 38.2% retracement of the 1.0351\u20131.3787 rally. That area marks the lower bound of the current macro consolidation phase.\nMomentum indicators suggest a fragile equilibrium:\n-\nRSI (daily) rebounded to 43 after hitting oversold lows.\n-\nMACD histogram shows contracting negative momentum.\n-\nVolume-weighted price around 1.3110 confirms accumulation zones near current levels.\nMacro Pressure: U.S. Shutdown Extends to 38 Days, Dampening Dollar Momentum\nThe extended U.S. shutdown has eroded investor confidence in the dollar\u2019s short-term strength. Economic visibility remains limited \u2014 crucial releases like non-farm payrolls and retail sales were postponed \u2014 forcing traders to rely on second-tier sentiment data. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to 50.3, a six-month low, while 1-year inflation expectations rose slightly to 4.7%.\nMeanwhile, Fed officials including Vice Chair Philip Jefferson signaled a pause in rate cuts, warning of \u201ccautious adjustments\u201d amid missing economic data. The market now prices a 66% probability of a 25-basis-point cut in December, a shift from 80% just two weeks ago. The Dollar Index\u2019s correction from 100.21 to 99.53 reflects this repricing, easing upward pressure on GBP/USD.\nUK Fundamentals: Domestic Data Mixed, but Services Stay Resilient\nIn the UK, the macro backdrop remains divided. Retail spending and manufacturing PMI remain weak, while services activity \u2014 particularly financial services and tourism \u2014 continue to stabilize. The Bank of England remains cautious but is expected to hold the Bank Rate at 4.75% through Q1 2026. Inflation has slowed to 3.9% YoY, but wage growth above 5% continues to anchor price stickiness.\nFiscal constraints also weigh on sentiment. The UK\u2019s Q3 GDP growth is forecast near 0.1%, with the trade deficit widening to \u00a33.8 billion. However, falling energy prices and stabilizing gilt yields (10-year at 3.94%) have softened pressure on the pound. The relative yield advantage of U.S. Treasuries narrowed slightly this week, reducing the dollar\u2019s appeal against the pound.\nDXY Weakness and Oversold Sterling Align for Technical Recovery\nThe broader dollar correction provides GBP/USD room for recovery. With DXY finding short-term support at 99.40, traders expect choppy conditions ahead of next week\u2019s data releases. The GBP/USD rally from 1.3008 to 1.3140 mirrors EUR/USD\u2019s move from 1.1"

TMTG reported owning roughly 756 million Cronos (CRO) tokens, worth approximately $110 million.\nThe position reflects the company\u2019s growing alignment with Crypto.com, a relationship that has already produced several crypto-focused initiatives, including exchange-traded products and promotional tie-ins.\nThese initiatives helped position TMTG as a more active participant in the crypto economy, even though they have not reversed the firm\u2019s financial challenges.\nTMTG posted a $54.8 million net loss in the third quarter of 2025, extending its stretch of multi-million-dollar quarterly losses.\nThis suggests that the company\u2019s crypto-heavy strategy has therefore served more as a political and operational statement than a source of near-term financial relief.\nTrump's Family Crypto Holdings Surge\nAs TMTG increased its exposure, other Trump-connected ventures expanded theirs as well, creating a broader cluster of politically adjacent crypto holdings.\nData from Arkham Intelligence indicates that several affiliated entities now hold substantial balances.\nTrump personally holds about $861,000 worth of digital assets, while World Liberty Financial, one of the largest Trump-associated projects, controls more than $5.7 billion in crypto."

                "body": "The research team at BitMEX has recently commented on why the Bitcoin (BTC) price is crashing. The digital assets firm pointed out that the prevailing narrative is now everywhere: \u201cThis time is different.\u201d With spot exchange-traded-funds or ETFs and considerable institutional flows, many now seemingly believe that the so-called Bitcoin 4-year cycle is finally dead.\nBitMEX\u2019s latest quantitative analysis suggests otherwise. According to the crypto exchange, the 4-year cycle is not actually dead (rather it is more structural).\nAs stated in the analysis, the persistence of the cycle is not really about retail speculation. Moreover, it said to be rooted in the mechanics of the crypto market:\n- The Halving Effect: The supply shock remains the primary catalyst, suggesting a peak 12\u201318 months post-halving.\n- Structural Flaw: High leverage and the dominance of perpetual futures mean market stability is governed by liquidation mechanics, guaranteeing excess in the bull phase and catastrophic drawdowns.\n- Current Indicators: Bitcoin\u2019s lagging underperformance YTD and recent $20B liquidation cascade signal cyclical fatigue, not maturity.\nHistory doesn\u2019t always repeat but it often rhymes.\nEvery 4 years, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) market follows a seemingly consistent rhythm that is said to be shaped by one mechanical event: the Bitcoin halving. Roughly every 210,000 blocks, the network cuts the BTC mining reward in half, slowing down new supply.\nBitMEX further stated that each halving has historically led \u201cto the same sequence: accumulation \u2192 parabolic rally \u2192 speculative peak \u2192 collapse and recovery.\u201d\n- 2012\u20132014: The first halving ushered in Bitcoin\u2019s earliest true bull market, pushing prices from double digits to over $1,000 before the Mt. Gox collapse marked the first great crash.\n- 2016\u20132018: The second halving led to the 2017 mania and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom, before the 2018 bear was triggered by China\u2019s crackdown and the overwhelming number of token issuances.\n- 2020\u20132022: The third halving kicked off crypto\u2019s institutional era\u2014Strategy, Tesla, and ETFs\u2014culminating in the 2021 high. This was shortly followed by the 2022 collapse, fuelled by the downfall of LUNA, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), and FTX.\n- 2024 onward: The most recent halving occurred on 19 April 2024, cutting issuance to 3.125 BTC. We are now midway through this fourth cycle.\nThe pattern has repeated so precisely that some analysts \u201cestimate the peak usually comes 12\u201318 months after each halving.\u201d\nThe mechanism is described as being \u201cself-reinforcing: lower supply, rising demand, euphoric speculation, and eventual exhaustion.\u201d\nBitMEX concluded:\n\u201cIf the cycle had truly ended, Bitcoin should be leading this risk-on environment \u2014 not lagging it. Its relative weakness implies we are approaching the final phase of the cycle \u2014 wind down and recovery. Further evidence is the crypto ecosystem is again showing internal \u201ccracks\u201d for a deep correction that is internally only for the crypto market.\u201d"

                "body": "- Fusaka is the next checkpoint in Ethereum\u2019s development.\n- The upgrade goes live on the mainnet in December.\n- It contains 12 changes, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals\nEthereum\u2019s Fusaka upgrade will activate on the blockchain\u2019s mainnet on December 3, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\nThe goal? To enable Ethereum to handle the large transaction traffic from its layer 2 chains, blockchains with a $47 billion on-chain economy built on top of Ethereum. Those chains inherit the base layer\u2019s security architecture while offering faster and cheaper transactions.\n\u201cFusaka\u2019s biggest impact comes from improvements to data availability through PeerDAS, which should make rollups cheaper and more scalable,\u201d Nick Johnson, founder and lead developer of Ethereum Naming Service, ENS, told DL News.\nFusaka is the latest checkpoint in Ethereum\u2019s development plan. Developers are attempting to scale the $410 billion blockchain so that it can handle 100,000 transactions per second, a massive increase from its current maximum of 30 transactions per second. It follows the Pectra upgrade that the developers released in May.\nData load\nPeerDAS is one of 12 changes to the blockchain included in the Fusaka upgrade package. It targets the data load needed for verifying transactions from layer 2 blockchains.\nLayer 2 chains bundle thousands of transactions and submit summaries, called blobs, to the Ethereum base layer. Nodes running on the base layer currently have to download the entire blob data to check for validity.\nThat process becomes more expensive for nodes as layer 2 transactions soar. It also creates a data traffic jam on the base layer.\nPeerDAS solves the problem by reducing the data load for nodes when verifying layer 2 transactions. Instead of downloading the whole blob, nodes only need to check random samples within the blob data to verify transactions.\nLeo Fan, co-founder of Cysic, a zero-knowledge-based blockchain, describes Fusaka as a \u201cdeep infrastructural shift\u201d for Ethereum, which could increase the chain\u2019s throughput eightfold.\nThe reduced data load could result in a significant reduction in bandwidth costs for nodes. Experts like Shiv Shankar, CEO of Boundless, a zero-knowledge scalability protocol, said that this could help improve Ethereum\u2019s efficiency.\n\u201cIt lets Ethereum handle more activity, which is good for developers building apps,\u201d Shankar told DL News.\nHowever, Fusaka doesn\u2019t aim to supercharge Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 chains alone. It also includes improvements that directly impact the base layer.\nThe 12 EIPs include two upgrades that directly aim to stretch the base layer\u2019s block and data limits. EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals, are blueprints vetted by Ethereum developers that codify changes to the blockchain.\nThese upgrades allow for more transaction processing capacity and increase the number of blobs that layer 2 chains can submit to the main chain.\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

The drop came alongside a 4% correction in the Nasdaq index, which erased gains from the previous two weeks. Traders are now debating whether ETH still has chances to reclaim the $3,900 level.\nConcerns about global economic growth surfaced after weak quarterly results from consumer-focused companies and renewed worries over high valuations in the artificial intelligence sector. Meanwhile, the longest-ever US government shutdown continues to hurt the economy.\nEther futures are trading at a 4% premium to spot markets, unchanged from the previous week. The data shows a limited appetite for bullish positions, although it has not yet approached panic levels below 0%.\nUnder normal market conditions, this premium typically sits between 5% and 10% to account for the longer settlement period.\nMarket anxiety grew after US consumer sentiment expectations plunged to their lowest levels ever, according to a University of Michigan survey.\nNovember\u2019s reading, released Friday, was the second weakest since at least 1978 and was largely blamed on the ongoing US government spending shutdown, AP reported.\nPart of Ether investors\u2019 frustration stems from ETH 4% weekly underperformance compared to the broader crypto market. This suggests that, beyond rising macroeconomic risks, other factors have likely made traders more cautious toward Ethereum.\nThe total value locked on the Ethereum network fell to $74 billion\u2014the lowest since July\u2014marking a 24% drop over the past 30 days. Investors were caught off guard after one of Ethereum\u2019s leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, Balancer v2, was hit by a $120 million exploit on Monday.\nEthereum DApps revenue declined in October\nEthereum decentralized applications (DApps) generated $80.7 million in revenue in October, an 18% decline from September. The decrease is particularly concerning for ETH holders, as lower onchain activity puts downward pressure on the native staking yield.\nEthereum\u2019s design includes a mechanism that burns ETH during periods of high demand for blockchain data processing, helping balance network activity and supply.\nHowever, the first week of November shows early signs of strength for Ethereum compared with rival blockchains. Active addresses climbed 5% over the past seven days, while transactions rose 2%. By contrast, both Tron and BNB Chain saw declines in onchain activity.\nETH trader sentiment has been weighed down by the lack of demand for Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). US-listed products recorded $507 million in net outflows during November, and there were no notable ETH corporate reserve purchases, according to Strategic ETH Reserve data.\nCurrently, ETH\u2019s only clear catalyst is the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, slated for early December. The update is designed to deliver several scalability and security enhancements to the network.\nHowever, with derivatives markets signaling weakness and investors wary of a slowing global economy, the chances of a breakout toward $3,900 in the short term appear limited.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

                "body": "The blockchain sector stands at a critical crossroads, with the ongoing challenge of balancing scalability and security having historically limited the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi). ZKsync\u2019s recent Atlas Upgrade, released on October 8, 2025, marks a significant leap forward. Utilizing zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and a redesigned core framework, this upgrade is set to transform Layer 2 operations, allowing\nEthereum\nto handle more than 15,000 transactions per second (TPS) with almost immediate finality and extremely low costs, as detailed in a\nBlockchain Reporter article\n. For investors, this is not just a technical achievement but a signal of increased capital entering ZK-driven ecosystems, fueled by institutional demand for scalable, secure, and privacy-centric financial solutions.\nTechnical Advancements: The Architecture of Scalability\nThe Atlas Upgrade brings two major innovations: a high-speed sequencer and the Airbender proof system. The sequencer, tailored for intensive workloads, achieves over 30,000 TPS in testing, while Airbender\u2014a proof system based on RISC-V\u2014cuts computational costs by 40% compared to earlier ZK-rollup models, according to a\nFinanceFeeds report\n. These enhancements are vital for DeFi, where high fees and slow transactions have previously discouraged institutional involvement. By reducing costs to nearly zero and delivering finality in less than a second,\nZKsync\nemerges as a strong contender to centralized exchanges for rapid trading and instant settlements.\nAdditionally, the upgrade\u2019s support for multiple virtual machines (multi-VM) and full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility ensures smooth interaction between Layer 1 and Layer 2. This removes the necessity for separate liquidity centers, enabling Layer 2 solutions to tap directly into Ethereum\u2019s liquidity, as noted in the\nBlockchain Reporter article\n. For example, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on ZKsync can now access Ethereum\u2019s vast liquidity pool directly, minimizing slippage and improving the user experience. These capabilities are especially attractive to institutional players who value transparency and efficiency in managing capital.\nImplications for DeFi: Security, Privacy, and Institutional Trust\nThe DeFi landscape has come under increased scrutiny after major security breaches, such as the $116 million Balancer and $93 million Stream Finance incidents. These cases highlighted the vulnerabilities of smart contracts and the urgent need for stronger security measures. ZK-based solutions inherently address these issues by using cryptographic proofs to confirm transactions without revealing private information, as mentioned in the\nBlockchain Reporter article\n. The Atlas Upgrade strengthens this benefit by incorporating real-time risk monitoring tools, like RedStone\u2019s Credora platform, which provides dynamic credit scoring for DeFi protocols, according to the\nFinanceFeeds report\n.\nSuch safeguards are crucial for institutional adoption. The Ethereum Protocol Advocacy Alliance (EPAA) emphasizes that decentralized governance and non-custodial systems are key to earning institutional trust, as reported in the\nBlockchain Reporter article\n. ZKsync\u2019s latest upgrade supports these values, delivering an infrastructure that is both transparent and privacy-preserving, and aligns with regulatory standards. For instance, a pension fund looking to invest in DeFi can now use ZKsync\u2019s zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions while maintaining user privacy\u2014a balance that previous blockchain systems struggled to achieve.\nInvestment Readiness: Capital Inflows and Market Response\nThe market has already responded positively. After the Atlas Upgrade was announced, ZKsync\u2019s native token (ZK) jumped by about 50%, reflecting strong investor belief in its future potential, as covered in the\nFinanceFeeds report\n. This surge is further supported by ZKsync\u2019s strategic collaborations, such as a $19 million Series A investment round co-led for"

                "body": "Solana Eyes $1 Boom, Ethereum's November Forecast Turns Bullish, While BlockDAG's $435M+ Presale Nears Final Countdown\nAs November unfolds, three cryptocurrencies are commanding attention for very different reasons. Solana (SOL) continues to lead on performance, fuelled by institutional adoption and rapid ecosystem growth in stablecoins and tokenized assets. Ethereum (ETH), despite recent price dips, remains the market's benchmark for innovation, with its November forecast pointing toward renewed strength driven by whale accumulation and strong on-chain fundamentals.Yet it's BlockDAG (BDAG) https://blockdag.network/ that's defying all expectations, entering its final presale stage at $0.005 after raising over $435 million and attracting more than 312,000 holders. With the Value Era underway, BlockDAG's momentum signals that early backers are witnessing more than just a presale; it's a shift in crypto leadership. In a market built on timing, Solana's ecosystem growth, Ethereum's November forecast, and BlockDAG's rise define where conviction meets opportunity.\nSolana (SOL) Ecosystem Growth Accelerates Amid Institutional Demand\nSolana is fast becoming one of the strongest contenders in the growing stablecoin and tokenization market. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, Solana's advanced technology and speed give it an edge as stablecoins expand beyond crypto trading into global payments and finance. He predicts the infrastructure supporting tokenized assets could grow tenfold, positioning Solana to capture a major share of this trillion-dollar opportunity.\nWhat makes Solana worth considering for investors is its momentum with institutional players. Big firms are beginning to build stablecoin and tokenization products on Solana due to its high throughput and low transaction costs. This combination of speed, adoption, and growing real-world use cases strengthens its long-term potential. For those seeking a blockchain project with both scalability and institutional appeal, Solana's progress could signal one of the strongest investment opportunities in the coming cycle.\nEthereum (ETH) November Forecast Signals Renewed Market Strength\nEthereum's price action in November often reveals opportunity hidden beneath short-term volatility. Despite a recent 6.8% drop, historical data shows Ethereum has averaged around 6.9% gains in November over the past eight years. This seasonal strength, combined with growing institutional activity, suggests a potential turning point ahead. On-chain metrics back this up, large holders have increased their positions, and Ethereum's NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) indicator signals reduced selling pressure. This points to quiet accumulation rather than panic selling.\nFor investors, this creates an interesting setup: Ethereum is undervalued relative to its fundamentals, yet whales are positioning early for possible recovery. While crypto always carries risk, Ethereum's track record of innovation and adoption continues to anchor its long-term potential. For those seeking a strategic entry point into a proven blockchain asset, November could offer a timely opportunity to look closer.\nBlockDAG's $435M Presale Enters Final Countdown Phase\nBlockDAG has officially stepped into its most defining moment, the Value Era. With only 4.3B coins remaining and the presale price locked at $0.005 in Batch 32, the countdown to February 10, 2026, has begun. The numbers alone tell a powerful story: $435 million+ raised, 20,000+ miners sold, 312,000+ holders, and an active community of 3.5 million X1 app users. These milestones underline a project that has outgrown the label of a typical presale; it's a movement that's changing how investors see early blockchain opportunities.\nThis is the final chance to buy before the allotted coins are sold out. Once the presale closes, entry points will move to exchange listings potentially at much higher prices. Institutional buyers have already shown interest, adding credibility to BlockD"

                "source": "Cryptopolitan",

                "body": "Solana\u2019s explosive rise is still one of the biggest wealth-building stories in recent crypto years. Smart investors who rode that wave are now scanning the market for the next crypto to explode before the next major bull leg starts. While many altcoins are already overextended or trading near cycle highs, the spotlight is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new DeFi token priced at only $0.035 that is quickly building a reputation as the top crypto with asymmetric upside potential.\nAdding an element of greater urgency is that Stage 6 of the MUTM presale is almost completely sold out, with a staggering 85% already earmarked for purchase, a clear sign of stepped-up demand and growing FOMO in those that have so far invested. Those who recognized Solana\u2019s breakout potential early didn\u2019t wait for mainstream confirmation, they acted when the value was still hidden. The same pattern is emerging here: MUTM is still under $0.05, still pre-exchange, and still in accumulation territory, exactly the zone where life-changing gains are made for those who move before the masses.\nSolana Price Prediction\nSolana is displaying a sign of trying to recover after reverting from its rising trendline support, thus forming a possible short-term relief rally setup. Technical analysis indicates that SOL will likely target the $180 area, which meets several technical resistances, including its upper channel line, previous resistance points, as well as the 0.5-level of Fibonacci retracement of its recent drop. This area is most likely where bears will re-enter, thus forming a possible lower high (LH) formation.\nFailure of SOL to overshoot through the $180 barrier with good market volume will clearly show that a realistic switch to the $125-$135 area is likely, which matches its previous accumulation points as well as its lower channel line. On a short-term perspective, an oversold Stochastic RSI making a positive curl is a clear sign that new buying is already building in strength, thus supporting a possible short-term bounce before a deeper trend is determined.\nThis is a situation that is attracting a lot of traders\u2019 attention, although it also points towards why investors are looking at cheaper high-upside alternatives in the market, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerging as one of the most popular early market projects.\na New Era of Decentralized Finance\nMutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the most innovative and influential initiatives within DeFi. The current presale has been performing above estimates, attracting over 17,800 participants while securing a total of over 18.5 million in contributions. This is a clear reflection of increasing market confidence in investors, as Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the most attractive cryptos in the market today\nEssentially, Mutuum Finance brings in a new kind of decentralized lending and borrowing system based on transparency, stability, and fairness. It enables lenders to define conditions of repayment while granting borrowers flexible interest rates aligned with market trends. This balanced and flexible system provides a more efficient and trustworthy alternative to traditional DeFi lending platforms\nDefining a Future Standard of DeFi Platforms\nThrough the creation of a system whereby lenders and borrowers conduct their business in an open and fair manner, Mutuum Finance is setting a precedent that will define the decentralized finance market of the future. Its strategy focuses on reliability, empowerment of the community, and economic functionality in a manner that makes it an exceptional coin in the changing DeFi market.\nMutuum Finance has already managed to raise over $18.5 million and attract well over 17,800 presale participants at a stage where its presale Stage 6 is already over 85% sold out at a price of only $0.035. This is a clear sign of its popularity and an increasing recognition that it is likely to have a similar start to that of market successes such as Solana before it went mainstream."

The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) has accumulated $545 million in net inflows since its October 28 debut, including $223 million in seed capital, signaling strong institutional demand even as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs lost over $2.6 billion combined. Despite the macro drag from U.S. fiscal uncertainty and a government shutdown, Solana remains a rare standout with consistent daily ETF inflows over eight consecutive sessions\u2014an unprecedented feat for a new altcoin product.\nInstitutional Demand: Solana\u2019s ETF Momentum and Capital Rotation\nThe steady inflows into BSOL contrast sharply with Bitcoin\u2019s outflows, showing a rotation in institutional preference. Asset managers and hedge funds appear to be reallocating exposure toward high-throughput blockchains like Solana as yield and staking mechanics offer better returns. The ETF\u2019s 100% staking feature has made it attractive to investors seeking yield-linked exposure without direct custody risk. Grayscale\u2019s Solana Trust ETF (GSOL) has also gained traction with $114 million in inflows, most from seed investors. Collectively, Solana ETFs now account for over $650 million in new capital within two weeks\u2014an extraordinary figure in a market still reeling from a 16% correction in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nCorrelation With Bitcoin: The 0.97 Shadow That Governs Price Action\nSolana\u2019s near-perfect 0.97 correlation with Bitcoin underscores its dependency on macro crypto flows. With Bitcoin oscillating around the $100,000 level, Solana\u2019s volatility mirrors every BTC downtick, reinforcing its role as a high-beta proxy within the digital asset space. The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) indicator for SOL recently entered the capitulation zone, a region historically followed by accumulation. When this metric compresses, long-term holders typically stop selling, setting the stage for recovery once BTC stabilizes. The data suggests that capitulation could morph into an accumulation cycle near $150\u2013$155, particularly if Bitcoin volatility cools.\nTechnical Pressure Points: From Breakdown to Recovery Zones\nTechnically, Solana broke down from a symmetrical triangle pattern, breaching the $178\u2013$180 support that aligned with its 21-day EMA and 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. The new lower low at $158 forms the first defense line for short-term traders. Below $155, the structure weakens, exposing $146\u2013$140 as the deeper demand area. On the upside, a reclaim of $165 would invalidate the bearish breakdown, setting the stage for a retest of $175\u2013$190, while a decisive break above $200 reopens the $250 target projected by medium-term DeFi growth models. The Bollinger Band Width Percentile at 65% suggests rising volatility, hinting that a sharp move is imminent\u2014likely catalyzed by ETF flows or Bitcoin stabilization.\nOn-Chain Strength: 70M Daily Transactions and $143B DEX Volume\nWhile the market focuses on price weakness, Solana\u2019s network metrics remain stellar. October alone saw 70 million daily transactions and $143 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, outpacing rivals like Cardano and Avalanche. Its 1,100 transactions per second (TPS) throughput and high validator participation continue to solidify its standing as the most efficient Layer-1 chain for DeFi and NFTs. Institutional developers, including Visa and Shopify integrations, continue to expand on Solana, reflecting a maturing ecosystem insulated from short-term volatility.\nETF Catalyst vs. Retail Fatigue: The Diverging Flows\nInstitutional buying contrasts shar"

                "body": "NEW YORK -- Stocks wavered to a mixed finish on Wall Street Friday and notched their first weekly loss in the last four.\nMajor indexes wobbled throughout most of the week, but ultimately pulled back from records set the prior week. Technology stocks once again determined the broader direction of the market.\nThe S&P 500 spent most of the day in the red and was down as much as 1.3%. It ultimately eked out a gain, rising 8.48 points, or 0.1%, to close at 6,728.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average made a similar reversal and rose 74.80 points, or 0.2%, to close at 46,987.10.\nThe technology-heavy Nasdaq was down as much as 2.1% at one point during trading, but recovered most of the losses. It fell 49.46 points, or 0.2%, to 23,004.54.\nThe market was weighed down by technology stocks, especially several big names with huge valuations that give them outsized influence over the direction of the market. Google's parent company, Alphabet, fell 2.1% and Broadcom fell 1.7%.\nWall Street remained focused on the latest quarterly reports and forecasts from U.S. companies.\nPayments company Block, which operates the Square and Cash App businesses, sank 7.7% after turning in results that fell short of forecasts. Exercise equipment maker Peloton jumped 14.2% after its results beat estimates.\nExpedia Group surged 17.5% after beating analysts' quarterly earnings forecasts.\nMore than 90% of companies within the S&P 500 have reported earnings for their latest quarter. Most companies have reported growth beyond Wall Street expectations and the influential tech sector has the strongest growth, according to data from FactSet.\nCorporate profits and forecasts were already being scrutinized by Wall Street as investors try to gauge whether the market's overall high value is justified. The results have taken on more significance amid a lack of other data about the economy because of the U.S. government shutdown, which is now the longest on record.\nThe shutdown is now responsible for yet another missing economic report typically relied on by Wall Street and economists. The monthly employment data for October was unavailable, as was the monthly data for September previously. The lack of data on employment is especially troubling because the job market was already weakening.\nWall Street still has several private sources of economic data to turn to, outside of earnings. The latest came Friday from the University of Michigan, with its monthly consumer sentiment report. The latest report showed that consumer sentiment fell sharply from a month ago and hit a three-year low. Economists had expected a slight increase.\n\"Consumers are starting to get concerned about the potential effects of the government's shutdown on economic activity,\" Eugenio Aleman, chief economist for Raymond James, wrote in a note to investors.\nThe survey also showed that inflation expectations edged slightly higher. Government data on consumer prices and other measures of inflation are among the information Wall Street and others lack because of the government shutdown. Inflation has been stubbornly high and remains a key concern, especially amid a volatile U.S. trade war that could add fuel to rising inflation.\nThe lack of inflation and employment data is a problem for the Federal Reserve, which has signaled a more cautious approach on interest rate cuts moving forward. Wall Street's big gains this year have been partly due to anticipation for interest rate cuts, which can help stimulate the economy by making loans less expensive.\nThe Fed has already cut its benchmark rate twice this year as it tries to counter the impact that a weakening employment market could have on economic growth. Cutting rates could worsen inflation at a time when levels are stubbornly higher than the central bank's 2% goal, however.\nWall Street is still mostly betting that the Fed will cut interest rates at its December meeting. Investors are forecasting a 67% chance of another interest rate cut, according to CME FedWat"

                "body": "No one wants to buy Roomba maker iRobot anymore, and bankruptcy could be next\nIs this the beginning of the end for Roomba?\nAccording to the robot vacuum maker, iRobot, it's a real possibility.\niRobot was banking on a $1.7 billion acquisition deal from Amazon, which fell apart due to regulatory issues in January 2024. Since then, iRobot has been looking for a buyer to solve its financial woes.\nOn Monday, iRobot shared in a regulatory filing with the SEC that talks with the last remaining potential buyer have fallen through, as CNBC reported. The company says the bidder offered a \"significantly lower\" price per share than what the Roomba maker's stocks currently trade at.\niRobot's stock dropped 33 percent on this news.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe currently are not in advanced negotiations with any alternative counterparties to a potential sale or strategic transaction,\u201d iRobot wrote in a regulatory filing with the SEC. \u201cAs such, there remains no assurance that our review of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction or outcome.\u201d\nWhile Roombas were once synonymous with robot vacuums in general, in recent years, the company has faced steeper competition from competing brands like Shark. Mashable shopping reporters have found Roombas often lag behind rival vacuums in testing. Robot vacuums have also evolved considerably, and new flagship robot vacuums now offer smart laser mapping, mopping, and self-cleaning. But over the past few years, iRobot has struggled to keep up with the competition.\niRobot has also faced considerable revenue problems in recent years and has struggled to pay debts.\nIn July 2023, iRobot took out a $200 million loan to keep operations afloat, with the expectation that the company would soon be acquired by Amazon. Now, iRobot needs to find new funding, and fast, or the company says it \"may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely see bankruptcy protection.\"\nThis latest news isn't a total surprise.\nWhen the company shared its financials in March, iRobot warned that it could be out of business within 12 months. And it seems not much has changed since March, aside from the fact that we are now much closer to that 12-month mark."

                "body": "Some \u2018good news\u2019 for mortgage borrowers despite base rate being maintained\nMortgage borrowers can still find cause for optimism as numerous lenders continue to reduce fixed rates, even after the Bank of England maintained its base rate at 4 per cent on Thursday, experts have said.\nDespite the decision to hold rates, positive signals emerged from the Bank, which indicated that inflation has now reached its peak and is anticipated to fall in the coming months.\nBank governor Andrew Bailey stated that a cut to the base rate would only occur once \"we need to be sure that inflation is on track to return to our 2% target.\"\nAlice Haine, a personal finance analyst at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said: \u201cFor mortgaged homeowners, the headline interest rate may not have shifted, but the good news is that mortgage affordability has improved for some.\n\u201cFive rate cuts since last summer, a more relaxed lending environment, slower house price growth and strong wage gains have helped to ease affordability pressures. However, today\u2019s decision to hold rates, coupled with uncertainty over potential property tax hikes in the upcoming Budget may feel unsettling for homeowners and prospective buyers alike.\u201d\nDavid Hollingworth, associate director at L&C Mortgages, said: \u201cThe fact that the outlook for rates has improved has already resulted in a reduction to the cost of funds for lenders and there\u2019s been a raft of cuts to fixed rates already.\n\u201cMost major lenders have trimmed back their rates in the last couple of weeks, which has helped bring rates back down.\n\u201cThat does mean that the expected cuts to base rate are therefore already being priced into fixed mortgage deals, whereas tracker rates will only react once the base rate is cut.\u201d\nMatt Smith, a mortgages expert at Rightmove, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve started to see some lenders become more competitive in certain segments of the mortgage market in recent days, and offer some headline-grabbing cheaper rates, as they look to secure some final business before the end of the year.\u201d\nAccording to figures from UK Finance, 1.6 million fixed mortgages were due to expire in 2025, of which many will have already done so, and 1.8 million deals are set to end in 2026.\nSeveral mortgage lenders have launched new rates this week, including Nationwide Building Society, Lloyds and Halifax.\nHSBC UK also announced this week that it has introduced a new maximum mortgage loan-to-income (LTI) ratio of up to 6.5 times annual income for its Premier customers.\nTo qualify for HSBC Premier, customers must have an annual income of at least \u00a3100,000 paid into an HSBC Premier account, or hold \u00a3100,000 or more in savings or investments with the bank.\nLorna Hopes, mortgage specialist at chartered financial advisers Smith & Pinching, said: \u201cCompetition between lenders had been heating up before today, and the small print behind the Bank\u2019s decision could now light the touchpaper on a fixed rate price war.\u201d\nFrances Haque, chief economist at Santander UK, said lower swap rates have enabled lenders to cut mortgage rates, adding: \u201cWe hope to see the market stay on this positive and upward trend \u2013 with modest house price growth to continue as we near the end of the year.\n\u201cWhether or not we\u2019ll see a base rate reduction before the end of 2025 will depend heavily on what comes out of the Budget, and whether we see recent positive trends in inflation and wage growth continue in upcoming data releases.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nTony Hall, head of business development at Saffron for Intermediaries, said: \u201cBorrowers may start to see greater choice in the months ahead if price pressures continue to ease.\u201d\nJason Tebb, president of OnTheMarket, said: \u201cThe vote was close with the rate setters voting by a majority of five to four to hold rates.\n\u201cWhile this will be disappointing news for those borrowers who had hoped for a rate cut this time around, it may mean the next reduction is not too far off.\u201d\nAccording to Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, the average two-year fixed mortgag"

Still, automakers managed to buck the trend, thanks to newfound relief in chip supplies that gave the sector a lift.\nWhat does this mean?\nGermany\u2019s monthly trade surplus missed expectations in September, landing at 15.3 billion euros versus August\u2019s 16.9 billion and economists\u2019 forecasts. While exports crept up 1.4%\u2014a hint of resilience\u2014imports surged 3.1%, showing strong demand but also squeezing the surplus. ING analysts pointed out that although exports aren\u2019t in freefall, any comeback has been slow going, with lingering global headwinds still a challenge for Germany\u2019s export machine. But not all was bleak: the Dutch government gave Nexperia the green light to export chips worldwide, resolving a dispute with China that had bogged down carmakers. That, along with improving US-China trade ties, sent BMW, Volkswagen, and Mercedes-Benz shares higher\u2014even as Daimler Truck Holding slipped following underwhelming earnings.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Mixed signals for Germany\u2019s economic engine.\nThe DAX\u2019s dip highlights concerns about Germany\u2019s ability to drive growth, given ongoing structural challenges and unpredictable global demand. Yet the immediate bounce in auto stocks after the Nexperia decision shows how addressing supply bottlenecks can quickly restore confidence in crucial industries. Looking ahead, investors will be watching whether Germany\u2019s manufacturing and export sectors can bounce back and adapt to ever-changing global trends.\nThe bigger picture: Trade flows reflect a changing world.\nGermany\u2019s trade data underscores how even leading export economies are feeling the pinch from global policy shifts and supply chain turmoil. While signs of easing US-China tensions and chip supply relief bode well, Germany\u2019s industries still face a tough balancing act in a shifting geopolitical and economic landscape. The response from key sectors like autos could end up shaping Europe\u2019s broader outlook.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

The Stoxx Europe, DAX, FTSE 100, CAC, and Swiss Market Index all dipped into negative territory, weighed down by a further slump in construction activity. The HCOB Eurozone Construction PMI slipped to 44.0 in October, signaling a deepening decline, while the UK\u2019s construction PMI fell to 44.1 \u2013 its worst reading in over five years, and a run not seen since the global financial crisis. Retail activity also stayed muted, with euro area retail volumes down 0.1% for September and sharper drops in places like Lithuania and Latvia. Not even a minor bump in German manufacturing output could offset a 1% annual decline. On the company front, UBS shares slipped after revealing plans to wind down several invoice finance funds linked to riskier debt, and Smith & Nephew shares tumbled on weaker-than-expected revenue growth.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Growth headwinds shape investor caution.\nOngoing contractions in construction and soft retail figures are turning up the pressure on European equities. Major indices remain under stress, with sectors tied to consumer demand or more cyclical industries especially at risk for more bumps ahead as growth continues to slow. The surprises from UBS and Smith & Nephew only reinforce investors\u2019 skittishness \u2013 keeping a close eye on corporate debt and earnings could be crucial in the coming months.\nThe bigger picture: European recovery faces more setbacks.\nWeak construction and lackluster retail sales have added fresh doubts to hopes for Europe\u2019s post-pandemic recovery. While certain areas, like German manufacturing, show some strength, ongoing sector weaknesses could hold back hiring and investment. Policymakers are now left weighing support for the economy against persistent inflation risks \u2013 which could mean the path back to sustained growth proves rockier than first thought.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

The S & P 500 fell 1.6% for the week. Both stock measures broke three-week winning streaks.This week's market decline, which followed a strong October, can be chalked up to two reasons. First, investors grew concerned about the eye-watering valuations of stocks tied to artificial intelligence. Case in point: Nvidia lost its $5 trillion market cap designation in a weekly loss of 7%. The weakness in Nvidia was exacerbated by the realization that China would not be opening back up in a meaningful way for the powerhouse of AI chips. While management has not included China sales in its outlook for months, many investors still thought it could happen. Still, we maintain our long-held \"own it, don't trade\" thesis on Nvidia. .SPX .IXIC 5D mountain S & P 500 and Nasdaq weekly performance Second, there were emerging signs that the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history, was starting to harm the economy. Job cuts last month reached their highest levels for any October in 22 years, according to Thursday's reading from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. A day later, the latest monthly consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan registered nearly its worst reading ever. These reports from private organizations have taken on added importance since the shutdown, which started on Oct. 1 and has delayed most government economic data. During this week of market turmoil, we executed three trades. On Monday, we added to our Starbucks position. The stock has taken a beating with other restaurant names on fears of a weakening consumer. In this case, we think the decline is overblown. After all, the turnaround story under CEO Brian Niccol remains strong. \"With shares trading back to their 'Liberation Day' tariffs lows in early April, we see this recent weakness as an opportunity to slowly scoop up more,\" Jeff Marks, the Investing Club's director of portfolio analysis, wrote in a trade alert. \"Niccol has embarked on an ambitious plan to bring back the coffeehouse atmosphere and fix its stores through a new operating and staffing model called Green Apron Service . It's taken a few quarters, but the turn has finally started.\" The Club also snapped up more Boeing stock Tuesday. Shares dropped significantly after the aircraft maker's earnings report last week, caused by a larger-than-expected charge on its 777X program. Yes, the quarter was a frustrating setback. But the decline presented a great opportunity for long-term investors like us. \"The turnaround under Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg is still progressing nicely, driven by better execution on its 737 program,\" Marks wrote in a trade alert. \"With production moving from 38 airplanes per month to 42 \u2014 then eventually 47 and 52 under FAA guidance in the future \u2014 Boeing's ability to make and deliver more planes will lead to strong free cash flow generation in the years ahead.\" The market's pullback Thursday gave us a chance to buy more GE Vernova stock. Shares have tumbled as AI-linked names have been scrutinized for their valuations. That's because GE Vernova is one of the world's largest producers of gas-fired turbines, which are used to create electricity and electrification products found in data centers. The company's sales heavily benefit from the insatiable demand for more energy due to the frantic AI infrastructure race. \"We are using this downturn to buy more shares since we still have a positive long-term outlook on the need for increased electricity investment,\" Marks wrote in another trade alert. Eli Lilly made headlines this week. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a GLP-1 pricing deal with Lilly and rival drugmaker Novo Nordisk that would lower prices for certain weight-loss treatments in exchange for coverage in Medicare and Medicaid programs.

While the headline numbers were soft, we believe that investors might be missing some encouraging factors.\nThe Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit\nTo properly understand CoStar Group's profit results, we need to consider the US$18m expense attributed to unusual items. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect CoStar Group to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On CoStar Group's Profit Performance\nUnusual items (expenses) detracted from CoStar Group's earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that CoStar Group's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. If you want to do dive deeper into CoStar Group, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

I really don\u2019t give a s---,\" Maher said. \"I was reading \u2014 it shows you how the media is. Everything is always on one side or the other. When [Trump] first mentioned it, it was all about, \u2018Oh, my God, he\u2019s desecrating the White House.\u2019 Then I finally read, \u2018Oh, well, they\u2019ve done s--- to the White House before.\u2019\"\n\"It\u2019s just a building, I think,\" he added.\nRejecting the White House\u2019s current setup, where state dinners have been held in tents, Maher exclaimed, \"This is America!\"\nWHITE HOUSE MAKEOVERS HAVE LONG SPARKED CONTROVERSY, WELL BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S $200M BALLROOM\nAside from criticizing the media's \"one side or the other\" coverage of the remodel, Maher suggested that the ballroom may actually be a worthwhile investment, considering state dinners are currently hosted \"in a tent.\"\n\"Also, I realized after reading other people, we don\u2019t have a place when they have state dinners,\" he said. \"They\u2019re doing it in a tent! This is America! So do I give a s--- that he\u2019s doing this to the White House? I really don\u2019t.\"\nMaher also pointed to the fact that the ballroom is being funded by \"private money,\" and isn't being subsidized by American tax dollars.\nThis isn't the HBO host's first time commenting on Trump's ballroom project. Last month he sounded the alarm on the \"symbolism\" behind the president's addition to the White House and revealed what \"bothers\" him about the demolition of the East Wing.\nBILL MAHER SAYS TRUMP'S CONSTRUCTION OF 'GIANT BALLROOM' MEANS 'HE'S NOT LEAVING\u2019 THE WHITE HOUSE\n\"The symbolism is he\u2019s not leaving,\" Maher told his panel. \"Who puts in a giant ballroom if you\u2019re leaving?\"\nAlthough Maher objected to Trump\u2019s demolition, he sparred with former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele over whether the White House is \"just a building.\"\n\"We watched this week the destruction of a symbol of this government,\" Steele lamented. \"Of our democracy, of our pluralistic society.\"\n\"You\u2019re talking about the White House?\" Maher countered. \"Oh, it\u2019s a building, Mike.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nLater in the segment, Steele said that Trump had torn the East Wing down \"without accountability.\" The late-night host said he agreed with Steele on that.\n\"You know, he should have gotten the permits, but that's how he does things,\" Maher said. \"I agree, but it is just a building, first of all.\"\n\"That part of the building wasn't always there,\" he continued. \"Presidents do change the buildings. Nixon put in a bowling alley. Obama made the tennis court a basketball court. I can't get this mad about everything, Mike. I just can't.\"\nTrump\u2019s privately funded $200 million White House ballroom is the latest \"bold, necessary addition\" to the executive residence, officials said, describing the East Wing construction as a continuation of presidential upgrades dating back more than a century.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThroughout its 223-year history, the iconic residence has seen numerous updates \u2014 both large and small \u2014 under nearly every administration.\nFox News' Ashley J.
