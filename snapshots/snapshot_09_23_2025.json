                "body": "Key Takeaways\n- Gold surged to a fresh record high on Monday after notching its first inflation-adjusted record since 1980 earlier this month.\n- Gold prices have been boosted by several interconnected factors: geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, a weaker U.S. dollar, and the interest rate outlook.\n- Veteran bond trader Jeffrey Gundlach last week forecast gold would reach $4,000 an ounce before the end of the year, and said a 25% allocation to the precious metal was \"not excessive\" given underlying trends.\nGold prices climbed to a record high Monday, extending a blistering rally that experts don't expect to end anytime soon.\nGold futures surged 2% Monday to trade at an all-time high of about $3,780 an ounce. The real gold price, which adjusts for inflation, hit a record high earlier this month for the first time since 1980.1\nIn a note on Monday, Deutsche Bank analysts forecast that gold prices could rise above $4,000 by the end of 2025, implying a full-year return of more than 50%.1 That kind of price appreciation would make gold the year\u2019s best-performing asset and likely put it in the top decile of S&P 500 stocks, on par with Nvidia (NVDA).\nWhat This Means for Investors\nInvestors often acquire gold as a hedge against inflation, political turmoil and economic uncertainty, and some investing experts recommend increasing exposure to the precious metal given current market conditions. Bullion, as well as exchange-traded funds tied to gold or to shares of miners, could provide entry points\nThe reasons behind gold's stellar year are plentiful and interrelated. Central bank demand, a weaker dollar, President Donald Trump's tariffs, and interest rates all bear some responsibility and are expected to continue to support gold prices in the coming months.\nCentral Banks Are Buying Gold Despite Record Prices\nConflict in Europe and the Middle East, as well as simmering tensions between the U.S. and China, have given central banks around the world reason to be major buyers of gold this year.\nAccording to the World Gold Council\u2019s 2025 Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey, 95% of central bankers expect global gold reserves to increase this year, and a record 43% forecast their own bank\u2019s reserves would increase over the same period. No respondents said they expected their reserves to decline this year, despite record gold prices.2\nGeopolitical crises are a major reason central banks add to their gold reserves. Gold\u2019s performance during times of crisis was either highly or somewhat relevant to their gold portfolio, said 85% of respondents, and 71% cited its role as a geopolitical risk hedge.\nGold buying is also being driven by a desire to diversify reserves. Nearly three-quarters of respondents expect the U.S. dollar\u2019s share of global reserves to decline over the next year as banks add gold and other currencies such as the euro and Chinese renminbi.\nA Weaker Dollar Could Be Another Tailwind\nThe value of the U.S. dollar has declined precipitously this year amid a dramatic reset of the domestic and international economic outlooks.\nThe U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, has declined more than 10% this year. The vast majority of the index\u2019s losses came when trade uncertainty and global tensions were at their highest from early March to early July.\nRelated Education\nConcerns that tariffs and Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown would slow U.S. growth, and potentially push the economy into a recession, weighed on the dollar through those months. The decline may have also partially been driven by de-dollarization or the \u201cSell America\u201d trade, in which foreign investors, spooked by the Trump administration, dumped dollars and Treasurys.\nA weaker greenback is expected to continue to be a tailwind for gold, which is priced in dollars, through the rest of the year.\n\u201cI think almost certainly gold will close above $4,000 before the end of this year,\u201d Jeffrey Gundlach, the founder and CEO of inve"

                "body": "Why Gold Is Surging 40% in 2025 Amid Rising Inflation\nHigher inflation is coming... and gold is already flashing the warning.\nThe precious yellow metal has surged 40% this year, currently trading around $3,670 per ounce. It is setting one record high after another.\nThere's good reason for gold's rise. It stands apart from politics and credit. It can't be printed. It can't be defaulted on. And when governments start to lose credibility, gold becomes the store of value the smart money runs to.\nThat's exactly what's happening now...\nU.S. Deficits, Rate Cuts, and the Inflationary Pressure on the Dollar\nU.S. deficits are out of control. We're talking about a $1.9 trillion per year shortfall and rising.\nThe biggest annual budget items are locked in place: $1.7 trillion for Medicaid and Medicare, $1.5 trillion for Social Security, $927 billion for war, and over $1 trillion to pay the interest on the debt.\nLast Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cut the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points \u2013 down to a range from 4% to 4.25%. It was the Fed's first rate cut in nine months. And it's easy to see why.\nThere's nowhere else to cut...\nIt's obvious the political class will not make any real cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, Social Security, or the War Department's budget. The failure of the modest goals of the Department of Government Efficiency (\"DOGE\") before it ever really got started... proves there's no political will.\nThat means no cuts will be made in terms of any of the big expenditures that matter in terms of getting government spending under control. So the deficit will grow.\nBut as the saying goes, \"there's no free lunch.\" The pressure has to be released somewhere, and the escape valve is the U.S. dollar.\nThat's why Powell cut interest rates into an inflationary environment... He had no choice.\nThe only palatable solution at this point is to cut federal interest payments and to stimulate the economy so tax receipts rise and the deficit narrows.\nThe timing couldn't be worse.\nThe Fed's latest rate cut comes as the consumer price index (\"CPI\") spiked to 2.9% in August. That's up from 2.5% a year ago, and up above the Fed's 2% target. The CPI has risen every month since bottoming in April at 2.3%.\nCore inflation \u2013 which excludes volatile food and energy prices \u2013 has been running even hotter for the past few months, at 3.1%.\nWhy the Dollar Is Failing as a Long-Term Store of Value\nMoney has three primary purposes: being a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.\nThe dollar still works fine for the first two. You can spend it anywhere and know exactly what the price means.\nBust as a store of value? Inflation eats away at it every year. Think of the dollar \u2013 and other fiat currencies \u2013 as a bucket with a hole in it. The more money and debt created, the faster it leaks.\nIt's why most people are better off holding investments like stocks, real estate, and gold over the long term rather than cash.\nUncoincidentally, the average gold price was $40.80 per ounce in 1971. Since then, the U.S. national debt has grown 94-fold. Multiply $40.80 by 94 times, and you get $3,835 per ounce.\nIt's not an exact science. Gold is volatile and subject to extreme price swings.\nBut the point still holds... The price of gold is heavily influenced by debt creation.\nWith U.S. government spending out of control, many countries are moving their financial reserves out of the dollar and into gold.\nCentral Banks Shift Reserves\nAccording to 2024 data, the U.S. dollar makes up 46% of global reserves \u2013 down from around 55% a decade ago. Gold has now surpassed the euro and comprises 20% of global reserves \u2013 trailing only the dollar.\nFor the first time since 1996, foreign central banks are holding more gold than U.S. Treasurys. And that's not by accident.\nAs the U.S. fiscal problem becomes more acute, we expect central banks' gold holdings to trend higher.\nCentral banks are navigating massive government debt, a global trade war, monetary expansion, i"

The global benchmark has traded between $65.50 and $69 since early August.\nInvest in Gold\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI)contract for October, expiring on Monday, closed down at $62.64 a barrel, down 4 cents, or 0.1%. The more actively traded second-month contract was down 12 cents, or 0.2%, at $62.28.\n\"Traders are back to focusing on a possibly over-supplied global oil market that is soon to come, unless the U.S. and EU can agree on harsher tariffs on countries that purchase Russian crude,\" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.\nIraq, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' second-largest producer, has increased oil exports under an OPEC+ agreement, state oil marketer SOMO said. It also expects September's exports to range from 3.4 million to 3.45 million barrels per day (bpd).\nKuwait's crude oil production capacity stands at 3.2 million bpd, the highest assessment in more than 10 years, Oil Minister Tariq Al-Roumi told local newspaper Al Qabas.\nU.S. equities, which often move in tandem with oil, dipped amid a visa crackdown and guesswork about the Federal Reserve's next interest rate moves.\nFed officials cast doubt on the need for further rate cuts at a time when inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target and the job market remains near full employment. Lower borrowing costs typically boost oil demand.\nTensions rose in the Middle East over several Western nations recognising a Palestinian state, as well as in Eastern Europe after Estonia said Russian fighter jets had entered its airspace without permission on Friday. But none of these developments resulted in an immediate oil supply disruption.\nBrent and WTI settled down more than 1% on Friday to mark a slight decline last week as worries about large supplies and declining demand weighed on sentiment.\n\"The setup for the oil market is that global oil demand is set to taper off from Q3 to Q4 and again to Q1-26. At the same time production by OPEC+ is on a rising path,\" said SEB analysts.\n\"The big question is, of course, if China will stockpile the increasing surplus or whether the oil price will be pushed lower into the 50s. We believe the latter.\"\nIraq has also given preliminary approval to a plan to resume pipeline oil exports from its semi-autonomous Kurdistan region through Turkey, sources told Reuters.\n(Additional reporting by Florence Tan and Mohi Narayan; Editing by Bernadette Baum, Joe Bavier, William Maclean and Marguerita Choy)"

                "body": "Oil markets enter late September 2025 under pressure from shifting macro signals and diverging supply-demand forecasts. The Federal Reserve\u2019s latest projections paint a weaker employment picture, weighing on energy consumption expectations. Meanwhile, OPEC remains optimistic, projecting steady demand growth into 2026. Let\u2019s take a loot at recent inventory data, positioning in the futures market, and key technical levels shaping crude oil\u2019s near-term outlook.\nProduction -0.1% prior +0,54% change -13k bbl with a big draw on headline stocks of -9.285mil. The distillate stock build however neutralised any bullish elements of this report with a weekly build of 4.046mil expected at a build of 975k.\nThe market\u2019s running on thin gruel and contradictory hymn sheets. EIA\u2019s STEO has barrels stacking up into late-\u201925\u2014inventory builds peaking into 4Q25/1Q26\u2014implying softer prices and a curve that can\u2019t justify heroics. Translation: non-OPEC growth plus the OPEC+ unwind keeps the shelves from looking bare, at least on their spreadsheet.\nOPEC reads the tape differently. Their MOMR still hangs its hat on sturdier demand\u2014~1.3 mb/d growth in 2025 and ~1.4 mb/d in 2026\u2014leaning toward a tighter balance as the year wears on and into next. That skew (and their tolerance for \u201cmanaged\u201d supply) says deficits can re-appear if shale cools and maintenance/interruptions bite.\nGoldman pretty bearish on oil.\nI think the bearishness we see in oil right now is directly attributable to the FOMC in which 4.5% unemployment has become the new 4.3% projection to 2025 year-end. This was a much worse picture estimated by The Fed than at the prior meeting. Less employment, less industry, less oil consumption. This is the black hole of selling that front month prices simply can not escape.\nHere is how the projections around uncertainty have grown from the Summary of Economic Projections.\nShort specs covered 12,845 contracts last week, to put this in perspective, this rate of change is larger than 74.6% of all other observations\u2026.EVER.

On September 2nd they added 42k long contracts. They are at a 96.7% all time crowding. Net length 820,579 contracts. The longest they ever go in history was 922,957 contracts on May 15th 2007.\nI am by no means saying we are going back to astro highs like in 2007 as we are a far way off that level of Commercial length. But I do want to highlight that they are in the top 10% concentration here of length.\nCommercial Net longs\nFront month WTI historical non back adjusted.\nWTI C.O.T Commercials long-Seasonal distribution\nWhen I think of Specs, I think of spreaders.

So I monitor to see if specs are increasing or decreasing net directional weight. This gives me insight on their directional bias as a group.\nSpec shorts retreated in the last week and added to the net length by 4,020 contracts. The additional longs -not a massive indication by any means, but its enough to show me they are increasing weight on the long side.\nNet long 278,276\nNet Short 179,567\nSelling continues to balance the market down in the quarterly value area, with QPVAL a firm downside swing target for shorts $59.79\nWTI Front month November futures.

But by midday, some analysts noted plunging oil prices could help gas prices by reducing associated gas production.\nU.S. oil futures fell as much as 34% in their biggest daily rout since the 1991 Gulf War after Saudi Arabia signaled it would hike output to win market share even though the coronavirus has already left the market oversupplied.\nEven before crude futures collapsed, gas prices over the past week had been trading within a nickel of their lowest since August 1998 as record production and mild weather enabled utilities to leave more gas in storage this winter, making fuel shortages and prices spikes unlikely.\nMuch of the growth in gas output was coming from gas associated with the production of oil in shale basins like the Permian in West Texas. Since drillers were seeking oil, that production was insensitive to low gas prices.\n\"A large enough decrease in (oil production in) the Permian could support natural gas prices as a whole,\" Daniel Myers, market analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston, said in a report.\nFront-month gas futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 7.0 cents, or 4.1%, to settle at $1.778 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).\nEarlier in the session, gas slid to $1.61 per MMBtu, its lowest since August 1998. If prices drop below that level, they would fall to their lowest since September 1995.\nRefinitiv, a data provider, projected average demand in the U.S. Lower 48 states, including exports, would rise from 100.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) this week to 107.5 Bcf/d next week.

Gasoline prices are expected to average about $3.10 per gallon this year, down 20 cents per gallon from last year, and fall to an average of $2.90 per gallon in 2026. All regions, except the West Coast, are expected to see prices below $3.00 per gallon next year. California gasoline prices have been averaging $1.50 a gallon above the national average, despite California recently passing legislation to increase onshore oil drilling. The state\u2019s anti-fossil fuel policies have caused two refineries to announce closures \u2014 one this year and one next year.\nThe EIA\u2019s lower oil price forecast is mainly due to large oil inventory builds as OPEC+ members increase production. Though not included in the forecast, OPEC+ recently announced production increases of 137,000 barrels per day beginning in October to supplement its other increases beginning in April. The EIA expects global oil inventory builds will average more than two million barrels per day through the first quarter of 2026, after which a reduction in output by both OPEC+ and some non-OPEC producers is expected to moderate inventory builds.\nGlobal liquids consumption is expected to increase to 103.8 million barrels per day in 2025 and 105.09 million barrels per day in 2026, increasing by 0.9 million barrels per day in 2025 and 1.3 million barrels per day in 2026, driven almost entirely by non-OECD countries. Most non-OECD growth is concentrated in Asia, with liquid fuels consumption in India and China each growing by between 0.4 million barrels per day and 0.5 million barrels per day from 2024 through 2026.\nU.S. gasoline consumption is expected to average 8.9 million barrels per day in 2026, up slightly from 2025, due to the lower price forecast and an upward revision by the Census Bureau of the working age population by 500,000 workers. The EIA expects vehicle miles traveled in 2026 to increase by 0.7%, up from a 0.2% increase in the previous STEO, which is expected to increase gasoline consumption.\nIEA Strikes a Different Tune\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA), in contrast to its net-zero forecasts, is now indicating that new investment in oil and gas is needed to maintain output levels amid faster decline rates at existing fields due to higher reliance on shale and deep offshore resources. In a recent report, the IEA indicated that, in order to maintain current levels of production, more than 45 million barrels per day of oil and around 2,000 billion cubic meters of natural gas would be needed in 2050 from new conventional fields, requiring investment of $540 billion each year through 2050. It said a large gap exists even with projects ramping up and others approved for development and not yet in production. In the absence of upstream investment in oil, the equivalent of Brazil and Norway\u2019s combined production each year would be removed from the global market balance. Finally, the IEA agrees with the oil industry, which has been indicating for years that underinvestment threatens global energy supply.\nTrump Advocates for More U.S. Oil Sales\nPresident Trump wants countries to stop buying Russian oil to help put an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and is advocating for countries to buy more from U.S. companies. On their recent tour of Europe, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum indicated their plans to expand U.S. fossil fuel exports, stating that they were crucial to \u201cpeace and prosperity.\u201d According to the New York Times, their mission in Europe was to secure contracts to sell more American fossil fuels and lobby the European Union to loosen environmental regulations that are too onerous.

                "body": "For the past two years, the United States has set oil production records. This growth is a continuance of the surge in oil production resulting from the shale boom that began earlier this century.\nAccording to data from the Energy Information Administration, U.S. oil production average 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024, up from 12.7 million in 2023 and 12.5 million in 2022.\nIt is now clear that the U.S. is on track this year to set its third consecutive annual record for crude oil production. Year-to-date production through the week ending September 12, 2025 shows a production level of 13.44 million BPD, which is about 1.9% ahead of last year\u2019s record pace.\nBut beneath those headline numbers, a subtle shift is underway: growth is slowing.\nThe slowdown becomes clear if we look at the year-over-year percentage changes over the past 20 years.\nThere have been only two other periods in the past 20 years where U.S. oil production growth slowed for three consecutive years, but both of those instances had extenuating circumstances. The first was from 2014 through 2016, when a price war launched by OPEC triggered a collapse in oil prices and forced U.S. producers to slash drilling activity. The second occurred from 2018 through 2020, ending with the unprecedented demand destruction of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhat makes the current period noteworthy is that it would mark the first three-year slowdown without a major external crisis to blame. This time, the deceleration is being driven largely by internal factors\u2014capital discipline, geology, and infrastructure constraints\u2014rather than a market shock.\nThe New Shape of the Curve\nYear-to-date production growth for 2025 marks a noticeable deceleration compared to the peak shale boom years, when annual growth often ran in the double digits. The Permian Basin, America\u2019s premier oil field, is still producing at record levels, but the gains are smaller. Wells are being drilled and completed more selectively, and producers are spacing wells farther apart to avoid draining reservoirs too quickly.\nThis is not the kind of slowdown that signals crisis. Rather, it reflects a sector that has matured. The \u201cgrowth at any cost\u201d mentality that defined the early shale revolution has given way to a more disciplined, shareholder-focused approach.\nWhy Growth Is Slowing\nSeveral factors are contributing to the slowdown:\n- Capital Discipline: After years of outspending cash flow, most public oil producers now operate under strict capital-allocation frameworks. Management teams have heard investors loud and clear: prioritize free cash flow, not just production volumes. That has meant slower drilling programs and more cash returned to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.\n- Geological Limits: The best drilling acreage\u2014the so-called \u201cTier 1\u201d sweet spots\u2014has been heavily developed over the past decade. While technology continues to improve well productivity, operators are increasingly drilling outside the core, where wells tend to produce less oil and deplete faster.\n- Service Costs and Inflation: Labor shortages, higher steel prices, and rising service costs have also slowed activity. While these costs have moderated from their post-pandemic peaks, they remain elevated compared to pre-2020 levels.\n- Infrastructure Bottlenecks: Takeaway capacity from certain basins, particularly in the Permian, remains a limiting factor. While pipeline expansions are coming online, infrastructure buildout is running just fast enough to keep pace\u2014not enough to enable another breakout surge in production.\nThe result is a measured pace of growth that looks nothing like the wild expansion of 2010\u20132019, when U.S. production more than doubled in less than a decade.\nImplications for Global Markets\nSlower U.S. production growth has implications well beyond the shale patch. For much of the past decade, rising American output helped keep a lid on global oil prices, effectively acting as a cap on OPEC\u2019s pricing power. If growth continue"

                "body": "- EUR/USD forecast partly hinges on PMIs and US inflation data this week\n- Germany\u2019s PMIs could keep the euro supported if numbers improve\n- Fed\u2019s core PCE release on Friday remains the key driver for dollar momentum\nFollowing last week\u2019s rate cut by the Fed, we saw the US dollar regain its poise somewhat, ending on a high on Friday. However, it remains to be seen whether the dollar recovery has any legs. There will be a lot of focus on speeches from Fed officials this week with the FOMC now resuming its easing cycle. Currencies where the central bank has ended or is nearing the end of its easing cycle should outperform the greenback. Chief among them is the euro, with the ECB practically done with rate cuts this year. This should keep the EUR/USD forecast in the bullish territory.\nWill the dollar selling resume?\nPlenty of Federal Reserve voices are lined up this week, likely giving us a clearer picture of how the FOMC is leaning after Powell\u2019s notably cautious tone last week. With the Dot Plot pencilling in two further cuts this year, I can\u2019t see much reason for the dollar to find fresh support \u2013 one can, in fact, argue that it is already looking a touch pricey in the short run.\nThe real question for investors is whether Powell\u2019s hesitation over more aggressive easing is echoed by the wider committee. Today, we\u2019ve got comments expected from hawkish-leaning Hammack, Musalem and Barkin, while Williams should bring the more dovish perspective. Stephen Miran, who backed a 50bp cut last week, will also be speaking. Then tomorrow, Powell himself takes the stage again with an outlook speech that could carry real weight.\nWhat else to watch out for this week?\nThis week promises to be pivotal for the EUR/USD forecast, with a packed economic calendar likely to drive sharp moves in currency markets. Traders will be eyeing global PMIs, the Swiss National Bank\u2019s (SNB) policy announcement, Fedspeak (see above) and the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the core PCE price index. Each of these events has the potential to shift expectations for monetary policy across major economies, setting the stage for volatility in EUR/USD.\n- Global PMIs to provide a snapshot of Eurozone economic health\nThe latest Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) figures are due on Tuesday. These are forward-looking indicators that often provide an early read on economic conditions, sometimes proving more market-moving than hard data. For the eurozone, Germany\u2019s PMI readings will be closely scrutinized, as any signs of stabilization or improvement could support the euro. Conversely, weak figures may reinforce concerns over slowing growth.\nIn the US, the focus will be on employment components, which could reinforce fears of a cooling labour market. Should PMIs disappoint, the dollar may resume its recent slide, opening the door for a EUR/USD rebound. Meanwhile, in the UK, stronger prices paid could highlight inflation concerns, a development that indirectly could weigh on the dollar by dampening expectations for further BoE cuts.\n- Core PCE inflation\nThe highlight of the week will undoubtedly be Friday\u2019s release of the US core PCE index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge. The Fed recently cut rates as expected and signalled two more cuts by year-end, but Powell\u2019s warning that \u201cthere are no risk-free paths\u201d underscores the delicate balance policymakers are trying to strike.\nTariffs remain a wildcard, with risks of reigniting inflationary pressures. If Friday\u2019s PCE data surprises to the upside, inflation concerns could quickly return to the spotlight, boosting the dollar. On the other hand, a softer reading may reinforce dovish expectations and weigh on the greenback, supporting EUR/USD. The University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Inflation Expectations survey will add another layer of insight for traders parsing Fed policy direction.\nTechnical analysis: EUR/USD forecast remains tilted to upside\nThe trend is bullish on the EUR/USD and with rates now testing support here around 1."

                "body": "- EUR/USD manages to regain some composure, retargeting the 1.1800 barrier.\n- The US Dollar faced some renewed selling pressure, eroding part of recent gains.\n- Traders will now look to further Fedspeak comments and PMI data.\nThe Euro (EUR) kicked off the week on a firmer footing, with EUR/USD edging back toward multi-day highs just under the 1.1800 level.\nThe rebound came as the US Dollar (USD) lost some traction, even with Treasury yields still climbing. The US Dollar Index (DXY) gave up part of last week\u2019s post-Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rally, as investors looked ahead to fresh remarks from Fed officials and key business activity surveys on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThe Fed\u2019s ambiguous message\nThe Fed trimmed rates by 25 basis points on September 17, citing cooling in the labour market. Inflation, though, remains a sticking point, with the central bank noting that it is still \u201csomewhat elevated\u201d.\nThe updated dot plot pointed to another 50 basis points of easing before year-end, smaller cuts in 2026 and 2027, and a median 2025 policy rate of 3.6%. Growth projections nudged higher to 1.6%, while unemployment stayed at 4.5% and inflation forecasts were unchanged.\nNot everyone was on board. Incoming governor Stephen Miran argued for a deeper 50bp cut.\nChair Jerome Powell, speaking at his press conference, admitted employment growth has slowed, consumer spending has cooled, and inflation is running at 2.7% on the headline PCE and 2.9% on the core measure. He blamed tariffs for pushing up prices but noted services inflation is easing. Powell described risks as \u201cmore balanced\u201d and stressed the Fed is moving closer to neutral, downplaying the appetite for sharper rate cuts.\nECB holds steady as inflation nears target\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) earlier this month kept all three policy rates unchanged, sticking to its meeting-by-meeting, data-driven approach.\nOfficials said inflation is largely on track with the 2% medium-term target. Core inflation is seen averaging 2.4% in 2025, easing to 1.9% in 2026 and 1.8% in 2027.\nPresident Christine Lagarde described the ECB as being in a \u201cgood place\u201d, with risks more evenly balanced. She reinforced, though, that rate decisions will remain entirely dependent on incoming data.\nTrade tensions cool but tariffs remain\nOn the trade front, tensions between Washington and Beijing eased somewhat after both sides agreed to a 90-day extension of their truce. That said, tariffs are still high: the US continues to tax Chinese goods at 30%, while China applies a 10% tariff on US imports.\nMeanwhile, Washington reached a deal with Brussels: the EU agreed to cut tariffs on US industrial goods and ease access for American farm and seafood exports. In return, the US imposed a 15% tariff on most EU imports. Auto tariffs remain on the table, pending EU regulatory discussions.\nSpeculators trim bullish bets\nSpeculative appetite for the Euro has cooled. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data for the week ending September 16 showed non-commercial net longs falling to five-week lows near 117.8K contracts. Additionally, institutional traders also pared back net shorts to around 167.4K contracts, all amid a drop in open interest to about 855.5K contracts, suggesting fading conviction on both sides.\nTechnical levels to watch\nEUR/USD is showing signs of stabilisation after three straight days of losses.\nOn the topside, the key level is the 2025 ceiling at 1.1918 (September 17). A break higher would open the door to the psychological 1.2000 mark.\nSupport sits first at the 55-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 1.1672, followed by the weekly trough at 1.1574 (August 27) and the August low at 1.1391 (August 1).\nMomentum signals appear constructive, although somewhat subdued: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped to around 56, pointing to a steady but softening buying impulse. Furthermore, the Average Directional Index (ADX), hovering near 17, highlights a trend that lacks muscle.\nEUR/USD da"

The euro has now dropped four sessions in a row, pressured by a resurgent U.S. dollar and growing signs of disinflation inside the eurozone. The greenback\u2019s rebound has been reinforced by U.S. jobless claims tumbling to 231K from the prior 264K, alongside a sharp rise in the Philadelphia Fed index to 23.2, its best level since January. These figures point to resilience in the American economy even as the Federal Reserve trims policy rates.\nFederal Reserve Policy and Market Guidance Keep Dollar in Demand\nThe Fed\u2019s latest 25 basis-point cut lowered the funds range to 4.00%\u20134.25%, but Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s \u201crisk-management\u201d framing signaled the central bank will not rush into an aggressive easing cycle. Futures markets still price a 90% chance of another cut in October and an 80% probability of one more in December, yet Powell warned that tariff-driven inflation remains a threat. Forward guidance penciling in just two more cuts this year and one in 2026 implies rates could stabilize near 3.50%, higher than markets once expected, offering continued support for the dollar and weighing on EUR/USD.\nECB Stays Cautious as German PPI Confirms Disinflation\nThe European Central Bank has left rates unchanged for a second straight meeting, with Vice President Luis de Guindos calling the stance \u201cappropriate\u201d but warning that uncertainty remains elevated. Governing Council voices, including Mario Centeno, acknowledged inflation slipping below the 2% threshold, leaving the door open for additional accommodation. The weakness is clear in the data: Germany\u2019s producer price index fell 2.2% year-over-year in August, a steeper drop than July\u2019s -1.5% and well below expectations of -1.6%. On a monthly basis, prices fell 0.5%, reinforcing concerns that manufacturing and supply chains are under deflationary pressure. With eurozone inflation steady at just 2.1%, the ECB has little scope to turn hawkish, which undercuts euro demand.\nFrench Political Tensions Add to Euro Weakness\nDomestic politics have also added stress. France has seen mass anti-austerity demonstrations in Paris, Lyon, and Marseille, aimed at forcing President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu to back away from spending cuts. Investors worry fiscal credibility is slipping, and protests are becoming another layer of risk premium for euro-denominated assets. Political instability at the core of the eurozone makes the single currency a less attractive counterweight to the dollar, especially with U.S. yields holding firm.\nTechnical Picture: 1.1700 Support Tested as Momentum Turns Bearish\nFrom a technical perspective, EUR/USD has slipped under its short-term trendline and is now consolidating near 1.1750, where both the 200-EMA and September uptrend converge. Momentum signals confirm fatigue: RSI on the 4-hour chart sits just below 50, while short-term EMAs have crossed beneath longer averages. If sellers push further, the key zone at 1.1710\u20131.1700 comes into play, followed by deeper support at 1.1660 and 1.1615. On the upside, intraday resistance stands at 1.1790, and a breakout through 1.1820 would be required to re-ignite bullish momentum toward 1.1878 and the recent 1.1920 high. Price action shows repeated rejections around 1.1840\u20131.1880, underscoring how heavy supply is layered overhead.\nRead More\n-\nSPMO ETF Rallies 35% in a Year, Oracle and Visa Join While Amazon and Tesla Exit\n22.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Top $553M as BTC-USD Trades Near $115K, Fed Policy Fuels Surge\n22.09."

Sterling had briefly touched 1.3726 last week before collapsing on the back of the Federal Reserve\u2019s quarter-point cut. While the cut initially weakened the dollar, Powell\u2019s hawkish commentary and the Fed\u2019s dot plot showing only one more cut through 2026 restored strength to the greenback. This forced the pair back below the 1.35 handle, a zone now proving decisive for near-term direction.\nFiscal Strain in the UK Adds Heavy Downside Pressure to GBP/USD\nAugust borrowing numbers revealed a deficit of \u00a318 billion, the highest August shortfall in five years, far above expectations of \u00a312.8 billion. The cumulative fiscal year deficit has already hit \u00a383.8 billion, overshooting the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s projection of \u00a372.4 billion for the first five months. Ten-year gilt yields surged to 4.70% and 30-year yields to 5.55% as investors priced in higher debt servicing costs. The fiscal deterioration comes at the same time consumer confidence fell back to -19 in September, reversing a brief uptick. With the UK Autumn budget weeks away, markets are bracing for whether Chancellor Rachel Reeves signals fiscal tightening or doubles down on spending.\nFederal Reserve Hawkish Tilt Bolsters the Dollar and Weighs on GBP/USD\nThe U.S. dollar strengthened after retail sales data came in at +0.6% MoM versus +0.2% expected, while jobless claims undershot forecasts, pointing to ongoing labor market resilience. The Dollar Index (DXY) rebounded 0.18% to 97.47. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields remain elevated, anchoring demand for dollars against weaker peers. Traders now price in an additional 50 bps of cuts by year-end 2025, but the Fed\u2019s communication is clearly calibrated to maintain inflation control rather than indulge markets. This hawkish bias is particularly punishing for GBP/USD, given the UK\u2019s fiscal fragility and slower growth trajectory.\nRead More\n-\nSPMO ETF Rallies 35% in a Year, Oracle and Visa Join While Amazon and Tesla Exit\n22.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Top $553M as BTC-USD Trades Near $115K, Fed Policy Fuels Surge\n22.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - (NG=F) Slips to $2.89 as 90 Bcf Injection Expands Surplus, Bears Eye $2.70\n22.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY PRice Forecast - USD to JPY at 147.73 as Fed Cut and BoJ Hawkish Split Define 145.90\u2013149.00 Battleground\n22.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nBank of England Caught Between Inflation Risks and Labor Slack\nThe Bank of England kept rates unchanged at 4.00%, voting 7-2 in favor of holding.

On the American side of the data docket, September\u2019s PMI results are expected to retreat across the board, with the Manufacturing component set to decline sharply to 52.0 from 53.0. The US Services PMI survey is expected to show business sentiment contracted to 53.9 from 54.5.\nFed narrative fracture could drive further market volatility\nThe Fed finally delivered a long-awaited interest rate cut last week, and proponents for lower rates are already clamoring for more, waving off fresh inflationary risks. The newest member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Board of Governors and Donald Trump\u2019s hand-picked replacement for Adriana Kugler\u2019s recently-vacated seat, Stephen Miran, raced to proclaim his opinion that Fed rates could easily be two full percentage points lower than they are now, a deeply untraditional monetary policy view that is not shared by anyone else on the Fed board, nor in any meaningful datasets.\nGBP/USD price forecast\nA fresh bullish turnaround for the GBP/USD pair puts Cable on pace to extend a technical bounce from the 50-day EMA near 1.3500, but the 1.3600 handle remains a significant technical hurdle for near-term price action.\nGBP/USD daily chart\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produ"

That move came after last week\u2019s failure to hold above the 0.6700 mark, which had been the highest in months.\nInterestingly, the retreat happened even as the US Dollar (USD) lost a bit of momentum. The US Dollar Index (DXY) gave back some ground after a three-day rally, unwinding part of the reaction to the September 17 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\nStubborn inflation keeps the RBA cautious\nAustralia\u2019s inflation story remains sticky. July\u2019s Monthly CPI (Weighted Mean) accelerated to 2.8% from 1.9% in June, while Q2 CPI rose 0.7% QoQ and 2.1% YoY.\nThat explains why the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) isn\u2019t in a rush to cut. Policymakers are cautiously supporting growth to prevent another price flare-up, as inflation remains higher than they would prefer.\nDomestic economy holding up better than feared\nDespite global uncertainty, the Australian economy has shown surprising resilience. August\u2019s Manufacturing PMI came in at 53.0, while Services hit 55.8, both firmly in expansion territory.\nRetail Sales climbed 1.2% in June, the July trade surplus widened to A$7.3 billion, and business investment ticked up in Q2. GDP also surprised on the upside, rising 0.6% QoQ and 1.8% YoY.\nThe labour market is a little more mixed. Unemployment held steady at 4.2% in August, but total employment fell by 5.4K.\nRBA sticks to data-driven path\nEarlier this month, the RBA trimmed the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3.60% and pared back its 2025 growth forecast. Governor Michele Bullock has since made clear that deeper cuts aren\u2019t on the table for now, stressing that policy decisions will depend on the data.\nThe minutes echoed that stance: if the labour market shows fresh signs of weakness, the RBA could move faster, but if growth holds steady, changes will be more gradual.\nAppearing before a House economics committee, Governor Bullock also emphasised that growth and inflation remain in a \u201cgood place\u201d, signalling there\u2019s no pressing need to cut rates.\nHeading into next week\u2019s policy meeting, markets broadly expect the RBA to stay on hold, with implied pricing pointing to about 26 basis points of easing by year-end.\nChina still the swing factor\nChina continues to heavily influence Australia's outlook. Q2 GDP there grew 5.2% YoY, but August retail sales disappointed at 3.4%.\nPMIs are also mixed: manufacturing slipped back into contraction at 49.4, while services barely held above 50 at 50.3. On top of that, deflation risks linger, with CPI down 0.4% in the year to August.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) kept its Loan Prime Rates unchanged in September: 3.00% for the One-Year and 3.50% for the Five-Year, just as markets expected.\nSpeculators remain sellers of the AUD\nAccording to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data for the week ending September 16, speculators trimmed their bearish bets on the AUD, with net shorts falling to around 51.2K contracts, the lowest since May. Of note, however, is that open interest decreased sharply to nearly 154K contracts.\nTechnical landscape\nFrom a technical standpoint, if buyers regain control, AUD/USD could retest its 2025 ceiling at 0.6707 (September 17). A clean break higher would expose last year\u2019s peak at 0.6942 (September 30), just shy of the 0.7000 round level.\nOn the downside, provisional support sits at the 55-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) at 0.6535 and 0.6510, respectively. A breach below this region could bring the August floor at 0.6414 (August 21) back into focus, seconded by the 200-day SMA at 0.6396, and then the June valley at 0.6372 (June 23).\nFurthermore, momentum indicators show a softer tone but still point t"

As a result, the price broke below the SMA and the trendline.\nAfter the break, the price could pull back to retest the recently broken line before continuing lower.

As a result, USD/JPY remains confined to the 145.75\u2013148.50 range it has traded within for most of the past two months.\nA strong two-day rally leading into last week\u2019s high could tip the balance towards an eventual bullish breakout, but one could argue it should have already occurred. Until a clear breakout takes place, the range remains valid, and range-trading strategies may be preferred.\nThe daily chart shows USD/JPY closed flat on Friday with a wide-legged doji near Thursday\u2019s high. Monday\u2019s false break of last week\u2019s high resulted in a shooting star candle near the top of the range. Bears could seek to fade into retracements within Monday\u2019s range and target the 147.19 low / daily S2 pivot or 147 handle.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nAUD/JPY Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nThe strong rebound from the April low has carried AUD/JPY more than 14% higher, though early signs of a retracement are beginning to emerge. A bearish divergence formed on the weekly RSI (2) within overbought territory by last week\u2019s close, and AUD/JPY snapped a three-week winning streak from arguably stretched levels. The BOJ\u2019s decision to announce ETF and REIT sales saw AUD/JPY retest the July high, though it has so far managed to hold above the 97.24 high-volume node (HVN).\nWith an inverted hammer and inside day forming above Friday\u2019s low and the HVN, a near-term bounce from current levels cannot be ruled out. However, a deeper pullback against the 14% rally remains possible, which could bring the 96.77 HVN or 96.31 near the 50% retracement level into focus.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/JPY\nAUD/JPY Technical Analysis: 1-Hour Chart\nThe 1-hour chart shows volumes trending lower while prices declined towards the July high, which suggests bears may be losing momentum. Notably, volume spikes have coincided with two cycle lows around the July high and the 97.24 HVN, indicating that buyers stepped in at those levels.\nBulls may look to fade dips towards the HVN in anticipation of a countertrend bounce towards the 97.85 high and the nearby 200-bar SMA.\nIf such a bounce materialises, it will be important to reassess the potential for a swing high and resumption of the downtrend. Conversely, a direct break below the 97.20 area would assume bearish continuation, placing the 96.77 HVN into focus for sellers.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/JPY\nGBP/JPY Technical Analysis: British Pound vs Japanese Yen\nThe 200 level is clearly a major milestone for bulls to overcome, so it\u2019s not surprising to see volatility increase around it.

Dollar momentum faded as the U.S. Dollar Index slipped to 97.38, snapping a three-day rally. The move came after last week\u2019s 25-bps Fed cut, where Chair Jerome Powell signaled further easing would be gradual and data-dependent. Fed Governor Stephen Miran warned policy was \u201cwell into restrictive territory,\u201d calling for 50-bps cuts, highlighting internal division.\nBank of Japan\u2019s Policy Tension and Political Shifts\nThe Bank of Japan held its policy rate at 0.50% but signaled the start of normalization, outlining a gradual unwind of ETF and J-REIT holdings. Governor Ueda noted that underlying inflation is edging toward 2%, while tariffs and food inflation risk pushing it higher. Two board members \u2014 Hajime Takata and Naoki Tamura \u2014 dissented, demanding an immediate hike to 0.75%. This split indicates pressure for further tightening as durable wage growth becomes a policy condition.

When U.S. yields climb, USD/JPY gravitates higher; when they fall, the pair retraces. Treasuries will be tested this week with 2-, 5-, and 7-year auctions, following a sharp yield decline over the past two months. A rebound in yields could push USD/JPY back above 149.00 resistance, while weak demand risks fueling a slide toward 145.48.\nTokyo CPI and Japanese Inflation Outlook\nJapan\u2019s core inflation held steady at 1.6% YoY in August, but services prices remain sticky. Markets will focus on Tokyo CPI this Friday, a reliable lead indicator for national inflation. A strong print could strengthen expectations for an October hike, lifting yen demand. Conversely, soft data could reinforce caution and allow USD/JPY to retest 149.35 or even the 151.00 resistance.\nTechnical Landscape: 145.90 Support and 149.00 Resistance\nTechnically, USD/JPY carved out a hammer candle at 145.90 after the Fed cut, signaling strong demand. RSI sits above 50 and MACD momentum leans bullish, suggesting buyers are defending support. The pair remains boxed between 146.50\u2013149.00, with 149.00 the immediate ceiling. A breakout above this level exposes 151.00, while a break below 145.90 opens risk toward 144.40 and 142.42.\nMarket Drivers This Week\nThe focus now shifts to preliminary U.S. PMIs on Tuesday, followed by jobless claims Thursday and the critical PCE inflation and consumption data on Friday. Multiple Fed officials, including Powell and Williams, will speak through the week, and dovish signals could drag USD/JPY back to 145.

In its accompanying statement, the central bank described a moderate economic recovery but pointed to persistent weak spots and warned of risks stemming from global trade policy.\nIn a more significant step, the regulator unanimously approved plans to begin selling ETFs and J-REITs from its vast portfolio. This detail is particularly noteworthy and can be interpreted as a cautious signal that the bank is preparing to wind down its long-standing asset purchase program.\nThis week, investor focus will shift to the latest PMI data and inflation figures for Tokyo, alongside the release of the minutes from the BoJ\u2019s July meeting. These documents may provide crucial insights into the timing and nature of the regulator\u2019s next policy steps.\nTechnical Analysis: USD/JPY\nH4 Chart:\nOn the H4 chart, USD/JPY found solid support at the 147.20 level and is now developing a fresh upward move targeting 148.88. We expect this target to be tested today. Following this, a corrective pullback towards 147.20 is likely. Following this correction, we anticipate another upward move aiming for the 150.00 psychological level. This outlook is technically confirmed by the MACD indicator, whose signal line is positioned above zero and pointing sharply upwards.\nH1 Chart:\nThe H1 chart shows the pair completed an upward move to 148.23, followed by a correction to 147.20. The current momentum is building for a further advance towards 148.88. Upon reaching this level, a corrective pullback towards 147.20 is possible. The broader upward trajectory is then expected to resume, with a minimum target of 150.00. This scenario is supported by the Stochastic oscillator, with its signal line currently above 50 and rising firmly towards the 80 level.\nConclusion\nThe yen remains under significant pressure, caught between a resilient US dollar and the Bank of Japan\u2019s cautious, gradual approach to policy normalisation. The path of least resistance for USD/JPY remains higher, contingent on this week\u2019s key data releases reinforcing the current fundamental and technical picture.\nDisclaimer: Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author\u2019s particular opinion.

The pair draws support as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) weakens on declining Oil prices, given that Canada is the largest Oil exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price extends its losses for the fifth consecutive session, trading around $61.90 per barrel at the time of writing. Crude Oil prices decline amid rising oversupply concerns, alleviating ongoing risks tied to Russian Oil.\nReuters reports suggest that Iraq may potentially add around 230,000 bpd to global supply by resuming crude exports through Kurdistan after a period of over two years. Additionally, Iraq has boosted oil exports under the OPEC+ framework, with September shipments projected between 3.4 and 3.45 million bpd.\nThe USD/CAD pair remains stronger as the US Dollar (USD) pares its recent losses from the previous session, following cautious statements from US Federal Reserve (Fed) officials on Monday. Traders will likely observe the preliminary reading of the US S&P Global PMI reports for September later in the day. US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell will also be eyed.\nTraders will shift their focus toward the August Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index data, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, which is expected to signal subdued price pressures.\nFed Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack warned on Monday that inflation pressures will likely persist for the time being, noting challenges on both sides of the Fed's mandate to both control inflation and support the labor market. We should exercise great caution in easing policy restrictions, as we are falling short on inflation by a more significant margin, Hammack added.\nMeanwhile, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin noted that tariff policies tend to result in higher prices for consumers, noting that the primary point of concern for businesses remains cloudy trade policy, not high interest rates.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a "

That shift, alongside a 0.1% dip in oil prices \u2013 the country\u2019s top export \u2013 left the loonie losing steam after its earlier display of strength. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve eased up too, but signaled it\u2019s not rushing into more cuts, underscoring a growing policy divide. Canadian government bond yields fell as well, with the 10-year dropping to 3.19%, widening the spread with US equivalents to its largest since early July. Now, all eyes are on the Bank of Canada governor\u2019s upcoming speech for clues on where policy goes from here.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency crossroads shape investor moves.\nA weaker loonie and wider yield gap can shift capital flows and sway demand for Canadian assets. While the currency drop may help exports, it raises costs for importers and fuels uncertainty for global investors. Diverging tactics from the Fed and Bank of Canada could prompt investors to rebalance portfolios, especially with Canadian energy stocks already facing added heat from sliding oil prices.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks walk different economic tightropes.\nMajor central banks are each charting their own course as they ease out of tight monetary policy, and Canada\u2019s story is a key example. With producer prices still rising \u2013 up 0.5% last month and 4% year-on-year \u2013 the BoC\u2019s cautious steps could serve as a bellwether for other commodity-driven economies that juggle growth with inflation. How Canada navigates these crosscurrents could shape its influence on the global stage as wider policy shifts unfold.\nProspero.ai\u2019s high-tech signals and plays are helping investors make smarter decisions.\nNow, you can benefit as they do: Prospero\u2019s crowdfunder is open.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\nNo wonder the platform was named the Best AI Fintech by the Global Financial Market Review, while winning the award for the Most Influential CEO 2025 Financial Technology from CEO Monthly.\nIf you want to invest in an investor favorite, check out Prospero.ai's crowdfunder here.\nInvesting in private securities is risky, speculative, and illiquid.

                "body": "Pound Vs Canadian Dollar Week Ahead: BoE Signals More Cuts, BoC Delivers 25bp Easing\nThe Pound Canadian Dollar (GBP/CAD) exchange rate was mixed last week following the publication of both the Bank of England (BoE)\u2019s and the Bank of Canada (BoC)\u2019s latest interest rate decisions.\nPound to Canadian Dollar (GBP/CAD): 1.86787 (+0.66%)\nEuro to Canadian Dollar (EUR/CAD): 1.63131 (+0.84%)\nDollar to Canadian Dollar (USD/CAD): 1.38227 (+0.28%)\nLooking ahead to this week, the Pound Canadian Dollar exchange rate (GBP/CAD) will likely be driven by several economic releases from both the UK and Canada.\nLooking at the Pound, the UK will release its preliminary PMI readings for September.\nDue on Tuesday, the UK\u2019s closely watched services PMI is likely to be a key catalyst for Sterling.\nIf the index signals a loss of momentum in the sector, the data may reignite worries over the resilience of the UK economy and leave the Pound vulnerable to fresh selling pressure.\nTurning to the Canadian Dollar, Canada will release its latest GDP reading at the end of the week.\nThe data is expected to show a slight rise in GDP in July which, should the data match expectations, could see CAD exchange rates close the week on the front foot.\nWEEKLY RECAP:\nThe Pound (GBP) opened the week on solid ground, with investors continuing to price in hawkish expectations ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s September policy announcement.\nWhile Tuesday\u2019s labour market figures highlighted further signs of weakness, Sterling managed to hold its footing, with hopes that the BoE would maintain a cautious approach cushioning the downside.\nMid-week brought additional support for the Pound as the latest CPI release showed inflation running at nearly double the Bank\u2019s 2% target.\nThe stickiness of price pressures reinforced the view that policymakers would be reluctant to ease policy too aggressively, helping GBP extend its gains.\nHowever, Sterling\u2019s momentum faded on Thursday in the wake of the BoE\u2019s rate decision.\nAs forecast, interest rates were left unchanged, but Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s comments hinted that the cutting cycle still had further to run, clouding the Pound\u2019s outlook.\nThe pressure intensified on Friday, when news of a jump in government borrowing costs reignited fiscal concerns.\nEven stronger-than-expected retail sales figures failed to turn sentiment around, leaving GBP to finish the week on the back foot against most major peers.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) started the week mixed as, despite a hotter-than-expected inflation reading, a declining US Dollar (USD) weighed on the \u2018Loonie\u2019 given its positive correlation with the \u2018Greenback\u2019.\nHowever, during mid-week trade, the Canadian Dollar slumped against the majority of its peers as the Canadian central bank enacted a 25 basis point interest rate cut.\nOn Thursday, the \u2018Loonie\u2019 managed to firm once again thanks to a rising US Dollar, before Friday saw the release of the country\u2019s latest retail sales index.\nThe data posted a decline and slumped from 1.6% to -0.8%, ultimately leaving CAD exchange rates to close the week on the back foot."

USD/JPY continues to trade within its established range, AUD/JPY shows signs of exhaustion after a sharp rally, and GBP/JPY faces resistance at the 200 milestone.

As a result, USD/JPY remains confined to the 145.75\u2013148.50 range it has traded within for most of the past two months.\nA strong two-day rally leading into last week\u2019s high could tip the balance towards an eventual bullish breakout, but one could argue it should have already occurred. Until a clear breakout takes place, the range remains valid, and range-trading strategies may be preferred.\nThe daily chart shows USD/JPY closed flat on Friday with a wide-legged doji near Thursday\u2019s high. Monday\u2019s false break of last week\u2019s high resulted in a shooting star candle near the top of the range. Bears could seek to fade into retracements within Monday\u2019s range and target the 147.19 low / daily S2 pivot or 147 handle.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nAUD/JPY Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs Japanese Yen\nThe strong rebound from the April low has carried AUD/JPY more than 14% higher, though early signs of a retracement are beginning to emerge. A bearish divergence formed on the weekly RSI (2) within overbought territory by last week\u2019s close, and AUD/JPY snapped a three-week winning streak from arguably stretched levels. The BOJ\u2019s decision to announce ETF and REIT sales saw AUD/JPY retest the July high, though it has so far managed to hold above the 97.24 high-volume node (HVN).\nWith an inverted hammer and inside day forming above Friday\u2019s low and the HVN, a near-term bounce from current levels cannot be ruled out. However, a deeper pullback against the 14% rally remains possible, which could bring the 96.77 HVN or 96.31 near the 50% retracement level into focus.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/JPY\nAUD/JPY Technical Analysis: 1-Hour Chart\nThe 1-hour chart shows volumes trending lower while prices declined towards the July high, which suggests bears may be losing momentum. Notably, volume spikes have coincided with two cycle lows around the July high and the 97.24 HVN, indicating that buyers stepped in at those levels.\nBulls may look to fade dips towards the HVN in anticipation of a countertrend bounce towards the 97.85 high and the nearby 200-bar SMA.\nIf such a bounce materialises, it will be important to reassess the potential for a swing high and resumption of the downtrend. Conversely, a direct break below the 97.20 area would assume bearish continuation, placing the 96.77 HVN into focus for sellers.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/JPY\nGBP/JPY Technical Analysis: British Pound vs Japanese Yen\nThe 200 level is clearly a major milestone for bulls to overcome, so it\u2019s not surprising to see volatility increase around it. Despite three daily closes above 200 in the past week, GBP/JPY printed a shooting star followed by a bearish engulfing candle, which confirmed a close back below the 200 level and last Wednesday\u2019s low.\nWith bears showing strength at cycle highs near such a key psychological level, they may look to fade any retracement within Friday\u2019s bearish range.\nA move tow"

Ann Wagner, and seven other lawmakers praised Trump\u2019s order for the potential to democratize investing.\nThey urged regulators to revise existing guidance that currently blocks roughly 90 million Americans from allocating to asset classes long reserved for the wealthy.\n\u201cGiven these directives, we encourage the SEC to provide swift assistance to the Secretary of Labor and to make any necessary revisions to its current regulations and guidance,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cWe also request the SEC review bipartisan legislation being advanced in the 119th Congress concerning accredited investors. We are hopeful that such actions will help the 90 million Americans that are currently restricted from investing in alternative assets to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement.\u201d\nWhile \u201calternative assets\u201d broadly include private equity and venture capital, the order also creates a potential regulatory pathway for Bitcoin exposure inside tax-advantaged retirement plans.\nSeveral committee members, including Rep. Warren Davidson, have been vocal advocates for adding Bitcoin into existing mainstream financial infrastructures, framing it as both a hedge against monetary debasement and a tool for long-term savings.\nThe lawmakers also pointed to bipartisan legislation advancing in the 119th Congress that would modernize the definition of \u201caccredited investor,\u201d another longstanding hurdle preventing ordinary Americans from accessing private markets and digital assets.\nIf carried through, the executive order could mark a watershed moment for Bitcoin adoption in the United States.\nFor decades, Americans saving for retirement have had little choice but to hold assets denominated in fiat currency \u2014 a system that, by design, loses purchasing power over time. Opening 401(k) plans to Bitcoin would offer savers a way to directly align their long-term wealth with a provably scarce, non-sovereign asset.\nSEC Chair Paul Atkins is slated to appear on Fox Business tomorrow, where he may address the executive order and its implications for retirement savers."

This is because bitcoin has posted substantial gains over the past year, climbing more than 80%, but prices remain volatile, dropping over 2.4% over the past week.\n\u201cOur role is to prevent investors from taking on disproportionate risk,\u201d said Magda Wierzycka, Sygnia\u2019s CEO, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on September 22. \u201cBitcoin is exciting, but it\u2019s not a guaranteed path to wealth. It needs careful management within a diversified portfolio.\u201d\nEmerging Markets May Face Greater Volatility\nSouth Africa\u2019s financial landscape will shift significantly as new Bitcoin ETFs await regulatory approval. These offerings will likely boost the country\u2019s digital asset adoption, but analysts urge investor discipline. Analysts warn that emerging markets like South Africa may face heightened volatility.\nSponsoredThe fund manager plans to introduce additional crypto ETFs on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange once regulatory approval comes through.\nThe caution stems from the inherent vulnerability of these markets to sudden price swings, a reality amplified by the lower average per capita income compared to developed nations. Financial firms are stepping in to act as stabilizing forces.\nSygnia, for example, is encouraging informed participation over speculative overcommitment. Sygnia\u2019s CEO, Wierzycka, emphasizes that while Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a legitimate long-term investment, its place in a portfolio must be measured.\n\u201cEven with potential gains, the risk of overexposure is very real,\u201d she noted. The firm\u2019s cautious stance reflects the market realities, advocating that crypto should remain a small, strategic portion of a broader investment plan.\nIs Bitcoin\u2019s ETF Boom Cooling Off?\nThe push for regulated products is happening against a backdrop of massive growth in the global crypto market. Bitcoin-related exchange-traded products now control more than 1.47 million BTC, representing about 7% of the total Bitcoin supply. The majority of this is held by US-based ETFs, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT leading with roughly 747,000 BTC, followed by Fidelity\u2019s FBTC at close to 200,000 BTC.\nDespite the significant inflows, recent trends show a cooling period. Bitcoin ETPs experienced $301 million in outflows in August, while Ethereum-focused funds saw a surge, attracting nearly $4 billion.\nMarket watchers anticipate that a combination of regulated ETFs and careful advisory practices could foster safer investor engagement and sustainable growth in South Africa\u2019s crypto sector."

The model would fund Ethereum's ecosystem while preserving the network's cultural values and avoiding embarrassing revenue sources.\nCurrent high-revenue apps include NFTs, meme coins, and speculative trading, while value-aligned applications struggle with adoption or fee generation. Buterin emphasized that revenue generators don't need to be revolutionary but must avoid being \"actively unethical or embarrassing\" to the ecosystem.\nThe comparison to Google highlights how search advertising revenue funds the company's diverse projects despite accounting for over three-quarters of total revenue in 2024. Google sustains less profitable yet valuable product lines through advertising income, creating a model that Ethereum could replicate.\nButerin highlighted deposit rates on Aave as an example, where blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC yield around 5% annually. Higher-risk stablecoins offer returns above 10%, creating sustainable revenue streams without compromising network ethics.\nEthereum DeFi total value locked recently surpassed $100 billion for the first time since early 2022. The milestone represents significant recovery from the 2022-2023 bear market when TVL collapsed across the ecosystem following multiple protocol failures.\nRegulatory momentum, including the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, could accelerate DeFi adoption further. A DeFi Education Fund survey found that over 40% of Americans would consider using DeFi under stronger regulatory frameworks.\nThe approach seeks harmony between sustainable economics and ethical operations, contrasting with ecosystems where political meme coins dominate fee revenue. Low-risk DeFi can eventually evolve into reputation-based lending, prediction market integration, and alternatives to dollar-denominated stablecoins like \"flatcoins.\""

Disclaimer\nEthereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network is facing a liquidity crunch after a surge of withdrawals totaling 2.369 million ETH ($10.2B) entered the exit queue in September 2025. The withdrawal queue has expanded 327% in a week, underscoring a shift as staking yields fall to 2.84%, the lowest since Ethereum\u2019s move to PoS in 2022.\nA significant portion of the capital is flowing into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which offer better rewards. Pendle\u2019s stETH pools currently pay 5.4% APR, drawing roughly 40% of exit ETH into higher-yield opportunities. This is weighing on short-term sentiment and creating congestion, with exit processing times stretching to 43 days.\nAt the same time, retail-focused speculation remains active, particularly around the BullZilla ($BZIL) presale. The project\u2019s \u201cWhale Signal Detected\u201d stage has already raised more than $ 580,000, sold 28 billion tokens, and attracted over 1,900 holders, a clear snapshot of retail energy contrasting with Ethereum\u2019s institutional capital rotation.\nEthereum Breaking News: Kiln Exit and DeFi Migration\nA single driver accounts for much of the exodus: staking provider Kiln withdrew 1.6M ETH, nearly 61% of the total exit queue, following the July 2025 SwissBorg hack. Analysts note this represents rotational capital rather than permanent exits.\nEthereum\u2019s validator entry queue has shrunk to 320,000 ETH, confirming that fewer new participants are joining staking under current conditions. Meanwhile, Ethereum TVS (Total Value Staked) has fallen to 36M ETH, declining by 150,000 ETH weekly. In parallel, Ethereum DeFi TVL reached a record $97B, showing that yield competitiveness is reshaping the ETH ecosystem.\nInstitutional Patience, Retail Shifts\nDespite liquidity stress, institutional investors remain engaged. Bitcoin Immersion, a major treasury management firm, has accumulated 1.52M ETH ($6.6B), signaling that Ethereum remains a strategic asset.\nRetail traders, however, are chasing alternative narratives. Meme coin presales like BullZilla are gaining momentum, showing how Ethereum ROI trends extend beyond staking and DeFi into high-risk, high-reward speculation.\nETH Price Prediction September 2025\nWith more than $10B queued for withdrawal, Ethereum price stability is being tested. Analysts warn that persistent exit delays and declining yields could create near-term sell pressure.\nStill, ETH September 2025 forecasts remain cautiously optimistic. Rising DeFi adoption, institutional treasury demand, and Ethereum\u2019s dominance in smart contracts and Layer 2 scaling underpin long-term strength. In short, while withdrawals dominate crypto news today ETH, the bigger picture still favors Ethereum\u2019s role as a cornerstone blockchain.\nWhale Signal Detected: BullZilla Presale Tracker\nWhile Metaplanet captures headlines with its billion-dollar treasury play, retail energy is surging in presales like BullZilla ($BZIL). The project is now in Stage 3: Whale Signal Detected, and its numbers are drawing attention.\nThis presale snapshot highlights how grassroots investors are finding opportunities outside Ethereum staking, reflecting the same ETH vs altcoins narrative where speculative bets compete with network-level yields.\nConclusion\nEthereum\u2019s PoS network is undergoing one of its most significant liquidity shifts since the Merge,"

                "body": "Solana (SOL) is still one of the best-performing blue-chip altcoins, with analysts opining that its price can easily double during the next leg of the bull rally. While SOL\u2019s scalability and ecosystem expansion justify this optimism, its enormous market cap significantly limits the magnitude of its gains. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in presale at $0.035 and has attracted investment interest in its DeFi lending-and-borrowing smart contract. There is far more upside room to grow, and early projections are that MUTM can provide many multiples that of Solana, with up to 43x potential gains as usage increases, some predict.\nSolana Trades Around $238 as Resistance Mounts\nSolana (SOL) is currently trading at approximately $238.50, with network strength but facing near-term resistance at the $250 level. Network indicators like active addresses, DeFi adoption, and tool integrations are strong and favorable towards its potential to trend upwards, but macro headwinds and market sentiment like interest rates and regulatory signals are tempering the pace. While SOL remains a leading layer-1 with widespread usage, Mutuum Finance, could have higher percentage upside in 2025 being a new lower-priced crypto.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) Takes Everyone by Surprise\nMutuum Finance is now at stage six of its presale at $0.035 following its 16.17% increase from the previous stage. The market is recording an all-time high demand for the project with more than 16,470 investors subscribed and exceeded $16.15 million raised.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program for the security of the platform. The bugs have been classified on four levels i.e., critical, major, minor, and low.\nThe protocol has strong safety on any asset that is collateralized in a way that doesn\u2019t impact protocol and user safety. They target collateral ratios, lending limits and deposit limits. Off close undercollateral positions are incentivized as a method of systemic stability to be liquidated promptly with call penalties and charge liquidation guarantee remediation.\nCollateral efficiency is maximized in the collateralized securities, i.e., lending efficiency is maximized in Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios of high collateralized finance. Reserve problems are introduced as a buffer for market circumstances, and excess reserves can be levied on extremely volatile assets to negate the volatility.\nMutuum Finance\u2019s vision for the long term is to transform the DeFi model as it currently stands. In a bid to incentivize early adoption, the project is running a $100,000 giveaway that will reward 10 users with a $10,000 MUTM. The projects is a two-way DeFi lending protocol, and the benefit of using it extends to both borrowers and lenders. It is an open protocol for institutional investors and retail investors, and manipulative-resistant.\nThe Better Bull Run Bet\nSolana (SOL) remains one of the strongest performing layer-1 blockchains, and analysts believe it has the potential to double in 2025 as it continues to see increased usage and adoption. Its massive market cap, however, will keep percentage growth relatively limited compared to cheaper assets. That\u2019s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. Now in Stage 6 of its presale at just $0.035, the project has already attracted over $16.15 million from over 16,470 investors, showing strong demand. With its two-pronged lending platform, overcollateralized risk management, and $50,000 CertiK-audited bug bounty program, Mutuum Finance is built for growth and long-term sustainability.\nAnalysts think its upside could be as high as 43x, multiples of Solana\u2019s upside potential. MUTM is shaping up to be a true DeFi disruptor. Growth investors seeking high-growth prospects may see Stage 6 entry as the optimal entry point prior to the next price blast-off.\nFor more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance"

By bridging BTC into SOL\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, BTC gains instant settlement, programmable use cases, and access to lending, borrowing, and yield opportunities.\nThe best form of Bitcoin is literally on Solana, citing the network\u2019s ability to transform BTC from a static store of value into a dynamic, productive asset. Solana Sensei, the Founder of Sensei holdings and Namaste group, has highlighted on X that 66% of all wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) traders are on the Solana network. He supports this claim with the reasons why people are choosing to hold and use their BTC on SOL.\nWhy Solana\u2019s Speed And Low Fees Change The Game\nSolana is extremely cheap in transactions, a stark contrast to the $5 to $50+ fees often seen on the Bitcoin or Ethereum networks for the same move. With transaction finality in approximately 400 milliseconds, BTC transfers on SOL become nearly instant, compared to the minutes or hours of waiting on other chains. SOL\u2019s capacity to process 65,000 TPS allows it to handle BTC at an internet-scale without network congestion.\nFurthermore, Bitcoin becomes a programmable asset with deep integration into DeFi protocols like Jupiter, Raydium, Orca, Drift, and Kamino, enabling instant trading, lending, and use as collateral. Also, BTC becomes programmable in SOL DeFi, NFT, and RWAs, without the need for bridges across multiple chains.\nThis integration transforms BTC into a dynamic, productive asset that can be used for lending, staking, and liquidity provision or structural products in ways that are not possible on the native BTC chain. BTC custody solutions, such as tBTC, sBTC, or the Wormhole BTC, combined with SOL\u2019s high validator count and Jito MEV protection, are making it secure to use BTC on the network.\nBitcoin on SOL pairs with USDC and USD1, which are the stablecoins that dominate settlement volume across all chains. With products like the SOL Mobile Saga and Seeker, there are instant BTC swaps and BTC payments on mobile. As the focus on SOL increases, the network is becoming a hub for ETFs and RWAs, with institutional flows ramping up. Meanwhile, Wrapped BTC on SOL will be directly plugged into that liquidity.\nEarning Native Bitcoin on Solana Through mSOL\nAnalyst CPrinz, the on-chain Researcher, has revealed a new partnership between Marinade, SOL\u2019s leading staking platform with 10 million and $1.7 billion in total value locked, and Zeus Network.\nSpecifically, the collaboration is designed to expand the utility of Marinade liquid staked SOL token, mSOL, by enabling users to earn native BTC on the SOL blockchain.

                "body": "Dow Jones has announced its acquisition of Eco-Movement, a leading platform that specializes in providing data about electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. This strategic move allows Eco-Movement to operate as part of OPIS, Dow Jones\u2019s expanding division focused on energy solutions.\nEco-Movement is based in Utrecht, Netherlands, and is recognized for its expertise in collecting and enhancing data related to EV charging points. The company has developed a comprehensive platform that tracks public and semi-public charging stations worldwide, providing real-time information on their availability. With nearly 2 million connectors across more than 80 countries, Eco-Movement\u2019s data offerings will significantly enrich the range of energy-related products and services that Dow Jones provides to its customers.\nThe acquisition of Eco-Movement aligns perfectly with Dow Jones\u2019s ongoing growth, particularly in its professional information business. This segment has achieved considerable success, offering a diverse range of products and services that cater to sectors such as risk management, research, and energy. In its most recent earnings report, the Dow Jones Energy division revealed an impressive growth rate of 11% from the previous fiscal year, which brought its revenue to $278 million. This success has played a key role in driving Dow Jones\u2019s overall record revenue of $2.33 billion for the year.\nBy integrating Eco-Movement into its operations, Dow Jones is bolstering its energy division with high-quality data and analytics. This enhancement will support more informed decision-making for a diverse range of stakeholders, including retailers, fleets, charge point operators, utilities, and financial institutions. Furthermore, this acquisition builds upon OPIS\u2019s existing activities related to the energy transition, which include areas such as carbon markets, clean fuels, solar power, and hydrogen.\nNotably, Dow Jones has been involved with Eco-Movement since its early stages. The company was an early investor, participating in Eco-Movement\u2019s Series A funding round back in 2022. Since that initial investment, Eco-Movement has experienced remarkable success, with revenue soaring by more than 200 percent.\nThis acquisition is just one of several strategic initiatives that Dow Jones has undertaken to strengthen its portfolio. Earlier this year, the company also acquired Oxford Analytica and Dragonfly Intelligence, both of which add valuable geopolitical risk and security intelligence to Dow Jones\u2019s Risk & Compliance product suite.\nKEY QUOTES:\n\u201cEco-Movement is an incredible addition to our Dow Jones Energy portfolio at a time when we expect the EV market to grow globally. It\u2019s a key element of giving our audience the proprietary data they need to make critical decisions. With this acquisition, our users can now see the entire spectrum of vehicle energy\u2013from fossil fuels to electricity\u2013around the world, and it\u2019s all part of our strategy to enable customers to go deep on the topics they care about.\u201d\nAlmar Latour, CEO of Dow Jones and Publisher of The Wall Street Journal\n\u201cJoining OPIS, part of Dow Jones, marks an exciting new chapter for Eco-Movement. As the leading charge point data platform, our mission has always been to provide EV charging location and pricing data services to empower the entire e-mobility ecosystem. By combining our industry-leading data platform with OPIS\u2019s expertise and network, we can accelerate the transition to sustainable mobility and deliver even greater value to charge point operators, OEMs, navigation and map providers and analysts.\u201d\nRoderick van den Berg, Eco-Movement co-founder and CEO"

Despite some early session volatility, the Dow is following the rest of the US market higher to kick off the new trading week, with all major indexes showing green across the board.\nAfter closing in the green for two straight weeks, the Dow Jones is firmly on its way to a third bullish weekly candle, pushing bids above last week\u2019s all-time highs to chalk in a fresh peak on Monday. The Dow is up around 2% in September alone, a month that has historically seen ill-tempered equity market performance.\nFed's internal divergence on rate forecast begins to widen\nA flurry of Federal Reserve (Fed) policymaker statements greeted markets on Monday, and the narrative thread surrounding policy rate targets is beginning to diverge wildly across the voting body. Donald Trump\u2019s hand-picked Board of Governors member, Stephen Miran, is ramping up his rate-cutting rhetoric, declaring on Monday that the fed funds rate is 200 basis points too high, while also asserting that achieving net zero immigration will both bolster the labor market and tamp down inflation, a policy stance that does not appear to be shared by any of his fellow Fed board members.\nA smattering of economic data will greet markets throughout the week. S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey results for September are due on Tuesday and are expected to show a general decline in both the manufacturing and services segments. US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is slated for Wednesday, and median market forecasts expect annualized Q2 growth to hold steady at 3.3%.\nThis week\u2019s key data release is set for Friday, when the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) inflation from August will drop on markets. Core PCE inflation is expected to tick down to 0.2% MoM from 0.3%, while the yearly figure is forecast to hold steady at 2.9%, well above the Fed\u2019s 2.0% target.\nDow Jones daily chart\nDow Jones FAQs\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the oldest stock market indices in the world, is compiled of the 30 most traded stocks in the US. The index is price-weighted rather than weighted by capitalization. It is calculated by summing the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing them by a factor, currently 0.152. The index was founded by Charles Dow, who also founded the Wall Street Journal. In later years it has been criticized for not being broadly representative enough because it only tracks 30 conglomerates, unlike broader indices such as the S&P 500.\nMany different factors drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The aggregate performance of the component companies revealed in quarterly company earnings reports is the main one. US and global macroeconomic data also contributes as it impacts on investor sentiment. The level of interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve (Fed), also influences the DJIA as it affects the cost of credit, on which many corporations are heavily reliant. Therefore, inflation can be a major driver as well as other metrics which impact the Fed decisions.\nDow Theory is a method for identifying the primary trend of the stock market developed by Charles Dow. A key step is to compare the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) and only follow trends where both are moving in the same direction. Volume is a confirmatory criteria. The theory uses elements of peak and trough analysis. Dow\u2019s theory posits three trend phases: accumulation, when smart money starts buying or selling; public participation, when the wider public joins in; and distribution, when the smart money exits.\nThere are a number of ways to trade"

That played out as sterling advanced against the dollar, making sales tougher for exporters and tightening the outlook for sectors like autos. That pain was amplified when Porsche dialed back its electric vehicle targets, trimming profit forecasts for itself and Volkswagen, and dragging shares like Aston Martin along for the ride. Higher-than-expected UK government borrowing and a cautious Bank of England\u2014holding rates steady amid sticky inflation\u2014fueled extra unease, while gold and industrial metals miners got a lift as commodity prices surged. Meanwhile, EasyJet, IAG, and Wizz Air stumbled after cyberattacks snarled flights, and Tate & Lyle suffered the FTSE 250's biggest drop on a Morgan Stanley downgrade. Now, investors are zeroed in on upcoming Federal Reserve commentary for fresh direction.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency swings keep investors on their toes.\nA rising pound piles pressure on exporters by making their goods pricier abroad, tightening profits for companies with global reach. On the flip side, commodity-driven sectors\u2014like gold and industrial miners\u2014can find tailwinds from strong international demand or a softer dollar. With rate policy in flux and economic signals still mixed, expect more ups and downs as investors watch currencies and central banks closely.\nThe bigger picture: Macroeconomic moves and industry risks take center stage.\nUK fiscal policy is back in the spotlight as government borrowing overshoots targets, raising the stakes for November\u2019s budget reset. Simultaneously, cyberattacks on airlines underscore growing business vulnerabilities, and changes in electric vehicle plans are rippling through Europe\u2019s auto sector.

                "body": "FTSE 100 Live 22 September: Gold Price Hits New Record, Index Steady\nOn September 22, 2023, the FTSE 100 index exhibited remarkable stability, even as gold prices surged to unprecedented heights. This article delves into the implications of these developments for investors, the broader market, and the economic landscape, while addressing frequently asked questions about the FTSE 100 and gold pricing.\nOverview of the FTSE 100 Index\nThe FTSE 100, or Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index, serves as a benchmark for the performance of the top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. The index is a key indicator of the UK\u2019s economic health and investor sentiment. Comprising major corporations across diverse sectors, the FTSE 100 includes well-known names such as Unilever, BP, and HSBC.\nFTSE 100 Performance on September 22\nOn this particular day, the FTSE 100 remained relatively steady, reflecting a cautious yet stable market environment. Investors seemed to be weighing global economic concerns against domestic factors. The index\u2019s performance can be attributed to various factors, including corporate earnings, geopolitical events, and monetary policy decisions.\nKey Factors Influencing the FTSE 100\n1. Economic Indicators: Recent economic data, including inflation rates and employment figures, play a significant role in shaping market sentiment. Investors closely monitor these indicators to gauge the economy\u2019s direction. For instance, if inflation rates rise significantly, it could lead to speculation about interest rate hikes, which can affect stock valuations.\n2. Global Events: Events such as geopolitical tensions or changes in trade policies can also impact investor confidence. For instance, any berawangnews.com regarding Brexit negotiations or international relations can sway the market. A recent development in UK-EU relations, for example, could lead to fluctuations in the index as investors reassess their risk exposure.\n3. Corporate Earnings: The quarterly earnings reports from FTSE 100 companies greatly influence the index. Strong earnings often boost stock prices, while disappointing results can lead to declines. Notably, companies like Diageo and AstraZeneca have reported positive growth, contributing to overall index stability.\nGold Price Hits New Record\nOn the same date, gold prices reached a new record, which has significant implications for the market and investors alike. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset, particularly during times of economic uncertainty.\nWhy is Gold Considered a Safe-Haven Asset?\nGold has historically been a reliable store of value. During times of economic turmoil or high inflation, investors often flock to gold to protect their wealth. The recent surge in gold prices can be attributed to several factors:\n1. Inflation Concerns: With rising inflation rates globally, many investors are seeking refuge in gold, anticipating that its value will hold up better than fiat currencies. For instance, if inflation in the UK surpasses 5%, as it has in recent months, gold becomes more attractive as a hedge against eroding purchasing power.\n2. Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing conflicts and instability in various regions can drive demand for gold, as it tends to retain its value in uncertain times. The recent tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East have led many investors to seek security in gold assets.\n3. Currency Fluctuations: The value of gold is inversely related to the strength of the US dollar. As the dollar weakens, gold prices typically rise. With the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policies affecting the dollar\u2019s value, fluctuations in the currency can lead to significant changes in gold pricing.\nImplications of Rising Gold Prices\nThe increase in gold prices can have a ripple effect on various sectors:\n- Mining Companies: Companies involved in gold mining may see increased stock prices due to higher gold valuations. This could positively impact their earnings and investment potential. Fo"

                "body": "2025\u2019s been another strong year so far for UK and global stocks. The FTSE 100 is up 12% in the year to date. The S&P 500 index of US shares has punched even larger returns, and touched new record peaks late last week.\nDespite rising inflation and pressure on major economies, stock markets have shown surprising resilience. But with these conditions persisting, significant uncertainty reigns for the remainder of the year and into 2026.\nHaving said that, I think these three top stocks can keep rising. Here\u2019s why I feel they\u2019re worth serious consideration.\nSilver surfer\nPrecious metals stock Fresnillo (LSE:FRES) has been by far the best recent performer across the FTSE 100 index.\nUp 239% since 1 January, it\u2019s been propelled by surging gold and silver prices. Both metals\u2019 impressive momentum shows no signs of cooling either, as macroeconomic and geopolitical worries grow. Gold struck new peaks above $3,700 per ounce late this week, and has punched its fifth weekly gain on the spin.\nPurchasing mining stocks exposes investors to industry risks like production issues and exploration disappointments. But the gains can also be supersized. With Fresnillo, its wide portfolio of Mexican assets gives it the scale to capitalise on gold and silver\u2019s bull runs.\nThis wide footprint also reduces the threat of operational issues at group level. Fresnillo\u2019s the world\u2019s largest silver producer, pulling 28.2m ounces out the ground during January-June.\nLemons to lemonade\nInsolvency specialist Begbies Traynor thrives during tough economic conditions. So with the UK economy struggling for traction, demand for its services is booming. Pre-tax profits almost doubled in the 12 months to June, to \u00a311.5m.\nWith corporate insolvencies still rising \u2014 latest Insolvency Service data showed a 6% increase year on year in August \u2014 I expect the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) company to remain busy.\nOf course, Begbies could come under pressure if economic conditions improve. However, the company\u2019s resilient long-term growth record helps soothe (if not totally eliminate) any fears I have. Profits have risen every year for a decade.\nBegbies Traynor shares have risen 24% in 2025.\nAnother FTSE high performer\nThe final share we\u2019re looking at is Prudential, a company I hold in my own portfolio. It\u2019s recent decision to double-down on Asia and African markets is a bold one as China\u2019s economy splutters. Trouble in Asia\u2019s largest economy carries significant contagion risks across the broader continent.\nBut it\u2019s a strategy that also has enormous growth potential, as increasing personal incomes turbocharges insurance demand in these underpenetrated markets.\nKPMG, for instance, has predicted \u201chigher growth rate across the next two years\u201d in Asia Pacific\u2019s insurance market, thanks to \u201chigher GDP growth, increasing risk awareness and the accelerated digitalisation of distribution channels\u201c.\nBetween January and June, \u2018The Pru\u2019 saw new business profits leap 12%, with growth reported in 13 of its 19 markets despite tough conditions. Prudential\u2019s share price risen 60% in value this year, putting it comfortably in the Footsie\u2019s Top 10 best performers."

Britain's FTSE 100 was little changed, inching up less than 0.1% to 9,225.17. U.S. shares were set to drift lower with Dow futures down 0.3% at 46,524.00. S&P 500 futures shed 0.2% to 6,707.00.\nEarlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 1.0% to finish at 45,493.66, rebounding from the decline late last week over concerns about the Bank of Japan's selling its holdings. Such concerns abated as markets began to see any move as gradual.\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4% to 8,810.90. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.7% to 3,468.65.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 12 points, or 0.3%.\nThe market is digesting multiple headwinds, including a looming federal funding deadline and limited policy flexibility from the Fed. With Congress deadlocked and the September 30 funding deadline approaching, investor focus is shifting to Washington. Senate proposals from both parties failed last week, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on President Trump to intervene.\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem reaffirmed support for last week\u2019s quarter-point rate cut but cautioned against expecting much more easing. He argued the federal funds rate\u2014now at 4%-4.25%\u2014is near neutral and warned that excessive accommodation could stoke inflation risks. Musalem, a current FOMC voter, emphasized balancing labor market concerns with inflation goals and noted financial conditions remain supportive.\nHis stance reflects broader Fed caution. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic also dismissed the need for more cuts this year. Nonetheless, CME FedWatch data show markets still pricing in two more rate reductions before year-end, keeping the macro data path in sharp focus for traders.\nTechnology led gains on Monday, with the sector up 0.5%, while communication services and consumer discretionary also posted modest advances. Defensive names lagged, with consumer staples dropping 0.67% and utilities falling 0.16%. Energy and materials also trended lower despite recent strength, signaling some sector rotation following last week\u2019s risk-on sentiment.\nThe market\u2019s narrow gains follow a strong prior week that saw all major indexes\u2014including the Russell 2000\u2014reach fresh highs. Still, the S&P enters a historically weak week, adding to trader caution ahead of key inflation data.\nPfizer surged nearly 3% after announcing a $4.9 billion all-cash acquisition of weight-loss drugmaker Metsera, which soared 60%.\nCompass dropped 9% despite agreeing to acquire real estate rival Anywhere in a $1.6 billion all-stock deal. Anywhere shares jumped over 50% on the news.\nOther movers included Sarepta Therapeutics, up 10% on an analyst upgrade, and Crown Castle, which gained 1.1% after a bullish call from Wolfe Research.\nKenvue tumbled 5% after reports linking Tylenol use in pregnancy to autism.\nFox Corp climbed nearly 4% following Trump\u2019s mention of Murdoch involvement in TikTok\u2019s U.S. future.\nWith equities near highs and the Fed signaling restraint, the next major catalyst will be Friday\u2019s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index\u2014the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge. A soft print could validate rate cut expectations and support equities, but any upside surprise would challenge the easing narrative.\nTraders should prepare for potential volatility this week as economic data, political developments, and Fed commentary converge. Market support may hinge more on solid macro readings than additional monetary easing.\nMore Information in our Economic Calendar.\nJames Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Five-star wide receiver Jamier Brown, the No. 2 prospect in the ESPN Junior 300, has been committed to Ohio State since November.

The 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA was shot and killed during a campus event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, September 10. His death sparked grief from supporters, backlash from critics, and a heated fight online over how his legacy should be remembered.\nThat debate grew louder when comparisons to Martin Luther King Jr. surfaced \u2014 prompted by a viral post from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna that placed Kirk alongside figures like Abraham Lincoln, JFK, Jesus, and King. Within hours, social media was flooded with pushback, including from Bernice King, MLK\u2019s daughter. On September 12, she reposted Luna's meme on X, writing, \u201cThere are so many things wrong with this. So many. I get tired, y\u2019all.\u201d\nA day earlier, she had shared on Instagram, \u201cIt will require much more than quoting my father for the United States to evolve from our current conundrum of multi-faceted violence, tragic apathy, and degrading policies.\u201d\nHer brother, Martin Luther King III, also spoke out, telling WAVY TV 10 that comparing Kirk to his father was \u201ca disservice to unification.\u201d His comments came as renewed attention turned to Kirk\u2019s record of criticizing both Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nNow, another member of the King family is weighing in.\nOn September 17, Alveda C. King \u2014 the niece of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 released a video message that framed Kirk\u2019s death through the lens of her own family\u2019s history. \u201cAs a woman who survived the assassinations of my uncle, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., my father, Reverend A.D. King, and my grandmother, Mrs. Alberta Williams-King, I know all too well the impact of this kind of cowardly act. Charlie Kirk was assassinated,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd now while his family and this nation grieve, some are calling him a racist. A white supremacist. Even a fake Christian. Such accusations are conversations unbecoming to a Christian,\u201d she continued. \u201cIn the final analysis, Charlie stood for life, for faith, and biblical truth. He wasn\u2019t afraid to say the name of Jesus in the public square, and he paid a price for it. Now is not the time to attack Charlie. It\u2019s the time to lift up the banner of Christ as the member of the one blood human race Charlie Kirk did. His legacy of public discourse of bringing difficult conversations to the table mattered. He caused us to think and to pray. Charlie has gone to meet his maker. May he rest in peace. May we honor him today by praying for his family and by answering this question: Where will you spend eternity?\u201d\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Alveda spoke about Kirk\u2019s death. A day after the shooting, she appeared on The World Over with host Raymond Arroyo, saying she was \u201cvery startled\u201d by the news and that her \u201cheart immediately went to him and his family, his beautiful wife, his little children.\u201d Alveda described the assassination as a trauma trigger given her own family\u2019s history with political violence. Still, she urged prayer, forgiveness, and a return to \u201cregard for human dignity\u2026 from the womb to the tomb and beyond.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to a point of caring, of loving, of repenting, of forgiving,\u201d she said. \u201cTherein lies the answer.\u201d\nAccording to the Associated Press, prosecutors charged 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson with aggravated murder, a charge that makes the case eligible for the death penalty. CNN reports that charging documents include a series of text messages Robinson sent to his romantic partner, \u201cwho is currently transitioning from male to female,\u201d confessing to the attack, the transcript reads.\nIn his first court appearance via video to 4th District Court in Provo, Judge Tony Graf announced the charges \u2014 prosecutors confirmed they intend to seek the death penalty, per Deseret News.

Once the details became clear, markets decided the pace was gentle enough to sidestep a market shock, reigniting buying activity. Heavyweights like Advantest and Tokyo Electron soared 3.56% and 5% as tech stocks led gains, while Fast Retailing nudged the Topix up 0.9%. Not every name joined the rally\u2014SoftBank dipped slightly\u2014but the overall mood improved, helped by the yen hovering around 148.21 to the dollar, which gave exporters a bit of a boost.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Confidence returns after a shaky start.\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s careful pacing reassured investors who feared a rapid selloff would rattle the market. Tech stocks led the rebound, highlighting how global appetite for Japan\u2019s innovative companies remains strong. With both the Nikkei and Topix bouncing higher, sentiment looks upbeat, especially since exporters continue to benefit from a weak yen.\nThe bigger picture: Japan\u2019s gradualist moves set a tone for stability.\nBy opting for a slow unwind, the Bank of Japan underscores its commitment to financial stability as it gradually exits crisis-mode policies. With Japan's stock market and advanced tech industry playing key roles in global investing, this steady approach could encourage more international capital to flow into Japanese equities if confidence holds.\nProspero.ai\u2019s high-tech signals and plays are helping investors make smarter decisions.\nNow, you can benefit as they do: Prospero\u2019s crowdfunder is open.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\nNo wonder the platform was named the Best AI Fintech by the Global Financial Market Review, while winning the award for the Most Influential CEO 2025 Financial Technology from CEO Monthly.\nIf you want to invest in an investor favorite, check out Prospero.ai's crowdfunder here.\nInvesting in private securities is risky, speculative, and illiquid.
