                "body": "Will gold be a worthwhile investment in 2026? Here's what experts think.\nGold had a banner year, with prices on the precious metal reaching record highs multiple times. Currently, the price per ounce sits at over $4,200, up from $2,600 at the start of the year.\nThat price run-up is certainly eye-popping, and it may have investors wondering if gold is still a smart investment after the new year rolls around. Are there still benefits of buying gold, given its higher price, though? Here's what experts have to say about gold investments in 2026.\nFind out how to add gold to your investment portfolio now.\nWhy gold could be a smart investment in 2026, experts say\nMany investors purchase gold as a hedge against inflation or to serve as a diversifier in their overall portfolio. This is because gold tends to hold its value long-term, even as the value of the dollar falls. Gold's value also tends to have less of a correlation to other asset classes, allowing you to retain wealth, while other types of investments \u2014 like stocks, for example \u2014 experience more volatility.\nAccording to experts, both these protections may be necessary in the new year. Inflation has already risen steadily since early 2025, and there's a chance this trend could continue, particularly if the Federal Reserve chairman is replaced as expected, says James Cordier, founder and head trader at OptionSpreaders.com.\n\"Looking at some of the recent discussions from the administration, it looks like Kevin Hassett will likely be the next Fed chairman,\" Cordier says. \"This appointment would deliver what could set into motion one of the most dovish Feds we've seen in quite some time.\"\n\"It also sets the stage for a precipitous decline in the value of the dollar in 2026 and would likely be a major catalyst for gold prices to continue their climb,\" Cordier says.\nThat's the other reason you may want to invest in gold still: Prices still have room to grow, and potentially quite a bit. (Deutsche Bank recently predicted that gold prices could reach nearly $5,000 per ounce next year.)\n\"There are precious few reasons for gold prices to recede, and several good reasons for it to continue the current rally,\" says Brett Elliott, director of content at the American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX). \"Apart from the fundamentals, the technicals tell us that gold isn't done yet either. \"\nDarius Dale, founder and CEO of investment analysis firm 42 Macro LLC, says the two major risk management models his company uses are currently signaling a long-term, bullish outlook for gold, and since 1998, those tools have been over 90% accurate.\nIn short: \"If they are currently still bullish on gold, the investing public should be, too,\" Dale says. \"While a repeat of 2025's around 60% year-to-date returns is unlikely, more double-digit gains are an easy hurdle to beat.\"\nLearn more about how gold investing could benefit you today.\nWhy gold may not be a worthwhile investment in 2026\nOn the flip side, nothing is set in stone, and there is always the possibility that gold prices could reverse course. Still, most experts aren't expecting that to occur.\n\"The biggest risk heading into 2026 is that buyers decide gold has gotten too expensive and stop buying,\" Elliott says. \"Offsetting that, of course, are going to be the investors and central banks, though.\"\nIf gold does fall in price next year, it would make for a poor short-term investment and could mean lower returns or even a net loss entirely. If you have a longer timeline, you may be able to make up for any declines and still see returns.\n\"Gold is always a good investment if your time horizon is long enough,\" Elliott says. \"Short-term investments in gold are normally harder to get a return on.\"\nThe bottom line\nGold isn't the only precious metal you can invest in next year. If you're looking for a more economical option, silver can be one to consider. Its prices have been rising, much like gold's price has, though silver offers a much lower entry point of jus"

                "body": "Iranians turning to Gold as inflation runs rampant\nIranians are turning to gold as sanctions and government policy destroy their currency.\nThe average inflation rate in Iran has climbed to over 40 percent (based on CPI) on an annual basis. According to an AP report, gold has become the most trusted hedge against this rapid devaluation of the rial.\nThe rapid increase in the local gold price reflects the inflationary environment. Last week, the price of a gold coin in Iran exceeded 1.2 billion rials for the first time in the country\u2019s history.\nStill, people are buying. A gold and jewelry merchant told the AP he has never seen such high demand for gold.\n\u201cIn the past two weeks, I\u2019ve sold 6 kilos (13.2 pounds) of gold to ordinary people \u2014 a new experience for me. People are rushing to buy because they fear their savings will lose value.\u201d\nWage earners are quickly exchanging their rapidly devaluing fiat currency into real money. A grandfather told the AP that he sees gold as \u201cthe best way to preserve value.\u201d\n\u201cWhenever I make money, I turn it into gold,\u201d Behzad Rashvand said.\nAudio equipment salesman Hamid Safari has adopted a similar strategy.\n\u201cWhenever I have enough money to save, I immediately convert it into gold. Throughout history, gold has not only held its value but also increased in worth. We should learn from history if we want to build a better life.\u201d\nFatemeh Parsa invested her inheritance in real estate. Now she regrets that decision.\n\u201cWith global gold prices rising, I sometimes wish I had bought gold instead \u2014 my assets would have grown much more than real estate. Now, it seems that investing in silver could be valuable, especially for my children\u2019s future.\u201d\nSome Iranians turned to cryptocurrency to keep ahead of inflation, but that has proved problematic because the U.S. government has cracked down on Iranian crypto sellers. The U.S. slapped sanctions on two Iranian financiers, along with more than a dozen individuals and firms in Hong Kong and the UAE, for coordinating the purchase of $100 million in cryptocurrency that was used to facilitate oil sales by the Iranian government.\nIranians have not only turned to gold as an inflation hedge. They value its portability. Many Iranians fled Tehran to the countryside during the 12-day war with Israel. The influx of people overwhelmed rural infrastructure, and ATMs quickly ran out of cash or broke down.\nGold solves this problem because it is easy to transport. According to the AP, people have learned from history.\n\u201cMany who fled the cities during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war took whatever they could with them. And in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, those allied with the shah and his government fled Iran with whatever they could carry. Back then, the rial hit an all-time high of 120 to $1, which saw money-changing shops inundated and people buying gold, jewelry, rugs and other assets to spirit abroad.\u201d\nA 49-year-old fabric importer told the AP he is liquidating his assets and turning them into foreign currency and gold.\n\u201cIn an emergency, I need to be able to carry my assets with me if I have to leave.\u201d\nIranians are following a universal strategy. When government money fails and the financial system breaks down, they turn to gold. For instance, Indians used their vast gold savings to make ends meet during the COVID lockdowns, and Turkish citizens are currently gobbling up gold to shield themselves from their government\u2019s relentless devaluation of their money.\nAmericans aren\u2019t facing the kind of borderline hyperinflation currently gripping Iran and Turkey, but their government is also devaluing their currency by design. Keep in mind that inflation is the plan. The stated objective is to erode the purchasing power of the dollar by 2 percent every year. Currency depreciation is considered a feature of a fiat monetary system \u2013 not a bug.\nWhether your government is stealing your money\u2019s purchasing power slowly or all at once, the only way to protect your wealth over time is to exchange your f"

                "body": "Gold has dominated headlines in 2025 as investors seek a secure store of value in a year marked by economic instability and heightened geopolitical risk.\nAccording to LSEG Data & Analytics, the precious metal has jumped 50% since January, outperforming major asset classes and marking its strongest advance since 1979. Rising demand from central banks, concerns over weakening currencies and persistent monetary volatility have made gold one of the most closely watched assets in global markets.\nLSEG recently delved into why gold is a save haven during global uncertainty.\nLSEG notes that a major catalyst for this rally has been a shift in US monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to begin easing comes at a difficult moment, with unemployment rising and inflation still stubborn. Investor appetite for traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries has weakened amid ongoing concerns over government policy and central bank credibility. As confidence in the dollar has faltered, gold has become an attractive alternative.\nGeopolitical tensions have intensified the move toward gold. Ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East continue to unsettle markets, while recent US policy decisions have fuelled uncertainty around future economic performance. LSEG highlights that fiscal plans passed by US lawmakers this summer have weakened the fiscal outlook.\nCentral banks are another major force behind rising demand. LSEG data shows that emerging market central banks have increased their gold holdings since 2022, when sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine raised concerns about relying heavily on foreign currency reserves. Some 95% of surveyed central banks now expect global gold reserves to increase over the next year.\nIn this highly uncertain environment, LSEG concludes that gold is again being treated as the ultimate safe haven. With the status of the US dollar as the primary global reserve currency under scrutiny, the precious metal continues to attract demand from institutional investors, central banks and retail buyers alike.\nFor more insights, read the full story here.\nRead the daily FinTech news\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 FinTech Global"

                "body": "Brent crude has drifted into the low-$60s, a price corridor OPEC+ has spent the better part of two years trying to defend through disciplined supply management. Yet the market\u2019s center of gravity is shifting. Independent forecasts now point to a looming surplus of 2.1\u20134 million barrels per day in early 2026. Against that backdrop, OPEC+ has chosen what it calls a \u201cstrategic pause,\u201d rolling over production quotas rather than deepening cuts.\nThe decision is meant to stabilize prices. But it raises a more fundamental question: Is OPEC+ still shaping the market, or merely reacting to forces now beyond its control?\nThe Cartel\u2019s Dilemma\nFor most of its modern history, OPEC\u2019s power was due to the fact that it controlled enough spare capacity to move prices at will. When demand weakened, it cut. When supply tightened, it opened the taps. That leverage is not gone, but it has been diluted.\nToday\u2019s oil market looks nothing like the cartel-dominated landscape of the past. Non-OPEC+ supply growth has become a significant factor. The United States, Brazil, and Guyana are adding barrels at a pace that offsets cartel restraint with unsettling consistency. The Energy Information Administration projects global petroleum liquids supply will rise by 1.9 million barrels per day in 2025 and another 1.6 million in 2026, driven largely by producers outside of OPEC+.\nIn response, OPEC+ is cutting production.\nThat dynamic explains the alliance\u2019s increasingly uncomfortable posture. Every additional cut risks ceding more market share to competitors who show no sign of slowing. Yet easing restrictions risks driving prices below levels that many members simply cannot afford. The long game for OPEC+ is to manage this delicate balance until non-OPEC+ supply peaks and begins to decline. But at the same time, they are fighting against the clock in a world committed to moving away from oil.\nThe Price Floor Debate\nFor OPEC+, the low-$60s Brent range has become an informal price floor. But bearish sentiment is hardening. Economists now expect West Texas Intermediate to average about $59 in 2026, with Brent near $62. Goldman Sachs has warned that prices could slip into the low $50s if surpluses build as projected.\nThose levels are important. At $55\u2013$60 WTI, large portions of U.S. shale remain marginal but functional. Below that, drilling activity begins to slow. Ironically, OPEC+\u2019s restraint may do more to protect U.S. producers from a deeper price collapse than to secure the cartel\u2019s own fiscal stability.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s budget arithmetic highlights the tension. Its fiscal breakeven oil price for 2025 is estimated near $91 per barrel\u2014far above current market levels. Other OPEC+ members face even tighter constraints. The longer Brent\u2014the international benchmark crude\u2014lingers near $60, the more budget pressure builds across the alliance, forcing heavier reliance on borrowing, reserve drawdowns, and currency management.\nIn past cycles, that pressure would have prompted swift, aggressive intervention, or cheating on quotas. This time, the response is caution.\nThe U.S. Paradox and the New Supply Map\nNon-OPEC+ supply growth is no longer a temporary disruption; it is the defining structural force of the oil market. U.S. shale, once dismissed as a short-cycle swing producer, has become a durable, manufacturing-style industry capable of sustaining output even through price downturns. Capital discipline has replaced growth-at-any-cost, but production efficiency continues to improve.\nBrazil\u2019s pre-salt fields are expanding with enormous capital backing and world-class reservoir quality. Guyana\u2019s rise is even more surprising. The country has already surpassed 900,000 barrels per day and is targeting 1.7 million by 2030\u2014an extraordinary figure for a nation that produced virtually nothing a decade ago.\nThese barrels are not marginal. They are structural, long-life, low-cost additions to global supply. And they arrive largely immune to OPEC+ coordination.\nThe cartel can still sl"

                "body": "Crude Oil Tumbles as the Dollar Strengthens and Equities Fall\nJanuary WTI crude oil (CLF26) on Monday closed down -1.20 (-2.00%), and January RBOB gasoline (RBF26) closed down -0.0360 (-1.96%).\nCrude oil and gasoline prices fell sharply on Monday, with gasoline posting a 1.5-week low. Dollar strength on Monday undercut energy prices. Crude prices also fell as Monday's stock market weakness weighed on confidence in the economic outlook and energy demand. A positive for crude prices is the expectation that restrictions on Russian energy exports will remain, following Ukrainian President Zelenskiy's statement that there is no accord yet to end the Russian-Ukrainian war.\nDon\u2019t Miss a Day: From crude oil to coffee, sign up free for Barchart\u2019s best-in-class commodity analysis.On the bearish side for crude, Saudi Arabian state producer Aramco last Thursday cut the price of its Arab Light crude oil for Asian customers by 30 cents/bbl for January delivery, the lowest since January 2021, a sign of weakened energy demand.\nGeopolitical risks are supporting crude prices. Last Tuesday, Interfax reported that Russian President Putin threatened to attack ships from nations helping Ukraine if attacks on Russian vessels don't stop. Recently, four Russian tankers have been attacked by drones in the Black Sea. Also, President Trump said airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed and that the US may soon start targeting drug cartels within Venezuela. Venezuela is the world's 12th-largest oil producer.\nReduced crude exports from Russia are underpinning crude prices. On November 19, Vortexa data showed Russia's oil product shipments fell to 1.7 million bpd in the first 15 days of November, the lowest in more than 3 years. Ukraine has targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past three months, exacerbating a fuel crunch in Russia and limiting Russia's crude export capabilities. Ukrainian drone and missile attacks over the weekend damaged a Russian Baltic Sea oil terminal, forcing it to close. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which carries 1.6 million bpd of Kazakhstan's crude exports, was forced to close after a pipeline was damaged at one of its moorings. New US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have also curbed Russian oil exports.\nCrude also garnered support after OPEC+ on Sunday said it will stick with plans to pause production increases during Q1 of 2026. OPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members will raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus. The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026. OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore. OPEC's November crude production fell by -10,000 bpd to 29.09 million bpd.\nVortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days fell -7.9 w/w to 121.23 million bbls in the week ended December 5.\nLast month, OPEC revised its Q3 global oil market estimates from a deficit to a surplus, as US production exceeded expectations and OPEC also ramped up crude output. OPEC said it now sees a 500,000 bpd surplus in global oil markets in Q3, versus last month's estimate for a -400,000 bpd deficit. Also, the EIA raised its 2025 US crude production estimate to 13.59 million bpd from 13.53 million bpd last month.\nLast Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of November 28 were -3.0% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -3.1% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -7.6% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending November 28 was unchanged w/w to 13.815 million bpd, slightly below the record high of 13.862 million bpd from the week of November 7.\nBak"

                "body": "Bearish oil outlook, but upside risks abound\nWe continue to hold onto our bearish outlook for the oil market in 2026. However, there are clear supply risks hanging over the market\n2026 oil surplus to weigh on prices\nOur balance sheet shows that the surplus in the oil market is set to grow in 2026, following OPEC+'s decision to unwind supply cuts at a quicker-than-expected pace. Non-OPEC supply is also expected to grow at a healthy clip despite this year's price weakness.\nAccording to our balance, we will see a surplus of more than 2m b/d in 2026. Global supply is set to grow by 2.1m b/d next year, while demand looks to be more modest at around 800k b/d.\nThe peak of this surplus is expected in the first half of 2026. However, with our balance sheet showing a surplus in every quarter next year, global oil stocks should continue to build through the year, keeping downward pressure on prices. We forecast that ICE Brent will average US$57/bbl over the year, with the key assumption being that Russian oil flows continue unabated despite US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil.\nThe scale of the surplus and the expected build in inventory should put the forward curve under additional pressure, pushing it deeper into contango. The front end of the curve has held up better than expected as supply risks provide support. In addition, the growing amount of Russian oil at sea not making its way to the destination suggests the spot market may be tighter than what the oil balance suggests at the moment.\nThis is a key risk to our bearish view. Clearly, if sanctions prove more effective than we and the market expect, this leaves upside for oil prices. However, Russia has managed to keep oil flowing since 2022 despite sanctions and embargoes. We suspect the use of intermediaries and the larger discounts available to buyers of Russian crude oil should see flows continue.\nDownside risks include ongoing peace talks. If they lead to the lifting of certain sanctions on Russia, much of the supply risk hanging over the oil market will ease. While we don\u2019t believe such a scenario would dramatically increase Russian oil supply, given that it\u2019s held up well despite sanctions, removing this risk could push Brent down to the low $50s.\nThe oil market faces a large surplus in 2026 (m b/d)\nWill volatility return to oil markets?\nWhat\u2019s really stood out in oil markets this year is the lack of volatility, particularly given the myriad geopolitical events and supply risks. There\u2019s the ever-lurking uncertainty over sanctions on Russian oil supply, but also US and Israeli strikes on Iran. After such an event, one would\u2019ve expected violent spikes in the oil market, given the fears over the loss of Iranian supply, and the potential spillover into the broader region. Instead, Brent had a brief rally to just over $80/bbl.\nSo, why is there a lack of volatility in markets this year?\nFirst, we have been living in a world with heightened geopolitical risks since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. So, there will be an element of fatigue when it comes to geopolitical developments, particularly when events in recent years have had little to no impact on oil supply.\nSecond, there have been growing expectations of a surplus environment, particularly towards the end of this year and into 2026, which would have comforted the market. Perhaps the biggest factor blunting volatility is the large amount of spare capacity that OPEC has been sitting on. It was a little more than 5m b/d earlier in the year, easing concerns over potential supply disruptions. But obviously, OPEC has been tapping into this spare capacity aggressively this year. As such, this buffer is much smaller moving forward. It means the market in the future may be more sensitive to developments, which could mean increased volatility.\nOPEC's spare production capacity provided comfort to the market in recent years but is now falling (m b/d)\nOPEC+ policy shift and its next moves\nOPEC+ chose an interesting time this year to shift pol"

                "body": "Brent crude has drifted into the low-$60s, a price corridor OPEC+ has spent the better part of two years trying to defend through disciplined supply management. Yet the market\u2019s center of gravity is shifting. Independent forecasts now point to a looming surplus of 2.1\u20134 million barrels per day in early 2026. Against that backdrop, OPEC+ has chosen what it calls a \u201cstrategic pause,\u201d rolling over production quotas rather than deepening cuts.\nThe decision is meant to stabilize prices. But it raises a more fundamental question: Is OPEC+ still shaping the market, or merely reacting to forces now beyond its control?\nThe Cartel\u2019s Dilemma\nFor most of its modern history, OPEC\u2019s power was due to the fact that it controlled enough spare capacity to move prices at will. When demand weakened, it cut. When supply tightened, it opened the taps. That leverage is not gone, but it has been diluted.\nToday\u2019s oil market looks nothing like the cartel-dominated landscape of the past. Non-OPEC+ supply growth has become a significant factor. The United States, Brazil, and Guyana are adding barrels at a pace that offsets cartel restraint with unsettling consistency. The Energy Information Administration projects global petroleum liquids supply will rise by 1.9 million barrels per day in 2025 and another 1.6 million in 2026, driven largely by producers outside of OPEC+.\nIn response, OPEC+ is cutting production.\nThat dynamic explains the alliance\u2019s increasingly uncomfortable posture. Every additional cut risks ceding more market share to competitors who show no sign of slowing. Yet easing restrictions risks driving prices below levels that many members simply cannot afford. The long game for OPEC+ is to manage this delicate balance until non-OPEC+ supply peaks and begins to decline. But at the same time, they are fighting against the clock in a world committed to moving away from oil.\nThe Price Floor Debate\nFor OPEC+, the low-$60s Brent range has become an informal price floor. But bearish sentiment is hardening. Economists now expect West Texas Intermediate to average about $59 in 2026, with Brent near $62. Goldman Sachs has warned that prices could slip into the low $50s if surpluses build as projected.\nThose levels are important. At $55\u2013$60 WTI, large portions of U.S. shale remain marginal but functional. Below that, drilling activity begins to slow. Ironically, OPEC+\u2019s restraint may do more to protect U.S. producers from a deeper price collapse than to secure the cartel\u2019s own fiscal stability.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s budget arithmetic highlights the tension. Its fiscal breakeven oil price for 2025 is estimated near $91 per barrel\u2014far above current market levels. Other OPEC+ members face even tighter constraints. The longer Brent\u2014the international benchmark crude\u2014lingers near $60, the more budget pressure builds across the alliance, forcing heavier reliance on borrowing, reserve drawdowns, and currency management.\nIn past cycles, that pressure would have prompted swift, aggressive intervention, or cheating on quotas. This time, the response is caution.\nThe U.S. Paradox and the New Supply Map\nNon-OPEC+ supply growth is no longer a temporary disruption; it is the defining structural force of the oil market. U.S. shale, once dismissed as a short-cycle swing producer, has become a durable, manufacturing-style industry capable of sustaining output even through price downturns. Capital discipline has replaced growth-at-any-cost, but production efficiency continues to improve.\nBrazil\u2019s pre-salt fields are expanding with enormous capital backing and world-class reservoir quality. Guyana\u2019s rise is even more surprising. The country has already surpassed 900,000 barrels per day and is targeting 1.7 million by 2030\u2014an extraordinary figure for a nation that produced virtually nothing a decade ago.\nThese barrels are not marginal. They are structural, long-life, low-cost additions to global supply. And they arrive largely immune to OPEC+ coordination.\nThe cartel can still sl"

The focus now shifts to the FOMC rate decision on Wednesday, and the focus is on breakout of this multi-week range just above support.\nNote that the 100% extension of the November rally is eyed at 1679 and a weekly close above this level would nullify the threat this advance being a near-term correction and shift the focus back towards key resistance at 1.1747/78. This region is defined by the 2025 high-week close (HWC), the 61.8% retracement of the September decline, and the 2025 high-close. And advance beyond this threshold would threaten another test of the yearly highs with subsequent resistance eyed at the 100% extension of the 2022 advance at 1.1917 and the 38.2% retracement of the broader 2008 decline at 1.2019.\nWeekly support remains unchanged at 1.1497-1.1505- a region defined by the March 2020 high, the 2022 swing high, and the 78.6% retracement of the July advance. A break / weekly close below this threshold would be needed to suggest a more significant high is in place, and a larger trend reversal is underway. Subsequent support objectives eyed at the April high-close at 1.1394 and the 2024 HWC / 38.2% retracement of the yearly range at 1.1228/54- look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nBottom line: Euro is trading in a well-defined range with EUR/USD trading into the upper bounds this week ahead of major event risk. Look for the breakout to offer guidance into the close of the year. From a trading standpoint, the immediate focus is on a breakout of the embedded December opening-range- losses would need to be limited to the 1.1589 IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a close above 1.1679 needed to fuel the next leg of the rally.\nKeep in mind we get the release of the FOMC interest rate decision on Wednesday. The focus will be on the Fed\u2019s updated Summary of Economic Projections, and the interest rate dot-plot will be critical as investors adjust the outlook for monetary policy heading into 2026. As of now, Fed Fund Futures are nearly fully priced for a cut this week (87%) with the next rate cut expected in April. Stay nimble into the release and watch the weekly closes here for guidance.

Meanwhile, US Treasury yields advance, as investors seem to price in a higher neutral fed funds rate, following last Friday\u2019s data that revealed US inflation stalled but it remains closer to 3%.\nThe US economic docket featured the New York Fed Survey of Consumers expectations, with households turning pessimistic on current and future financial conditions.\nNevertheless, the Euro shrugged off those factors as European Central Bank (ECB) member Isabel Schnabel, said that she\u2019s comfortable on bets that the next move is a hike.

Schnabel added that the Euro economy could grow above its potential despite the headwinds. Regarding inflation, it is in good place at 2%, yet volatile energy prices and base effects could exert upward pressure on headline inflation.\n- ECB\u2019s Rehm said that they must be aware of upside and downside inflation risks.\nTechnical analysis: EUR/USD dips below 1.1650, eyes on 1.1600\nEUR/USD to holds belpw1.1650 for a fifth straight session, carving out a tight consolidation range between this level and 1.1600.

The pair remains stable as markets brace for a decisive Federal Reserve policy meeting expected to define direction into year-end. Traders are positioned for a 25-basis-point rate cut, with the CME FedWatch Tool assigning an 88% probability, sharply higher than the 70% priced last week. This shift has weighed on the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), now down to 99.0 from 101.4, sustaining weakness across major currency pairs. Meanwhile, the euro\u2019s strength is amplified by improving German macro data and hawkish signals from the European Central Bank (ECB), producing a sharp divergence between both monetary paths.\nFed Easing Cycle And Eurozone Resilience Build Divergence\nU.S. data continues to display a mixed yet decelerating trend. The core PCE price index rose 0.2% month-on-month, in line with expectations, keeping inflation anchored near 2.8%. The 10-year Treasury yield has eased to 3.81%, down from 4.45% in early November, as markets anticipate the start of a monetary easing cycle. The narrowing of real yield differentials, which now stand near their smallest since April, continues to favor the euro over the dollar. In contrast, Germany\u2019s industrial output unexpectedly jumped 1.8% month-on-month in October, against expectations for a 0.4% contraction, following a 1.3% gain in September. The strength in German data challenges the Eurozone slowdown narrative and underpins optimism for the bloc\u2019s recovery. ECB official Isabel Schnabel reinforced this divergence, stating that she was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with the idea of a potential rate hike in 2026, citing structural resilience across the Eurozone. With the ECB leaning hawkish while the Fed prepares to cut, EUR/USD is positioned advantageously above 1.1650, with a potential technical extension toward 1.1750\u20131.1820.\nDollar Weakness Persists As Traders Rotate Toward Euro Assets\nThe dollar\u2019s weakness reflects a clear reallocation of capital toward currencies with stronger forward policy guidance. The U.S. fiscal deficit remains above $2.1 trillion, and short-term Treasury yields around 4.02% signal that real yields are compressing. The two-year U.S.\u2013Germany spread, which has narrowed to less than 110 basis points, is at its lowest since May and historically supports euro appreciation. Every 10-basis-point narrowing between these yields typically adds 0.0025\u20130.0030 to EUR/USD, suggesting upside potential toward 1.1750 in coming sessions.\nTechnical Recovery Confirms Structure Shift After Two-Month Sideways Trend\nPrice action on the EUR/USD chart confirms that momentum has transitioned from consolidation to accumulation. The pair\u2019s breakout above 1.1525, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, signaled a structural shift in direction. Buyers have maintained control since reclaiming 1.1653, the 0.618 retracement, while each retest of that zone has absorbed selling pressure effectively. Indicators confirm stability: the Parabolic SAR remains positive, the Supertrend holds a buy bias with trailing support at 1.1504, and RSI readings at 61 show steady bullish energy without overextension. The next resistance stands at 1.1728, overlapping the 0.786 Fibonacci level, followed by 1.1822, which aligns with summer highs. On the downside, immediate support remains 1.1550, followed by a secondary defense line at 1.1525, both serving as consolidation anchors.\nEcb Hawkishness Counters Fed Dovish Messaging\nWhile the Fed moves toward "

Labour market fragility suggests an 87% probability of the Bank of England reducing rates at its December meeting.\nEarthquake In Japan\nA strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck northeastern Japan, prompting a tsunami warning for coastal regions. This event has not affected GBP/USD, which shows bullish momentum despite needing a close above 1.3350 to challenge 1.3400.\nThe Pound Sterling, the UK\u2019s currency, is the fourth most traded globally. Its value is affected by Bank of England policies, primarily interest rate adjustments, and by economic indicators like GDP, manufacturing, and trade balance. Strong data can lead to GBP appreciation, making the UK attractive for foreign investments.\nAs of today, December 8th, 2025, we are seeing GBP/USD holding steady around 1.3325, right below the critical 200-day moving average. The market is in a holding pattern as we await major policy decisions from both the US Federal Reserve this week and the Bank of England next week. This period of low movement is likely the calm before significant volatility.\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver a \u201chawkish cut\u201d this Wednesday, a somewhat contradictory action that could whipsaw markets. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 91% probability of a 25 basis point cut, which would normally weaken the dollar. However, if the Fed\u2019s statement signals this is a one-time adjustment and not the start of a prolonged easing cycle, the dollar could paradoxically strengthen after an initial dip.\nBank Of England Pressure\nWe saw a similar dynamic play out back in July 2019, when the Fed cut rates but signaled a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment,\u201d causing an initial sell-off in the dollar that quickly reversed. This historical precedent suggests that traders should be wary of chasing the initial move following the announcement. The real direction will be determined by the updated economic projections and the tone of the press conference.\nOn the other side of the pair, pressure is building on the Bank of England to cut rates. Recent data from the Office for National Statistics showed the UK unemployment rate ticked up to 4.5% in the three months to October, and wage growth has slowed considerably. These signs of a weakening labor market are why we see an 87% chance of a rate cut priced in for the December meeting, which will likely act as a headwind for the Pound.\nGiven the high event risk, option-based strategies that profit from a spike in volatility look attractive. We are seeing the CBOE FX Volatility Index for the British Pound already climbing, so buying straddles or strangles with strike prices around key levels like 1.3400 and 1.3250 could be a prudent way to trade the upcoming announcements. These strategies would pay out if the price moves sharply in either direction, protecting against the uncertainty of the central banks\u2019 forward guidance.\nWe must also keep an eye on external risk factors, such as the recent earthquake in Japan. Such events can trigger a flight to safety, which typically benefits the US Dollar as a safe-haven currency. This could place additional downward pressure on GBP/USD, independent of the central bank actions."

Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling "

                "body": "I\u2019ve been tracking the British Pound for strength over the past few weeks and in the major pair of GBP/USD, it has not disappointed.\nAfter showing its most oversold reading in more than two years in early-November the pair came to life in a very big way, and as we go into this week\u2019s FOMC rate decision, it\u2019s one of the more attractive major pairs for USD-weakness scenarios.\nThe pair rallied up to a fresh monthly high last week while re-testing a zone of prior support-turned-resistance, and to start this week we\u2019re seeing a bit of pullback. There\u2019s three support levels of note with 1.3287 an 1.3250 somewhat nearby already, but it\u2019s the support that I looked at in last week\u2019s webinar at 1.3186 that stands out as important, as a clean hold of that level while producing a doji on the daily last Tuesday marks a pivotal spot for bulls to defend.\nGBP/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/JPY\nWhile USD has pulled back over the past couple of weeks it\u2019s still up on net for Q4; and the currency that\u2019s been even weaker over that period is one that still remains of interest in the Japanese Yen. As I\u2019ve been tracking for USD-strategy, USD/JPY remains one of the more attractive venues for USD-strength scenarios so juxtaposing the above two themes, of GBP/USD of preference for USD-weakness and USD/JPY for USD-strength, we can simply remove the Dollar from the mix to arrive at GBP/JPY for cross-currency themes.\nAnd to be sure, the pair has put in quite the rally over the past month after finally breakout out from the 204 level that had held as resistance in late-October.\nNow the pair is in another key zone and this is the same the stymied the advance last year, built around the wick from the reversal candle last July and it runs from 206 up to 208.12.\nGBP/JPY Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/JPY Shorter-Term\nThe challenge with GBP/JPY now is not only the longer-term zone that the pair is trading within, but also the fact that pullbacks have been rather light, and rallies have slowed as price has pushed up to next resistance. This hasn\u2019t quite built a rising wedge as there\u2019s no clear upper trendline, but the tonality of such a formation is there. So this doesn\u2019t necessarily rule out bullish continuation, but it does caution against chasing breakouts or fresh highs, for now at least, until buyers are able to convincingly punch through 208.12. Shorter-term, there\u2019s still support interest at 206.70 or maybe even 207.20, if the trader wanted to push the theme aggressively.\nGBP/JPY Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/GBP\nWhen I brought this one into the GBP mix in last month\u2019s Technical Analysis article, the pair was trading very near a fresh two-and-a-half year high. I was looking at a spot of support potential from prior resistance and that zone is now in-play, plotted from around .8739-.8753.\nWhere this one comes in as interesting in my opinion is for those that would be looking to fade this recent run of GBP-strength. Given that we\u2019re already testing a big zone of support as taken from prior resistance, there\u2019s scope for bullish scenarios, although its still early and price is technically trading inside of the zone at the moment.\nEUR/GBP Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/GBP Daily\nTo put some additional detail to the above, we can\u2019t quite say that a low is in place yet, but there could be the early stages of such a setup. From the daily chart we can see underside wicks for the past two completed daily candles, and another for today, so far. These are holding at higher-lows and bulls even took a shot today to take control, although were rebuffed at the Fibonacci level of .8753. So, again, it\u2019s still early, but if we can see buyers push a higher-high on the daily, particularly if they can force a daily close above .8753, it\u2019ll look like a possible bullish reversal "

Inflation remains sticky, demand is firm and labour market slack is waning, all of which argue against further cuts. However, markets have already priced that shift aggressively. If the Bank stops short of going that far, it could set up a classic \u2018buy the rumour, sell the fact\u2019 outcome, leaving AUD vulnerable to a knee-jerk pullback before the broader bullish trend reasserts itself.\nHawkish Tone Already Set in November\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia enters its final meeting of the year with a distinctly hawkish tone already established in November, when the Board warned that \u201cinflation has recently picked up.\u201d That phrase will be the one traders focus on today, as it signals the RBA\u2019s growing discomfort with price pressures that were \u201cmaterially higher than expected\u201d in the September quarter. At the same time, the Bank acknowledged uncertainty about whether policy remains restrictive, a subtle but important admission that the easing cycle may have run its course.\nSource: ABS\nSince then, the data has only reinforced those concerns. October\u2019s CPI report showed headline and trimmed mean inflation accelerating further, both above the top of the 2\u20133% target band, while household spending surged 1.3%, the strongest monthly gain since January 2024. Discretionary categories led the improvement, suggesting demand is not just holding up but strengthening, a dynamic that risks amplifying underlying price pressures.\nLabour market conditions have also tightened. Unemployment tumbled to 4.3% from 4.5% as employment surged by 42,200, while underemployment and underutilisation fell alongside youth unemployment. These shifts hint that slack in the economy is being eaten into, raising the risk that wage pressures could reaccelerate, particularly with productivity growth weak and unit labour costs still high.\nPolicy Options Narrow: Hold or Hike\nAgainst this backdrop, it is highly likely that if the RBA discusses two policy options today, they will be to hold or hike, not hold or cut. It\u2019s likely this will be the first question RBA Governor Michele Bullock is asked at her post-meeting press conference, scheduled to begin an hour after the rates decision drops at 2.30pm AEDT.\nSource: Bloomberg\nHeading into the December meeting, swaps are fully priced for the RBA\u2019s next hiking cycle to begin by November next year, with around a one-in-four chance of a second 25-point increase also baked in for that meeting. The first move may arrive even sooner, with pricing for a hike at the RBA\u2019s May meeting sitting at 55%, indicating traders marginally favour a move within six months.\nWhat to Watch in the Statement\nFor traders, the real test will come from the language the RBA uses to describe the labour market, inflation, wage pressures and cyclical areas such as housing and consumer spending. Pay particular attention to the final paragraph of the statement, as this is where the Bank often delivers explicit guidance on the rate outlook. While it\u2019s unlikely to appear today, if there is a tweak, it\u2019s far more likely to be hawkish than dovish.\nFor those new to trading around the RBA decision, the subheadings in the statement provide an excellent and near-instant read on the Bank\u2019s thinking, allowing for quick assessment of how markets may react. Keep in mind that Michele Bullock often comes across as more hawkish than the tone of the statement, which is crafted by the entire Board, so the period between the statement and her press conference could be volatile.\nTrading Risks: Buy the Rumour, Sell the Fact?\nMy concern heading into the meeting is that hawkish pricing has advanced far beyond what the RBA will be willing to signal publicly.

At the time of writing, the pair is hovering near 0.6621, with traders turning cautious ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest rate decision on Tuesday.\nMarkets widely expect the RBA to keep interest rates unchanged at 3.60%, following back-to-back holds in September and November after delivering three cuts earlier in the year. With the move fully priced in, the focus shifts to the forward guidance, especially as speculation grows that policymakers may tilt toward tightening heading into 2026 if domestic conditions stay firm.\nAt the same time, investors are also looking ahead to Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision, where the central bank is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points. The diverging monetary policy paths leave the near-term outlook tilted in favor of AUD/USD upside, particularly if the RBA delivers a hawkish hold.\nFrom a technical perspective, AUD/USD remains well-supported, following a clean break above the 0.6600 psychological level that now acts as immediate support.\nHolding above this level reinforces the bullish tone and keeps the door open for a retest of this year\u2019s peak at 0.6707, marked on September 17 and standing as the year-to-date high as well as the strongest level since October 2024.\nA decisive break above 0.6707 would expose the psychological 0.6800 handle as the next upside target if momentum continues to strengthen.\nOn the downside, a daily close back below 0.6600 would undermine the short-term bullish bias and expose the next support region at 0.6540-0.6530, where the 21-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) converge. A deeper pullback could extend toward the 0.6450 area.\nMomentum indicators reinforce the constructive tone. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line advances in positive territory, suggesting strengthening bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is holding around 65, keeping a firm upward bias without entering overbought conditions.\nEconomic Indicator\nRBA Interest Rate Decision\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announces its interest rate decision at the end of its eight scheduled meetings per year. If the RBA is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises interest rates it is usually bullish for the Australian Dollar (AUD). Likewise, if the RBA has a dovish view on the Australian economy and keeps interest rates unchanged, or cuts them, it is seen as bearish for AUD.\nRead more.Next release: Tue Dec 09, 2025 03:30\nFrequency: Irregular\nConsensus: 3.6%\nPrevious: 3.6%\nSource: Reserve Bank of Australia\nAuthor\nVishal Chaturvedi\nFXStreet\nI am a macro-focused research analyst with over four years of experience covering forex and commodities market.

Buying pressure on the US Dollar emerges as markets reposition ahead of Wednesday\u2019s crucial Federal Reserve (Fed) decision, in a context of elevated volatility following a strong earthquake in Japan.\nInvestors remain convinced that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points this week, with chances around 86% according to the CME FedWatch tool. However, the communication from Chair Jerome Powell may take on a more restrictive tone to emphasize the risks of persistent inflation. Several analysts also highlight the possibility of an unusual number of dissenters within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), according to Reuters, which would reduce visibility on the policy path heading into 2026.\nWith no major US data scheduled on Monday, attention turns to Tuesday\u2019s ADP Employment Report and JOLTS Job Openings, which could refine the assessment of the labor-market slowdown, especially as November\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report will not be released until next week. Friday\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data confirmed a slower-than-hoped disinflation trend, with Core PCE at 2.8% YoY, reinforcing the idea that the Fed may want to limit the pace of easing next year.\nIn Japan, tension escalated after a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck the northeast of the country. According to Nikkei Asia, tsunami warnings were issued for Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate. The event immediately weighed on Japanese assets, while the Japanese Yen (JPY) weakened as investors assessed the potential economic impact and the risk that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may postpone its anticipated rate hike.\nRecent macroeconomic data also raise concerns about Japan\u2019s ability to absorb rapid monetary tightening. The third-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was revised down to an annualized contraction of 2.3%, the sharpest since 2023. However, nominal wages grew 2.6% in October, continuing to fuel expectations of a rate hike at the December BoJ meeting. Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields remain near multi-year highs, reflecting this shifting policy narrative.\nIn summary, USD/JPY sits at the crossroads of two opposing forces. A US Dollar supported by rising US yields and a Japanese Yen weakened by post-earthquake uncertainty, despite prospects of policy tightening. The Fed decision on Wednesday, combined with the gradual assessment of the earthquake\u2019s economic impact, will likely shape the pair\u2019s next moves.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Japanese Yen Technical Analysis: USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY\nThe Japanese Yen showed strength last week as expectations for a December rate hike from the BoJ built into markets. But perhaps the bigger question is what\u2019s next for the BoJ, and whether the bank will continue to hike rates into 2026 and 2027.\nUSD/JPY is pushing out of a falling wedge formation that built last week after price found support in the familiar 154.45-155.00 zone. This was an area of prior resistance when the pair was rallying into late-November and so far, it\u2019s held as higher-low support. For USD-strength scenarios, USD/JPY still looks to be one of the more attractive major FX pairs, but for traders looking to avoid USD altogether, Yen-weakness has similarly been on display against both the Euro and British Pound, looked at further below.\nUSD/JPY\nIn the major of USD/JPY last week was largely a period of defense. The 154.45-155.00 zone came into play on Monday although buyers were unable to re-take control. Recurrent tests on Thursday and Friday similarly saw holds, but on Friday, bulls started to tip-toe back above the 155.00 level, and as I looked at in the weekend video, USD/JPY retained interest for USD-strength scenarios as we came into Fed week.\nThat support last week helped to slow sellers at or around lows and that built a falling wedge formation, which is often approached with aim of bullish breakout, such as we\u2019re seeing now.\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nUSD/JPY\nFrom the four-hour chart we can see the higher-high after the falling wedge breakout and this gives some shorter-term bullish scope to match up with the bigger picture bullish bias. This would also keep the door open for a support test at the 155.00 handle, which could technically qualify as a higher-low given last Friday\u2019s test and hold of the 154.45 level. I\u2019m tracking next resistance up at 156.20, which is a spot of prior support turned resistance.\nUSD/JPY Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/JPY\nFor the past couple of weeks EUR/JPY has been locked in a consistent range. Unable to break above 182 yet defended multiple times above 180.00, the mean reversion has been clean. Given the holds at resistance, it\u2019s difficult to get excited about chasing the pair so close to resistance \u2013 but \u2013 if there is a break there\u2019s a couple of different ways to move forward. A break of 181.50 can open the door for a push up to 182 although this would be an aggressive stance. Or \u2013 for traders looking to be a bit more patient, waiting for a test of 182.00 to allow for a pullback to support at prior resistance of 181.50 could allow for a trend-like approach to working with breakout scenarios.\nAlternatively, if we do see pullback and range continuation, it\u2019s the spot from 180-180.14 that remains of interest as the trader could essentially trade the range with a prior trend-side bias; and then if price does venture back up to resistance, manage the trade and look for breakout then.\nEUR/JPY Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/JPY\nFor JPY-weakness I\u2019ve been focusing on GBP/JPY for the past few weeks, following the GBP/USD recovery after the early-November sell-off. And as I wrote earlier, GBP/USD seems one of the more attractive major pairs for USD-weakness and if married up with USD/JPY which appears as one of the more attractive pairs for USD-strength, the trader can, in essence, remove the USD from the equation altogether by looking at GBP/JPY.\nThe complication with near-term GBP/JPY strategy is where the pair trades on a bigger picture basis. This is the same zone that reversed GBP/JPY back in the summer of last year \u2013 but this does offer some contrast to the EUR/JPY setup above, which is currently trading near ATHs.\nGBP/JPY Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nGBP/JPY Shorter-Term\nGBP/JPY is in the process of driving a shor"

                "body": "USD/JPY Price Forecast: Dollar Gains to 155.80 as BoJ Rate Hike Bets Collide with Fed Cut Expectations\nWage Growth, Earthquake Impact, and Policy Divergence Shape Yen Volatility\nThe USD/JPY pair trades at 155.80, up 0.30% on the day, holding near a two-week high as global investors position ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision this Wednesday. The market now faces a rare divergence: Japan moving toward tightening while the U.S. prepares to ease. This structural policy split has pushed volatility in yen pairs to multi-month highs, with traders recalibrating exposure following Japan\u2019s 7.6-magnitude earthquake and strong wage data that reinforce the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) tightening bias.\nBoJ Rate Hike Probability Hits 90% as Wage Data Strengthens Inflation Outlook\nJapanese wage growth continues to redefine the BoJ\u2019s macro stance. Average cash earnings rose 2.6% year-on-year in October, up from 2.1% in September, marking the third consecutive month of acceleration. Overtime pay grew 1.5%, signaling sustained labor market demand. The union federation UA Zensen plans to seek a 6% wage increase in 2026, after securing a 4.75% rise in 2025, amplifying structural inflation pressures. The BoJ swaps curve now implies a 90% probability of a 25bps rate hike to 0.75% on December 19, the most aggressive pricing since the bank exited yield curve control. Markets interpret this as the final phase of ultra-loose policy, confirming the end of Japan\u2019s deflationary era that lasted over three decades.\nJapan\u2019s Inflation Resilience Offsets GDP Contraction\nRevised Q3 GDP data showed the economy contracted 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, worse than the preliminary 0.5% decline. However, the GDP deflator \u2014 a broad measure of inflation \u2014 surged to 3.4% from 2.8%, confirming entrenched price momentum. Private consumption rose 0.2%, double initial expectations, while capital expenditure fell 0.2%, reversing prior estimates. These figures reinforce the narrative that inflationary forces in Japan are now structural rather than cyclical. Despite the weaker growth headline, the nominal economy remains firm, validating the BoJ\u2019s shift toward normalization.\nU.S. Fed Cut Expectations Limit Dollar Upside\nAcross the Pacific, the Federal Reserve is expected to deliver a 25bps rate cut this week, with CME FedWatch assigning an 88% probability. However, speculation of a \u201chawkish cut\u201d persists \u2014 meaning the Fed could ease rates while signaling caution against rapid easing in 2026. Core PCE inflation at 2.8% year-on-year remains above target, giving Chair Powell limited room to sound dovish. U.S. Treasury yields rose overnight, supporting the dollar\u2019s rebound, yet investors anticipate three to four rate cuts next year as inflation cools and growth decelerates. This widening divergence \u2014 BoJ tightening versus Fed easing \u2014 has placed the USD/JPY pair at a policy crossroads.\nEarthquake and Fiscal Uncertainty Weigh on Yen Outlook\nThe 7.6-magnitude earthquake in northern Japan introduced fresh uncertainty into monetary policy timing. Damage assessments continue, but analysts expect fiscal stimulus to follow, increasing government borrowing and pushing Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields higher. Ten-year JGB yields surged to 1.97%, the highest since 2007, as investors anticipate an expanded reconstruction budget. Although this dynamic supports a stronger yen through yield differentials, it also risks delaying the BoJ\u2019s next rate hike should the economic disruption deepen. For now, traders treat the event as JPY-neutral, balancing reconstruction optimism against policy risk.\nTechnical Picture: USD/JPY Faces Dual Resistance at 155.50 and 156.15\nThe pair has broken above a descending channel formed in November, confirming short-term bullish momentum. Resistance stands at 155.50 \u2014 the prior December high \u2014 followed by 156.15 and 156.60. A sustained break above 156.60 could open room toward 157.90, the November peak, though intervention risk remains high near those levels. On the dow"

                "body": "USD/CAD trades near its lowest level since late September following strong Canadian employment data. Traders expect the Bank of Canada (BoC) to maintain interest rates on Wednesday due to recent data suggesting a steady approach.\nThe Canadian Dollar inches higher against the US Dollar as market attention focuses on differing expectations for the BoC and the Federal Reserve (Fed). USD/CAD is trading near 1.3807, marking its lowest level since September 22, after a 0.95% drop on Friday.\nBank Of Canada Interest Rate Expectation\nThe BoC is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 2.25% at its policy meeting, as economic indicators support a steady stance. Canada\u2019s job market is robust, with 53.6K jobs added in November, surpassing expectations, and the unemployment rate falling to 6.5% from 6.9%.\nInflation trends are varied. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) eased to 2.2% YoY in October, slightly above the 2.1% consensus. Growth metrics show a rebound, with the GDP expanding 0.6% in Q3, reversing a -0.5% decline in Q2.\nIn the US, the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision is imminent, with an 87% chance of a 25 bps cut. Market sentiment remains in favour of the Canadian Dollar due to policy divergence ahead of central bank decisions.\nBased on the current outlook as of December 8, 2025, we are seeing a clear policy split between the Bank of Canada and the US Federal Reserve. This divergence is the primary driver for the Canadian dollar\u2019s recent strength. Traders should prepare for significant moves surrounding the central bank decisions this Wednesday.\nCentral Bank Policy Divergence\nThe Canadian economy is showing resilience, which supports our view that the Bank of Canada will hold its rate steady at 2.25%. The latest report from Statistics Canada confirmed the economy added 53,600 jobs in November, pushing the unemployment rate down to 6.5%. This strong labor market, combined with core inflation holding firm at 2.9%, gives the BoC little reason to consider easing policy right now.\nConversely, the argument for a US Federal Reserve rate cut is growing stronger. Recent data shows US Core PCE, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, has fallen to 2.7% year-over-year, continuing a cooling trend we have observed through most of 2025. This, along with mixed labor data, has pushed market expectations for a cut this week to nearly 87%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nFor derivative traders, this outlook suggests positioning for a continued slide in USD/CAD. Buying put options on USD/CAD offers a straightforward way to gain downside exposure while capping risk ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcements. We should target strike prices below the current 1.3800 level, potentially looking toward the lows seen back in the third quarter.\nGiven the scheduled event risk, implied volatility is likely elevated, which presents other opportunities. For those who believe the downward move is already priced in, selling out-of-the-money call spreads on USD/CAD could be a viable strategy to collect premium. This position benefits if the pair moves lower, stays flat, or rises only moderately.\nWe can look to history for a guide on how these policy differences play out. We saw a similar dynamic back in 2023 when the Bank of Canada paused its rate-hiking cycle well before the Federal Reserve did. That period showed us that policy divergence can be a powerful and lasting driver for currency pairs, often creating trends that persist for several months."

                "body": "USD/CAD Forecast: Bears might await FOMC decision on Wednesday before placing fresh bets\n- USD/CAD consolidates Friday\u2019s upbeat Canadian jobs data-inspired heavy losses.\n- The divergent BoC-Fed policy expectations back the case for further depreciation.\n- Traders, however, seem reluctant ahead of the key FOMC decision on Wednesday.\nThe USD/CAD pair oscillates in a narrow trading band near its lowest level since September 23 touched earlier this Monday, and seems vulnerable to slide further amid a bearish fundamental backdrop. The Canadian Dollar (CAD) continues with its relative outperformance on the back of Friday's upbeat domestic employment details, which reaffirmed the Bank of Canada's (BoC) hawkish outlook. This, along with the recent move up in Crude Oil prices, underpins the commodity-linked Loonie and weighs on the currency pair amid a bearish US Dollar (USD).\nThe latest figures published by Statistics Canada showed on Friday that the number of employed people rose for the third straight month, by 53,600 in November, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 6.5% from 6.9% in the previous month. This comes after the BoC signal in October that it is likely finished cutting interest rates for now, and boosts the CAD. The USD, on the other hand, languishes near its lowest level since late October amid bets for more rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and validates the negative outlook for the USD/CAD pair.\nAccording to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, traders are pricing in a nearly 90% chance that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs by 25 basis points (bps) at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The bets were lifted by a delayed report published by the US Commerce Department on Friday, which showed that the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index matched consensus estimates and rose 2.8% on a yearly basis in September. Moreover, the core PCE Price Index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.8% compared to 2.9% in August.\nThis comes on top of signs of a cooling US labor market backs the case for more easing by the Fed. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to the hawkish BoC and suggests that the path of least resistance for the USD/CAD pair is to the downside. Traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bearish bets and opt to wait for more cues about the Fed's rate-cut path. Hence, the focus will be on the updated economic projections, including the so-called dot plot, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments during the post-meeting press conference.\nUSD/CAD daily chart\nTechnical Outlook\nAgainst the backdrop of the recent repeated failures ahead of the mid-1.4100s, Friday's sustained break and close below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), around the 1.3900 mark, favors the USD/CAD bears. However, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is already flashing slightly oversold conditions and makes it prudent to wait for some near-term consolidation or a modest rebound before positioning for further losses heading into the key central bank event risks.\nIn the meantime, the 1.3860 immediate hurdle is likely to cap any attempted recovery ahead of the 1.3900 mark, or the 200-day SMA. A sustained strength beyond the latter could trigger a short-covering rally and lift the USD/CAD pair beyond the 1.3950-1.3955 intermediate hurdle, towards reclaiming the 1.4000 psychological mark. Some follow-through buying would negate the negative outlook and shift the near-term bias back in favor of bullish traders.\nOn the flip side, weakness below the 1.3800 round figure could find some support near the 1.3770 region ahead of the September swing low, around the 1.3720 region. Failure to defend the said support levels would make the USD/CAD pair vulnerable to extend the decline further towards the 1.3660-1.3655 intermediate support before eventually dropping to test sub-1.3600 levels.\nPremium\nYou have reached your limit of 3 free articles for this month.\nStart you"

Global liquidity requires cheap funding out of Japan, and I think that will continue to be the mainstay of the asset bubbles that everybody enjoys.\nPullbacks and Trend Considerations\nShort-term pullbacks are buying opportunities, and I do believe that the 50-day EMA at the very least is your floor, and that is right around the 203.62 Yen level and rising. As long as we don't get some type of major meltdown on a global stage, I expect the Japanese Yen to continue to weaken, but I don't know that we won't get the occasional pullback. You'll just have to make sure that you have enough space for your stop loss to take advantage of these dips and, more importantly, hang on to the trend.\nYou get paid at the end of every day to hold this pair, and that's something that I like.

                "body": "Ethereum\u2019s recent downturn has caught many traders off guard. With ETH losing 20% of its market cap, investors are questioning where the next real upside might come from.\nWhile larger assets struggle to recover, a new DeFi altcoin, priced at $0.035, is quietly reaching a 96% sellout in its presale. Some analysts believe this shift shows investors are moving toward lower-cost tokens with stronger early growth potential.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining attention as the presale nears its final stretch.\nEthereum (ETH)\nEthereum remains one of the biggest names in the cryptocurrency market. Years ago, ETH\u2019s price was under $10 before climbing all the way above $4,000 and becoming the leading platform for smart contracts. Its early surge created massive returns for holders, and ETH still has a multi-billion-dollar market cap today.\nBut that scale is now part of its challenge. With such a large valuation, many traders believe the room for exponential upside is limited compared to smaller altcoins still entering the market. Gas fees, the slow adoption of upgrades, and competition from lower-cost networks have also prompted some investors to seek alternative opportunities.\nFollowing ETH\u2019s recent 20% decline in market cap, the focus has shifted toward new projects with lower entry prices and stronger potential for high-percentage gains. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the conversation for users seeking early-stage exposure.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM)\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a lending protocol with two active markets. The first is the Peer-to-Contract market. Users supply assets such as ETH or USDT into a liquidity pool. In return, they receive mtTokens. These mtTokens rise in value over time as borrowers repay interest.\nTo illustrate how the yield works, imagine someone deposits $1,000 worth of ETH. As borrowers repay interest, the mtTokens increase in value, providing the supplier with natural APY growth tied to real protocol activity.\nThe second market is the Peer-to-Peer lending environment. Borrowers can choose flexible rates that depend on liquidity levels. When liquidity is high, borrow rates stay lower. When liquidity is tight, rates rise to attract more deposits.\nMutuum Finance also uses LTV rules to safeguard its loans. If collateral drops too far and the loan becomes unsafe, liquidations occur. In this event, liquidators purchase discounted collateral and repay a portion of the borrower\u2019s debt, thereby stabilizing their position.\nAnalysts highlight that this dual-market system gives Mutuum Finance strong utility from day one. With both mtToken yield and flexible borrowing, the protocol is designed to support real activity and consistent revenue. That revenue later supports the token\u2019s buy-and-distribute model, creating long-term buying pressure.\nPresale Numbers and Daily Incentives\nSince Mutuum Finance began in early 2025, it has raised $19.1 million, attracted 18,300 holders, and sold 810 million tokens. From the 4 billion total MUTM supply, about 1.82 billion tokens are allocated for the presale. This means nearly half the future circulating supply is in early community hands.\nMUTM is currently priced at $0.035, reflecting a 250% increase from Phase 1. At launch, the token is set to list at $0.06, and some analysts believe post-launch activity could drive the price even higher. Early investor sentiment suggests that purchasing at $0.035 could yield a strong upside, particularly if the first exchange listings are announced soon after launch.\nSecurity has played a key role in the project\u2019s growing credibility. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score and is undergoing an independent review by Halborn Security. It also launched a $50K bug bounty focused on code vulnerabilities.\nTo keep community activity high, the project runs a 24-hour leaderboard. The top contributor each day earns $500 in MUTM, which has led to steady presale inflows. When the treasury jumps sharply, such"

He has consistently advocated for the blockchain, citing the unique technical properties that make it a leading platform for developers.\nSolana currently has a total value locked of $8.41 billion, according to DeFiLlama, only trailing Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), making it one of the biggest blockchains for decentralized finance.\nAdditionally, Chainspect data shows Solana has the most active developers across all blockchains.\nScaramucci said Solana is a core position for SkyBridge and for his personal holdings. He said the firm invested early, similar to its Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) strategy five years ago.\nScaramucci previously authored a book called \"The Little Book of Bitcoin,\" aimed at helping readers grasp the financial significance of digital assets.\nBuilding a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\nFor those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\nMoomoo isn't just for trading \u2014 it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock\u2014but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\nAmerican Hartford Gold\nFor investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides asimple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets."

That is where Remittix (RTX) enters the picture as another Best Crypto To Buy Now candidate, with more than $28.5 million raised for a payment-focused token. Together, they show how traders mix established momentum with early-stage payment growth.\nSolana Price Action Today And What It Means For 2025\nSolana trades at $138 today, with a market cap of about $77.9 billion and daily volume around $4.8 billion, which places it firmly in the large-cap group of the crypto market. For many traders, this liquidity alone makes Solana one of the clearer entries when shortlisting the Best Crypto To Buy Now.\nThe Solana ecosystem has become one of the fastest-growing Layer-1 networks, expanding across DeFi, NFTs, gaming, AI and memecoins. Technical traders watch support near the $130 zone and resistance around $145 to $150, where recent rallies have stalled.\nThe takeaway is that Solana remains a strong candidate for growth, yet its size and past gains limit the asymmetry that early-stage investors often seek.\nRemittix Stands Out As A Real-World Payment Contender\nWhile Solana focuses on broad smart contracts, Remittix targets one problem very directly: payments and global remittance. Investors who see Solana as one of the Best Crypto To Buy Now for network growth often add Remittix beside it as a focused payments token with more room to grow.\nMore than 693 million RTX tokens have already been sold at $0.119, with over $28.5 million raised, reinforcing that demand. Remittix aims to become a crypto-to-fiat payment hub with a wallet, web app, fiat rails, and API connections for merchants and payment partners.\nThe live iOS wallet on the Apple App Store already works as a full crypto wallet, while a major December update will add crypto-to-fiat features and turn it into a PayFi gateway. Two centralized exchange listings are secured at BitMart and LBank, with a third planned once the raise passes $30 million.\nThe team is fully audited and verified by CertiK and Remittix now ranks number one for pre-launch tokens on CertiK Skynet, with a Skynet Score of 80.09 and thousands of community ratings that signal public trust.\nKey points that make RTX stand out in the current crypto market are:\n- Focus on real-world payments and global remittance\n- Direct crypto-to-bank transfers are planned in more than 30 countries\n- Utility-first token that aims to support real transaction volume\n- Audited by CertiK with public Skynet monitoring and an A-grade security score\n- Built for adoption and daily use rather than short-term speculation\nBalancing Solana Momentum With Remittix Payment Growth For 2025\nSolana still has a strong case when traders search for the Best Crypto To Buy Now, thanks to deep liquidity, active users and a steady stream of ecosystem news. At the same time, the market is starting to reward real-world payment tokens, and the more than $28.5 million raised by Remittix shows how fast that shift is building.\nFor investors who want a blend of established layer 1 strength and focused payment growth, pairing Solana with Remittix offers a balanced way to approach 2025.

Both look set to deliver, even if the path proves choppier than the straight-line gains seen in parts of 2024 and 2025.\nCorporate earnings have weathered the storm of higher rates and elevated costs remarkably well. Margins have held up, productivity gains are finally showing through, and revenue growth remains solid across most sectors. The pessimism that dominated much of 2022 and 2023 has proven misplaced, with companies demonstrating pricing power and operational efficiency that exceeded expectations.\nThe AI investment boom is beginning to translate into tangible benefits. While sceptics focus on the massive capital expenditure, the productivity gains are becoming visible in corporate results. This supports both margin expansion and top-line growth, providing a foundation for continued earnings momentum through 2026.\nThe Fed, meanwhile, has room to ease policy without reigniting inflation concerns. Disinflation is sufficiently entrenched that rate cuts can proceed at a measured pace, providing a tailwind for risk assets without requiring an economic crisis to justify them. This \"goldilocks\" scenario of growth with easing financial conditions is exactly what equity markets need.\nValuation concerns are overblown. Yes, the market isn't cheap, but it rarely is at the start of sustained bull runs. Elevated multiples reflect strong fundamentals and improving earnings visibility, not irrational exuberance. The concentration in mega-cap tech simply reflects where the growth is, and there's no reason to expect this leadership to falter when these companies continue to deliver.\nMid-term election years bring volatility, but the overall trajectory remains upward. Historical weakness in these periods tends to create buying opportunities rather than signalling sustained declines. With corporate balance sheets strong, buyback activity robust, and liquidity conditions improving, the path of least resistance is higher.\nPullbacks will happen, as they always do. But the fundamental backdrop of earnings growth, Fed support and solid corporate fundamentals argues for buying dips rather than fighting the trend. The bull market has further to run.\nTechnical analysis\nDow Jones\nWhile 50,000 eluded the Dow Jones index in 2025, it staged an impressive recovery from the tariff panic of April. After dropping below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) in March, and then falling to below 37,000, the index recovered its losses and then moved higher, and by mid-August it was at a new record high.\nFor the moment, the progression of new highs and higher lows confirms the solid technical outlook to match the strong earnings and macroeconomic picture.\nDow Jones candlestick chart\nS&P 500\nIt is a similar picture for this index, and the S&P 500's bigger weighting to the tech sector meant that the recovery has been even stronger. The rally since April has been remarkably quiet, with only the November pullback really threatening to disrupt the broader uptrend.\nS&P 500 candlestick chart\nA note on volatility\nApart from March-May, the year has been quite a quiet one overall. Investors and traders alike need to be prepared for the possibility that this will not be the case next year. It is now around eight months since the 20% drop in April, which means we may be closer to the next drop than to the one last April. The \u2018average\u2019 year sees at least one fall of 14% for the S&P 500, and a similar one for the Dow.\nThe quiet period of the last eight months will not last for ever, and it is important to be aware that volatility can return at some point in the new year.\nImportant to know\nThis information has been prepared "

The Nasdaq advanced 1.5% last week, while the S&P 500 added 0.6%. The Dow lagged, finishing slightly negative.\nInvestor focus is dominated by two topics for the upcoming week: policy clarity on trade and earnings from tech heavyweights. On Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reaffirmed the White House\u2019s Aug. 1 deadline for new tariffs, calling it a \"hard stop\" for compliance \u2014 before saying that he's looking at continued conversation beyond that date.\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, earnings season shifts into high gear with Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA) set to report Wednesday.

December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) fell -0.35%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) fell -0.27%.\nStock indexes settled lower on Monday, pressured by higher bond yields. The 10-year T-note yield climbed to a 2.25-month high on Monday at 4.19% and finished up +4 bp at 4.17%. However, stocks have support on expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates following the 2-day FOMC meeting that ends on Wednesday.

Confluent closed up more than +29% after IBM acquired the company for about $11 billion, including debt. Also, Carvana closed up more than +12% after S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company will replace LKQ Corp in the S&P 500 before trading begins on Monday, December 22.\nThe markets this week will focus on government reports and the FOMC meeting. On Tuesday, Oct JOLTS job openings are expected to increase by 7,150. On Wednesday, the Q3 employment cost index is expected to climb by +0.9%. The results of the Tue/Wed FOMC meeting are expected to show a -25 bp cut in the federal funds target range to 3.50%-3.75%. The markets will also look at the Fed's summary of economic projections and its dot-plot interest rate forecast. In addition, post-meeting comments from Fed Chair Powell on Wednesday about the future direction of interest rates could move the markets. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +29,000 to 220,000.\nMonday\u2019s Chinese trade report was mixed as China\u2019s Nov exports rose +5.9% y/y, stronger than expectations of +4.0% y/y. However, Nov imports rose by only +1.9% y/y, weaker than expectations of +3.0% y/y.\nPresident Trump said last Tuesday that he will announce his selection for the new Fed Chair in early 2026. Bloomberg reported last week that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is seen as the likely choice to succeed Powell. The Fed\u2019s independence would come into question, as Hassett supports President Trump\u2019s approach to cutting interest rates at the Fed.\nThe markets are discounting a 99% chance of another -25 bp rate cut at the conclusion of the 2-day FOMC meeting on Wednesday.\nQ3 corporate earnings season is drawing to a close as 495 of the 500 S&P companies have released results.

Supply pressures are undercutting T-note prices as the Treasury will auction $119 billion of T-notes and T-bonds this week. Also, T-notes are weighed down by negative carryover from a fall in Japanese 10-year JGB bond prices to an 18-year low today, amid prospects for a BOJ rate hike later this month. T-notes recovered from their worst level on strong demand for the Treasury\u2019s $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes that had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.64, better than the 10-auction average of 2.63.\nEuropean government bond yields moved higher on Monday.

                "body": "The UK stock market started the new week on the back foot on Monday, 8 December 2025, as investors juggled a landmark Unilever spin\u2011off, a renewed bond sell\u2011off and looming interest\u2011rate decisions from both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.\nBy the closing bell in London, the FTSE 100 had slipped around 0.2% to 9,645.09, while the FTSE 250 fell 0.7% to 21,921.28 and the AIM All\u2011Share lost 0.4% to 748.52. Alternative benchmarks told a similar story, with the Cboe UK 100 down 0.2%, the Cboe UK 250 off 0.6% and Cboe Small Companies down 0.9%. [1]\nAcross the continent, the pan\u2011European STOXX 600 faded 0.1%, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 underperforming slightly, down about 0.23%, as higher long\u2011dated bond yields weighed on real estate and other rate\u2011sensitive sectors. [2]\nIndex recap: a cautious start to a crucial week\nThe price action was muted but telling.\n- FTSE 100: down 21.92 points (\u20110.2%) at 9,645.09. [3]\n- FTSE 250: down 142.67 points (\u20110.7%) at 21,921.28. [4]\n- AIM All\u2011Share: down 0.4% at 748.52. [5]\n- Investing.com UK 100: fell roughly 0.24% at the close, echoing the broader UK equity weakness. [6]\nThe tone was shaped by two big macro questions:\n- Will the Fed cut rates again on Wednesday?\n- Markets are pricing around a 90% chance of another 25 bps cut, which would be the third consecutive reduction, taking the federal funds target range to roughly 3.5\u20133.75%, according to CME FedWatch data cited by Reuters. [7]\n- Will the Bank of England follow suit?\n- The BoE is widely expected to trim Bank Rate by 25 bps to about 3.75% next week, after holding in November, as a still\u2011weak UK jobs market and post\u2011budget tax concerns weigh on business confidence. [8]\nIn the background, UK government bond yields moved higher alongside European peers, with a Bloomberg live blog noting that UK bonds were falling amid a broader sell\u2011off as traders pared back rate\u2011cut expectations. [9]\nUnilever\u2019s Magnum spin\u2011off: ice cream debuts, parent melts\nThe single biggest story on the FTSE 100 today was Unilever\u2019s demerger of its ice\u2011cream business, now trading as The Magnum Ice Cream Company (MICC).\nWhat actually happened\n- Unilever completed the separation of its global ice\u2011cream arm \u2014 which includes Magnum \u2014 over the weekend, with Magnum shares debuting today in Amsterdam, London and New York. [10]\n- In Amsterdam, Magnum opened around \u20ac12.20, below the \u20ac12.80 reference price, implying a valuation of roughly \u20ac7.8\u20137.9 billion, shy of some earlier expectations. [11]\n- Unilever has flagged that a share consolidation will take place after today\u2019s London close to adjust for the value of the spin\u2011off. [12]\nMarket reaction\nThe reaction in the parent stock was brutal:\n- Unilever fell about 6.6% to 4,160p, making it the FTSE 100\u2019s worst performer of the day. [13]\nAlliance News and Reuters commentary point to a couple of key drivers behind the drop: [14]\n- Technical selling pressure\n- Magnum is headquartered in the Netherlands and listed primarily on Euronext Amsterdam, meaning it is not eligible for inclusion in the FTSE UK index series.\n- UK index funds benchmarked to FTSE UK indices that received Magnum shares in the spin\u2011off are forced sellers, creating short\u2011term downward pressure on the new listing and sentiment knock\u2011on for Unilever.\n- Valuation reset & uncertainty\n- Magnum\u2019s initial valuation came in lower than some earlier estimates, prompting investors to reassess how much long\u2011term value Unilever has actually unlocked. [15]\nDespite the rocky debut, Morningstar and other analysts quoted in today\u2019s coverage remain constructive on the long\u2011term story, arguing that a standalone Magnum should benefit from a focused management team and category\u2011specific strategy, even if early flows are dominated by forced selling and arbitrage. [16]\nRate jitters hit housebuilders and real estate \u2013 but 2026 hopes stay alive\nHigher bond yields and the prospect of further central\u2011bank moves left UK housing and property shares among the weakest pockets of the market.\n-"

In several sectors, earnings have grown faster than revenues, signalling that firms have been able to preserve pricing power or offset softer sales through productivity gains and operational efficiency improvements.\nSideways trading reflects mixed performance\nChemicals, cyclical manufacturers exposed to China \u2013 and its lacklustre growth \u2013 utilities and real estate (though not heavily represented in the DAX 40) weighed on the German stock index's performance.\nThis and the unwinding of trades where \u2018overvalued\u2019 US AI and technology plays were sold in favour of stock purchases in Europe's largest economy \u2013 such as at the beginning of the year - explain why the DAX 40 has been trading sideways since June of 2025.\nAt the same time the German blue chip index\u2019s peers have been catching up - and in the case of the Nasdaq 100 \u2013 started to outperform the DAX 40 towards the latter part of 2025.\nDAX 40 versus global peers year-to-date performance chart\nUS tariff-induced lower demand for German goods and services as well as unfavourable currency dynamics - particularly with the euro appreciating by around 15% in the first half of the year \u2013 means that exporters with a high share of US dollar (USD)-denominated sales no longer have a natural earnings tailwind.\nAI adoption supports operational efficiency\nMeanwhile, the diffusion of AI-driven automation and digitalisation is gradually filtering into core German industries, providing incremental support.\nWhile Germany is not viewed as a pure technology powerhouse, many DAX names - from industrial automation specialists to advanced manufacturers - are beginning to realise meaningful efficiency gains. These incremental improvements support margins and help cushion the cyclical downturn that has characterised much of 2023-2024.\nThe adoption of automation and digital technologies represents a structural shift that could provide sustained competitive advantages.\nECB easing provides supportive backdrop\nOn the policy front, the European Central Bank (ECB) might at present be reticent - but has scope - to ease further in 2026 without jeopardising its disinflation progress.\nEurozone inflation, which fluctuated between 1.9% and 2.5% during 2025, hovered around its 2% central bank target rate during the second half of the year.\nWith inflation expectations anchored and growth still subdued across the bloc, policy"

                "body": "Germany is on course for the highest corporate insolvency count in more than a decade, raising fresh questions about the resilience of the nation\u2019s largest listed companies \u2014 and the ETFs that track them.\nThe latest data from Creditreform, cited by Reuters, paints a sobering picture of deepening financial strain across Europe\u2019s biggest economy. For investors in the iShares MSCI Germany ETF (NYSE:EWG) and the Global X DAX Germany ETF (NASDAQ:DAX), those stresses may soon become harder to ignore.\n\u2022 iShares MSCI Germany Index Fund stock is trading near recent highs. What\u2019s next for EWG stock?\nCorporate Failures Hit 11-Year High\nCreditreform predicts that about 23,900 German companies will go bankrupt in 2025, an increase of 8.3% over last year and the most since 2014. The pace of deterioration has slowed, but the report marks a second successive year of economic contraction, rising costs, and shrinking access to credit.\nSmall and micro-enterprises, those with 10 employees or fewer, account for over 80% of all insolvency cases, emphasizing the vulnerability of Germany's SME backbone. While individually small, these firms supply, support and service many of the country's largest public companies.\nThis makes the insolvency spike relevant for ETF investors, as ripple effects-such as supply-chain delays, payment defaults and tighter credit conditions \u2014 can ultimately influence the performance of large-cap constituents inside both EWG and DAX.\nAlso Read: German Economy Is In \u2018Free Fall\u2019 From Self-Inflicted Policies\nTwo Lenses On A Weakening Economy\nAlthough the ETFs track different indices, they together provide a comprehensive view of the sentiment towards German equities.\nThe EWG tracks the MSCI Germany Index and provides broad exposure to industrials, financials, autos, health care and consumer-oriented names. Those areas tend to feel the effects of domestic economic weakness more directly, making the fund particularly sensitive to rising bankruptcies and sluggish business activity.\nBy contrast, DAX, which tracks Germany\u2019s flagship blue-chip index DAX (Deutscher Aktienindex), is more concentrated in multinational heavyweights. These firms benefit from global revenue streams, but are not immune from homegrown pressures, including high labor costs, energy burdens and softening domestic demand.\nWith corporate and consumer finances both weakening, the macro backdrop for the two leading Germany-focused ETFs is unfavorable.\nConsumer Strain Adds A Second Shock\nFinancial stress in Germany is not confined to companies.\nPrivate bankruptcies are set to increase by 6.5% in 2025, reaching their highest level since 2016, buoyed by over-indebted households, as well as a wave of job cuts and increasing unemployment.\nFor those ETFs that have exposure to banks, consumer discretionary names and domestic industrials, the pressure on households may further weigh down earnings expectations.\nOutlook: A Tough Road Into 2026\nCreditreform warns of Germany losing its competitiveness, weighed down by high costs, bureaucracy and persistent economic weakness. With no quick turnaround on the horizon, the investors in both EWG and DAX are facing a market increasingly shaped by insolvency risks, both corporate and consumer.\nRead Next:\nPhoot: ImageFlow via Shutterstock"

Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) hovered above the baseline after the indexes notched modest losses on Monday to break string of recent gains.\n(YM=F)\nNvidia (NVDA) shares rose over 2% in extended trading after Trump said on Truth Social that the company can sell H200 chips to \u201capproved customers\u201d in China and other regions, provided that 25% of the sales value is paid to the US government. Trump added that Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cresponded positively\u201d to the arrangement in a move that adds some security to Nvidia's China business after months of trade-policy uncertainty.\nMeanwhile, this week\u2019s spotlight turns to the Federal Reserve\u2019s final policy decision of the year, set for Wednesday. Traders overwhelmingly expect a quarter-point rate cut, similar to the September and October moves. Fed funds futures now imply an 89% probability of another reduction, up from about 67% a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. But prospects for 2026 are less certain, with some observers expecting a \"hawkish cut.\"\nInvestors will also turn their attention to corporate earnings from Oracle (ORCL), Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST) and Lululemon (LULU), with megacap AI and retail trends in focus.\nLIVE 2 updates"

                "body": "- In today\u2019s CEO Daily: Diane Brady breaks down Netflix\u2019s blockbuster deal for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n- The big story: China\u2019s trade surplus surpasses $1 trillion.\n- The markets: Mixed, with U.S. futures edging up.\n- Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune.\nGood morning. There\u2019s a lot of debate over last week\u2019s surprise announcement that Netflix struck an $83 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. President Donald Trump said Sunday that their combined market share \u201ccould be a problem,\u201d and the deal will face international scrutiny, too. Some takeaways so far:\nWarner Bros. held out for a bigger shared win. An insider told me that Warner Bros. chief David Zaslav was not eager to partner with Paramount Skydance because of financing, the price, and the fact that rookie CEO David Ellison would not only retain controlling shares but was still digesting his last win.\nActivate Consulting CEO Michael J. Wolf, a veteran media consultant and former president of MTV Networks, argues that this deal is a must-do for Netflix, given the rising strength of competitors like YouTube, Amazon Prime and Tubi. \u201cNo doubt Netflix is the default streaming service,\u201d Wolf told me over the weekend. \u201cGoing forward, what will be required to win is more iconic IP and more global franchises that work everywhere. Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the only companies out there that will give Netflix both of these at once.\u201d\nExperience matters. Content and the ability to distribute it have fueled many an entertainment merger. But history is filled with examples of those who\u2019ve generated huge value for stakeholders from such deals and many that did not. The AOL Time Warner merger proved to be an expensive cautionary tale about clashing cultures, mistimed market shifts and the perils of buying at peak bubble. (Time Warner\u2019s Turner acquisition, on the other hand, was a home run.) I remember GE CEO Jeff Immelt telling me \u201cwe know this world\u201d when merging VivendiUniversal and NBC. Turns out GE didn\u2019t create as much value as NBC Universal\u2019s subsequent buyer Comcast did. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is right to say that \u201cour mission has always been to entertain.\u201d But even if he overcomes antitrust scrutiny, he must then win over Hollywood, investors and consumers who already balk at the idea of this new behemoth.\nAI is changing the game. We\u2019ve already seen how much AI is changing the entertainment game, with AI-generated actor Tilly Norwood, AI influencers, Coca-Cola commercials, and movies. Since Netflix is a longtime builder\u2014versus a buyer\u2014some wonder if the streamer is interested in Warner Bros.\u2019 deep library for reasons other than simply giving consumers more stuff to consume. As Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, told Fortune, the future of entertainment may come down to who owns what she calls \u201cthe video corpus\u201d to train and power the next generation of AI models.\nContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com\nTop news\nChina\u2019s $1 trillion trade surplus\nPresident Trump\u2019s tariffs weren\u2019t enough to rein in China\u2019s exports. The country\u2019s trade surplus blew past $1 trillion for the first time this year, with one month to spare. China\u2019s exports to the U.S. have plummeted, falling 29% in November year-on-year, but shipments to other countries, especially in southeast Asia, have soared, making up the difference.\nIBM\u2019s big AI deal\nIBM is reportedly in talks to buy Confluent, a company that manages real-time flow of data in big AI models, in a deal worth $11 billion. The acquisition would be IBM\u2019s largest in recent years; the tech giant announced it was slashing thousands of jobs in November in a shift towards AI.\nApple\u2019s C-Suite shakeup\nFour Apple executives who report to CEO Tim Cook have stepped down in the past week, marking a major shakeup at the tech giant known for C-Suite stability that\u2019s hampering its effort to catch up in the AI race.\nDeutsche Bank pay bump\nDeutsche Bank wants to boost the pay of its super"

USD/CHF has climbed to an 8-day high and now trades roughly 30 pips below my 0.81 upside target. Momentum has also turned higher on USD/JPY, consistent with last week\u2019s bullish view.\nGBP/JPY broke to a 16-month high and now sits just 40 pips beneath its July 2024 peak.\nNZD/JPY reached a 13-month high, while AUD/JPY hit a 17-month high ahead of today\u2019s RBA meeting, where a hawkish hold is expected.\nThe US dollar index is holding above last week\u2019s lows and printed a bullish candle on Monday, though meaningful follow-through is still lacking.

Two bullish hammers formed on Thursday and Friday around the October high, accompanied by a bullish divergence on the RSI(2). The RSI(14) also held above 50 throughout the pullback and is now turning higher.\nImportantly, USD/JPY continued to close above the 155 handle \u2014 a level many traders consider sensitive for potential MOF scrutiny. Historically, though, intervention risk rises more on disorderly volatility than on any specific price level.\nThe 1-hour chart on the right shows a developing bullish trend, marked by higher highs and higher lows while price continues to respect the 10-bar EMA as dynamic support. USD/JPY looks set to test the weekly R1 pivot at 156.20 and the high-volume node near 156.35. Whether it can break and sustain above these levels will likely depend on how hawkish the market perceives the upcoming FOMC meeting. A clean break above 156.50 would open the door for a run towards the 157 handle.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView USD/JPY\nEUR/JPY Technical Analysis: Euro vs Japanese Yen\nThe euro remains in a strong uptrend against the yen, with momentum turning higher after a bullish continuation pattern on the EUR/JPY daily chart. The symmetrical triangle now projects an upside target just above the 183 handle, aligning with the monthly R1 pivot at 183.46. The daily RSI(14) also remains comfortably above 50 and is curling higher without entering overbought territory.\nEUR/JPY is also trending higher on the 1-hour chart, with price now pressing against the weekly R1 pivot and the recent swing high at 181.52. A clean break above this zone would shift focus towards the November high at 182.00 and the weekly R2 pivot at 182.15, with the symmetrical triangle target further above.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView EUR/JPY\nNikkei 225 Futures (NK) Technical Analysis\nWhile the 10-day correlation between USD/JPY and the Nikkei is virtually flat at 0.1 \u2014 and still low at 0.4 over 20 days \u2014 correlations are inherently lagging. The 60-day reading, however, is very strong at 0.9. With USD/JPY pushing higher and the Nikkei holding elevated levels, the risk is that shorter-term correlations begin to tighten again.\nThe daily chart shows that, despite short-term noise, USD/JPY and the Nikkei tend to move broadly in tandem over time.\nRising volumes supported the two-day bullish breakout on the Nikkei last week, while volume has since tapered off as prices consolidate above the 20-day EMA and the 50k handle within what appears to be a developing pennant/flag pattern. Bulls may seek pullbacks into last week\u2019s range or towards the 20-day EMA, positioning for a potential continuation towar"
