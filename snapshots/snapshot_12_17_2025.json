The Fed\u2019s latest rate cut, coupled with more dovish comments, is fueling speculation around policy for the rest of the year.

                "body": "Gold jumps to near seven-week highs amid US labor market slowdown\n- Gold price climbs to near seven-week highs in Wednesday\u2019s Asian session.\n- A continued cooling in the US labor market weighs on the US Dollar and lifts Gold price.\n- Traders will take more cues from the Fedspeak on Wednesday ahead of the key US inflation reports.\nGold price (XAU/USD) extends its upside to near seven-week highs above $4,300 during the Asian trading hours on Wednesday. The precious metal gains momentum as the US labor market remains relatively resilient but shows signs of slowing. The mixed US employment report for November reinforces bets of further rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and weighs on the US Dollar (USD). Lower interest rates could reduce the opportunity cost of holding Gold, supporting the non-yielding precious metal.\nThe US central bank delivered its third 25-basis-point rate cut at the December policy meeting last week. However, Fed policymakers are divided on whether additional rate cuts are needed in 2026. The median Fed official penciled in just one reduction next year, but some policymakers see no further cuts. Traders await the Fedspeak later on Wednesday. New York Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic are set to speak. Any hawkish comments from policymakers could lift the Greenback and undermine the USD-denominated commodity price in the near term.\nLooking ahead, the US November Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will be in the spotlight on Thursday. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will be published on Friday. These reports could shape expectations for Fed rate cuts.\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Gold rises amid slowing trend in the US labor market\n- The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose by 64,000 in November after falling by 105,000 in October, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Tuesday. This reading came in stronger than the market expectation for an increase of 50,000.\n- The Unemployment Rate in the US ticked higher to 4.6% in November from 4.4% in October. The Average Hourly Earnings increased 0.1% MoM in November after jumping 0.4% in the previous month.\n- US Retail Sales were unexpectedly flat in October, following a downwardly revised 0.1% gain in September, the US Census Bureau showed on Tuesday. This figure came in below the consensus of 0.1%.\n- US President Donald Trump is set to interview Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Wednesday for the next Fed Chair, according to people familiar with that matter, per the Wall Street Journal.\n- Markets anticipate two rate cuts next year. Fed funds futures are pricing an implied 75.6% chance of a hold in rates at the US central bank's next meeting in January, up from nearly 70% a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n- Reuters reported on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump ordered a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. His action came after US forces seized an oil tanker in waters near Venezuela last week.\nGold\u2019s long-term technical outlook remains bullish\nGold trades in positive territory on the day. According to the four-hour chart, the positive view of the precious metal remains intact, with the price being well-supported above the key 100-day Exponential Moving Average. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands widen and the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is located above the midline, displaying the bullish momentum in the near term.\nSustained trading above the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band of $4,305, XAU/USD could be gearing up for another run at the December 15 high of $4,350. Any follow-through buying above this level could even open the door to retest an all-time high of $4,381.\nOn the flip side, a string of red candles could set the tone for a bearish run, with the first support level to watch at the December 16 low of $4,271. The next contention level is seen at the 100-day EMA of $4,220.\nRisk sentiment FAQs\nIn the world of financia"

                "body": "The Commodities Feed: Trump\u2019s Venezuelan oil tanker blockade\nThe oil surplus environment saw Brent trade down to its lowest level since February 2021 yesterday. However, prices are finding better support in early morning trading today, with Venezuelan supply risks growing\nEnergy - Venezuelan oil supply risks\nThe oil market sell-off accelerated yesterday. ICE Brent is settling 2.7% lower, breaking below US$60/bbl to its lowest level since February 2021. This pressure comes from a growing surplus outlook. Hopes for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire will undoubtedly add to the downward pressure. As our oil balance shows, the peak of the surplus is expected in the first quarter of 2026. However, with every quarter of next year in surplus, inventories should grow throughout 2026, putting further pressure on oil prices.\nThere are clear supply risks to our view. Russian risks are well telegraphed, but there are clear risks to the Venezuelan oil supply. Oil prices have bounced higher in early-morning trading today (WTI up around 1.3% at the time of writing), after President Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. This follows the US seizing an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week. Venezuela exported around 600k b/d of oil in November. It\u2019s likely that these volumes will fall given the latest developments. The bulk of this oil is shipped to China.\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API) inventory numbers released overnight were also supportive of the market. US crude oil inventories are reported to have fallen by 9.3m barrels over the last week. Meanwhile, refined product inventory changes were more bearish, with gasoline and distillate fuel oil stocks increasing by 4.8m barrels and 2.5m barrels, respectively.\nEuropean natural gas prices continued to come under pressure yesterday, with the Tittle Transfer Facility (TTF) settling 2.4% lower. Milder weather weighed on the market. However, forecasts show that weather is set to turn colder than usual later in the month, which should provide some support to prices. Particularly when you consider that EU gas storage is below average, at 69% full at the moment vs. a 5-year average of 78%. The record-large gross short that investment funds hold in TTF continues to pose a risk.\nMetals \u2013 South32\u2019s Mozal aluminium smelter to shut\nSouth32 will shut its Mozal aluminium smelter in Mozambique after failing to secure a long-term electricity supply, adding to an already tight market. This should keep global inventories low, while prices are expected to see further upside next year. Mozal will be placed on care and maintenance in March, when the current contract ends. South32 said it has not procured the raw materials required to sustain operations beyond that period. The Mozal smelter, in which South32 holds a 64% stake, is Mozambique\u2019s largest industrial employer. It accounted for around 29% of South32\u2019s total aluminium production in 2025. Aluminium is Mozambique\u2019s third-biggest export.\nProducing aluminium is highly energy-intensive, and smelters globally have been struggling to secure long-power contracts at viable prices.\nThis means our global aluminium deficit will now increase to around 600kt. This also assumes Century\u2019s 12-month Iceland outage and China\u2019s capacity cap will remain at 45 million tonnes. Still, a faster-than-expected ramp-up in new Indonesian capacity could narrow that deficit and put downward pressure on prices.\nMozal has been a significant source of aluminium exports to Europe. The smelter\u2019s closure will directly impact the EU\u2019s aluminium industry. Europe is unlikely to restart enough idled smelting capacity to fill the Mozal gap, with power price volatility capping any meaningful domestic recovery. This means higher premiums and tighter supply, particularly for low-carbon aluminium. Mozal\u2019s aluminium, produced using hydropower, is considered low-carbon. It has helped European buyers meet decarbonization targets and limit CBAM exposure.\nAg"

High inventories and lackluster exports are the main culprits, highlighted by double-digit declines in Europe\u2019s palm oil imports this season. While global crude oil prices have climbed\u2014thanks in part to the US tightening its blockade on Venezuelan oil, supporting palm oil used in biodiesel\u2014regional weakness is clear, with Chinese palm and soyoil contracts also trending lower. Ultimately, despite some supportive factors, soft exports and economic uncertainty continue to keep Malaysian palm oil prices in a narrow range.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Navigating choppy waters in the edible oils trade.\nThe palm oil market\u2019s back-and-forth highlights broader uncertainty across global edible oil sectors. With European Union imports of palm oil down 12% and soybean shipments falling 13% compared to last year, traders are watching for signs of shifting demand. Plus, price swings in related assets\u2014from Dalian soyoil to Chicago contracts\u2014show just how interconnected these commodities are. If Malaysia\u2019s exports stay soft as 2026 approaches, producers and investors could face even bumpier price action.\nThe bigger picture: Policies and geopolitics steer future demand.\nMacro forces like biofuel mandates and shifting international relations are now driving the outlook for palm oil. New US biofuel standards and ongoing limits on Venezuelan oil exports are reshaping the market for palm-based biodiesel, while a weaker ringgit does make Malaysian product more appealing to foreign buyers. Still, with economic headwinds and growing regulatory uncertainty, the industry\u2019s future may hinge more on how countries adapt their trade policies and climate goals than on currency moves alone.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "The Commodities Feed: Trump\u2019s Venezuelan oil tanker blockade\nThe oil surplus environment saw Brent trade down to its lowest level since February 2021 yesterday. However, prices are finding better support in early morning trading today, with Venezuelan supply risks growing\nEnergy - Venezuelan oil supply risks\nThe oil market sell-off accelerated yesterday. ICE Brent is settling 2.7% lower, breaking below US$60/bbl to its lowest level since February 2021. This pressure comes from a growing surplus outlook. Hopes for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire will undoubtedly add to the downward pressure. As our oil balance shows, the peak of the surplus is expected in the first quarter of 2026. However, with every quarter of next year in surplus, inventories should grow throughout 2026, putting further pressure on oil prices.\nThere are clear supply risks to our view. Russian risks are well telegraphed, but there are clear risks to the Venezuelan oil supply. Oil prices have bounced higher in early-morning trading today (WTI up around 1.3% at the time of writing), after President Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. This follows the US seizing an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week. Venezuela exported around 600k b/d of oil in November. It\u2019s likely that these volumes will fall given the latest developments. The bulk of this oil is shipped to China.\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API) inventory numbers released overnight were also supportive of the market. US crude oil inventories are reported to have fallen by 9.3m barrels over the last week. Meanwhile, refined product inventory changes were more bearish, with gasoline and distillate fuel oil stocks increasing by 4.8m barrels and 2.5m barrels, respectively.\nEuropean natural gas prices continued to come under pressure yesterday, with the Tittle Transfer Facility (TTF) settling 2.4% lower. Milder weather weighed on the market. However, forecasts show that weather is set to turn colder than usual later in the month, which should provide some support to prices. Particularly when you consider that EU gas storage is below average, at 69% full at the moment vs. a 5-year average of 78%. The record-large gross short that investment funds hold in TTF continues to pose a risk.\nMetals \u2013 South32\u2019s Mozal aluminium smelter to shut\nSouth32 will shut its Mozal aluminium smelter in Mozambique after failing to secure a long-term electricity supply, adding to an already tight market. This should keep global inventories low, while prices are expected to see further upside next year. Mozal will be placed on care and maintenance in March, when the current contract ends. South32 said it has not procured the raw materials required to sustain operations beyond that period. The Mozal smelter, in which South32 holds a 64% stake, is Mozambique\u2019s largest industrial employer. It accounted for around 29% of South32\u2019s total aluminium production in 2025. Aluminium is Mozambique\u2019s third-biggest export.\nProducing aluminium is highly energy-intensive, and smelters globally have been struggling to secure long-power contracts at viable prices.\nThis means our global aluminium deficit will now increase to around 600kt. This also assumes Century\u2019s 12-month Iceland outage and China\u2019s capacity cap will remain at 45 million tonnes. Still, a faster-than-expected ramp-up in new Indonesian capacity could narrow that deficit and put downward pressure on prices.\nMozal has been a significant source of aluminium exports to Europe. The smelter\u2019s closure will directly impact the EU\u2019s aluminium industry. Europe is unlikely to restart enough idled smelting capacity to fill the Mozal gap, with power price volatility capping any meaningful domestic recovery. This means higher premiums and tighter supply, particularly for low-carbon aluminium. Mozal\u2019s aluminium, produced using hydropower, is considered low-carbon. It has helped European buyers meet decarbonization targets and limit CBAM exposure.\nAg"

                "body": "The US dollar was already down on the day when the US jobs report was released. It then fell further as traders reacted to the rise in the unemployment rate to its highest level since 2021, even if the headline jobs growth beat expectations slightly. Still, the jobs report was not as bad as some had feared, and this limited the impact of the data. Next up is the release of CPI on Thursday, which is when we will also hear from the European Central Bank, keeping the EUR/USD forecast in sharp focus.\nUS dollar reacts to mixed jobs report\n- NFP for November was mixed: The US added 64,000 new jobs in November, beating estimates of around 50,000. But that\u2019s where the good news ends. Unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, reaching its highest level since September 2021. It was from 4.4%, more than 4.5% expected. Average hourly earnings were just +0.1% m/m vs. +0.3% eyed, which along with a pickup in the unemployment rate points to disinflation.\n- Meanwhile, the October payrolls report showed a massive 105,000 drop compared to a 25,0000 drop expected, although this was entirely due to the federal government job losses of 162,000 in October \u2013 due to the government shutdown.\n- Retail sales: 0.0% vs. +0.1% eyed, but core sales +0.4% vs. +0.2% expected.\nToday\u2019s US data releases were overall weaker than expected, although not as bad as some had feared either. The market was pricing in just shy of 50% chance of a March cut before the jobs report, but in the immediate aftermath of the report that was up to around 60%. At the time of writing, US rate futures still saw two cuts in 2026 after the jobs and retail sales data, pricing around 58 bps of easing next year.\nEUR/USD forecast: ECB next key risk event\nAhead of Thursday\u2019s ECB meeting, attention today turned to the eurozone PMIs, following some encouraging industrial production data released yesterday. There had been hope that the figures would show a further improvement in European industrial sentiment, with lower energy prices continuing to support the eurozone\u2019s terms of trade, now close to the best levels seen in almost four years. In that sense, the backdrop remains fundamentally euro positive.\nHowever, the data disappointed slightly. The composite PMI slipped from 52.8 to 51.9 in December, with manufacturing output once again contracting. Even so, this level is still consistent with respectable eurozone GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nAfter peaking in the summer, Manufacturing PMI resumed its decline after August and fell back to 49.2 this month. Services followed a different trajectory, bottoming out in May and remaining comfortably above the 50 threshold, at 52.6 in December.\nAs the year draws to a close, the growth picture looks familiar. Germany and France continue to lag slightly, while the rest of the eurozone\u2014where PMI details are less granular\u2014appears more resilient.\nDespite ongoing global uncertainty, the eurozone economy has managed to stay afloat throughout the year. While a sharp acceleration in growth seems unlikely, a gradual improvement over the course of 2026 remains our base case, which is why we maintain a bullish EUR/USD forecast next year.\nTechnical EUR/USD forecast and levels to watch\nThe bullish trend on the EUR/USD chart looks to have remained intact following the release of the jobs report earlier today. We expect support levels to hold heading into the ECB meeting, with the first line of defence now seen around 1.1725/30 area. Below that lies the most important short-term support zone between 1.1650 to 1.1680ish. Nothing significant below that until 1.1500 now. On the upside, 1.1800 remains a key objective for the bulls. Above it, the September high of 1.1919 then the 1.20 handle.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R"

Nonetheless, the potential downside for the major pair might be limited amid the growing acceptance that the European Central Bank (ECB) is done cutting interest rates. The ECB is expected to hold interest rates steady at its December meeting on Thursday. The central bank has kept its key deposit rate on hold at 2% since July.\nAcross the pond, the mixed US employment report for November showed that the US labor market remains relatively resilient but shows signs of slowing. This, in turn, could drag the Greenback lower and create a tailwind for the major pair. The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose by 64,000 in November after falling by 105,000 in October. This figure came in better than the estimates of 50,000. Meanwhile, the Unemployment Rate in the US ticked higher to 4.6% in November from 4.4% in October.\nTechnical Analysis:\nIn the daily chart, EUR/USD trades at 1.1732. The 100-EMA nudges higher at 1.1611, with price holding above it and sustaining an upward bias. The 20-period average inside the Bollinger bands advances near 1.1639, supporting shallow pullbacks. Price leans toward the upper band, and the bands are widening, indicating firm bullish pressure alongside rising volatility.\nRSI at 65.58 shows solid bullish momentum while not yet overbought. Immediate resistance stands at the upper Bollinger Band at 1.1788, whereas support is set at the middle band at 1.1639 and the 100-EMA at 1.1611. A break higher could open the door to an extension of the advance, while failure to clear resistance would keep the pair capped and invite a retracement toward support.\n(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool)\nECB FAQs\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for the region. The ECB primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nIn extreme situations, the European Central Bank can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the ECB prints Euros and uses them to buy assets \u2013 usually government or corporate bonds \u2013 from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Euro. QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The ECB used it during the Great Financial Crisis in 2009-11, in 2015 when inflation remained stubbornly low, as well as during the covid pandemic.\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the European Central Bank (ECB) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the ECB stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Euro.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallali"

                "body": "EUR/USD remains steady near 1.1750 as US job data suggests the Federal Reserve might continue easing monetary policy next year. The pair recorded a small dip of 0.04%, while the US Dollar Index held steady at 98.21.\nThe US Nonfarm Payrolls for October and November show an already weak labour market, with the unemployment rate rising. This data did not increase the likelihood of a rate cut at the Federal Reserve\u2019s January 28 meeting, though the market priced in 59.8 basis points of easing by December 2026.\nEuropean Central Bank Policy\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) is expected to hold rates steady through 2026 due to subdued inflation but an anticipated resilient economy. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic expressed a preference to keep rates unchanged at the December Fed meeting.\nThe Euro exhibited strength against the Australian Dollar, showing percentage changes across various currencies. The Eurozone\u2019s economic indicators, such as inflation and GDP, influence the Euro\u2019s value, with a positive trade balance typically strengthening a currency.\nNegotiations for peace in Ukraine could affect the Euro, as seen when the US offered security guarantees to Kyiv. Technical analysis suggests a neutral to upward bias for EUR/USD, with potential resistance and support levels identified.\nThe current market shows the EUR/USD is holding steady around 1.1750, as signs of a weakening U.S. labor market suggest the Federal Reserve may continue easing its policy. The U.S. unemployment rate recently climbed to 4.6%, a noticeable increase from the 3.7% level we saw back in late 2023, reinforcing this view. This situation creates a clear policy difference, as the European Central Bank is expected to keep its rates on hold at its meeting tomorrow.\nWe see the Fed\u2019s dilemma reflected in the latest inflation figures, with the November U.S. Consumer Price Index coming in at 2.8%, which is lower than past peaks but still above the 2% target. Despite this, the softening jobs data seems to be the primary factor guiding the Fed\u2019s cautious stance toward potential rate cuts in 2026. This has kept the U.S. Dollar Index subdued, providing a floor for the EUR/USD pair.\nEurozone Economic Outlook\nOn the other hand, the Eurozone\u2019s economy is showing resilience, with third-quarter GDP growing by a modest 0.2% and inflation holding at 2.6% in November. This steady performance supports the market expectation that the ECB will not rush to cut rates, creating a fundamental strength for the Euro against the dollar. This divergence between a dovish-leaning Fed and a neutral ECB is the central theme we should be trading.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests that buying call options on the EUR/USD with strike prices above 1.1800 could be a good strategy to capture potential upside. The defined risk of an option is appealing given the mixed signals from some Fed officials. Selling cash-secured puts with a strike price below the 1.1700 support level is another way to collect premium while expressing a cautiously bullish view.\nHowever, we must watch for risks, especially from tomorrow\u2019s ECB meeting and any surprise hawkish statements from the Fed. The ongoing discussions about a new Fed chair also add a layer of political uncertainty that could cause sudden moves. Traders could hedge long positions by purchasing out-of-the-money puts below the 100-day moving average, currently near 1.1645.\nWith key central bank announcements pending, we should anticipate a rise in short-term implied volatility for the EUR/USD pair. This makes strategies that benefit from time decay, like selling strangles or iron condors, potentially more profitable if we believe the pair will remain within the 1.1700 to 1.1850 range. Comparing current implied volatility to its historical average will tell us if options are priced cheaply or expensively right now."

The UK unemployment rate rose to 5.1%, up from 5%, marking the highest level since January 2021. Wage growth excluding bonuses edged lower to 4.6% from 4.7% dropping to its lowest level since early 2022, while private sector pay fell below 4% for the first time since 2020. These figures were slightly stronger than expected and remain above the inflation rate.\nHowever, tax data showed that the number of employees on payrolls fell by a larger-than-expected 38,000. The data support the view that the UK jobs market is losing momentum.\nMeanwhile, UK PMI data indicate that activity was stronger than expected; the service sector PMI was 52.1 in December, up from 51.3 and above the forecast of 51.6. Manufacturing PMI was also stronger than expected at 51.2, up from 50.2 in November. The data suggest that UK firms experienced a post-budget boost following months of speculation. Business enjoyed the sharpest pick up in new work in over a year.\nThe data precedes the BoE rate decision, at which the central bank is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points.\nThe USD is trading around multi-week lows as investors await U.S. economic data later in the session, which could impact the Fed's policy path.\nExpectations are that the delayed November and partial October nonfarm payrolls report will show 50,000 jobs added, following 119,000 in September. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.4%.\nThe data come as policymakers remain concerned about the cooling of the US jobs market, which prompted a 25-basis-point rate cut at the December meeting. The market is pricing in a 75% probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged at its January 28 meeting.\nWeaker-than-expected data could fuel expectations of a Fed rate cut, putting the dollar and lifting stocks. However, weak data could raise concerns about the outlook for the US economy, driving both the dollar and stocks lower.\nGBP/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nGBP/USD recovered from the 1.30 low, breaking above the falling trendline and the 200 SMA to trade at 1.3420 at the time of writing.\nBuyers, supported by the RSI above 50, will look to extend gains to 1.3480, the mid-October high. Above here, 136 comes into focus.\nOn the downside, support is seen at 1.3450, the 200 SMA, and the horizontal support. A break below here brings 1.3260, the 50 SMA, and horizontal support into focus ahead of 1.32.\nOil slumps towards 2025 lows on Russia \u2013 Ukraine peace optimism\nOil prices have fallen by almost over 1.5% on Tuesday, dropping towards $55 a barrel, the lowest level since May this year, on optimism of a Russia-Ukraine peace deal.\nThe US has offered to provide NATO-style security guarantees for Kyiv, and European negotiators reported progress in peace talks on Monday to end the Russia-Ukraine war. These developments have sparked optimism that the end of the conflict could be sooner than initially expected.\nThe end of the war increases the likelihood that Russian sanctions will be eased or lifted, thereby increasing global oil supply. This comes at a time when the market is already nervous about a supply glut in 2026.\nMeanwhile, overnight data added to concerns about the demand outlook. Chinese factory output growth slowed to a 15-month low, whilst retail sales grew at the slowest pace since December 2022 during the COVID pandemic.\nReports that the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week offered some support to oil prices all day the movies had a limited impact.\nAttention will now turn to the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for further clues regarding the health of the U.S. economy.

Meanwhile, Monthly inflation is expected to be flat at 0% after rising 0.4% in October.\nThe UK core CPI, considered more relevant for the central bank, as it strips off the seasonal impact of food and energy prices, is expected to remain consistent at a 3.4% YoY rise in November.\nHow could the UK CPI affect GBP/USD?\nGBP/USD is likely to stay subdued if UK CPI meets expectations. However, any upside surprise could cap losses by tempering dovish sentiment ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) policy decision on Thursday. The BoE is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points to 3.75%, the lowest since 2022, as rising unemployment and economic stagnation ease inflation pressures. Traders will also observe UK Retail Sales and PPI Core Output data.\nThe GBP/USD pair struggles as the US Dollar (USD) advances after mixed US labor market data for November did little to reinforce expectations of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts. The CME FedWatch tool suggests that Fed funds futures are pricing an implied 74.4% chance of a hold in rates at the US central bank's next meeting in January, up from nearly 70% a week ago.\nTechnically, the GBP/USD pair is trading around 1.3390 at the time of writing. Daily chart analysis points to a sustained bullish bias, with the pair holding within an ascending channel and the 14-day RSI remaining above 50. The pair may explore the resistance region around the 13-week high of 1.3536. On the downside, the immediate support lies at the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.3662, followed by the psychological level of 1.3300, aligned with the 50-day EMA at 1.3295.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country ea"

                "body": "The GBP/USD rose by 0.42% due to weak US jobs data, indicating slack in the labour market. Despite this, US Retail Sales were unchanged, showing steady consumer activity. The GBP/USD was trading at 1.3432, having dipped to a daily low of 1.3355 earlier.\nUK data supported the Pound Sterling\u2019s rise, including preliminary S&P Global PMI data and labour market statistics for the three months to October. The GBP/USD remained in a range above the mid-1.3300s as traders awaited key macroeconomic updates and central bank events to guide further moves.\nEconomic Indicators And Market Reactivity\nUS Retail Sales figures remained stable at $732.6 billion. Gold prices have slightly decreased but maintained gains from the previous week, with future reports set to include updates on Russia-Ukraine peace talks and Venezuela tensions.\nBNB, known as Binance Coin, decreased to around $855, experiencing a decline from the previous day. This decline is linked to bearish on-chain signals and increasing retail trading activity, indicating stronger downward pressure.\nGiven the soft US jobs data, we see the US Dollar facing continued pressure. The recent November Non-Farm Payroll report, which added only 95,000 jobs against an expected 180,000, confirms a cooling labor market. This trend strengthens the case for Federal Reserve easing in the coming year, making short positions on the dollar attractive.\nThe Pound Sterling is showing notable strength, not just from dollar weakness but from its own solid fundamentals. With UK inflation holding firm around 4.0%, the Bank of England is in a much different position than the Fed, creating a clear policy divergence. This makes call options on GBP/USD look appealing as the pair pushes past the 1.3400 level.\nHowever, we must remain cautious about betting too heavily on immediate Fed rate cuts. US inflation, while down from its highs seen over the past few years, is still at 3.5% year-over-year, and Fed officials like Bostic continue to warn the fight is not over. The potential for a new Fed Chair adds a layer of political uncertainty that could quickly change market expectations and increase volatility.\nForex Market Dynamics And Risks\nWe have seen this setup before, following the aggressive rate-hiking cycle of 2022-2023, where markets quickly price in a policy pivot at the first sign of economic weakness. Today, with US retail sales flat, traders are again front-running a potential shift from the central bank. This indicates that any incoming data suggesting further economic slowdown will likely accelerate the dollar\u2019s decline.\nThis broad dollar weakness is also lifting the Euro, which is now testing the 1.1800 mark. Meanwhile, the sustained high price of gold, which is consolidating around $4,300, suggests a deep-seated concern about currency devaluation and geopolitical risk. Holding derivatives that profit from rising gold prices could serve as a valuable hedge in this uncertain environment.\nWhile the forex markets appear to be in a risk-on mood against the dollar, other sectors are flashing warning signs. The decline in BNB below $855 points to bearish sentiment in more speculative assets. This suggests that any long positions should be carefully managed, as underlying market fragility could still trigger a flight back to the dollar if global tensions escalate."

However, the downside of the AUD/USD pair could be restrained as the Aussie Dollar could find support as markets grow increasingly wary of a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rate hike as early as February.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank now expect the RBA to start tightening sooner than previously projected, pointing to stubborn inflation in a capacity-constrained economy. Their forecasts followed the central bank\u2019s hawkish hold on rates at its final 2025 meeting last week. Swaps price in a 28% chance of a February hike, nearly 41% in March, with August almost fully priced.\nThe AUD remains under pressure as Australia\u2019s preliminary S&P Global Manufacturing PMI edged up to 52.2 in December from 51.6 previously, according to data released by S&P Global on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Services PMI slipped to 51.0 from 52.8, and the Composite PMI fell to 51.1 from 52.6.\nUS Dollar struggles despite diminishing Fed rate cut bets\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is holding ground and trading around 98.20 at the time of writing. The USD could find support as mixed labor market data did little to reinforce expectations of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n- The US November jobs report showed payroll growth of 64K, slightly above forecasts, but October figures were revised sharply lower, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest since 2021, underscoring a gradually cooling labor market. Retail sales were flat on the month, reinforcing signs that consumer demand is losing momentum.\n- Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in a blog post on Tuesday that the jobs report was a mixed picture and that it did not change the outlook, and that he would prefer to leave rates unchanged at the last Fed meeting. Bostic said that \u201cmultiple surveys\u201d are suggesting that there are higher input costs and that firms are determined to preserve their margins by increasing prices. He added that \u201cPrice pressures are not just coming from tariffs, the Fed should not be hasty to declare victory,\u201d and that he sees GDP for 2026 at around 2.5%.\n- Fed officials are split over whether more easing of monetary policy is needed next year. The median Fed official penciled in just one reduction in 2026, but some policymakers see no further cuts. Meanwhile, traders anticipate two rate cuts next year.\n- The CME FedWatch tool suggests that Fed funds futures are pricing an implied 74.4% chance of a hold in rates at the US central bank's next meeting in January, up from nearly 70% a week ago.\n- The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Monday that China\u2019s Retail Sales rose 1.3% year-over-year (YoY) in November vs. 2.9% expected and 2.9% in October. Chinese Industrial Production increased 4.8% YoY in the same period, compared to the 5.0% forecast and 4.9% seen previously.\n- China\u2019s Fixed Asset Investment came in at -2.6% year-to-date (YTD) YoY in November, missing the expected -2.3% figure. The October reading was -1.7%.\n- The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported last week that the Unemployment Rate steadied at 4.3% in November. The figure came in below the market consensus of 4.4%. Furthermore, the Australian Employment Change arrived at -21.3K in November from 41.1K in October (revised from 42.2K), compared with the consensus forecast of 20K.\nAustralian Dollar hovers around nine-day EMA near lower ascending cha"

                "body": "AUD/USD Price Annual Forecast: Is 2026 the year the Aussie breaks above 0.70?\n- AUD/USD rebounded sharply in 2025 as the US Dollar suffered one of its steepest annual declines in decades.\n- In 2026, diverging central-bank cycles could deepen as the Fed moves toward further easing while the RBA adopts a hawkish pause.\n- The upcoming overhaul of Fed leadership, with Powell's departure, introduces a major institutional wildcard for the USD.\n- Australia\u2019s stable growth, sticky inflation and resilient labor market support an elevated yield advantage that could lift the Aussie further.\nThe year 2025 profoundly reshaped the dynamics of AUD/USD. The Australian Dollar (AUD) initially dropped under the shock of US tariff hikes, before rebounding sharply as the US Dollar (USD) weakened, undermined by a softening labor market, a Federal Reserve (Fed) forced to resume rate cuts and an unprecedented US government shutdown. In contrast, the Australian economy offered a far more stable narrative: growth close to potential, a resilient labor market and a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) that shifted from a cautious easing phase to a distinctly more hawkish stance by year-end.\nThis contrast between a solid Australia and the United States (US), mired in uncertainty, was the main driver behind the AUD/USD recovery. But 2026 looks even more decisive. The Fed is about to change face with Jerome Powell\u2019s departure in May, US inflation remains uncomfortably high and political pressure on monetary policy is intensifying. The RBA, by contrast, seems set for a prolonged pause, with a tightening bias if inflation were to surprise again on the upside.\nIn a context where rate differentials, institutional credibility, and geopolitical dynamics are once again central, 2026 could mark a new phase in the balance of power between the Aussie and the US Dollar.\nAustralian Dollar in 2025: A pivotal year of tariff shock, US Dollar slide and domestic resilience\n2025 was anything but linear for the Australian Dollar. The AUD/USD pair started the year around 0.6140, plunged in the spring on the back of tariff announcements from the Trump administration, and then gradually recovered as the US Dollar weakened. At the time of writing, the Aussie is trading near 0.6650, up about 7% YTD, after swinging between a low at 0.5914 on April 9 and a high at 0.6707 on September 17.\nIn the background, the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped from 110.18 at the start of the year to a low of 96.22 on September 17, before stabilizing below the symbolic 100 level. This decline of more than 10% over the year, one of the largest since the shift to floating exchange rates, has profoundly reshaped the FX landscape and was a key driver behind the AUD\u2019s rebound.\nFrom tariff shock to the April low\nThe first major move of the year in AUD/USD came from Washington. The project of US President Donald Trump to reduce the US trade deficit \u201cat all costs\u201d through the steepest tariff hikes in nearly a century triggered a confidence shock. The February announcements caught markets off guard, sparking a sharp spike in risk aversion.\nIn that phase, the Australian Dollar was traded as a pure cyclical currency. Investors anticipated a slowdown in global trade, pressure on Asian demand \u2013 particularly from China \u2013 and cut exposure to commodity-linked currencies. AUD/USD subsequently dropped to 0.5914 on April 9, its lowest level of the year.\nHowever, this initial risk-off move did not morph into a sustained US Dollar bull cycle. Very quickly, concerns shifted. It was no longer just global growth that was in question, but the US trajectory itself.\nA US Dollar in crisis of confidence\nThe rest of the year was dominated by what several analysts describe as a \u201cbreak year\u201d for the US Dollar.\nOn the monetary side, the Federal Reserve, after three rate cuts in 2024, had paused at the start of 2025. But the gradual deterioration in labor market indicators forced it to restart its easing cycle from September, with three addit"

                "body": "USD/JPY faces downside risk as Japanese exports strengthen BoJ rate-hike expectations.\nJapanese exports jumped in November, reinforcing bets on a Bank of Japan rate hike. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda hinted at an imminent rate hike last week, citing diminishing US tariff risks and strong wage growth.\nEconomists expect the BoJ to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on Friday, December 19. USD/JPY briefly dropped from 154.777 to 154.710 after the data release before recovering, reflecting market caution ahead of Friday\u2019s decision.\nThe pickup in external demand and the looming BoJ rate hike support a bearish USD/JPY price outlook.\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss the macro backdrop, the near-term price catalysts, and technical levels traders should closely watch.\nJapanese exports increased 6.1% year-on-year (YoY) in November, up from 3.6% in October, while imports rose 1.3% (Oct: 0.7%). A rebound in demand from the US boosted exports midway through Q4. According to the Ministry of Finance, exports to the US increased 8.8% YoY in November after falling 3.1% YoY in October,\nThe upswing in external demand and stronger imports will boost Japan\u2019s economy, given its 45% trade-to-GDP ratio. For context, the Japanese economy contracted by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, with external demand declining 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, a drag on the economy.\nLower US tariffs on Japanese goods contributed to the pickup in US demand. The US administration dropped tariffs from 25% to 15% in the third quarter.\nStronger external demand and a pickup in economic momentum will likely strengthen the yen. Rising yen demand supports a bearish USD/JPY trajectory in the lead-up to the BoJ\u2019s monetary policy decision, with 153 in view.\nWhile market bets on a December BoJ rate hike have strengthened the yen, US retail sales data will give insights into the US economy, triggering USD/JPY volatility.\nLater on Wednesday, US retail sales will fuel speculation about a March Fed rate cut, influencing the US dollar\u2019s trajectory. Economists forecast retail sales to rise 0.3% month-on-month in November after stalling in October.\nStronger retail sales would boost the US economy, given that private consumption accounts for roughly 65% of the GDP. Additionally, consumer spending typically fuels demand-driven inflation, suggesting a more hawkish Fed rate path. Fading bets on a March Fed rate cut will likely lift US dollar demand, cushioning the near-term downside for USD/JPY.\nBeyond the data, traders should monitor FOMC members\u2019 speeches for reactions to November\u2019s jobs report and the timeline for a rate cut. Fed Board of Governors Christopher Waller, New York Fed President John Williams, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic are due to speak mid-week. Support for further monetary policy easing would overshadow upbeat retail sales data, sending USD/JPY lower on weaker US dollar demand.\nFor context, US unemployment rose from 4.4% in October to 4.6% in November, while wage growth slowed from 3.7% YoY to 3.5% YoY in November. Rising unemployment and softer wage growth may curb consumer spending and dampen demand-driven inflation.\nA cooler inflation outlook would support a more dovish Fed rate path and weaken US dollar demand.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a March Fed rate cut increased from 51% on December 15 to 53.3% on December 16 as markets reacted to the US jobs data. A BoJ rate hike and a March Fed rate cut would narrow the US-Japan rate differential, favoring the yen.\nThe BoJ and the Fed\u2019s policy outlooks support a bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nWith markets focused on monetary policy, technical indicators, and fundamentals, they will offer critical insights into potential USD/JPY price trends.\nLooking at the daily chart, USD/JPY remained above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), signaling a bullish bias. While technicals remained bullish, fundamentals are increasingly outweighing the technical structure, suggesting a "

The Japanese Yen (JPY) strengthens against the US Dollar (USD) amid growing speculation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will hike rates to 0.75% on Friday.\nThe US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP)rose by 64,000 in November after declining 105,000 in October, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Tuesday. This reading came in stronger than the market expectation for an increase of 50,000. The report also showed that NFP declined by 105,000 in October. Meanwhile, the Unemployment Rate in the US climbed to 4.6% in November from 4.4% in October.\nThe Greenback faced some selling pressure in the immediate reaction to the mixed US employment report. Fed policymakers are divided on whether additional rate cuts are needed in 2026. The median Fed official forecasts just one reduction next year, although traders expect two.\nThe BoJ is anticipated to raise interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5% at a two-day policy meeting ending on Friday, a three-decade high, and pledge to keep hiking borrowing costs. Traders ramped up their bets for an imminent BoJ rate hike following Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments last week, saying that the likelihood of the central bank's baseline economic and price outlook materializing had been gradually increasing. Firming BoJ rate hike expectations could boost the JPY and act as a headwind for the pair in the near term.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) officials are scheduled to speak later on Wednesday, including New York Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. Any hawkish comments from Fed policymakers might help limit the Greenback\u2019s losses.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

Later this week, the Bank of Japan will decide on interest rates. Markets see a strong chance, close to 90%, of a 25 basis point rate hike.\nThe economic calendar also remains busy. Key updates include delayed data from the US labor market and inflation trends. Investors currently expect rates to stay where they are. Still, weak economic data can quickly shift expectations, as seen in recent market moves and sharp changes in rate forecasts.\nAt the same time, the USD/JPY pair remains range-bound as traders wait for the Bank of Japan decision.\nJapan Rate Hike Seen as All but Certain\nAs explained in the analysis two weeks ago, the Bank of Japan has been sending clear hawkish signals to prepare markets for a rate hike. This approach has worked. A hike now feels expected rather than surprising.\nThese signals have also capped gains in the USD/JPY pair, which remains in a sideways range as markets wait for the decision. If the Bank of Japan delivers the expected hike, attention will shift to the policy statement and any hints about when the next increase could come in what remains a slow tightening cycle.\nIt would be unrealistic to expect the Bank of Japan, which usually moves cautiously, to raise rates at every meeting early next year. A more likely trigger comes from spring wage negotiations, which play a major role in shaping inflation. Current forecasts point to a 5 percent wage increase, according to Japan\u2019s largest labor union representing millions of workers.\nMacroeconomic Calendar Brings Long-Awaited Data\nToday, Tuesday, fresh data from the US labor market will be released. Because of the timing, markets only have a consensus estimate for the unemployment rate, which is expected to stay unchanged at 4.4 percent year on year.\nOn Thursday, new data on price changes in the US economy will also be published. These figures matter, yet the Federal Reserve\u2019s current messaging shows a stronger focus on the labor market. Last week interest rate cut supports this view and highlights jobs data as the main priority.\nThe week ends with Japan inflation data on Friday and the Bank of Japan key interest rate decision. Together, these events should set the direction for the USD/JPY pair through at least the end of the year.\nWhere Is USD/JPY Headed Next?\nUSD/JPY is trading in a short-term sideways range, with support near 155 yen per dollar. A clear break below this level could trigger a deeper move lower, with the main target near 151 yen per dollar, where the rising trend line and key support meet.\nOn the upside, the 158 to 159 yen per dollar zone is the key resistance for buyers. A break above this area would open the door for a move toward the long-term highs.\n****\nBelow are the key ways an InvestingPro subscription can enhance your stock market investing performance:\n- ProPicks AI: AI-managed stock picks every month, with several picks that have already taken off in November and in the long term.\n- Warren AI: Investing.com\u2019s AI tool provides real-time market insights, advanced chart analysis, and personalized trading data to help traders make quick, data-driven decisions.\n- Fair Value: This feature aggregates 17 institutional-grade valuation models to cut through the noise and show you which stocks are overhyped, undervalued, or fairly priced.\n-\n1,200+ Financial Metrics at Your Fingertips: From debt "

                "body": "Over the past five trading sessions, USD/CAD has posted a decline of more than 0.7% in favor of the Canadian dollar, maintaining a consistent bearish bias in the short term. For now, selling pressure has remained strong, especially after the release of U.S. employment data, which reinforced a structural weakness in the U.S. dollar. Adding to this, this week\u2019s inflation figures from Canada continue to support a neutral rate outlook from the Bank of Canada, allowing the Canadian dollar to maintain steady strength. If both factors persist, selling pressure may continue to dominate USD/CAD movements in the coming sessions.\nWhat Happened with U.S. Employment Data?\nToday\u2019s session included the release of NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls) data for October and November, which had been delayed due to the recent government shutdown. Although the most recent figure was positive \u2014 64,000 jobs added, surpassing expectations of 50,000 \u2014 the October reading showed a significant drop of \u2013100,000 jobs, indicating a sharp slowdown in the U.S. labor market.\nSource: ForexFactory\nDespite the mixed nature of the data, the Federal Reserve has not yet adjusted its outlook for the coming year. The negative October data justified last week\u2019s rate cut, while the November rebound supports the idea that the central bank will maintain a neutral stance heading into January\u2019s decision. What seems more evident is that the labor-market volatility suggests that rate hikes will not be considered in 2026; instead, the Fed may alternate between neutral rates and additional cuts to stabilize employment conditions.\nHowever, the post-NFP landscape has not improved demand for the U.S. dollar. On one hand, labor data remains in a sensitive state, reducing the attractiveness of U.S. investments; on the other hand, the Federal Reserve has not provided clear signals about its direction for 2026, increasing overall market indecision and weakening Treasury bond stability. The lack of clarity diminishes foreign capital interest and limits demand for U.S. dollars.\nThis weakness is reflected in the behavior of the DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against a basket of currencies. The DXY continues its consistent downtrend, trading below 100 points and moving toward the 98-point area\u2014levels not seen since early October. This confirms a persistent decline in U.S. dollar strength in the short term.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nTaken together, these factors show that the employment data release generated more uncertainty than confidence regarding the U.S. economy. As long as this scenario persists, structural dollar weakness could continue benefiting the Canadian dollar, allowing it to gain ground consistently and strengthening selling pressure on USD/CAD in the sessions ahead.\nInflation in Canada\nCanada\u2019s CPI data was released this Monday, showing a neutral inflation reading. The headline rate remained at 2.2% for November, matching October\u2019s reading. Although inflation has not shown recent increases, it remains slightly above the Bank of Canada\u2019s 2% target, maintaining the need for continued monitoring.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nWhile the data does not suggest that the Bank of Canada will adopt an aggressive stance in 2026, it does point toward maintaining a neutral rate outlook. Compared with the potential for additional rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, a more stable rate environment in Canada could sustain the attractiveness of CAD-denominated investments, encouraging foreign capital inflows and supporting demand for the Canadian dollar in the short term.\nIf this neutral outlook persists, demand for CAD could remain consistent, becoming a key factor in maintaining steady selling pressure on USD/CAD over the medium term.\nUSD/CAD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- A New Downtrend Emerges: Since the November highs, a new short-term downtrend has begun to take shape in USD/CAD price action. With no strong bullish corrections, this downtrend becomes the most relevant "

The pair gains ground as the US Dollar (USD) finds support, as mixed labor market data did little to reinforce expectations of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nThe US November jobs report showed payroll growth of 64K, slightly above forecasts, but October figures were revised sharply lower, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest since 2021, underscoring a gradually cooling labor market. Retail sales were flat on the month, reinforcing signs that consumer demand is losing momentum.\nFed officials are split over whether more easing of monetary policy is needed next year. The median Fed official penciled in just one reduction in 2026, but some policymakers see no further cuts. Meanwhile, traders anticipate two rate cuts next year.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the US President Donald Trump is set to interview Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Wednesday for the top Fed job. A WSJ poll in October revealed that Waller was ranked as the top choice of economists, because \u201che has laid out some of the most intellectually consistent arguments for rate cuts this year and is seen as someone who might be able to navigate internal divisions.\u201d\nThe USD/CAD pair could extend its decline as the Canadian Dollar finds support from the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision to keep rates at 2.25% and its view that policy is \u201cabout the right level,\u201d dampening expectations for aggressive near-term easing.\nMeanwhile, Canadian inflation data, headline CPI steady at 2.2% and trimmed-mean inflation easing to a ten-month low of 2.8%, reinforced confidence that price pressures are converging toward the BoC\u2019s target.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls.

Spot prices, however, managed to rebound a few pips from a one-and-a-half-week low following the release of the UK jobs data and traded above the 207.00 mark during the early European session.\nThe UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the ILO Unemployment Rate edged higher to 5.1% in the three months to October from 5% in the quarter to September. The reading was in line with consensus estimates. Meanwhile, the number of people claiming jobless benefits climbed 20.1K in November compared to 22.3K expected. Adding to this, a downward revision of the previous month's Claimant Count Change, to -3.9K against 29.0K reported previously, offers some support to the British Pound (GBP) and the GBP/JPY cross.\nHowever, the growing acceptance that the Bank of England (BoE) will lower borrowing costs at its policy meeting on Thursday holds back the GBP bulls from placing aggressive bets. The Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, continues to be underpinned by firming expectations for an imminent interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) later this week. Apart from this, a softer risk tone further benefits the JPY's relative safe-haven status and contributes to capping the GBP/JPY cross, warranting some caution before positioning for a further recovery.\nTraders now look forward to the release of the flash UK PMIs for some impetus. The focus, however, will remain glued to the key central bank event risks \u2013 the BoE rate decision on Thursday and the outcome of a two-day BoJ policy meeting on Friday. The latter should play a key role in driving the near-term JPY price dynamics and determining the next leg of a directional move for the GBP/JPY cross.\nEconomic Indicator\nClaimant Count Change\nThe Claimant Count Change released by the UK Office for National Statistics presents the change in the number of unemployed people in the UK claiming benefits. There is a tendency for the metric to influence GBP volatility. Usually, a rise in the indicator has negative implications for consumer spending and economic growth. Generally, a high reading is seen as bearish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while a low reading is seen as bullish.\nRead more.Last release: Tue Dec 16, 2025 07:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nActual: 20.1K\nConsensus: 22.3K\nPrevious: 29K\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nThe change in the number of those claiming jobless benefits is an early gauge of the UK\u2019s labor market. The figures are released for the previous month, contrary to the Unemployment Rate, which is for the prior one. This release is scheduled around the middle of the month. An increase in applications is a sign of a worsening economic situation and implies looser monetary policy, while a decrease indicates improving conditions.

                "body": "Author: Arkham\nTranslation: Felix, PANews\nMany market observers have described the multi-year \"cycles\" of bitcoin price, which coincide with bitcoin halving events. These patterns, collectively known as the \"four-year cycle,\" have become significant psychological events influencing the mindset of crypto watchers and traders. This article will explore the various stages of the four-year cycle and review past bitcoin cycles. In addition, it will discuss whether the bitcoin cycle still exists.\nMarket observers believe that the standard bitcoin cycle begins with what is commonly referred to as the \"accumulation\" phase. They speculate that this phase starts with the crash following the previous cycle's peak. During this period, price volatility and on-chain activity are relatively low, and market sentiment tends to be neutral or negative. It is called the accumulation phase because long-term bitcoin holders start buying in large quantities. As a result, the price characteristics during this period are a gradual recovery.\nBitcoin price and long-term holder supplyOn-chain analysis shows that some investors are steadily accumulating, but most retail investors are still haunted by the previous crash and are not interested in buying bitcoin.\nThe accumulation phase usually lasts 12 to 15 months, after which the market cycle typically enters a new bull market. This usually occurs before the halving, as the prices of bitcoin and other crypto assets begin to rise in anticipation of the halving. The market starts to price in the bullish impact of future supply reduction, and sentiment shifts from neutral to optimistic. Liquidity begins to recover, and media attention increases accordingly.\nBitcoin price and new address countOnce the halving occurs, the bull market often rises parabolically, with prices starting to climb, sometimes slowly, sometimes explosively. Retail investors flood into the market, and traders begin to invest heavily. Historically, this is when all-time highs are often set, as a new wave of investors enters the market. Some investors increase leverage to chase the highs, resulting in even greater price volatility.\nPrevious bull markets have lasted about 12-18 months, typically ending with a sharp price drop. Leveraged traders are liquidated, altcoins fall even more, sentiment turns negative, and the bear market begins. At this stage of the cycle, many participants sell at a loss and cash out with whatever funds remain. Eventually, the dust settles and the market bottom slowly forms. Overall market activity and excitement have dropped significantly since the peak, but determined builders continue to move forward, quietly developing new products and innovations.\nTo fully understand the four-year bitcoin cycle theory, one must thoroughly understand the concept of halving and its impact on bitcoin price.\nBitcoin halving is a significant event that halves the mining reward (paid in BTC) for adding new blocks to the bitcoin blockchain. This occurs every 210,000 blocks, approximately every four years. In 2009, the reward for adding a new block was 50 bitcoins per block. Since then, it has halved four times. The 2024 halving set the current new block mining reward at 3.125 bitcoins. Assuming the four-year rhythm continues, halvings will persist until the total supply reaches the cap of 21 million, around the year 2140.\nHalving is Satoshi Nakamoto's way of ensuring bitcoin's scarcity. Bitcoin was born during the 2008 financial crisis, in part as a response to central bank bailouts and fiat currency inflation. Most governments and their associated fiat currencies constantly adjust monetary policy, making it difficult for holders to have long-term confidence in the value of their fiat currency.\nBitcoin's halving mechanism mimics gold, making it more scarce. As gold reserves are depleted, mining becomes increasingly difficult, while bitcoin achieves this mathematically. As the new supply of bitcoin decreases, its scarcity increases. H"

                "body": "Bitcoin ETF news is back in the spotlight this week as an unusual new proposal draws attention from traders and institutions alike. While Bitcoin continues to hover near $86,000 \u2013 down nearly 4% in 24 hours \u2013 a recently filed application for an \u201cAfterDark ETF\u201d has introduced a fresh narrative.\nThe fund aims to trade Bitcoin-linked products outside of regular U.S. market hours, capitalizing on off-peak volatility. Meanwhile, emerging crypto like Bitcoin Hyper is gaining traction as investors look for high-upside alternatives amid ETF uncertainty.\nBitcoin Price Pulls Back Despite Institutional Momentum\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $86,295.40, with a market cap just below $1.72 trillion, marking a 3.95% daily drop. Trading volume is up more than 24%, but sentiment remains cautious as leveraged players continue to drive volatility.\nThe drop comes amid a broader cooldown in tech and AI-related equities. According to CNBC, both AI stocks and crypto majors are under pressure, with Bitcoin slipping back from recent highs. This dip follows several weeks of optimism tied to inflows into U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, but Monday\u2019s decline hints at short-term market fatigue.\nStill, analysts point to macro resilience. \u201cMuch of the recent price action is noise,\u201d said one portfolio manager tracking digital assets. \u201cThe ETF flows are long-term structural. The volatility is from derivative unwindings and Asia-led weekend trades.\u201d\nThe \u201cAfterDark ETF\u201d Could Change Everything\nThe newly proposed Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF is not a typical spot vehicle. Instead of holding Bitcoin directly, the fund would allocate at least 80% of its value to futures, Bitcoin-linked ETFs, and options on those assets.\nA December 9 filing with the SEC shows the ETF would mimic a strategy similar to one studied by Bespoke Investment Group, which showed that buying the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) at the market close and selling at the next open would have yielded a 222% return since January 2024. In contrast, buying and selling during normal hours would have lost over 40%.\nIt will trade these instruments after U.S. markets close and exit those positions shortly after the market reopens. This design seeks to profit from Bitcoin\u2019s tendency to make outsized moves during non-U.S. trading hours, often influenced by Asian and European flows.\nPolitical Tailwinds and ETF Expansion Under Trump Administration\nWhile the ETF filing is technically new, it fits into a broader narrative of rapid ETF expansion under President Donald Trump, who returned to office in early 2024. Trump\u2019s administration has pressed both the SEC and CFTC to relax regulatory barriers for digital assets and open the door to more ETF experimentation \u2013 not just for Bitcoin, but also altcoins like Aptos, Sui, and meme tokens like Bonk and Dogecoin.\nAs of now, over 30 Bitcoin ETFs have launched in the U.S. market since January 2024. Most offer spot exposure, while others experiment with yield strategies or volatility harvesting. The AfterDark ETF, however, is the first to explicitly restrict its trading window to after-hours, a move that could introduce a new class of ETF products optimized for overnight price moves.\nWhy Retail Is Still Looking at Bitcoin Hyper\nWhile the headlines remain focused on Bitcoin ETF news, retail and early-stage investors are looking beyond institutional products. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper are positioning themselves as high-upside complements to slow-moving ETF flows.\nAt press time, Bitcoin Hyper is approaching $30 million raised, with only ~$400,000 left before the next price rise. The token currently sells for $0.013435, and buyers can participate using crypto or fiat via card. The presale interface shows a countdown timer \u2013 just over 24 hours remain before the next price increase, creating urgency among speculative buyers.\nBitcoin Hyper markets itself as a hyper-deflationary asset modeled after Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity mechanics, but with added st"

                "body": "AI Blockchain: How Ethereum Is Driving the Machine Economy\nEthereum has established itself as the blockchain network of choice for developers seeking to innovate and drive what\u2019s next in Web3. It should come as little surprise that the next natural step in this convergence is for Ethereum to serve as the foundational layer for artificial intelligence (AI) integration into decentralized applications. While no one can predict the future here, shrewd investors are likely to keep an eye on how the Ethereum price USD may shift in the wake of this integration.\nThe possibilities resulting from this convergence are fueling excitement across technology and financial sectors. The former is likely excited to see how AI might power and transform decentralized applications, along with automating logic and optimizing tools to make for a better user-driven system.\nThe financial crowd may be excited to see how their investments in both AI and digital assets might pay out following this integration. Ethereum has been the standard bearer for the cutting edge, and tech-minded investors have been drawn to the blockchain network to see how they can invest in the future.\nWhy AI and Ethereum Are Converging\nBeyond its continued efforts to innovate, Ethereum serves as a premier option for AI integration for many reasons. For one, AI can enhance the smart contract process, driving better and more sophisticated logic, instead of simple if-then or true-false conditions. AI-powered smart contracts can take into account the underlying context, allowing them to become more dynamic.\nMore dynamic and context-aware smart contracts can start to address issues before they arise. Some experts anticipate that \u201cby integrating AI with blockchain and smart contracts\u2026AI can optimize contract terms, predict and mitigate issues, and enhance the overall logistics.\u201d By taking into account and processing enormous amounts of historical data, AI can help develop contracts that may better anticipate market changes. In other words, AI may make smart contracts even smarter.\nEthereum\u2019s commitment to security, as demonstrated by the recent shift from a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism that harshly punishes bad actors, positions it as a strong candidate for hosting these smarter, more logical contracts. The blockchain network fosters a secure underlying environment for using and deploying AI\u2019s logic-based programs across different sectors, including governance, finance, and more.\nUse Cases Emerging in Web3\nInvestors and other interested parties needn\u2019t wait to see the impact of AI on blockchain technology. AI is already being used to assist with governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs. With the decentralized nature of blockchain being key here, AI can help organize and automate decision-making across disparate groups. AI assistants may help party members make better-informed and faster decisions, without needing to pore over countless pages of governance.\nMoreover, AI tools can move through blockchain marketplaces quickly, alerting governance and risk team members whenever fraud is detected. AI can help members of the marketplace remain agile and competitive, too. Where scanning for competitive pricing and useful products used to be a tedious and manual process for marketplace members, AI can quickly analyze and make key recommendations.\nDeveloper and Infrastructure Trends\nThere\u2019s no sign that the AI transformation is slowing anytime soon. Developers have seized on the technology for new projects, combining oracles and helping to scale Layer-2 solutions more quickly. AI-assisted oracles are helping to gather and process data from beyond the Ethereum blockchain networks more quickly and efficiently.\nAs AI tools serve to build a bridge between the Ethereum blockchain and everyday, applicable use, developers can likewise benefit from this go-between. Machine Learning (ML) and blockchain developers alike are better able to access and use existing infrastructure"

                "body": "How tokenized US Treasuries are replacing DeFi\u2019s foundation\nTokenized US Treasuries grew from $2 billion to $9 billion in 18 months. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Circle now offer on-chain T-bills as margin collateral, DeFi building blocks, and stablecoin alternatives.\nFor two years, decentralized finance operated on the concept that purely crypto-native assets could serve as the monetary base for a parallel financial system.\nEthereum staked through Lido anchored billions in DeFi loans, wrapped Bitcoin backed perpetual swaps, and algorithmic stablecoins recycled protocol emissions into synthetic dollars.\nThe entire edifice assumed crypto could bootstrap its own collateral hierarchy without touching the $27 trillion US Treasury market.\nThat assumption has broken quietly over the past 18 months. Tokenized US Treasuries and money-market funds now sit at roughly $9 billion across 60 distinct products and over 57,000 holder addresses, with an average seven-day yield near 3.8%. The growth in the period was more than five times.\nZoom out to the entire real-world asset stack and tokenized RWAs on public chains approach $19 billion, with government securities and income products dominating, according to rwa.xyz data.\nTreasuries have become the spine of this stack, functionally replicating their role in the $5 trillion US repo market, the instrument against which everything else clears.\nThis is not boutique experimentation. BlackRock's BUIDL fund reached nearly $3 billion in size, was accepted as collateral on Binance, and was extended to BNB Chain.\nFranklin Templeton's BENJI token represents over $800 million in a US-registered government money-market fund, with its shareholder records maintained on seven different networks.\nCircle's USYC quietly surpassed $1.3 billion in July, fueled by a partnership with Binance that enabled institutional investors to use the token as collateral for derivatives trading.\nJPMorgan launched a $100 million tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum that allows qualified investors to subscribe and redeem in USDC. The plumbing connecting Wall Street custody to Ethereum rails is in production, not proof-of-concept.\nWall Street custody meets Ethereum settlement\nThe issuer landscape reveals two competing theories of how crypto collateral evolves.\nBlackRock's BUIDL operates as a tokenized institutional liquidity fund managed by Securitize, with Bank of New York Mellon handling custody and fund administration. Shares represented by BUIDL tokens invest in cash, US Treasuries, and repos.\nRedemptions are made in USDC, with a $250,000 minimum and no redemption fee, placing BUIDL squarely in the institutional lane. Its acceptance as collateral on centralized exchanges and extension to multiple chains positions it as high-grade, dollar-denominated collateral for crypto derivatives and basis trades.\nFranklin Templeton took a different path with its OnChain US Government Money Fund, which tokenizes the shareholder registry itself: one share equals one BENJI token, with transfer and record-keeping maintained on-chain rather than in a legacy transfer-agent database.\nThe fund remains a registered US government money-market fund, the innovation sits in where the ledger lives.\nThis approach bets that public blockchains can serve as a primary record for regulated securities, not just as a secondary token layer on top of traditional systems.\nJanus Henderson's Anemoy Treasury Fund and Ondo Finance's OUSG sit at opposite ends of a third axis. Anemoy deploys tokens across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Celo, emphasizing multichain resilience, and has earned an S&P rating focused on its tokenization architecture.\nOndo, by contrast, operates as a DeFi-native issuer partnering with institutional back-ends. Its OUSG product offers 24/7 minting and redemption in USDC or PayPal's PYUSD, targeting qualified investors who want Treasury exposure without leaving crypto-native rails.\nOndo's broader platform reached $1.4 billion in total v"

This incident, confirmed by blockchain security experts, marks another security challenge for the popular yield-optimization platform. For investors and DeFi users, understanding what happened is crucial for navigating the risks and opportunities in this rapidly evolving space.\nWhat Happened in the Latest Yearn.finance V1 Hack?\nBlockchain security firm PeckShield first flagged the suspicious activity. An attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Yearn.finance V1 system, making off with digital assets worth approximately $300,000. The stolen funds were quickly converted into 103 ETH and sent to an anonymous cryptocurrency address beginning with 0x0F21.\nThis event is particularly troubling because it follows a separate, larger incident earlier this month where the protocol lost $9 million. The recurrence of such breaches raises serious questions about the security posture of even established DeFi projects.\nWhy Does the Yearn.finance V1 Hack Matter for DeFi?\nThe implications of this hack extend beyond the immediate financial loss. First, it erodes user trust in a protocol designed to manage and grow cryptocurrency holdings. Second, it highlights the persistent security vulnerabilities that plague the DeFi sector, even among veteran projects.\nConsider these key points:\n- Smart Contract Risk: The hack likely resulted from an exploit in the protocol\u2019s smart contract code, the self-executing agreements that power DeFi.\n- Fund Recovery Challenges: Due to the anonymous nature of blockchain transactions, recovering stolen funds is extremely difficult.\n- Market Confidence: Repeated security incidents can dampen overall confidence in DeFi, potentially affecting investment and innovation.\nHow Can Users Protect Themselves After a DeFi Hack?\nWhile the team behind Yearn.finance investigates the breach, users must take proactive steps to safeguard their assets. Security in the decentralized world ultimately relies on individual vigilance as much as protocol design.\nHere are actionable insights for any DeFi participant:\n- Diversify Holdings: Avoid concentrating all assets in a single protocol, even well-known ones like Yearn.finance.\n- Stay Informed: Follow official channels and security firms like PeckShield for real-time alerts on vulnerabilities.\n- Understand the Tech: Basic knowledge of how smart contracts and liquidity pools work can help you assess risk better.\n- Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, consider using a hardware wallet for an added layer of security between your assets and online protocols.\nWhat\u2019s the Future for Yearn.finance and DeFi Security?\nThe repeated Yearn.finance V1 hack incidents serve as a stark reminder that the DeFi industry is still maturing. However, they also catalyze improvement. Each breach leads to more robust auditing practices, better insurance mechanisms like decentralized coverage protocols, and a greater collective focus on security-first development.\nThe path forward involves a balance between innovative financial products and the rigorous, boring work of making them unhackable. The community\u2019s response to this event will be a telling indicator of DeFi\u2019s long-term resilience.\nConclusion: Navigating DeFi with Eyes Wide Open\nThe $300,000 Yearn.finance V1 hack is a setback, but not an endpoint. It underscores a critical truth about decentralized finance: high potential returns come with commensurate risks. The industry\u2019s promise of open, permissionless, and efficient finance remains powerful. However, realizing that promise fully depends on building systems that are not just innovative, but also fundamentally secure and trustworthy. For users, the lesson is to engage with DeFi actively and "

                "body": "How NFTs Are Embracing Solana\nIn the past, Ethereum was the foundation of DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 innovation. However, as the ecosystem expanded, NFTs began to exceed the capabilities of such tools. Solana, with its unique ability to process several thousand transactions per second, proved to be a highly viable alternative. As a result, Solana has become a key player in shaping blockchain technology and digital finance. In order to see this, you need only look at the recently increasing Solana price USD.\nSolana is reshaping the NFT landscape by offering a high-performance, low-cost alternative to Ethereum, making NFT creation and trading more accessible for creators, collectors, and gaming platforms worldwide. Ethereum\u2019s gas fees have limited casual participation in NFT markets. In stark contrast, Solana provides a faster, more affordable blockchain that appeals to artists and developers alike. This technical advantage is significant. According to CME Group, \u201cSolana is known in the cryptocurrency space because of the short processing times the blockchain offers. Solana can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), substantially higher than many other blockchains.\u201d\nBreaking Down NFTs\nAn NFT is a non-fungible token. In the strictest of objective terms, this means that it is a digital token that is not fungible, which is to say that it is not interchangeable. Part of the central appeal of NFTs is that they are not interchangeable and are instead distinctly individualistic. However, while this is a key appeal for many within the established community, it has also served as a detriment to potential newcomers.\nFor a better illustration of this, one need look no further than the literal differences in the terms \u2018non-fungible token\u2019 and \u2018cryptocurrency.\u2019 The latter is a smooth, easy-to-say single-word term that effectively encompasses the sum total of precisely what the technological product is within its name. By taking \u2018crypto,\u2019 a phrase associated with technological innovation, and adding it to the widely established \u2018currency,\u2019 it becomes immediately apparent what kind of product cryptocurrency is.\nIn contrast to this, while the phrase \u2018non-fugible token\u2019 does communicate what an NFT is at its core, it does so with verbiage that is so alien to average consumers that it leaves little to no lasting impression. As a result, in the years since both NFTs and cryptocurrency blew up in early 2020, cryptocurrency has remained viable and sustainable in ways NFTs have not. While pivoting to Solana doesn\u2019t change these superficial issues, it does alter some of the core components of NFTs, making it that much easier for new investors to jump on board.\nNFT Marketplaces and Ecosystem Growth\nElsewhere, platforms like Magic Eden and Solanart host diverse NFT projects, from art to gaming assets. In tandem with this, mobile-native wallets and simplified onboarding lower barriers for mainstream adoption.\nThis is of especially notable importance, given the ways in which so many traditional systems have pivoted to better allocate space for cryptocurrency in recent years. Thus, by embracing the possibilities that Solana brings as a new foundation, NFTs are able to take advantage of a much larger established ecosystem of opportunities.\nCreator Benefits\nIn addition to this, when compared to Ethereum, Solana offers reduced minting costs. This allows for more experimentation and frequent drops, all of which is conducive to better longevity and sustainability for investors. Furthermore, projects can program royalties directly into smart contracts with lower execution costs.\nEmbracing Volatility\nOne common criticism of cryptocurrency is its volatility. Although this is generally true, this volatility can actually be seen as one of its greatest strengths instead of a weakness. For example, Bitcoin's price can change by hundreds or even thousands of dollars within a single day.\nCompared to more traditional stocks or investments, which take much longer to"

Here's what's making news in the markets:\nWelcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\nCrypto\u2019s next $200 billion valuation debate may already be taking shape, and it looks a lot like Solana during the last cycle, according to a new report from Cantor Fitzgerald, which initiates coverage of Hyperion DeFi (HYPD) and Hyperliquid Strategies (PURR).\nCantor frames the equities as more than passive digital asset treasury companies (DATs). Unlike conventional DATs that simply warehouse tokens and wait for price appreciation, both companies are positioned as yield-generating participants in the Hyperliquid ecosystem through staking, validation, and market-building activity.\nThat operational exposure underpins a valuation thesis that treats Hyperliquid less like a speculative DeFi protocol and more like a layer 1 platform business, echoing the bull cases once applied to Solana.\nIn Cantor\u2019s 10-year model, Hyperliquid generates more than $5 billion in annual fees and is valued at a 50x multiple, implying a HYPE market capitalization north of $200 billion, with HYPD and PURR offering public-market access to that upside via active balance-sheet deployment rather than simple token custody.\nThe comparison matters because it reframes how decentralized exchanges are being valued. In Solana\u2019s case, investors eventually moved past treating the token as a speculative throughput play and began modeling it as financial infrastructure capable of generating durable cash flows.\nCantor is making the same argument for Hyperliquid, pointing to the protocol\u2019s fee structure, where roughly 99% of trading revenue is recycled into token buybacks, directly linking volume growth to supply reduction rather than shareholder dilution.\nCantor argues those fees are coming from an addressable market still dominated by centralized exchanges, where perpetual futures volumes exceeded $60 trillion in 2025.\nEven modest share gains from those venues translate into hundreds of billions of dollars in incremental volume and hundreds of millions of dollars in additional annual fees, anchoring Hyperliquid\u2019s growth case in the migration of existing liquidity rather than speculative demand creation.\nThe report also addresses rising competitive concerns, particularly around Aster, a rival perp DEX backed by Binance-affiliated interests that briefly surpassed Hyperliquid in monthly volume."

                "body": "Why Solana Serves as a Hub for Creators and Developers\nCrypto technology is often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which serve as a store of value that can be purchased or traded. While this is probably the most common use case for crypto, blockchains like Solana are becoming increasingly popular as platforms for creators and developers to build projects such as games, NFTs, and content platforms. They use Solana to USD exchanges to pay for their work on the network.\nSolana is known for its fast transaction speeds and high capacity. It also has low fees and notable scalability. This makes it a more popular choice for blockchain innovators.\nWhy Do Creators Choose Solana?\nCreators choose Solana over other popular ecosystems like Ethereum primarily because of its unique architecture, which serves as the foundation for the features that make Solana especially developer-friendly.\nUnlike Bitcoin, which operates on the sluggish and energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, or Ethereum, which only uses the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, Solana merges their own custom version of PoS with another invention of theirs dubbed \u201cProof of History\u201d (PoH).\nAs Coinbureau explains, PoH \u201ctimestamps transactions to create a verifiable order of events. This method significantly enhances the network's scalability, allowing high-speed processing without sacrificing security.\u201d With PoH, Solana can handle transaction speeds of over 50,000 TPS. Each transaction costs only a fraction of a cent on average.\nTransactions on Solana usually settle within a few seconds under normal network conditions. By comparison, transactions on Ethereum can take minutes or even hours at times. It is these confirmation times and near-zero transaction costs that make Solana ideal for scalable digital content and microtransactions, some of the most popular material on the blockchain. This popularity has driven creators to make user-friendly minting tools and integrated wallets, adding even more appeal to the network.\nSolana offers numerous benefits to developers and creators looking to innovate with blockchain technology, but it is worth noting that, like any other piece of tech, the network is not without its flaws.\nDespite its speed, or perhaps because of it, the network has experienced outages in the past, sometimes lasting hours on end. Solana is actively working toward reducing the likelihood of future outages. Congestion has also been an issue, albeit an uncommon one. As Solana draws in more innovators, however, it is likely these issues will be addressed or at least alleviated soon.\nGrowth of the Solana Ecosystem\nThe Solana ecosystem currently supports a wide range of project types. These include decentralized finance (DeFi), consumer applications, DePIN, community groups, payment systems, and various forms of digital infrastructure.\nSome of the most popular and accessible right now are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and music, highlighting how Solana works as an effective means of direct-to-audience monetization.\nSolana encourages further growth by providing developer grants and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) tools, both of which attract innovators in Web3 creator tools. This growth often cascades once it reaches a certain threshold, as the creation of novel and attractive features tends to invite more attention and further innovation, perpetuating the process in the absence of barriers.\nRevenue Models and Royalties\nMuch of the appeal of being a creator on Solana is the chance to be paid in SOL, the network\u2019s token, which was valued at $185.39 USD. Although the most straightforward method of earning SOL would be to trade it on the crypto market, since Solana is an ecosystem hosting hundreds of applications, a substantial amount of SOL is traded within the ecosystem itself.\nLike most blockchain technologies, Solana is decentralized and therefore allows for the development of tools like smart contracts. Developers use these contracts to crea"

The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% in early trading Tuesday. It\u2019s a bit below the all-time high it set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.2%. Treasury yields were mixed after one report said the unemployment rate was at its worst level last month since 2021, but employers also added more jobs than economists expected. A separate report said sales at U.S. retailers and restaurants were unchanged in October.\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.\nWall Street inched slightly lower early Tuesday ahead of the release of U.S. employment and inflation reports that could drive the direction of interest rates.\nFutures for the S&P 500 fell 0.2% before the bell Tuesday, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were unchanged. Nasdaq futures lost 0.2%.\nShares in Roomba maker iRobot sank more than 20% in premarket trading after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. That was on top of a nearly 73% decline on Monday. The company known for its robotic vacuums said it doesn\u2019t expect any disruptions to its devices as it is taken private.\nFord Motor Co. shares ticked up a little more than 1% after the automaker announced Monday that it is pivoting away from its once-ambitious electric vehicle plans amid financial losses and waning consumer demand. Ford, which has poured billions of dollars into electrification along with most of its industry peers, said it will no longer make the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck.\nThe main focus on Wall Street this week will be several big updates on how the U.S. economy is faring.\nEconomists expect the jobs report from November, due Tuesday, to show employers added 40,000 more jobs than they cut during the month. An update on inflation Thursday is forecast to show U.S. consumers paid prices that were 3.1% higher in November than a year before.\nInvestors are hoping that the job market will weaken by just enough to get the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but not so much that the economy slips into recession. Lower rates help boost the economy and prices for investments, but also may worsen inflation.\nEconomists expect Tuesday\u2019s report to show the unemployment rate at 4.4%, which would keep it near its worst level since 2021.\nAlso coming Thursday is the government's latest data on retail sales.\nPopular Reads\nIn Europe at midday, Germany's DAX lost 0.4%, while the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.2% lower. Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.5%.\nIn Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 declined 1.6% to 49,383.29 as preliminary factory data showed manufacturing slowing slightly. The S&P Global Flash purchasing managers index rose to 49.7 from 48.7 in November on a scale of up to 100 where 50 marks the cut off for expansion.\nInvestors are watching Japanese data carefully ahead of a Bank of Japan policy meeting on Friday that is widely expected to result in an interest rate hike that could rattle world bond, currency and cryptocurrency markets.\nChinese markets also retreated after figures for November, released Monday, came in weaker than expected. Retail sales rose at their slowest rate since 2022, during the pandemic, at 1.3% from a year earlier in November. Lending and investment also weakened.\n\u201cOverall, the data set confirms a loss of momentum into (the) year-end and is consistent with our growth forecasts that moderating to around 4%\u201d in the last quarter of this year, Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank said in a report.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.5% to 25,235.41, while the Shanghai Composite index lost 1.1% to 3,824.81.\nSouth Korea's Kospi gave up"

October data was incomplete and showed a decline due to government spending cuts. Economists had expected 50,000 new jobs.\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, up from 4.4%, the highest level since 2021. Still, the jobs data was not as bad as some had feared, which limited its impact. Furthermore, there will be another non-farm payrolls report in early January, ahead of the next Fed meeting on January 28.\nThe data has provided investors with greater clarity on the health of the labour market following the historic government shutdown, which had left the Fed and the market without visibility.\nBased on the data, the market is pricing in at least 58 basis points of rate reductions next year, higher than the 25-basis-point signals from the Fed last week.\nAttention will be turning to retail sales data tomorrow and inflation on Thursday for further insight.\nCorporate news\nPfizer, the pharma giant, is modestly lower after issuing disappointing 2026 earnings guidance.

                "body": "Investors faced a split-screen reality on Wall Street today. In a session that highlighted the market\u2019s current crosscurrents, the major US indexes close mixed, delivering a clear message: not all sectors are moving in lockstep. While the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated, the Nasdaq Composite managed to carve out a modest gain. This divergence is more than just a daily statistic; it\u2019s a crucial signal about where investor confidence and caution currently lie. Let\u2019s unpack what drove this split performance and what it could mean for your portfolio.\nWhat Does a Mixed Close for Major US Indexes Actually Mean?\nWhen we say the major US indexes close mixed, it indicates a lack of unified direction. Instead of a broad-based rally or sell-off, money is rotating between different types of companies. Today\u2019s numbers tell a specific story: the S&P 500, a benchmark for the overall US market, dipped 0.24%. The Dow Jones, heavily weighted toward industrial and traditional consumer giants, fell more sharply by 0.62%. In contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.23%. This pattern suggests investors are making nuanced bets, favoring growth-oriented technology stocks while showing hesitation toward more established, cyclical sectors.\nWhy Did the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Fall?\nThe declines in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones weren\u2019t random. Several headwinds pressured these broader indexes. First, rising bond yields often make the steady dividends of blue-chip Dow stocks less attractive by comparison. Second, concerns about slowing economic growth can hit industrial and financial companies\u2014key components of the Dow\u2014particularly hard. Finally, the S&P 500\u2019s drop reflects a cautious stance from a wide swath of investors. Key pressure points included:\n- Interest Rate Sensitivity: Traditional value stocks suffer when future earnings are discounted at higher rates.\n- Economic Data: Weak readings on manufacturing or consumer spending can trigger sell-offs in cyclical sectors.\n- Sector Rotation: Money may simply be flowing out of one area of the market and into another.\nHow Did the Nasdaq Manage to Gain Ground?\nThe Nasdaq\u2019s resilience, leading to a day where the major US indexes close mixed, points to renewed appetite for risk and growth. Technology and growth stocks often thrive in environments where long-term innovation prospects outweigh short-term economic worries. A surge in a handful of mega-cap tech stocks can single-handedly lift the entire index. Furthermore, positive news from the semiconductor sector or strong earnings from a major software company can provide a tailwind. This gain, however narrow, signals that some investors are still willing to bet on future earnings potential, even amid broader uncertainty.\nWhat Should Investors Do When Indexes Diverge?\nA mixed market is a test of strategy. It demands that investors look beyond the headline numbers of the major US indexes close mixed and understand the underlying forces. This environment rewards selectivity and research. Instead of making broad bets on \u201cthe market,\u201d focus shifts to individual sectors and company fundamentals. It\u2019s a powerful reminder that diversification across different asset types and industries is not just a safety measure\u2014it\u2019s a critical tool for navigating uneven performance. Days like these underscore why a one-size-fits-all approach rarely works.\nConclusion: Decoding the Signal from a Split Market\nThe fact that the major US indexes close mixed is a valuable piece of market intelligence. It breaks the illusion of a monolithic market and reveals the active battle between optimism for growth (tech) and concerns about value and the economic cycle (industrials). For the savvy observer, this isn\u2019t noise; it\u2019s a signal. It tells us that the market is in a process of digestion, weighing competing narratives about interest rates, inflation, and corporate profits. The path forward will likely remain choppy and sector-driven, making careful analysis mor"

The decrease was driven by an 11% fall in year-over-year import volume.\n\"Much of that difference is tied to last year's rush to build inventories and now with some warehouse levels still elevated, importers are pacing their orders a bit more carefully,\" Seroka said.\nStill, by the end of November, the port had moved almost 9.5 million container units, 1% more than last year, leading to the expectation that volume will top 10 million for the year.\nThe port moved 10.3 million container units last year and set a record in 2021 when it moved 10.7 million container units.\nHowever, exports \u2014 cargo shipments from the port \u2014 fell for the seventh time in 11 months in November, sliding 8%, which will lead to the first annual decline since 2021. Seroka blamed the drop on the response to the tariffs.\nRead more: Jobs at the Port of Los Angeles are down by half, executive director says\n\"We're also seeing the effects of retaliatory tariffs and third country trade deals on U.S. ag and manufacturing exports,\" Seroka said. \"This is a headwind we may face for some time to come.\"\nThe port director said he expects that imports will decline in the \"single digits\" next year because of continued high inventory levels, but he doesn't anticipate a drastic downturn in overall trade.\nRead more: From Bratz dolls to Krusty the Clown: How Trump tariffs are hurting L.A. toy makers\n\"I don't see the port volume falling off a cliff, and it's a pretty good leading indicator to the U.S. economy that we should take stock in,\" said Seroka, who added that there is much economic uncertainty entering next year.\nThe question of where the economy is headed was highlighted Tuesday by the latest jobs figures, which were delayed by the government shutdown."

Now I think events this could make them look even more tempting than they already are.\nAs well as dividend income, I\u2019ve been getting bags of growth too. Shares in one of my favourites, Lloyds Banking Group, are up 70% in the last year and 105% over two. As a result, the yield\u2019s fallen to 3.35%, but that should recover, and I\u2019m also collecting stellar rates of income elsewhere.\nHigh-income FTSE 100 shares\nOne of my favourites is wealth manager M&G. It was yielding more than 10% when I added it to my Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) in 2023. That has since dipped to 7.25% today on a trailing basis, but that\u2019s caused by a 37% rise in the share price over the last year, which I\u2019m certainly not going to complain about. I get an even bigger trailing yield of 7.8% from insurer Phoenix Group Holdings, whose shares are up 30% in a year, turbo-charging my total return.\nSome of the yields I\u2019m collecting are more than double what savers can expect from a standard deposit account. Legal & General Group throws off 8.7% while FTSE 250-listed Taylor Wimpey pays 9.4%. Their shares haven\u2019t done so well, but I\u2019m hoping that will reverse next year.\nMarkets reckons there\u2019s a 92% chance the Bank of England will cut the base rate at its next meeting on Thursday (18 December), most likely from 4% to 3.75%. That\u2019s bad news for savers, because returns on variable rate accounts will fall as a result, but it\u2019s good news for FTSE income stocks, as their yields will look even more attractive by comparison.\nBP shares are rewarding\nMy SIPP also contains oil giant BP (LSE: BP). While not the highest yielder on the FTSE 100, it still pays a generous 5.56%. The BP share price has been volatile, climbing 10% over the last year but down 5% over two. Nothing\u2019s guaranteed when investing, neither dividends nor share price growth. But over the long term, history shows that equities deliver far superior total returns to cash or bonds. Ultimately, volatility is the investor\u2019s friend.\nAn interest rate cut on Thursday will hit savings rates but won\u2019t have any impact on yields. In the longer run, it could boost dividends, as cheaper borrowing and a revived economy lift company profits.\nThere are other rewards to holding stocks. BP has also supported its share price through regular share buybacks. Yet I\u2019m not sure this is the first dividend stock I\u2019d consider buying right now. The BP share price could be in for a volatile time, amid talk of an oil gut. If crude prices fall further, so could BP\u2019s profits.\nClimate change also poses a risk, as the drive to renewables could knock oil demand, hitting an old-school fossil fuel producer like this one. However, there are plenty more high-yielding dividend stocks on the FTSE 100. And the lower interest rates go, the more attractive their yields will appear."

Growth in China's factory output stalled to a 15-month low in November, data showed.\nEuropean indexes also opened lower and struggled to make gains.

Growth in China's factory output stalled to a 15-month low in November, data showed.\nEuropean indexes also opened lower, before edging slightly higher. At 0956 GMT, the STOXX 600 was down 0.1% on the day SXXP, London's FTSE 100 was down 0.3% CURRENCYCOM:UK100 and Germany's DAX was down 0.5% DAX. Progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks contributed to a fall in European defence stocks. Still, the pullback comes in the context of stock markets hitting record highs in 2025, with the STOXX 600 on track for a 14.8% gain in 2025 overall.\nThe MSCI world equity index was down by 0.3% on the day EURONEXT:IACWI, and up 19.8% on the year as a whole.\nEconomists predict that the U.S. jobs data will show that federal government cost-cutting led to a decline in nonfarm payrolls in October, followed by a rebound in job growth in November.\n\u201cEither you get strong numbers, so the economy re-accelerates. Or you have not that good of a number and hence expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates even more,\u201d said Kevin Thozet, a member of Carmignac\u2019s investment committee.\nCENTRAL BANK MEETINGS, MORE DATA\nInvestors are also watching out for U.S. inflation data on Thursday, although a number of key details will be missing, and central bank meetings including rate policy decisions from the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.\nThe U.S. dollar index was little changed at 98.204, down by less than 0.1% on the day DXY and close to multi-week lows against the euro and yen. The euro was steady at $1.1754 EURUSD, after European PMI data showed that euro zone business activity growth slowed more than expected at the end of 2025.\n\"Lower energy prices mean that the euro zone's terms of trade \u2013 export relative to import prices \u2013 are closing in on the best levels seen over the last four years.

                "body": "Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ:SMCI) earnings growth rate lags the 60% CAGR delivered to shareholders\nThe last three months have been tough on Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) shareholders, who have seen the share price decline a rather worrying 30%. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been spectacular. In fact, during that period, the share price climbed 953%. Impressive! Arguably, the recent fall is to be expected after such a strong rise. Of course what matters most is whether the business can improve itself sustainably, thus justifying a higher price. Anyone who held for that rewarding ride would probably be keen to talk about it.\nWhile the stock has fallen 10% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Super Micro Computer achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 52% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 60% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Super Micro Computer's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nA Different Perspective\nInvestors in Super Micro Computer had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.2%, against a market gain of about 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 60%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Super Micro Computer better, we need to consider many other factors.

                "body": "Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) shares have continued their recent momentum with a 25% gain in the last month alone. Looking back a bit further, it's encouraging to see the stock is up 87% in the last year.\nFollowing the firm bounce in price, Dollar Tree may be sending bearish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 23.4x, since almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 19x and even P/E's lower than 11x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\nDollar Tree could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Dollar Tree.\nIs There Enough Growth For Dollar Tree?\nDollar Tree's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver solid growth, and importantly, perform better than the market.\nIf we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 4.0%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 22% in aggregate. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 15% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.\nWith this information, we can see why Dollar Tree is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\nWhat We Can Learn From Dollar Tree's P/E?\nDollar Tree's P/E is getting right up there since its shares have risen strongly. Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\nAs we suspected, our examination of Dollar Tree's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Dollar Tree might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nHave feedback on this article?

                "body": "Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg believes there's a lot of support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial Make America Healthy Again initiatives in Hollywood, but people just aren't open about it.\nMcCarthy-Wahlberg made the claim during a recent sitdown interview on the Culture Apothecary With Alex Clark podcast, when the host asked her, \"What sentiments do you hear from Hollywood about MAHA? Are they secretly very supportive of the MAHA movement?\"\n\"Secretly very supportive,\" McCarthy-Wahlberg replied. \"I've been mentoring mothers online who DM me still, but also celebrities that have called me and said, 'I don't want to come out. I don't want people to know I have a child on the spectrum. I don't want people to know my schedule. Can you help me?'\"\nShe continued, \"And I honor that because they saw what happened to me. They don't want \u2014 who in their right mind after everything that I've kind of [been through] would be like, 'You know, I want to be that next person that gets bullied for so many years.' So, there's more conservatives than you would know hiding out in Hollywood.\"\nThe Masked Singer panelist is likely referring to the public backlash she's faced over the years for her controversial stance on vaccines and what she believes is a connection to autism. Her son, Evan, was diagnosed with the disorder in 2005.\nA link between autism and vaccines has long been debunked by the scientific community, however, Health Secretary RFK Jr. has been a loud proponent of the discredited claim. His MAHA movement has come under repeated fire for moves like implementing massive staffing cuts, canceling contracts for life-saving vaccines, and suggesting a connection between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and disorders like autism and ADHD.\nBack on the podcast, when asked where she leans politically, McCarthy-Wahlberg initially said she considers herself \"conservative,\" but when Clark pointed out that she publicly identified as \"independent\" in the past, she explained, \"Yeah. Independent. I mean, I would lean both ways. If Bobby [Kennedy] ran as independent, I would have said the word independent.\"\nAs for what inspired this change, McCarthy-Wahlberg said, \"Mainly what you've talked about as well \u2014 the conservative values. I noticed that, like I said, there's more questioning authority, less government control, closer to God. It just lined up.\"\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\nMcCarthy-Wahlberg and her husband, Donnie Wahlberg, publicly supported RFK Jr.'s unsuccessful run for president in 2024. In a video uploaded to Instagram at the time, McCarthy-Wahlberg said: \"I'm endorsing Bobby for president.\"\n\"Our dear friend Bobby,\" Wahlberg chimed in, before the couple shouted, \"Go Bobby.\" Other celebrity endorsements for Kennedy included his wife and Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl Hines and comedian Rob Schneider."

After being acquired by overseas investment funds including Ripplewood, it was renamed Shinsei Bank and relisted in 2004.\nThe lender became a subsidiary of SBI Holdings in 2021 and was delisted in 2023. It repaid all public funds this year ahead of the IPO."

                "body": "Japan's Nikkei rises as tech shares track Nasdaq gains\nBy Junko Fujita\nJapan's Nikkei share average edged higher, rebounding from a two-week low hit in the previous session, as technology stocks tracked overnight gains on the Nasdaq.\nThe Nikkei NI225 was up 0.3% at 49,505.41, as of 0210 GMT, after briefly falling as much as 0.6% earlier in the session. If the advance holds, the index is set to snap a two-session losing streak. The broader Topix TOPIX added 0.05% to 3,372.24.\nThe broader Topix TOPIX edged 0.05% higher to 3,372.24.\nChip-testing equipment maker Advantest 6857 rose 1.59%, providing the biggest boost to the Nikkei. Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing 9983 gained 0.87%, while robot maker Fanuc 6954 jumped 2.68%.\nU.S. markets offered mixed cues overnight, with the Nasdaq closing higher, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ended lower, weighed down by losses in healthcare and energy stocks.\n\"It is hard to make active bets before the Bank of Japan's policy decision this week. The market has fully priced the interest rate hike at the BOJ's policy meeting, but investors want to know the pace of the rate hike next year,\" said Shota Sando, equity market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.\nThe BOJ is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75% on Friday, a three-decade high, and signal further tightening, closing the year with two hikes despite headwinds from U.S. tariffs and the inauguration of a dovish prime minister.\nThe Nikkei is likely to trade without a clear direction toward the year-end, fluctuating between small gains and losses as investors take profits after strong advances in technology shares, Sando said. However, he added that demand from individual investors looking to buy on dips should provide support.\nAmong other stocks, SoftBank Group 9984 slipped 0.88%, while fibre optic cable maker Fujikura 5803 erased early losses to trade 0.52% higher.\nOn the Tokyo Stock Exchange's prime market, 44% of stocks rose, 50% fell, and 4% were unchanged."
