                "body": "As gold prices continue their meteoric rise in 2025, Wall Street\u2019s most prominent voices are sounding the alarm for investors to allocate more to the precious metal. Icons like Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones have publicly advocated for gold as a hedge against mounting economic pressures, with prices surging past $3,600 an ounce earlier this year\u2014a record high that underscores the metal\u2019s appeal amid global uncertainty.\nThis rally marks gold\u2019s strongest performance since the inflationary turmoil of the 1970s, driven by a confluence of factors including persistent inflation, ballooning U.S. debt, and geopolitical risks. Central banks worldwide have ramped up purchases, adding to the demand that has nearly doubled bullion\u2019s value since 2023.\nRising Inflation and Debt Concerns Fuel Demand\nInvestors are flocking to gold as a safe haven, particularly in light of U.S. fiscal challenges. With national debt exceeding $35 trillion, fears of devaluation are pushing capital into tangible assets. According to a recent report from Business Insider, Wall Street strategists point to inflation\u2019s stubborn hold, with consumer prices still elevated despite Federal Reserve efforts to tame them through rate adjustments.\nGeopolitical tensions, including trade tariffs under the Trump administration and ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, have further bolstered gold\u2019s status. The Guardian highlighted how alarm over policies like proposed tariffs has driven bullion to new highs, as investors seek protection from currency fluctuations and supply chain disruptions.\nCentral Banks and Market Forecasts Point to Sustained Growth\nCentral bank buying has been a key catalyst, with institutions like China\u2019s People\u2019s Bank stockpiling reserves to diversify away from the dollar. This trend, combined with a weakening U.S. currency amid Fed rate cut expectations, has propelled gold\u2019s momentum. Bloomberg notes that for centuries, gold\u2019s portability and universal value make it the ultimate refuge during economic upheaval.\nLooking ahead, analysts are optimistic. UBS recently raised its forecast to $3,800 per ounce by year-end 2025, citing anticipated Fed easing and dollar weakness, as reported by Reuters. Similarly, Business Insider detailed how gold outperformed the S&P 500 this year, crushing traditional safe havens amid tariff fears.\nInvestor Strategies in a Volatile Environment\nFor industry insiders, incorporating gold into portfolios involves more than spot purchases; options include futures for leveraged exposure or physical bullion for long-term holds. BullionVault provides daily insights into how inflation and bond yields influence prices, recommending a 5-10% allocation to balance risks.\nRetail demand is also soaring, with gold bar sales up 13% year-over-year, per Business Insider. As economic vibes remain pessimistic, this hoarding reflects broader anxiety over recessions and debt sustainability.\nNavigating Risks and Opportunities Ahead\nYet, gold\u2019s volatility demands caution\u2014May saw its first monthly dip of 2025 amid renewed U.S.-China trade spats, as noted by BullionVault. Goldman Sachs advises focusing on commodities like gold alongside select stocks resilient to rate changes, per their outlook in Business Insider.\nUltimately, as 2025 progresses, gold\u2019s trajectory hinges on Fed decisions and global events. For savvy investors, it\u2019s not just a relic but a strategic bulwark against uncertainty, with Wall Street\u2019s endorsements signaling a bull market far from over."

Buyers emerged near the lows of the week at around $3,630 and drove the non-yielding metal higher. The XAU/USD trades at $3,670 during the North American session.\nXAU/USD recovers after Fed cut, outlook buoyed by low-rate environment and resilient Asian demand\nBullion is recovering ground on Friday, following the decision by the Federal Reserve (Fed), which cut rates by 25 basis points and laid the path for two additional rate cuts toward the end of the year. Nevertheless, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference was perceived as hawkish as he said that the reduction is a \u201crisk-management cut,\u201d and failed to say that tariff inflation is \u201ctransitory.\u201d\nNevertheless, the outlook for non-yielding metal looks promising as it tends to perform well in low interest rate environments.\nSwiss Gold exports to the US in August tumbled 99% after the US Customs & Border Protection revealed that bars would be subject to tariffs. The White House then backpedaled on that matter, and the exemption was formalized in early September.\nNevertheless, China came to the rescue as shipments more than tripled in August from 9.9 tonnes to 35, its highest level since May 2024, while exports to India rose as well.\nDaily market movers: Gold surges amid strong US Dollar\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the buck\u2019s performance against a basket of six currencies, is up 0.26% at 97.61.\n- US Treasury yields are rising steadily with the 10-year Treasury note up two and a half bps at 4.137%. US real yields surged almost three bps to 1.757%.\n- Minnesota Fed President Neel Kashkari said he supported this week\u2019s rate cut, citing rising risks to employment as justification for action. He argued it is unlikely that tariffs will push inflation much above 3%. He added that if the labor market strengthens and inflation rises further, the Fed should pause on additional easing. He also noted he remains open to raising rates again should economic conditions warrant.\n- Fed Governor Stephen Miran said that he was the one that voted for a 50 bps cut and with the lower dot in the \u201cdot plot.\u201d He said that the economy should have an interest rate not too far from the neutral rate now. He added that he will announce a review on his views on Monday.\n- Next week, the US economic docket will feature S&P Global Flash PMIs, Durable Goods, Jobless Claims, GDP data and the release of the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, the Core PCE. Alongside this, a flurry of Fed officials will hit the media.\n- Money market futures expectations for the October 29 meeting are at 91% for a 25-basis-point rate cut, revealed by the Prime Market Terminal interest rate probability tool.\nSource: Prime Market Terminal\nTechnical outlook: Gold price uptrend resumes above $3,650\nGold price uptrend resumes with the yellow metal climbing back above $3,670, opening the door for a test of the record high of $3,703. It is worth noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) bounced off the 70 overbought territory, hinting that bulls are gathering traction.\nIn that outcome, the next key resistance levels would be $3,750 and $3,800. Conversely, if XAU/USD tumbled beneath $3,650, this clears the path to challenge the September 11 low at $3,613, and the $3,600 mark.\nGold FAQs\nGold has played a key role in human\u2019s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times.

                "body": "Gold futures continued their downward trajectory on September 18, surrendering gains despite the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points. The precious metal's decline suggests that investors may be engaging in profit-taking activities after gold reached elevated price levels in recent sessions.\nDecember gold contracts settled $16.40 lower, representing a 0.44% decline to $3,678.20 on Thursday's trading session. Silver futures similarly retreated, closing lower by $0.03 or 0.08% at $42.12. Both precious metals encountered resistance from U.S. dollar strength that has persisted over the past two trading sessions.\nMarket analysts attribute gold's recent weakness to investor disappointment over the Federal Reserve's measured approach to monetary easing. The central bank's quarter-point rate reduction fell short of some market participants' expectations for a more aggressive half-point cut, leading to a reassessment of the Fed's dovish stance.\nThe economic backdrop presents a mixed picture for precious metals. Recent unemployment data revealed a sharp decline in initial jobless claims, indicating some resilience in the labor market. However, broader employment trends paint a more concerning picture, with the U.S. economy adding fewer than 30,000 jobs per month on average over the past quarter\u2014a significant deceleration from the robust pace of over 100,000 monthly additions observed earlier this year.\nGold experienced intraday volatility, falling more than 1% during the session as market participants interpreted the Federal Reserve's policy communications as less accommodative than previously anticipated. This reaction occurred despite the rate cut and the central bank's signals indicating potential for additional monetary easing in future meetings.\nThe precious metal's performance reflects the complex interplay between monetary policy expectations, currency dynamics, and investor sentiment in the current market environment. As gold traditionally benefits from lower interest rates and currency debasement concerns, the measured pace of Federal Reserve easing has prompted investors to reassess their positions in the safe-haven asset.\nFor those that would like more information about our services click here\nWishing you as always good trading,"

OPEC+ is set to unwind 1.6 million barrels per day of voluntary supply cuts starting October 2025, just as global crude inventories are already building. The bank projects worldwide oil stocks could reach nearly 11 billion barrels by the end of 2026, enough to meet more than three months of global demand. Although global consumption is on the rise\u2014Citi forecasts demand to climb by 0.7 million barrels daily next year\u2014the ramp-up in supply should outweigh those gains. Citi now expects average Brent prices to hover near $62 through early 2027, but also warns there\u2019s a 30% likelihood oil dips below $60 if demand disappoints, non-OPEC competitors step up production, or OPEC+ doesn\u2019t follow through on planned cutbacks.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Oil\u2019s supply cushion is getting thicker.\nGreater output from OPEC+ and swelling inventories\u2014especially from China\u2014are softening the risk of volatility, making sudden price surges less likely. Citi\u2019s Brent price target of $60 points to a lackluster outlook for oil bulls in the near term. For investors, that could mean pressure on energy stocks and oil exporters, but cheaper fuel could support industries and economies that rely on affordable energy, while helping dampen inflation for import-heavy regions.\nThe bigger picture: Supply strength eases economic nerves.\nAn abundant oil reserve makes the global economy more resilient to short-term geopolitical shocks, with Citi estimating only a slim chance that prices spike above $75\u2014even in tense situations. That said, trade disputes could still slow diesel demand, rippling through shipping and manufacturing. In the end, ample supply is shifting the balance of power, giving policymakers and businesses more room to navigate the twists ahead.\nProspero.ai\u2019s high-tech signals and plays are helping investors make smarter decisions.\nNow, you can benefit as they do: Prospero\u2019s crowdfunder is open.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\nNo wonder the platform was named the Best AI Fintech by the Global Financial Market Review, while winning the award for the Most Influential CEO 2025 Financial Technology from CEO Monthly.\nIf you want to invest in an investor favorite, check out Prospero.ai's crowdfunder here.\nInvesting in private securities is risky, speculative, and illiquid.

                "body": "Oil prices slipped on Friday as concerns over U.S. fuel demand outweighed optimism that the Federal Reserve\u2019s first rate cut of the year would bolster consumption.\nBrent crude futures fell 8 cents, or 0.12 percent, to $67.36 a barrel as of 5:38 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures dropped 14 cents, or 0.22 percent, to $63.43. Despite this session\u2019s decline, both benchmarks were set to end higher for the second consecutive week.\nOPEC+ output increases pressure sentiment\nThe Federal Reserve lowered its policy rate by a quarter point on Wednesday and signaled further reductions ahead in response to a weakening labor market. Lower borrowing costs generally support oil demand and tend to lift prices.\nHowever, conflicting signals across the market have weighed on prices. On the demand front, major energy agencies have flagged concerns over weakening consumption, limiting expectations for a strong near-term price rebound. On the supply front, planned output increases by OPEC+ and indications of oversupply in U.S. fuel inventories are further pressuring sentiment.\nU.S. crude inventories posted a sharp decline last week as net imports fell to a record low and exports climbed to their highest level in nearly two years, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. U.S. oil inventories shrank by an unexpected 9.285 million barrels in the week to September 12. Gasoline inventories also shrank by 2.3 million barrels, driven mainly by high exports.\nHowever, a larger-than-expected build in distillate stocks, which rose by 4 million barrels compared with forecasts for a 1 million-barrel increase, fueled concerns over demand in the world\u2019s largest oil consumer and weighed on prices. The distillate build showed demand for fuels and other oil derivatives was cooling ahead of the winter season, which usually signals softer oil demand.\nRead: Dubai 24-carat gold prices climb to AED441 as global rates retreat from record run\nSoftening U.S. labor market fuels demand concerns\nEconomic data has also fueled oil demand concerns. Jobless claims earlier in the week pointed to a softening U.S. labor market, with both worker demand and supply easing, while single-family home building dropped to a nearly 2.5-year low in August amid a surplus of unsold new homes.\nIn Russia, the Finance Ministry unveiled a new measure aimed at protecting the state budget from oil price volatility and Western sanctions, helping to ease some supply concerns.\nOil prices climbed earlier in the week as ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine fueled concerns about potential disruptions to Russian oil supplies, while speculation over additional Western sanctions on Moscow\u2019s energy sector added further support.\nA weaker dollar ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decision also helped lift prices, but the greenback\u2019s rebound on Thursday weighed on oil. Despite recent gains, oil prices remain under pressure in 2025, with crude still deep in the red amid persistent worries over slowing demand and the prospect of a supply boost."

Repairs are expected to take approximately a month.\nMarket sentiment was further supported by US-China trade developments. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration would not impose unilateral tariffs to curb China's Russian oil purchases, though such measures could be considered if Europe imposes steep duties on China and India.\nThese remarks eased concerns over potential trade disruptions and added optimism to the market.\nOil prices, however, dipped slightly on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates for the first time this year.\nThe Fed lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points, describing the move as a \"risk-management cut\" to protect against further labor market weakness.\nWhile lower borrowing costs typically support oil demand, traders remain cautious amid weak economic signals and muted consumption forecasts.\nMeanwhile, the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) latest data showed that commercial crude stocks fell 2.2% in the week ending September 12, dropping by 9.3 million barrels to 415.4 million, contrary to market expectations of a 1.4 million-barrel increase.\nWhile strategic petroleum reserves, excluded from commercial inventories, rose by 500,000 barrels, gasoline stocks declined by 2.3 million barrels, suggesting stronger domestic demand.\nAdding to market uncertainty, US President Donald Trump said in a Fox News interview Thursday that Europe could help end the Russia-Ukraine war by imposing sanctions or tariffs on China and called for a rapid halt to Russian oil imports\u2014actions he argued would weaken the Kremlin's war effort.

                "body": "USD Rallies After Fed Cuts: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CAD\nUS Dollar Talking Points:\n- It was a big week with multiple central bank meetings and while the dust hasn\u2019t yet settled, the USD has put in a three-day rally after the Fed\u2019s rate cut announcement.\n- This resembles last year, to a degree, as the Dollar initially perched down to a fresh low and then rallied into the end of the press conference. This week was then followed by another two days of strength and the current weekly DXY bar is showing as a doji.\n- Next week will be key for follow-through, in either direction, as there\u2019s also been a jump in longer-term Treasury yields following the announcement which again resembles last year.\nThe Fed doesn\u2019t control the entire US yield curve, and that was on full display this week as Treasury yields jumped even as the Fed cut rates. This is like what showed last year, as Fed rate cuts sparked a rally in stocks and a sell-off in bonds and in that instance, the moves ran into the end of the year. If investors are seeing higher inflation expectations on the back of short-term cuts, holding long bonds makes less sense, and that can help to explain the backdrop that\u2019s shown in both instances as in each, the Fed cut rates even with inflation well-above their own 2% target.\nThe weekly chart illustrates this theme well, as sellers finally had an open door to go for a breakdown and so far, they\u2019ve failed to run with it. Ever since the August NFP report, sellers have been responsive to fresh highs as denoted by the upper wicks on the below chart. But the underside wick on last week\u2019s bar illustrates that failure to take control, and that\u2019s something that could lead into pullback or possibly even reversal scenarios as we move deeper into the year.\nInterestingly, the low from last Q3, when the Fed cut rates, is what\u2019s set the high so far in the second-half of the year and that\u2019s a major decision point for the USD which bulls will need to take out to illustrate greater control. And from last year\u2019s instance, we can see that it took a few weeks for buyers to ultimately sway the trend, and they did so with force in Q4 even as the Fed was continuing to cut rates.\nUS Dollar Weekly Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD\nThe DXY basket is 57.6% Euro so if we are going to see a reversal in the Dollar, it will probably need some help from the single currency.\nLast week\u2019s ECB meeting is when Christine Lagarde started sounding less-dovish, saying that the disinflationary process was over and that the Eurozone economy was in a good spot. That wasn\u2019t quite match Powell\u2019s tone this week when he classified the move as a \u2018risk management rate cut\u2019 to go along with a dovish forecast from the FOMC for the rest of this year and into next.\nBut \u2013 there does remain a possibly bullish backdrop in EUR/USD given the fact that price has held around some key supports so far. If this changes, that USD reversal potential can start to look more attractive next week but this is a really big deal for broader Dollar trends, again, very similar to what showed last year around the Fed\u2019s first cut in September.\nFor support structure \u2013 the 1.1748 level is putting up a fight and below that, it\u2019s the zone from 1.1675-1.1686 that stands out as important. If sellers can start to evoke daily closes below that area, the premise of a EUR/USD reversal will start to look more attractive and deductively, so too would reversals in USD/DXY.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nThe weekly chart of EUR/USD is also of interest, and similarly, this highlights failure from bulls to run with the fresh three-year-high. But, it also illustrates that important support structure that could potentially keep buyers in the equation, if it does hold.\nBears made a forceful move in July but since the August 1st NFP report, there\u2019s been multiple episodes of failure from sellers as illustrated by those underside wicks "

This is the first change after a nine-month pause in the cycle, and the decision itself is precautionary. The Fed, guided by a \"risk management\" approach, did not react to a specific economic shock but acted prudently amid increasing uncertainty.\nA new element of communication was the growing attention paid to the labor market situation \u2013 despite relatively stable inflation and unemployment, a slowdown in the pace of employment and limited recruitment activity are visible, which may indicate the market's susceptibility to deterioration.\nNon Farm Payrolls (in thousands), source: Bloomberg\nECB Policy\nMeanwhile, in Europe, during the Eurogroup meeting in Copenhagen, members of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, Madis Muller and Mario Centeno, presented the ECB's monetary policy stance. The current policy remains moderately accommodative, and interest rates \u2013 including the deposit rate at 2% \u2013 have not changed in recent months. President Christine Lagarde emphasized that the ECB is at an opportune moment to achieve its 2% inflation target.\nMadis Muller noted that inflation is currently \"more or less on target,\" and the current level of rates supports economic growth, which in the coming quarters will be more dependent on domestic demand. Mario Centeno, in turn, pointed out the current risks to growth and inflation, which he believes are trending downwards. He did not rule out a future interest rate cut, although he currently sees no urgent need for it. The ECB forecasts inflation at 1.9% in 2027 and GDP growth of 1.3%. Structural challenges, such as higher tariffs from the US, weak industrial demand, and a growing propensity to save, limit the potential for economic recovery in the euro area.\nHICP ECB Projections, source: European Central Bank\nEUR/USD\nEURUSD, daily timeframe, source: TradingView\nIn the foreign exchange market, the EURUSD pair has been in an upward trend since mid-January, when the exchange rate rose from 1.0178 to 1.1918, representing an almost 17% increase. Despite this, technical analysis indicates the possibility of a correction \u2013 a negative divergence has formed between the price and the RSI indicator. In the region of 1.14, there is important technical support \u2013 both horizontal and resulting from previous corrections within the trend.\nA decline to this level could be merely a natural correction within a broad upward trend. Potential doubts about further US rate cuts could accelerate such a descent without disturbing the long-term upward structure. In turn, maintaining the current monetary policy in the euro area may strengthen the common currency's fundamentals against the dollar in the medium term.\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or directors.

Dollar demand revived after U.S. initial jobless claims dropped sharply by 33,000 to 231,000, far below the prior 264,000, while the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index bounced to 23.2, the best level since January. The Euro, meanwhile, faced additional selling pressure from domestic political unrest in France, where anti-austerity protests surged and threatened fiscal stability.\nFederal Reserve Policy Outlook and U.S. Court Dynamics Support USD\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s latest 25 bps rate cut was initially seen as dovish, but Chair Powell\u2019s insistence on a \u201cmeeting-by-meeting\u201d path kept expectations measured. Futures still price a 90% probability of another cut in October and 80% odds of one in December, though Powell underscored that tariff-driven inflation remains a live risk. A separate court battle added intrigue after the U.S. Supreme Court scheduled a November 5 decision on Trump\u2019s tariffs\u2014policies that could further shape the Dollar\u2019s trajectory. The combination of resilient labor data, a stronger manufacturing pulse, and limited scope for immediate aggressive easing reinforced the Greenback\u2019s near-term bid.\nECB Rhetoric and Weak German PPI Drag on the Euro\nOn the European side, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos repeated that current policy remains \u201cappropriate\u201d but acknowledged high uncertainty, suggesting easing could continue if needed. ECB Governing Council member Mario Centeno was more explicit, warning inflation cannot be tolerated below 2% for too long and hinting at further cuts. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s PPI fell 2.2% year-over-year in August, accelerating from -1.5% in July and weaker than the -1.6% expected. On the month, prices fell 0.5%, a sign of disinflation at the factory gate, undermining Euro sentiment and stoking concerns of slower demand across Europe\u2019s supply chains.\nFrench Political Pressure Adds to EUR/USD Headwinds\nBeyond macro data, French domestic unrest is weighing on the Euro. Hundreds of thousands gathered across Paris, Lyon, and Marseille to demand that President Emmanuel Macron and new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu abandon spending cuts inherited from Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou\u2019s government. With fiscal credibility in doubt and protests intensifying, investors remain cautious on Euro-denominated assets, compounding downside pressure on EUR/USD.\nTechnical Breakdown: Key Levels Defended at 1.1750\u20131.1760\nFrom a technical perspective, the pair has broken below its rising trendline and now consolidates near 1.1750\u20131.1760, a support area tested repeatedly since September 15. Momentum indicators confirm the weakness: the RSI sits below 50 on the 4-hour chart, while short-term EMAs cross beneath longer averages. If bears press further, 1.1710\u20131.1700 becomes the next defensive zone, aligned with the late August trendline. A clean break lower exposes 1.1660, the September 11 trough. On the topside, 1.1790 intraday resistance must be cleared before testing 1.1850 and the September 16 high at 1.1878. Price fatigue is visible after repeated failures at the 1.1840\u20131.1880 corridor.\nRead More\n-\nIs FENY ETF a Buy ? at $24.31 with 3.11% Yield: Income Hedge Backed by Big Oil and Tight Supply\n19.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Surge $140M as BTC-USD Holds $115K and Altcoin ETFs Break Records\n19.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - (NG=F) Pressured at $2.90 as Storage Surplus Collides With Fed Cut and EU Risks\n19.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Priuce Near 148.00 as Fed Cut Collide"

The US Dollar has recovered after falling to three-year lows in the aftermath of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy decision on Wednesday.\nMinnesota Fed President Neel Kashkari said that he supported the rate cut this week as risks of an increase in unemployment warranted some action. He noted that it is hard to see inflation climbing much higher than 3% from tariffs and added that if the jobs market improves and inflation rises, the Fed should hold rates. He added that he is open to hiking rates if economic conditions warrant.\nMeanwhile, Wednesday\u2019s Fed decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was fully priced by market participants, as the Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the buck\u2019s value against a basket of six currencies, rallied sharply and turned flat on the week at around 97.62.\nAcross the pond, UK Retail Sales rose 0.5% MoM in August, exceeding forecasts of 0.4%, while sales growth in July was slightly revised down.

The pair, however, maintains its immediate bearish trend intact, on track to a 0.6% weekly loss.\nWeaker-than-expected Australian labour data raised some speculation about the possibility of a surprise rate cut later this month, and sent the Aussie Dollar lower against its main peers.\nNet employment fell by 5.4K in August, against market expectations of a 22K increase and following a 26.5K growth in July. The sharp decline in full-time employment has been partially offset by the rise in part-time jobs, and the Unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2% but the feeling is that the labour market is losing momentum.\nThe USD appreciated further following US claims, manufacturing data\nIn the US, the Fed cut interest rates and hinted at further easing in the coming months, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell adopted a more cautious tone, providing a fresh impetus to the US Dollar.\nThe Greenback\u2019s recovery was further supported by a sharper-than-expected decline in weekly Jobless Claims, which fell by 33K to 231K in the second week of September, beating expectations, twice as much as the market consensus of a 14K decline.\nFurthermore, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index revealed a sharper-than-expected recovery of the region\u2019s sector activity. The Index bounced to 23.2, after a 0.3% contraction in August, bearing expectations of a more modest rebound, to 1.7. These figures did not dampen hopes of Fed easing, but have calmed fears of a sharp economic slowdown and underpinned the US Dollar\u2019s rebound.\nRBA FAQs\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for Australia. Decisions are made by a board of governors at 11 meetings a year and ad hoc emergency meetings as required. The RBA\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means an inflation rate of 2-3%, but also \u201c..to contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people.\u201d Its main tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will strengthen the Australian Dollar (AUD) and vice versa. Other RBA tools include quantitative easing and tightening.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for currencies since it lowers the value of money in general, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Moderately higher inflation now tends to lead central banks to put up their interest rates, which in turn has the effect of attracting more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in the case of Australia is the Aussie Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data gauges the health of an economy and can have an impact on the value of its currency. Investors prefer to invest their capital in economies that are safe and growing rather than precarious and shrinking. Greater capital inflows increase the aggregate demand and value of the domestic currency. Classic indicators, such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can influence AUD. A strong economy may encourage the Reserve Bank of Australia to put up interest rates, also supporting AUD.\nQuantitative Easing (QE) is a tool used in extreme situations when lowering interest rates is not enough to restore the flow of credit in the economy. QE is the process by which the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) prints Australian Dollars (AUD) for "

                "body": "In the last trading session of the week, USD/JPY recorded a moderate variation of 0.12%, but has once again begun to show a slight bearish bias as market indecision grows. This behavior reflects the influence of recent central bank decisions throughout the week. The bullish momentum of the U.S. dollar has stalled, while comments from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) highlight a growing division of opinions within the institution. If the central bank raises expectations of potential interest rate hikes in the short term, the selling pressure that had been sidelined could return and gain relevance for the pair.\nBank of Japan Decision\nIn today\u2019s early session, the BoJ officially announced that it would keep its interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, as expected. However, the most noteworthy development came shortly after: the bank revealed it will begin to sell part of its ETF holdings, currently valued at around $250 billion, as part of a plan to unwind the massive monetary stimulus applied in recent years. This marks a new approach, suggesting that the BoJ may not rely solely on maintaining low rates to support the economy in the short term.\nAnother key point was that during the meeting, at least two board members proposed raising the rate to 0.75%, indicating the emergence of internal disagreement. This shows that not everyone agrees on keeping rates so low compared to other major central banks worldwide, which could be an early sign that a more hawkish perspective is developing within the BoJ.\nRegarding inflation, the official target remains at 2%. Although it has declined steadily this year, from 4% at the start of 2025 to 2.7% in August, it is still not low enough to eliminate the risk of prices rising again. This highlights the need to adjust monetary policy to prevent inflation from re-accelerating if excessive stimulus continues.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nOverall, inflation remains a central concern for the BoJ. The division of opinions could bring interest rate hikes into future discussions. While Japan\u2019s current rate (0.5%) is far below that of the U.S. (4.25%), if the Fed continues its rate-cutting cycle and the BoJ adopts a more aggressive stance, the differential could narrow. In such a scenario, yen-denominated assets would become more attractive, potentially increasing selling pressure on USD/JPY.\nIs the U.S. Dollar Recovering?\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s long-awaited decision, the U.S. dollar has shown some relief. Since the rate cut was already priced in, speculation eased, allowing fresh bullish positions to enter the market. The DXY index has rebounded, moving closer to the 98-point level in the short term.\nSource: TradingEconomics\nThis rebound suggests that, after several weeks of declines, the dollar has found support. However, despite the recovery, the yen has not yielded as much as expected, which shows that the DXY still needs stronger confidence to fully dominate the yen. As a result, the recent buying pressure on USD/JPY may not remain fully consistent in the coming sessions.\nUSD/JPY Technical Forecast\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Sideways range gains importance: Since early July, USD/JPY has remained within a lateral channel between 148.606 and 146.367. This structure has limited clear directional moves. In the coming sessions, this range will remain the key technical reference, and only a firm breakout could trigger a more decisive move.\n- RSI: The RSI line shows a flat slope and oscillates near the neutral 50 level, reflecting a balance between buying and selling forces. This suggests that the neutral bias could persist in the short term.\n- MACD: The MACD histogram stays very close to the zero line, indicating neutrality in short-term moving averages. As long as this continues, the market is likely to remain in a phase of indecision.\nKey Levels:\n- 148.606 \u2013 Main Resistance: Coincides with the 200-period simple moving average, making it the most significant barrier for buyers.

In today\u2019s BoJ\u2019s monetary policy decision meeting, for the first time in 2025, two officials (Takata and Tamura) voted for an interest rate hike to 0.75%, citing that price stability (2% long-term inflation trend target in Japan) had been achieved, and the risks to prices becoming more skewed to the upside.\nLet\u2019s now examine fundamental factors.\nFig. 2: Japan overnight interest rate swaps as of 19 Sep 2025 (Source: MacroMicro)\nFig. 3: Yield spreads of US Treasury/JGB with major trend of USD/JPY as of 19 Sep 2025 (Source: TradingView)\nThe overnight index swaps (OIS) market for Japan\u2019s short-term interest rates is still pricing in a 25 basis points (bps) hike to the short-term overnight policy interest rate to 0.75% before 2025 ends.\nThe 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year OIS rates have continued to widen over the 1-month OIS rates in the past two weeks, where the 1-year OIS rate has increased from 0.67% on 8 September 2025 to 0.73% on Friday, 19 September 2025 at the time of writing (see Fig. 2).\nThe 2-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield, which is sensitive to changes to the BoJ\u2019s monetary policy stance, has continued its upward trajectory and climbed by to 0.91%, its highest level since 2008.\nHence, the yield premium between the 2-year US Treasury note and the 2-year Japanese Government Bond has continued to narrow steadily since the start of the year. The bearish breakdown of the 2.90% former major support on the week of 18 August 2025 is likely to add impetus for a further potential narrowing of the yield premium towards the next support at 2.05% (see Fig. 3).\nThis ongoing narrowing process suggests that 2-year US Treasuries have become relatively less attractive versus 2-year JGBs, reducing the yield premium in favour of the dollar.

The Bank of Japan has long been expected to do something about its ultra-loose monetary policy. If policymakers are reluctant to hike rates, then unloading the balance sheet might be the next best thing? Not exactly.\n\ud83c\udf81 Time for a Fresh Perspective?\n- The plans to offload the balance sheet weren\u2019t supposed to happen right now. Some see this as a sign that members of the central bank committee are getting impatient and looking for ways to start unwinding the easy policies that have made the country go for decades.\n- In fact, two members voted to hike rates while seven members opted for a hold. The internal disagreement sparked speculation that the bank could be tilting toward a hike by the end of the year.\n- Analysts are quick to point out that the pressure to move is already there \u2013 at least two members will likely vote for the hike at the next meeting.\n- The BoJ\u2019s rate decision came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Wednesday and after the Bank of England kept rates steady Thursday with two dissenting voices wanting a cut."

That move reversed some bets against the currency, while cautious signals from the Bank of Canada and the US Federal Reserve fed expectations for gentler monetary policy ahead. The Bank of Canada left future rate cuts on the table if the economy slows further, and Canadian bond yields climbed, especially on the 10-year, after months of drifting lower. Despite a sluggish job market and unresolved trade issues, BMO Capital Markets now expects a mild economic bounce in the third quarter. Still, Canada\u2019s dependence on oil exports means falling crude prices\u2014down 1.4% this week\u2014could continue to add some volatility.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency swings open doors.\nThe Canadian dollar\u2019s recent strength stands out, especially with a steady US dollar and falling oil prices in the mix. With consumer spending rebounding and central bank support possible, investor sentiment is turning more upbeat for Canadian assets. But ongoing oil price volatility keeps energy-linked sectors on their toes, and currency shifts could sway returns in the coming months.\nThe bigger picture: Policy pivots point the way.\nCentral banks\u2019 emphasis on flexibility ties the fate of the Canadian dollar and interest rates closely to new economic numbers and global developments.

Loonie traders shrugged off a wide missfire in Canadian Retail Sales figures from the summer, rejecting the day\u2019s early losses and sending the Canadian Dollar up 0.41% bottom-to-top against the Greenback.\nCanadian Retail Sales missed the mark in July, but the back-dated information did little do step on bullish Loonie flows on Friday. CAD traders are looking down the barrel of a thin economic data docket on the Canadian side, leaving an upcoming batch of key US data in the driver\u2019s seat.\nDaily digest market movers: Canadian Dollar breaks free and moves higher\n- The Canadian Dollar caught a strong bullish beat on Friday, snubbing downside data and climbing across the board as Loonie bulls grow impatient.\n- The CAD continues to hold out hope for a foothold from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the USD/CAD chart.\n- Canadian Retail Sales contracted by 0.8% in June, as expected, while core Retail Sales fell by 1.2%, a steeper decline than the forecast -0.7%.\n- Despite the headline miss in core Retail Sales, previous figures were revised upwards, giving Loonie traders some hope: core Retail Sales in June were revised up to 2.2% MoM, up from the previous 1.9%.\n- CAD positioning is set to be challenged next week, with US Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey results, US Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and US Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) inflation data all in the barrel.\nCanadian Dollar price forecast\nDespite the Canadian Dollar\u2019s near-term strength to cap off the week, USD/CAD remains hamstrung near key technical levels. Intraday bids are back below the 50-day EMA near 1.3785, but remain within recent traveling territory.\nUSD/CAD is leaning into the low side of what is shaping up to be a weak triple-bottom, with a demand zone near 1.3740.\nDow Jones daily chart\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as"

The central bank also announced plans to sell $250bn of traded funds.\nThe retreat immediately followed the peak at a 14-month high at 201.25, where the pair stalled below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 2024 uptrend. The focus is now on the 198.75-199.75 area, where the 20- and 50-day SMAs and the ascending trendline from April are positioned. A break lower could expose 197.90 or even 197.00, where the 38.2% retracement level is located.\nMomentum signals are softening, with the RSI and stochastics pointing lower. Still, as long as the RSI holds above 50, the bulls have room to regroup. In any case, the Bollinger Band squeeze suggests a new episode of volatility is imminent.\nIn the event buying interest resurfaces above 199.75, the pair may again battle the 201.00 bar with scope to meet the 203.00 mark and possibly stretch up to the key resistance line at 204.30.\nOverall, despite selling pressure, the short-term outlook remains constructive.

The modest bullish attempt comes on the back of some loss of impetus in the US Dollar, which nonetheless remains underpinned by the broad-based advance in US yields and firm sentiment, all following the FOMC event.\nGold keeps the bid bias in place around $3,670\nGold clocks decent gains, revisiting the $3,670 region per troy ounce at the end of the week. In the meantime, market participants continue to evaluate solid chances of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the next few months.

The Yen appreciated across the board following the decision.\nIn the UK, Setail Sales data from August beat expectations, showing a 0.5% monthly increase and a 0.7% year-on-year growth, beyond the market consensus of 0.4% and 0.6% respective figures. Excluding fuel, sales of all other products grew 0.8% in August and 1.2% on the year, also above the market consensus of 0.3% and 0.8% respective increases.\nBank of Japan FAQs\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the Japanese central bank, which sets monetary policy in the country. Its mandate is to issue banknotes and carry out currency and monetary control to ensure price stability, which means an inflation target of around 2%.\nThe Bank of Japan embarked in an ultra-loose monetary policy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy and fuel inflation amid a low-inflationary environment. The bank\u2019s policy is based on Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE), or printing notes to buy assets such as government or corporate bonds to provide liquidity. In 2016, the bank doubled down on its strategy and further loosened policy by first introducing negative interest rates and then directly controlling the yield of its 10-year government bonds. In March 2024, the BoJ lifted interest rates, effectively retreating from the ultra-loose monetary policy stance.\nThe Bank\u2019s massive stimulus caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers. This process exacerbated in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks, which opted to increase interest rates sharply to fight decades-high levels of inflation. The BoJ\u2019s policy led to a widening differential with other currencies, dragging down the value of the Yen. This trend partly reversed in 2024, when the BoJ decided to abandon its ultra-loose policy stance.\nA weaker Yen and the spike in global energy prices led to an increase in Japanese inflation, which exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target. The prospect of rising salaries in the country \u2013 a key element fuelling inflation \u2013 also contributed to the move.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The EUR/JPY is down a quarter of a per cent at 173.97, and USD/JPY is flat at 147.\nAlthough the yen may be the day's big winner, it still holds the title of the biggest loser when screened over a one-month timeline:\nAbove: JPY performance on a one-month timeframe.\nLonger-term underperformance is linked to Japan's chronically low interest rates, which suppress short-term bond yields and make it cheaper to borrow in yen and buy foreign bonds that yield higher rates.\nHowever, the gap looks set to close as the Bank of Japan looks to be on the cusp of a rate hiking cycle. Higher rates in Japan diminish the attractiveness of this 'carry' trade, and could help the Yen find growing support.\nFollowing Friday's decision, money-market pricing indicates 13bp of hikes are priced for the October policy meeting, up from 8.5bp ahead of the decision, implying a slightly greater than 50% probability of a 25bp hike.\n\"That seems reasonable given the LDP leadership election on 4th October is an element of uncertainty that could derail a hike on 30th October,\" says Halpenny.\n\"Overall, we continue to expect the BoJ to restart its hiking cycle in late October,\" says Kelvin Lam, Senior China+ Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics."

Historically, this event has been pivotal, often acting as a catapult for Bitcoin\u2019s value, with some analysts predicting it could skyrocket to an extraordinary $250K in the near future. Amid this fervor, investors are turning their gaze toward altcoins, intrigued by potential high-fliers like Hyperliquid and MAGACOIN FINANCE. The buzz around these digital assets underscores the thrilling prospects that lie just ahead.\nUnderstanding the Importance of Bitcoin Halving\nBitcoin halving occurs roughly every four years, slashing the rewards for miners and thereby constricting the influx of new Bitcoin. The forthcoming halving event will trim the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, inciting a scarcity that historically correlates with price increases. Previous halvings in 2012 and 2016 saw Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory explode, marking substantial rallies following these events.

An astonishing $176.9 million in short positions have been obliterated, casting a positive glow across the cryptocurrency sphere.

Its native token, HYPE, has catapulted beyond $55, boasting an astonishing increase of over 1,200% since its lows late last year. Growing market interest in its upcoming stablecoin, USDH, has energized its community and sparked institutional interest. Should current trends continue, Hyperliquid could pull in substantial liquidity following Bitcoin's markups, solidifying its position as a formidable force in the altcoin sphere.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE: A Potential Power Player\nMAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly become a hot topic among investors as the halving looms. With a model driven by scarcity and a commitment to community governance, it offers enticing investment potential. Perceived as undervalued, significant whale buying suggests a burgeoning confidence in this asset. Analysts speculate that MAGACOIN FINANCE could yield an eye-popping 100X return, particularly as momentum builds leading up to this transformative halving event.\nThe Altseason Phenomenon Explained\nHistorically, altcoin seasons follow Bitcoin\u2019s significant price shifts. When Bitcoin dominates headlines and climbs the charts, investors typically seek to diversify by exploring altcoins that present higher risk yet potentially greater rewards. In this cycle, with Bitcoin rumored to be on a trajectory toward $250K, newly emerging altcoins like Hyperliquid and MAGACOIN FINANCE are well-positioned to outpace their competitors, promising even more substantial returns. Their innovative concepts and unique advantages position them wisely to attract capital as investors pursue the next breakout.\nConclusion\nAs we stand at the precipice of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the possibilities for both Bitcoin itself and the altcoin market are immense. An exhilarating wave of short liquidations boosts investor sentiment, with promising tokens like Hyperliquid and MAGACOIN FINANCE stealing the limelight. Yet, as the crypto realm readies itself for this watershed moment, savvy investors should not only chase speculative gains but also cultivate resilient operational strategies.

This marks a significant milestone for Poland\u2019s financial market. The Bitcoin BETA ETF offers Polish investors an easy, regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin.\nWarsaw Exchange Launches Bitcoin Futures ETF\nThe Bitcoin BETA ETF tracks Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), one of the leading crypto futures platforms. Managed by AgioFunds TFI SA, the ETF provides exposure to Bitcoin through futures contracts instead of direct ownership of the cryptocurrency. This structure offers a safer route to invest in digital assets while avoiding the volatility of direct Bitcoin ownership.\nTo protect against currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Polish zloty, the ETF incorporates an FX hedge. This strategy uses forward contracts to manage currency risks. It is the first ETF on the Warsaw Stock Exchange to combine cryptocurrency exposure with built-in currency risk management.\nExpanding ETF Market in Poland\nThe launch of the Bitcoin BETA ETF strengthens the growing ETF market in Poland. The Warsaw Stock Exchange now hosts 16 ETFs, covering both local and global indexes. These include the WIG20, mWIG40, S&P 500, and Nasdaq-100, among others.\nETF trading on the GPW has surged, reaching PLN 1.9 billion in turnover so far this year. This marks a 94.2% increase compared to last year. As the market expands, more investors are drawn to this asset class, driven by transparency and ease of access.\nThe Bitcoin BETA ETF launch was approved by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) on June 17, 2025. AgioFunds TFI then issued two series of investment certificates (A and B). The market maker for the ETF is Dom Maklerski Banku Ochrony \u015arodowiska S.A., ensuring liquidity and stability."

The fund offers exposure to five major digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) through traditional market channels.\nThe approval utilizes new generic listing standards designed to accelerate crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) reviews across Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX exchanges. This streamlined process eliminates individual application assessments, significantly speeding approval timelines for future products.\nCEO Peter Mintzberg announced the approval, thanking the SEC Crypto Task Force for regulatory clarity efforts.\nThe fund currently holds over $915 million in assets under management with a $57.7 net asset value per share. This substantial size demonstrates existing investor appetite for multi-asset cryptocurrency products within traditional investment frameworks.\nThe Future of Crypto ETFs\nThe SEC Crypto Task Force, established by acting Chair Mark Uyeda under Commissioner Hester Peirce's leadership, represents a significant shift from previous enforcement-heavy approaches. The task force focuses on developing clear regulatory frameworks rather than pursuing litigation strategies.\nBloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas predicts over 100 crypto ETFs could launch within 12 months following generic listing standards implementation. Previous ETF category implementations showed tripling of product launches, suggesting massive expansion potential.\nThe approval coincides with growing expectations for altseason, where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform BTC. Coinbase predicted full-scale altcoin season beginning in September based on historical chart patterns and market conditions.\nChair Paul Atkins emphasized maximizing investor choice and fostering innovation through streamlined listing processes. The development reduces barriers to digital asset access within America's trusted capital markets, potentially attracting billions in new institutional investment.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).

                "body": "Grayscale, one of the largest crypto asset managers in the United States, is moving to stake over 40,000 Ethereum (ETH), according to fresh on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence.\nThis is a historic step for Grayscale as it becomes the first U.S. Ethereum ETF issuer to stake its holdings.\nThe move has sparked speculation across the crypto industry, with analysts suggesting that Grayscale may be preparing for a potential shift in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) stance on staking and how it classifies such activities.\nEarlier this year, the SEC delayed its decision on whether Grayscale funds could incorporate Ethereum staking.\nDespite filing proposals to enable staking, Grayscale has yet to secure SEC approval.\nHowever, the latest move suggests that Grayscale may be positioning ahead of an eventual ruling, especially given that no existing spot Ether ETFs currently offer staking options.\nHere are 3 key things you need to know about the SEC regulatory development on staking.\n1. SEC Liquid Staking Guidance Eases Regulatory Uncertainty\nOn August 5, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance issued a staff statement clarifying its view on liquid staking activities.\nIt held that, in many cases, liquid staking services, where users stake ETH (or other proof-of-stake assets) via a protocol or provider and receive staking receipt tokens, do not constitute securities under U.S. law, provided certain conditions are met.\nThe SEC executives made it clear that the receipt tokens (staking receipt tokens) are merely evidence of ownership of the underlying staked assets and rewards, not investment contracts.\nAs long as the liquid staking provider does not guarantee returns or exercise discretionary control over staking decisions.\nSam Kim, Chief Legal Officer of Lido Labs Foundation, added that the \u201cSEC guidance confirming that liquid staking and receipt tokens like stETH do not constitute securities provides the much-needed guidance that Lido and the wider industry have needed.\u201d\nThis guidance is important because it removes one major structural barrier for staking becoming more widely embraced by institutional actors.\n2. Ethereum\u2019s 45-Day Unstaking Queue: Security vs. User Experience\nA growing concern among users and institutional stakeholders is the 45-day exit queue for unstaking ETH.\nThis delay means that when a validator or staker opts to exit, it takes up to 45 days for their ETH to be unlocked and returned.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently defended this design, arguing that the long exit period is vital for network security."

                "body": "Ethereum is starting to get some serious attention from institutional investors, and it seems like the days of Bitcoin being the only game in town are over. The recent surge in ETF inflows for Ethereum has been nothing short of phenomenal. On September 18, 2025, Ethereum's ETFs raked in $213 million in net inflows, putting Bitcoin's $163 million to shame. This is a huge moment for Ethereum and a sign that we're entering a new chapter in the cryptocurrency world.\nThe Rise of ETFs\nIf you're not familiar with them, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are a way for both institutional and retail investors to get into cryptocurrencies without actually owning them. The recent inflow numbers show that more people are willing to put their money into these digital assets. It's no longer just a trend; it's becoming a standard part of the financial landscape. And now, with Ethereum rising in popularity, it seems like it's going to be a big player.\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\nThe age-old rivalry between Ethereum and Bitcoin is heating up. For a long time, Bitcoin was the king, but Ethereum's technical advancements and its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) have caught the eye of many institutional investors. It's clear now that Ethereum is not just another cryptocurrency; it\u2019s becoming a core part of a new financial system. The inflow numbers reflect that.\nInstitutional Interest\nThis surge in institutional money isn't just a flash in the pan; it's a sign that cryptocurrencies are becoming legitimate assets in the eyes of big investors. These guys are looking for safe, regulated ways to invest in this space, and they're finding it in Ethereum. This could mean better liquidity and stability for Ethereum, which is something everyone can get behind.\nCrypto Payroll: The Next Big Thing?\nOne of the most interesting trends emerging from all this is the adoption of crypto payroll solutions. Companies, especially small and medium-sized firms, are starting to pay their employees in crypto. Why? Because it allows for faster cross-border payments and cuts down on transaction fees. By using stablecoins and blockchain, companies can pay their employees in different parts of the world without the usual banking headaches.\nThis is particularly appealing to tech-savvy workers or freelancers who would rather receive their salary in crypto. As more companies jump on board, the demand for crypto payroll services is likely to rise, which means the worlds of crypto and traditional finance are becoming even more intertwined.\nEthereum's Role in DeFi\nEthereum isn\u2019t just a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s also a key player in the DeFi movement. Thanks to its smart contracts, a whole new world of financial products and services is opening up. As institutional interest grows, so will the acceptance of DeFi applications.\nExpect to see more Ethereum in various financial services as more people recognize its potential. This could lead to a financial system that\u2019s a bit more accessible, where anyone can get financial services without having to go through traditional banks.\nWhat's Next for Cryptocurrency?\nLooking forward, the trends surrounding Ethereum's ETF inflows and crypto payroll solutions will likely continue to evolve. As regulations become clearer and technology improves, more investors will probably want a piece of the Ethereum pie. The acceptance of digital assets in traditional finance could lead to new financial products designed for a wider range of investors.\nAs companies increasingly adopt crypto payroll solutions, the demand for platforms and compliance services will surge. Expect new startups to emerge, focusing on helping businesses navigate the increasingly complex world of crypto payments.\nSummary\nThere you have it. Ethereum's recent ETF inflows are changing the game, signaling a new era of institutional interest and market dynamics. As businesses warm up to crypto payroll solutions, we're seeing digital assets becoming a part of everyday financial operations. For investors an"

At the same time, Dogecoin has dropped by 0.41% to reach $0.2815, while $XRP is changing hands at $3.08.\nSEC\u2019s Calmed ETF Stance Fails to Trigger Market Shift Irrespective of Institutional Speculation\nBased on the market data, irrespective of the calming approach of the US SEC toward the ETPs, the major cryptocurrencies are presenting a dip in the \u201cbull vs bear\u201d showdown. Hence, the green light given by the SEC on the listing standards regarding crypto exchange-traded products has triggered speculation about a potential rise in institutional adoption. Under the Trump administration, this development likely decreases the barriers for entities to release crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nNonetheless, despite such a positive development, the weir cryptocurrency sphere appears to be unmoved in the short term. Specifically, a 21% decline has occurred in trading volumes across prominent exchanges over the past 24 hours. Additionally, liquidations have reached the $250 million mark throughout the market.\n$ETH, $DOGE, and $XRP Stand in Holding Pattern While $BTC Anticipated to Plunge to $112K Before Rise to $130K\nThus, the overall sentiment in the crypto market is \u201cNeutral.\u201d This points out that the industry is currently going through prevailing uncertainty. Additionally, the investors are keenly watching for an optimistic response from the key crypto assets like $BTC, $ETH, $DOGE, and $XRP to the latest positive regulatory shift.\nAt the moment, Bitcoin ($BTC), Ethereum ($ETH), Dogecoin ($DOGE), and $XRP seem locked in an apparent holding pattern. In this respect, the analysts expect $BTC to drop to $112K before a surge to $130K. However, whether the current scenario paves the way for the next spark remains to be seen as time passes."

This transformation follows an oversubscribed $300 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing round led by Pulsar Group with participation from prominent investors including the Solana Foundation, RockawayX, and ARK Invest. The substantial financial backing signals strong institutional confidence in Solana\u2019s ecosystem and the UAE\u2019s growing role in digital asset infrastructure.\nThe company has appointed Marco Santori, former Chief Legal Officer at major cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, as its new CEO. Santori\u2019s extensive experience in the crypto legal and regulatory landscape positions Solmate to navigate the complex regulatory environment while expanding its operations. The leadership change underscores the company\u2019s strategic shift from its previous focus on social impact football businesses to becoming a significant player in blockchain infrastructure development.\nSolmate plans to deploy its newly acquired capital into revenue-generating crypto infrastructure projects in the United Arab Emirates, specifically focusing on bare metal servers in Abu Dhabi designed to enhance Solana validator performance. This infrastructure investment aims to strengthen Solana\u2019s network reliability and performance while supporting the UAE\u2019s broader digital transformation initiatives. The strategic location in Abu Dhabi provides access to growing Middle Eastern markets and aligns with the region\u2019s increasing adoption of blockchain technologies.\nThe involvement of major blockchain and investment firms, particularly the Solana Foundation\u2019s participation, indicates a coordinated effort to accelerate Solana adoption across institutional markets, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This backing from established players in the cryptocurrency space provides Solmate with both financial resources and industry expertise to execute its ambitious infrastructure plans. The company\u2019s transformation represents a notable example of traditional businesses pivoting to capitalize on the growing digital asset ecosystem.\nThis rebranding and funding announcement comes at a time when the UAE is actively positioning itself as a global hub for digital assets and blockchain innovation. Solmate\u2019s infrastructure investments could significantly contribute to the region\u2019s technological development while providing essential services to the expanding Solana ecosystem. The company\u2019s strategic focus on revenue-generating infrastructure projects suggests a sustainable business model rather than speculative cryptocurrency investments, potentially offering more stable returns for investors.\nThis news story relied on content distributed by NewMediaWire.

I think in part because of how slow regulation was to catch up.\u201d\nThe Solana CEO agreed that it was \u201cannoying\u201d memecoins and NFTs have come out so successfully over its \u201ctrue mission.\u201d\nWhen asked whether established regulated organisations that have begun to explore the world of blockchain are benefiting from their compliance-first background, Yakovenko acknowledged both advantages and limitations.\n\u201cThis is the big challenge,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe advantage that we have [at Solana] is that we are very nimble and we can operate everywhere in the world.\u201d\nHowever, the advantage of these compared to traditional corporations is \u201cthat they\u2019re already regulated.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re already operating with those assets that we want on-chain in the U.S. but they don\u2019t have global availability,\u201d he added.\n\u201cNASDAQ is still in its little sandbox.\u201d\nYakovenko argued that a breakthrough moment will come once regulators allow public-key cryptography to be used directly for transferring and managing assets.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the interface that you can wrap around and start moving anything from inside NASDAQ to Solana and vice versa,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cOnce that interface exists I think the genie\u2019s out of the bottle \u2026 the toothpaste is out of the tube.\u201d\nDespite tensions between crypto projects and traditional finance, Yakovenko says cooperation is already underway.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said when asked whether Solana has engaged with major financial players.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked to folks across the spectrum from banks to regulated exchanges and regulators themselves,\u201d he added.\nYakovenko framed Solana as infrastructure rather than an institution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an email standard.

I can\u2019t stop it if I wanted to,\u201d he explained.\nThis, in his view, makes it inevitable that established exchanges will eventually integrate with Solana rather than compete with it.\n\u201cIf the protocol is awesome and globally synchronous and super fast, NASDAQ would make more money by just running a Solana node and integrating with it more directly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s ultimately a win-win. We\u2019re never going to build an exchange that is onboarding U.S. institutionals and serving U.S. customers,\u201d Yakoveno said. \u201cWe want NASDAQ to do that and to run it on Solana, and that would be great.\u201d\nYakavenko has consistently spoken out against the memecoin industry, despite the immense revenue it brings to Solana.\nDuring a debate with Base founder Jesse Pollak in July, Yakavenko claimed memecoins and NFTs have zero fundamental value.\nI\u2019ve said this for years.

                "body": "US stock market today hits record after $15 trillion rally as Trump signals US-China trade deal: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise and Russell 2000 shines\nSynopsis\nUS stock markets edged higher on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq extending their recent record-setting streaks. Investors focused on a high-profile call between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, amid fresh optimism over the TikTok deal and potential progress in the long-running US-China trade negotiations. Russell 2000 small-cap index notably shining as it reached a fresh record.\nPresident Trump indicated progress in US-China trade negotiations, boosting investor confidence in multinational companies and exporters. While details are still emerging, markets interpreted the signals as positive, raising hopes for a resolution that could ease tariffs and reduce global supply chain uncertainty.\nThe US president described the conversation as productive, noting progress on trade, fentanyl, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the approval of the TikTok deal. While Trump indicated that a full trade agreement may not be finalized immediately, he suggested the current tariff truce could be extended under \u201cpretty good terms.\u201d\nA potential trade breakthrough could support corporate earnings and long-term investor sentiment. Companies exposed to international trade, especially tech and manufacturing, may see improved profitability if a deal reduces barriers or regulatory risks.\nCurrently, small-cap stocks generally offer higher growth potential compared to large-cap stocks but come with greater volatility and risk. Small caps typically represent younger, less mature companies with market capitalizations between $300 million and $2 billion, often operating in emerging or rapidly growing industries. Because of their smaller size, they can grow revenues and profits faster, thus providing investors with the possibility of higher returns.\nIn contrast, large-cap stocks, which include well-established companies with market caps above $10 billion, tend to be more stable and less volatile. They often operate in mature industries, have stronger balance sheets, and may pay dividends, offering more reliable profits but slower growth. Large-cap companies benefit from more market liquidity, extensive research coverage, and broader investor interest.\nIn 2025, small caps have been showing stronger performance in sectors like specialty chemicals, renewable tech, and capital goods due to improved domestic demand and lower inflation, but with sharper price swings. Meanwhile, large caps have shown steadier but modest gains, favored for their stability amid global uncertainties and monetary policy impacts.\nBridgewater founder Ray Dalio highlighted risks to the US monetary system amid rising debt, recommending 10% portfolio allocations in gold and other non-fiat assets. Meanwhile, President Trump is considering a $550 billion fund to boost domestic manufacturing, prioritizing sectors like semiconductors and critical minerals.\nDow, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise as tech and small caps lead\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 98 points higher, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 also gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite, buoyed by strong technology sector gains, advanced 0.3%. Small-cap stocks shone, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.1% to hit a record closing high, extending a seven-week winning streak and underscoring the resilience of domestic-focused companies.Apple led tech gains, jumping 1.4% on the global rollout of its latest iPhone.\nTesla shares rose 2%, reflecting investor optimism in high-growth sectors.\nTikTok deal and Oracle\u2019s role\nThe TikTok agreement involves a consortium of investors\u2014including Oracle (ORCL), Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz\u2014taking an 80% stake in the company. Oracle would manage US user data on its Texas servers, keeping TikTok operational in the US despite potential regulatory restrictions.Oracle shares rose 1.88% on Friday, marking a 28% ga"

The Dow Jones is up 0.27%, while the Nasdaq has gained 0.94%, and the S&P 500 is up 0.48%.\nThe upswing helped these indices reach their highest numbers ever, and even the small cap Russell 2000 index surged 2.5% to hit its first record high in 24 years. The expectation that a new interest rate cut would help boost the market, at least temporarily, has proven powerfully true.\nMore Than a Rate Cut at Work\nIt is not just the Fed rate cut that is helping these stock indices and individual stocks achieve record highs, though. Investors should realize that powerful earnings have helped the market get where it is today, as a large number of companies have reported exceptional earnings over the past few weeks. Just recently, some of the top movers in the stock market reported their quarterly earnings.\nMany but not all surpassed expectations. Tesla (TSLA) was one of the few that fell short on its quarterly report after disappointing sales had been announced several times in the last quarter, but the company has since recovered and seeing its stock surge to tremendous highs.\nAlphabet (GGOGL) surpassed expectations and has continued to climb higher in the last few weeks. The company is coming out on top of its long-running lawsuit with the U.S. government and has been able to keep many of its top assets despite allegations of antitrust behavior.\nMeta Platforms (META) reported a 36% profit for the last quarter, but Facebook\u2019s parent company expects that in 2026, their expenses will outpace their earnings as they invest heavily in AI.\nApple (APPL) saw a 10% growth in revenue compared to the previous year, and despite a soft product launch of the new iPhone, their stock is on the upward trend as well. These are just a few of the stocks that are entering or achieving record highs right now and helping to push the stock indices to their highest numbers ever.\n- Check out our free forex signals\n- Follow the top economic events on FX Leaders economic calendar\n- Trade better, discover more Forex Trading Strategies\n- Open a FREE Trading Account"

Despite US labour concerns, growth hopes remain firm, with investors favouring defensives and betting on a soft landing.\nEurope\u2019s equity outlook is getting a fresh dose of optimism from fund managers, buoyed by receding trade tensions, easing inflation fears, and expectations of further central bank support.\nAccording to the latest Bank of America European Fund Manager Survey, released earlier this week, investors are increasingly positioning for a soft economic landing, with growing belief that global monetary easing, particularly from the US Federal Reserve, will help offset slowing economic momentum in key markets.\nWhile concern around the weakening US labour market has jumped \u2014 now ranked the number one downside risk by 59% of European investors \u2014 that hasn\u2019t derailed broader growth expectations.\nOnly 44% expect a slowdown in the US, the lowest reading since February. Meanwhile, expectations for a reacceleration in US growth have hit a 17-month high.\nHype around Europe\u2019s exceptionalism softens\nThe view of \"EU exceptionalism\", which had gained traction after President Donald Trump announced sweeping trade tariffs earlier this year, has now moderated. Still, confidence in European companies\u2019 growth potential remains robust.\nThe net overweight on European equities in global portfolios declined to 15%, from a peak of 41% in July, as confidence in Europe\u2019s ability to outperform the US has been tested by enduring concerns over political instability and underwhelming earnings growth.\nYet absolute sentiment on European equities has improved markedly. A net 37% of respondents expect upside in the near term, up from 15% last month. Some 52% now forecast mild gains in the coming months, while just 15% see downside risk, the lowest since February.\nUnderpinning this confidence is a belief that earnings upgrades will continue. Indeed, 70% of European fund managers cite stronger earnings as the most likely driver of equity gains, while just 26% view earnings downgrades as the primary risk for a market correction.\nStagflation worries ease\nThe prevailing macro outlook among respondents is still one of a \u201csoft, but stagflationary\u201d landing. However, the share of investors expecting stagflation fell to 41% from 58% last month.\nMore investors are now betting on a benign decline in inflation, while expectations of a global recession have continued to moderate.\nOnly 16% of global fund managers now expect a slowdown, down sharply from 41% in August, while 67% see a soft landing as the most probable outcome.\nInvestors increasingly view German fiscal expansion (cited by 74%) as the key driver of any European growth acceleration, far ahead of China stimulus or ECB policy. At the same time, 52% believe tariff risks are now largely priced in, while concerns over a global trade war have slipped in importance.\nStill, tail risks remain.\nThe most cited concerns for the months ahead are a second inflation wave (26%) and fears that the US Federal Reserve may lose its independence, potentially fuelling dollar weakening (24%).\nThe bearish dollar sentiment is nearing historic highs, with a net 47% of global managers expecting the greenback to weaken over the coming year.\nRisk appetite\nDespite the upbeat outlook for earnings, European investors are beginning to question their positioning.\nThe share worried about lacking defensive (more stable) exposure (19%) has risen sharply, far outweighing those concerned about missing out on cyclical (more volatile) upside (4%). That's the widest gap in two years.\nHealthcare has overtaken financials as the most favoured sector for the next twelve months, with industrials, utilities, and construction also enjoying overweight positions.\nBanks remain attractive to some, with 37% still positive on the sector, but enthusiasm has cooled from 58% in August.

Article no 1793\nThe U.S. stock markets closed higher with all three major indexes posting gains today, September 19, amid optimism from the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent rate cut and positive developments around a potential TikTok deal involving U.S. and Chinese leadership. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% (about 129 points), closing above 46,300 for the first time. The S&P 500 gained 0.5%, surpassing the 6,600 mark to finish around 6,669 points.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 0.7%, reaching fresh all-time highs near 24,626 points. This positive performance followed the Federal Reserve\u2019s first rate cut of 2025 and was supported by strong corporate earnings and progress in U.S.-China trade relations. Major tech and consumer discretionary stocks like Apple, Tesla, and Oracle contributed strongly to the market\u2019s advance.\nThe indexes also ended the week on track for their third consecutive weekly gains, with the S&P 500 up about 0.8%, the Dow up 1%, and the Nasdaq up 1.5% for the week.\nInvestor confidence was bolstered by the Fed\u2019s 25 basis point interest rate cut announced a day earlier, signaling more easing this year, aimed at supporting economic recovery amid a softening labor market. Additionally, attention on an upcoming meeting between U.S. and Chinese leaders about TikTok\u2019s status created some positive market sentiment.\nRead also : Tax Management strategies for Digital Nomads\nNotably, tech stocks including Intel and Nvidia saw significant movement, with Intel rising strongly after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment partnership. The small-cap Russell 2000 index also reached a new all-time high during this period, reflecting optimism about growth prospects for smaller companies benefiting from lower rates.\nGold prices rose notably on September 19. Gold futures traded around $3,680 per ounce, marking an increase of about 1% compared to the previous day. Throughout the month, gold showed a strong upward trend with a rise of approximately 10%, and year-to-date, gold was up about 40%, driven by the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut and geopolitical uncertainties supporting gold\u2019s safe-haven appeal.\nRead also : Gold : Build Your Wealth and Freedom\nRegarding silver, it also experienced gains on the same day. Silver prices rose by approximately 2.8%, trading near $43 per ounce.

Apple (AAPL) jumped 2% as the iPhone 17 hit global shelves, boosting the Nasdaq\u2019s outperformance. Tesla (TSLA) added 1.5%, extending momentum following upgrades and bullish price target hikes. Semiconductor stocks were volatile after Nvidia (NVDA) finalized a $5 billion stake in Intel (INTC). Intel soared 22% on Thursday, only to slip 1.65% Friday to $30.07 after Citi downgraded the stock to Sell, citing doubts about Intel\u2019s foundry competitiveness.

Kennedy Jr. appointed skeptics of vaccine safety like himself to a government panel that recommends who should get the shots. | Brynn Anderson/AP Photo\nBoth public health advocates and vaccine skeptics have one thing in common after a much-anticipated meeting of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s vaccine advisers ended on Friday: Surprise.\nThe panel\u2019s recommendations, to stop encouraging Covid vaccination while retaining access, and to stop offering one of two options for chickenpox shots, were neither as dire as the advocates feared, or as far-reaching as the skeptics expected. The advisers tabled for now a proposal to delay vaccination for hepatitis B.\nThe guidance left doctors and public health experts confused \u2014 it\u2019s not clear whether it means younger, healthy people will need prescriptions for Covid shots \u2014 and seeking clarity. It left Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine allies pledging to ramp up their lobbying to convince the government to go further. On Capitol Hill, it left the tense standoff between Democrats irate about Kennedy\u2019s policies and Republicans divided over them in a holding pattern.\n\u201cWe must ensure that any vaccine recommendation protects patient choice and never takes away families\u2019 access to safe, effective vaccines,\u201d Senate Health Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Kennedy\u2019s biggest GOP critic on Capitol Hill, said in a statement. Cassidy had called on Kennedy to cancel the meeting of the outside panel because he feared some of Kennedy\u2019s appointees were unqualified and biased against vaccines. But he expressed relief that the panel hadn\u2019t changed current guidance that newborns receive a hepatitis B vaccine on the first day of life.\nSpeaking to reporters after the panel\u2019s last vote, President Donald Trump touted his Operation Warp Speed that helped develop the vaccines in 2020 and said he was a proponent of Covid vaccination. \u201cI had the vaccine. I was very happy with it,\u201d he said, adding that he nonetheless trusted Kennedy: \u201cI put him in there because I want to have opposite views.\u201d\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices advises the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who must sign off on its recommendations before they take effect.\nPublic health advocates warned that Kennedy\u2019s firing of the panel\u2019s advisers and appointment of new ones, many skeptical of vaccine safety and inexperienced in the workings of the committee, were likely increasing Americans\u2019 reticence about the shots.\nSome of the panelists raised concerns about vaccine safety and disputed information presented by CDC staff about the safety and efficacy of the shots.\n\u201cThe reckless actions of this committee are causing damage in real time,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, a professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus and Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado who\u2019s followed ACIP meetings for a decade.\nO\u2019Leary, also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said a primary care colleague of his had seen a parent refuse the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine because of what she heard \u201cabout this committee showing fear about an issue that was settled literally over 15 years ago,\u201d O\u2019Leary told reporters Friday. The committee took no action on that shot, but did recommend that patients no longer be offered a measles shot that also provides protection against chickenpox.\nIf the recommendation is adopted, children would have to get the chickenpox shot separately, as 85 percent of kids already do.\nIn a surprise move, the panel voted against recommending that states require patients get a prescription for Covid shots, after an initial deadlock. They also voted to remove a blanket recommendation for adults 65 and older to vaccinate against Covid.\nAbout 23 percent "

                "body": "The Trump administration and Republicans have launched headlong into a broad overhaul of the American vaccine system \u2013 despite it being an overhaul that very few Americans seem to actually want.\nAnd there are increasing signs that it\u2019s taken a political toll on the man behind it: US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nFor the past few years, Kennedy\u2019s image numbers have proven remarkably resilient. Even as he espoused debunked claims about vaccines and science and moved from Democratic presidential candidate to independent to endorsing and serving under President Donald Trump, Americans as a whole have often liked him more than they\u2019ve disliked him.\nWhether that\u2019s because of the Kennedy name or anything else, it\u2019s enabled him to obtain significant political power.\nBut his level of public support appears to be changing, which could also be a bad sign for the man he serves, President Donald Trump, and could give the administration pause about truly turning him loose on vaccines.\nRecent polling now shows Kennedy\u2019s numbers are significantly underwater for his performance so far. And perhaps more significantly, very few Americans seem to have strongly favorable feelings toward him or trust him on vaccines.\nA Washington Post-Ipsos poll released Friday showed Americans disapproved of Kennedy\u2019s job performance 55%-42%.\nPolitical independents were even more negative, disapproving 61-34%. And even 21% of Republicans disapproved.\nThe poll also showed 38% of US adults strongly disapproved of Kennedy, compared to just 15% who strongly approved. So, strongly negative views more than doubled strongly positive ones.\nThe survey echoes a CBS News-YouGov poll from late August and early September that also showed Americans disapproved of Kennedy by double digits, 55-45%. Similar to the Washington Post poll, independents disapproved 61-39%, and even 20% of Republicans disapproved.\nAbout the only other time Kennedy\u2019s image numbers have been this bad was when he was running for president as an independent in mid-2024 \u2013 after he ditched the Democratic Party and was looking like he could potentially siphon votes from Trump. After his endorsement of Trump, his numbers recovered.\nAnd it\u2019s very difficult to divorce his newly negative numbers from his vaccine moves.\nPolls have shown that Americans have generally liked the ideas behind his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative \u2013 things like healthy eating and targeting processed foods \u2013 but they are on a very different page when it comes to vaccines.\nThe CBS poll showed 70% of Americans said the US government\u2019s policy should be to encourage parents to vaccinate their children \u201cfor diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella.\u201d A panel that Kennedy has restocked with his own picks, some of whom have made unproven claims about vaccines, voted this week to stop recommending the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine to children under age 4. (The same panel voted unanimously Friday to shift away from a broad recommendation for Covid-19 vaccines to say that people who want one must consult with a health care provider.)\nAnd about 80% of parents in a September KFF poll said public schools should require students to get the measles and polio vaccines, with some exceptions.\nVaccine skepticism has clearly grown on the right in recent years, but Americans as a whole continue to be very pro-vaccine.\nAnd Americans also seem to have little faith in Kennedy\u2019s leadership on this subject.\nA July KFF poll showed 63% of Americans had \u201cnot much\u201d or no confidence in Kennedy to provide reliable information about vaccines.\nJust 10% expressed a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of confidence.\nThe poll also showed significantly more people thought Kennedy\u2019s vaccine moves were making Americans less safe (36%) rather than safer (20%). More than 4 in 10 Americans picked neither option.\nWhat those numbers suggest: Many Americans appear to have been slow to tune in on his moves at HHS.\nBut that appears to be changing am"

                "body": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine panel on Friday weakened Covid shot recommendations in the U.S., advising that all Americans consult a health-care provider before deciding whether to receive the vaccine.\nThe 12-member panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that people 6 months and up receive vaccines based on so-called \"shared clinical decision-making,\" which refers to a decision process between a health-care provider and a patient or their guardian. The group also voted to emphasize that for those under 65, the Covid vaccine is most beneficial for those at high risk of severe illness from the disease.\nThe guidance breaks from previous years, where the committee recommended that all Americans ages 6 months and up receive an updated Covid shot.\nWhile ACIP did not restrict the use of the Covid vaccine, the panel's softer recommendation may further confuse Americans about whether to take a shot and make it more difficult for them to access one. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost.\nThe panel's chair, Martin Kulldorff, said it was his understanding that the new recommendation means that government-run insurance plans will still cover Covid vaccines. But it's unclear if all private health plans will maintain coverage of the shots.\nThe CDC, whose latest director was ousted by the Trump administration earlier this month, still has to adopt the panel's recommendations.\nThe vote is no surprise, as Kennedy appointed several vocal critics of mRNA Covid shots to the panel after ousting all previous members in June. During the meeting Friday, some members cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of Covid shots and mRNA technology, and questioned the reliability of data on hospitalization rates due to the virus.\nIt also follows Kennedy's other recent moves to change U.S. Covid vaccine policy, which have created new hurdles for some people to access vaccines, including prescription requirements in certain states. The CDC dropped Covid shot recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women, and the Food and Drug Administration approved new Covid jabs with limits on who can get them.\nThe ability to get vaccines may vary by state: In a break from federal guidelines, four Democratic states on Wednesday recommended that broad swaths of the population receive an updated Covid shot, including \"all who choose protection.\" Still, the new recommendations could weaken vaccination rates against the virus and heighten the threat of the disease spreading.\nA study published Thursday in JAMA Network Open showed that sticking to a universal Covid vaccine recommendation in the U.S., the guidance that has been in place in recent years, has the potential to prevent thousands more hospitalizations and deaths than limiting the advisory to high-risk groups.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nIn a statement Friday, Pfizer said the company and its partner BioNTech \"remain steadfast in our dedication to vaccine safety, quality and effectiveness through constant safety monitoring and ongoing research.''\nOne major health insurance group on Wednesday said its member plans will cover all vaccines already recommended by ACIP, including updated Covid and flu shots, despite any changes the new slate of appointees makes this week. Member plans of the group, America's Health Insurance Plans, collectively provide coverage and services to over 200 million Americans. That includes more than a dozen Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, Centene, CVS' Aetna, Elevance Health, Humana, Kaiser Permanente, M"

        "market_summary": "The Bank of Japan's decision to hold rates was accompanied by a surprisingly hawkish move to begin selling its massive ETF holdings, causing the Nikkei 225 to reverse from record highs into losses. The announcement, which included two dissenting votes for a rate hike, prompted a sharp rise in short-term government bond yields and a brief strengthening of the yen. Markets are interpreting the balance sheet reduction as a sign of a less accommodative policy stance, increasing bets on a potential rate hike later this year.\nSENTIMENT: Mixed\n\n**Overall Market Sentiment:** Mixed",

Benchmark 30-year JGBs had yet to trade following the BOJ's announcement.\n\"Initial market reactions suggest that short- and medium-term yields may now be more susceptible to upward pressure, as investors translate the reduction of risk-asset purchases into heightened expectations of future rate increases,\" said Shoki Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n\"By contrast, yields at the long and super-long end of the curve should remain more insulated, their behaviour being driven primarily by changes in the term premium.\"\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

                "body": "USD/JPY: Yen Gains Against Dollar as Bank of Japan Keeps Rates Steady, Plans Big ETF Sales\n2 min read\nKey points:\n- Yen climbs against greenback\n- Markets digest BoJ ETF plans\n- Rate hold comes after Fed\u2019s cut\nNo surprises on rate decision. But the bank\u2019s move to start unloading its balance sheet shocked Japanese stocks and sent the yen higher\u2026 briefly.\n\ud83d\udcaa Yen Strenghtens on BoJ Plans\n- The USDJPY pair shifted lower early Friday after the Bank of Japan said it\u2019s keeping interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. The move was widely expected as Japan continues to struggle to get its economy off the ground.\n- While there wasn\u2019t any talk of rate hikes (something many are secretly hoping for), Japan\u2019s central bank said it\u2019s planning to start unloading big chunks of the exchange-traded funds it's holding on its balance sheet.\n- How much exactly? About \u00a5335 billion ($2.4 billion) of ETFs and real estate investment trusts (REITs) a year. The BoJ has been purchasing ETFs and REITs for about 15 years as a way to ease its monetary policy and beat deflation. The book value of these holdings on the balance sheet is currently at \u00a537.1 trillion ($250 billion).\n\ud83d\udc40 Reactions Across the Board\n- The Japanese yen initially shot higher, sending the dollar-yen lower by 0.3% to \u00a5147.20. The pump was short-lived and before the European session kicked off the pair was back near breakeven for the day.\n- Japanese stocks immediately dropped when the news got out with the Nikkei 225 NIKKEI sliding more than 1.6% for the day.\n- Apparently, the shock reaction was more or less contained. The Bank of Japan has long been expected to do something about its ultra-loose monetary policy. If policymakers are reluctant to hike rates, then unloading the balance sheet might be the next best thing? Not exactly.\n\ud83c\udf81 Time for a Fresh Perspective?\n- The plans to offload the balance sheet weren\u2019t supposed to happen right now. Some see this as a sign that members of the central bank committee are getting impatient and looking for ways to start unwinding the easy policies that have made the country go for decades.\n- In fact, two members voted to hike rates while seven members opted for a hold. The internal disagreement sparked speculation that the bank could be tilting toward a hike by the end of the year.\n- Analysts are quick to point out that the pressure to move is already there \u2013 at least two members will likely vote for the hike at the next meeting.\n- The BoJ\u2019s rate decision came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Wednesday and after the Bank of England kept rates steady Thursday with two dissenting voices wanting a cut."
