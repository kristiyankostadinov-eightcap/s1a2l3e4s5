                "body": "Gold\u2019s bubble behaviour may signal paradigm shift\nBy Edward Chancellor\nAssets that rise rapidly above their long-term trend are usually set for a fall. That\u2019s what happened to gold after it peaked in late 1979. Over the following five years, the price of the yellow metal fell by nearly two-thirds. This year, gold has risen more than 60% in dollar terms, its best performance in 46 years. Adjusted for inflation, gold has never been more expensive. Either we are witnessing another bubble or it\u2019s a paradigm shift.\nThe precious metal known as the eternal store of value has retained its purchasing power over millennia. On examination, its market valuation tends to reflect different monetary regimes. Gold reset higher following the credit collapse of the 1920s, and jumped in the second half of the 1970s as the so-called \u201cGreat Inflation\u201d took hold; over the next two decades it remained in the doldrums as price increases abated and real interest rates remained high; after Alan Greenspan\u2019s Federal Reserve slashed interest rates in the early 2000s, gold enjoyed a long bull run. During the era of zero interest rates and quantitative easing from 2008 to 2022 the price was volatile but its upward trend continued.\nBy the turn of this decade it had become received wisdom that gold moves inversely with long-term real interest rates. Thus its value swooned in 2022 when central banks tightened the cost of borrowing and bond yields climbed. Then something unexpected happened: gold started to rise exponentially even as inflation turned down and inflation-adjusted bond yields rose.\nDaniel Oliver of Myrmikan Capital, a firm that invests in microcap gold miners, says this regime shift was caused by then U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to seize Russian foreign exchange reserves following Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This act shook the foundations of the international monetary system in which the U.S. dollar had long served as lynchpin. Reserve managers at a number of central banks started looking for an asset that could not be seized and was not the liability of another sovereign. They returned to the original reserve asset: gold.\nDuring each of the past three years, central banks have purchased over a thousand of tonnes of bullion. Goldman Sachs expects these official purchases to continue into next year. A number of central banks in the emerging world still own relatively little gold. Earlier this year, for instance, China\u2019s reported holdings as a share of its total foreign exchange reserves stood at only 6.5%, although some analysts believe Beijing\u2019s official gold reserves massively understate the true size of its hoard.\nAt first glance, the gold chart over the past three years looks like a classic investment bubble. But the irrational exuberance that normally accompanies a mania is absent. Speculators are too busy obsessing about cryptocurrencies and anything related to artificial intelligence to pay much attention to the barbarous relic. The number of ounces of gold held in exchange-traded funds remains more than 10% below the October 2020 high, according to Caesar Bryan, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Gold Fund. Furthermore, the number of shares outstanding in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF, which invests in publicly traded companies involved in gold and silver mining, has fallen by around a third from the 2020 peak.\nBryan observes that Wall Street remains unenthusiastic about gold\u2019s prospects. The consensus gold price for 2028 projected by investment analysts is nearly $1,000 below the current spot price. The 1970s gold bull market was extremely volatile, with a number of painful drawdowns. Gold investors have been bracing for a correction, but until now every minor setback has quickly reversed. Bryan has witnessed many bull and bear markets over his four decades in the gold business, but, he says, \u201cit does feel different this time.\u201d\nThe monetary and fiscal background to the 1979 bubble and the current day could har"

Sanctioned Russia and Venezuela will use a non-U.S. firm, while Iran\u2019s baseline for 2027 will be determined by the average of its production in August, September, and October 2026, as assessed by the OPEC secondary sources, of which Argus is one.\nThe new mechanism for quota assessment may seem too technical, but it is apparently needed as OPEC+ has seen disputes over the quota assignments in recent years.\nFor example, some big OPEC producers, such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait, plan to raise their oil production capacity in the coming years. These countries have argued that they deserve higher baseline production levels as they expand capacity. The UAE, for example, has won a higher baseline for 2025 and 2026.\nOther disgruntled producers included now former member Angola, which quit OPEC as of January 2024 after 16 years in the cartel. The reason was a spat with the OPEC and OPEC+ members about production quotas. At a meeting in mid-2023, Angola and Nigeria were given lower crude oil production quotas as part of the OPEC+ agreement, after the two producers had underperformed and failed to pump to their quotas for years, due to a lack of investment in new fields and maturing older oilfields.\nReassessment to Boost Investment\nThe new mechanism to assess MSC and thus production quotas is a \u201cturning point\u201d in OPEC+ policy, Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said this week.\n\u201cNow we have the most detailed, the most technical, transparent approach of how we can move forward in the future in managing the market and how to attend to production,\u201d said the energy minister of the biggest OPEC+ producer and de facto OPEC leader.\nSaudi Arabia and the other major Gulf producers will be the key beneficiaries of the new mechanism as it is set to incentivize keeping high capacity levels or boosting production capacity, Reuters columnist Ron Bousso argues.\nIndeed, many of the Gulf OPEC producers have plans to raise capacity, while Saudi Arabia keeps a 12 million barrels per day (bpd) production capacity, with its current spare capacity at about 2 million bpd.\nEven as Saudi Arabia is tendering a massive 44 gigawatts (GW) capacity of renewable energy projects, it will maintain its oil-producing potential to ensure global energy security, officials from the Kingdom said last year.\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), one of OPEC\u2019s top producers, aims to increase its production capacity to 5 million bpd by 2027. Currently, capacity is about 4.8 million bpd.\n\u201cWe can "

Sanctioned Russia and Venezuela will use a non-U.S. firm, while Iran\u2019s baseline for 2027 will be determined by the average of its production in August, September, and October 2026, as assessed by the OPEC secondary sources, of which Argus is one.\nThe new mechanism for quota assessment may seem too technical, but it is apparently needed as OPEC+ has seen disputes over the quota assignments in recent years.\nFor example, some big OPEC producers, such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait, plan to raise their oil production capacity in the coming years. These countries have argued that they deserve higher baseline production levels as they expand capacity. The UAE, for example, has won a higher baseline for 2025 and 2026.\nOther disgruntled producers included now former member Angola, which quit OPEC as of January 2024 after 16 years in the cartel. The reason was a spat with the OPEC and OPEC+ members about production quotas. At a meeting in mid-2023, Angola and Nigeria were given lower crude oil production quotas as part of the OPEC+ agreement, after the two producers had underperformed and failed to pump to their quotas for years, due to a lack of investment in new fields and maturing older oilfields.\nReassessment to Boost Investment\nThe new mechanism to assess MSC and thus production quotas is a \u201cturning point\u201d in OPEC+ policy, Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said this week.\n\u201cNow we have the most detailed, the most technical, transparent approach of how we can move forward in the future in managing the market and how to attend to production,\u201d said the energy minister of the biggest OPEC+ producer and de facto OPEC leader.\nSaudi Arabia and the other major Gulf producers will be the key beneficiaries of the new mechanism as it is set to incentivize keeping high capacity levels or boosting production capacity, Reuters columnist Ron Bousso argues.\nIndeed, many of the Gulf OPEC producers have plans to raise capacity, while Saudi Arabia keeps a 12 million barrels per day (bpd) production capacity, with its current spare capacity at about 2 million bpd.\nEven as Saudi Arabia is tendering a massive 44 gigawatts (GW) capacity of renewable energy projects, it will maintain its oil-producing potential to ensure global energy security, officials from the Kingdom said last year.\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), one of OPEC\u2019s top producers, aims to increase its production capacity to 5 million bpd by 2027. Currently, capacity is about 4.8 million bpd.\n\u201cWe can "

                "body": "OPEC+ Extends Oil Output Strategy Through 2026: SENER\nMexico will maintain its current oil production commitments within the OPEC+ alliance through 2026, SENER announced following the 40th OPEC\u2013non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting held on Nov. 30. Minister of Energy Luz Elena Gonz\u00e1lez represented Mexico at the session and confirmed that member countries agreed to extend the group\u2019s coordinated extraction strategy into next year.\nGonz\u00e1lez stated that the decision reinforces adherence to previously established production frameworks and is intended to support market stability. She noted that the extension is part of a broader effort to develop the basis for determining production levels for 2027.\nAccording to SENER, the meeting gathered the full group of producing countries that make up OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia. The bloc collectively accounts for roughly half of global crude supply and has used coordinated output management to influence market balance during periods of price volatility.\nMexico has been a participant in the OPEC+ framework since the onset of the pandemic-era agreement in 2020, although its production quota differs from that of core OPEC members. The country maintains an independent oil policy but aligns with the alliance on voluntary adjustments intended to support international price stability.\nSENER emphasized that Mexico\u2019s participation remains focused on contributing to predictable market conditions while safeguarding national production plans. The ministry reiterated that the joint policy allows producing nations to coordinate in response to shifts in global demand, geopolitical tensions, and macroeconomic conditions affecting the oil market.\nThe announcement comes at a time when global crude prices face renewed uncertainty due to fluctuating economic indicators and continued supply recalibrations by major producers. OPEC+ members will continue discussions in the coming months to outline preliminary extraction levels for 2027.\nMexico participates in the OPEC+ framework since the onset of the pandemic-era agreement in 2020, although its production quota differs from that of core OPEC members. The country maintains an independent oil policy but aligns with the alliance on voluntary adjustments intended to support international price stability.\nAccording to a recent market analysis, crude prices have declined under pressure from rising global inventories, weaker demand expectations, and elevated freight rates that have limited arbitrage opportunities for long-haul shipments. These conditions have reduced crude export margins and weighed on refining economics worldwide.\nFor Mexico, these developments compound preexisting structural challenges. While the government maintains its commitment to refine more crude domestically, notably through the ramp-up of the Olmeca Refinery, and to reduce fuel imports, analysts warn that lower global oil prices, volatile freight, and refining margins, and weak demand for refined products could undermine profitability.\nCurrent data shows PEMEX is producing significantly under the 1.8MMb/d benchmark set by the government. In 2025, monthly reports indicate crude-oil and condensate production at about 1.64MMb/d in October, one of the lowest levels since 2018.\nThe company itself projected a 2025 crude output of only 1.58 MMb/d, well below the target. Analysts attribute the shortfall to declining yield from mature fields, delayed well workovers and lack of new discoveries."

Spot prices currently trade around mid-1.1600s and remain on track to register gains for the second straight week.\nDespite the upbeat US labor market reports released on Thursday, the US Dollar (USD) struggles to capitalize on the overnight bounce from a six-week low amid dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. In fact, traders are now pricing in around an 85% chance that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs again next week. This, along with the underlying bullish sentiment, is seen undermining the Greenback's relative safe-haven status and acting as a tailwind for the EUR/USD pair.\nThe shared currency, on the other hand, continues to draw support from the growing acceptance that the European Central Bank (ECB) is done cutting interest rates. The expectations were reaffirmed by ECB President Christine Lagarde's comment earlier this week, saying that the central bank expects inflation to stay near its 2% goal in the coming months. This reinforces the argument for the policy hold, which backs the case for a further near-term appreciating move for the EUR/USD pair.\nEven from a technical perspective, the emergence of fresh buying on Friday validates this week's breakout through and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and reaffirms the positive outlook. Traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets and opt to wait for the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index. The crucial data might provide cues about the Fed's rate-cut path, which should will provide a fresh impetus to the buck and the EUR/USD pair.\nUS Dollar Price Last 7 Days\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies last 7 days.

                "body": "The EUR/USD exchange rate may increase as expectations build for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December, aided by key market dynamics. The recent decline in European Natural Gas prices to their lowest since early 2024 has made the Euro more competitive, although cold weather could potentially tighten the market and negate these gains.\nExpectations for Federal Reserve Rate Cut\nDanske Bank anticipates that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates, potentially pushing the EUR/USD higher. Natural Gas markets have unexpectedly contributed to this support, as European prices have dropped considerably, narrowing the spread with US prices to the tightest level since 2021. This shift benefits European manufacturers by improving their competitiveness, while US energy exporters might see reduced revenue.\nDespite the current favourable conditions for EUR/USD, the situation remains precarious due to low European gas storages for this time of year. A sudden drop in temperatures could lead to increased demand, depleting inventories and potentially causing a rebound in European gas prices, which would tighten the market conditions.\nWith the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates at its meeting later this month, we believe structural drivers could now push EUR/USD higher. The latest US CPI data for November 2025 showed inflation cooling to 2.8%, leading futures markets to price in an 85% probability of a 25-basis point cut on December 17th. This has already helped the currency pair climb toward a six-month high of 1.0950.\nThe Euro is also finding support from an unexpected source in the natural gas market. European natural gas prices have fallen to their lowest levels since early 2024, and the price difference compared to US gas is the narrowest it has been since 2021. This development improves the competitiveness of European manufacturers while reducing revenues for US energy exporters, creating a positive backdrop for EUR/USD.\nRisks to the Positive Outlook\nThe primary risk to this positive outlook is a sudden cold snap, as European gas storage facilities are currently reported at 88% full, which is below the five-year average of 92% for early December. For traders, this suggests buying EUR/USD call options to capture the upside from the expected Fed cut is a viable strategy. However, purchasing out-of-the-money put options could serve as a prudent hedge against a sharp reversal caused by a shift in weather.\nWe must watch weather models carefully, as some are now showing an increased probability of a polar vortex event over Northern Europe before the end of the year. We remember how the energy price spike in 2022 drove the Euro below parity, highlighting the currency\u2019s sensitivity to sudden energy shocks. Therefore, call options on Dutch TTF gas futures could also be considered as a direct hedge against this specific risk to long Euro positions."

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast: Euro Holds 1.1670 as Fed Cut Odds Hit 89% Drives Push Toward 1.1800\nThe euro trades near five-week highs at 1.1670, supported by firm Eurozone PMI and a dovish U.S. dollar | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Strengthens Toward 1.1700 As Fed Rate Cut Bets Intensify And ECB Holds Firm\nThe EUR/USD pair trades around 1.1672, advancing for an eighth straight session as the euro extends dominance amid widening policy divergence between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Dollar Index (DXY) slipped below 98.80, marking its weakest level since late October, after a series of soft U.S. economic readings reinforced expectations of monetary easing. The euro\u2019s resilience near five-week highs reflects sustained buying interest anchored in relative macro stability across the euro area.\nWeak U.S. Labor Market Data Pushes The Dollar To Two-Month Lows\nThe latest ADP Employment Report showed a contraction of 32,000 private-sector jobs in November, the largest decline in over two years, against expectations of a 5,000 gain. October\u2019s figure was revised higher to 47,000, highlighting the abrupt deceleration. Combined with six consecutive months of contraction in the ISM Services Employment Index, this data reinforces the narrative of a slowing U.S. labor market. The CME FedWatch Tool now prices an 89% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at next week\u2019s December 10 FOMC meeting, deepening downside pressure on the greenback.\nTreasury yields have softened accordingly, with the 10-year yield hovering at 4.08%, down from 4.31% last week. The move signals a shift toward risk assets as markets anticipate policy easing. The DXY, trading at 98.81, has broken key support at 99.02, turning that level into resistance while maintaining a descending channel pattern. With the RSI near 27, the dollar remains oversold but without a clear reversal trigger.\nECB\u2019s Steady Policy and Resilient Eurozone Data Strengthen Euro Outlook\nAcross Europe, the macro picture contrasts sharply with the U.S. narrative. The ECB maintains a neutral stance with 94% probability of unchanged rates at the December 16 meeting, reinforcing confidence in the euro\u2019s yield advantage. President Christine Lagarde reiterated that inflation remains \u201cconsistent\u201d around the 2% target, and that steady household spending and a firm labor market continue to support Eurozone growth.\nRecent data corroborates that view: the Eurozone HCOB Services PMI for November rose to 53.6 from 53.1, marking the sixth consecutive month of expansion and the strongest reading since May 2023. Germany\u2019s PMI was revised up to 53.1, and France\u2019s to 51.4, both signaling ongoing recovery in services activity. Meanwhile, Eurozone Retail Sales for October remained flat month-on-month but advanced 1.5% year-on-year, beating forecasts of 1.4% and improving from 1.0% in September.\nThis macro divergence\u2014a dovish Fed versus a steady ECB\u2014is amplifying euro strength, pushing EUR/USD closer to the 1.1700 handle.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD Retains Bullish Momentum Above 1.1650 Support\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains confined within a robust ascending channel that began in mid-November from 1.1480 lows. The pair trades above the 50-EMA at 1.1630 and the 200-EMA at 1.1593, maintaining a strong upward bias. Immediate resistance sits at 1.1688, followed by 1.1730 (October 17 high) and 1.1778 (October 1 high). A sustained close above 1.1688 would likely confirm a breakout toward 1.1800.\nOn the downside, the first line of defense lies at 1.1650, coinciding with prior breakout levels, while secondary support rests near 1.1615 trendline support. Momentum indicators remain constructive but stretched: RSI (69) indicates firm buying momentum approaching overbought territory, while MACD remains above zero, confirming bullish control. A minor retracement toward 1.1652 would relieve pressure before another upward push.\nShort-Term Trading Dynamics and Key Event Risks\nMarket focus now turns to upcoming "

                "body": "The GBP/USD exchange rate fell below 1.3350, affecting recent gains. Despite a seven-session slide in the Dollar Index, the Pound Sterling\u2019s upward momentum remains unclear, with the focus shifting to upcoming US inflation data.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s December interest rate decision is anticipated, with a 90% chance of a quarter-point rate cut expected by the market. Current private data suggests potential further weakening in the US labour market, increasing the likelihood of future rate cuts.\nThe Role of the Bank of England\nThe Bank of England plays a pivotal role in determining the value of the Pound Sterling through its monetary policy, mainly focused on maintaining stable inflation. Economic health indicators such as GDP, PMIs, and employment significantly impact the Pound\u2019s value, where strong data may bolster the currency.\nThe Trade Balance is another key indicator, reflecting the difference between export earnings and import costs, which can influence currency strength. A positive balance can strengthen the currency, while a negative balance may weaken it.\nAll economic data and indicators must be noted by stakeholders, as these gauge the economy\u2019s health and subsequently impact currency strength. The upcoming US inflation report, despite its age, could still influence future Federal Reserve actions.\nResistance at Year\u2019s End\nThe pound\u2019s push against the dollar is finding resistance as we approach the year\u2019s end. We are currently seeing GBP/USD hover around 1.3700, a significant climb from the 1.3350 levels we saw in the past. This hesitation comes as the market digests conflicting signals from both the UK and US economies.\nLooking back, it is interesting to remember when markets were pricing in a nearly 90% chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Today, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 95% probability of the Fed holding rates steady at its meeting next week, especially after last month\u2019s non-farm payrolls added a solid 195,000 jobs. With the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for November showing inflation holding at a stubborn 3.1%, the case for easing policy has evaporated.\nOn the other side of the pair, the Bank of England is facing its own inflation challenges, which have kept the pound supported. The UK\u2019s most recent CPI figure came in higher than expected at 3.8%, keeping pressure on the BoE to maintain its restrictive stance. This policy divergence is the central reason for the pound\u2019s relative strength throughout 2025.\nFor traders, this creates an environment where implied volatility may be underpriced ahead of next week\u2019s central bank meetings. Buying straddles or strangles on GBP/USD could be a prudent way to position for a potential sharp move in either direction. Any surprise, whether hawkish from the Fed or dovish from the BoE, could break the current consolidation.\nAlternatively, for those who believe the central banks will stick to the script, selling options to collect premium could be attractive. An iron condor strategy, selling a call spread above recent highs and a put spread below recent lows, would profit if the pair remains range-bound. We see significant historical support down toward that old 1.3350 handle, which could form a lower bound for such a play."

At the time of writing, AUD/USD is trading around 0.6622, its strongest level since October 7.\nThe shift in sentiment comes ahead of the RBA\u2019s interest rate decision on December 9, with investors increasingly convinced that the central bank will maintain its wait-and-see stance. The RBA kept the cash rate unchanged at 3.60% in November and recent domestic indicators have done little to justify further easing.\nIn fact, Speculation is building that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may need to revisit the possibility of raising interest rates as inflation remains stubborn and domestic demand continues to show surprising resilience.\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, household spending rose 1.3% in October, the strongest monthly increase since January 2024 and a sharp acceleration from September\u2019s 0.3% rise. Spending is now 5.6% higher than a year earlier.\nFresh trade figures released earlier in the day added support to the Aussie.

For the Australian Dollar, often traded as a liquid proxy for China\u2019s economic outlook, the move provided an additional tailwind, reinforcing the pair\u2019s upward momentum.\nA softer US Dollar is also helping lift AUD/USD, with the Greenback under pressure as markets maintain a dovish outlook for the Federal Reserve heading into next week\u2019s policy meeting. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against a basket of six major currencies, is trading around 98.83, hovering near a one-month low.\nRBA FAQs\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for Australia. Decisions are made by a board of governors at 11 meetings a year and ad hoc emergency meetings as required. The RBA\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means an inflation rate of 2-3%, but also \u201c..to contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people.\u201d Its main tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will strengthen the Australian Dollar (AUD) and vice versa. Other RBA tools include quantitative easing and tightening.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for currencies since it lowers the value of money in general, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Moderately higher inflation now tends to lead central banks to put up their interest rates, which in turn has the effect of attracting more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in the case of Australia is the Aussie Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data gauges the health of an economy and can have an impact on the value of its currency. Investors prefer to invest their capital in economies that are safe and growing rather than precarious and shrinking. Greater capital inflows increase the aggregate demand and value of the domestic currency. Classic indicators, such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employmen"

Earlier in the day, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that monthly household spending indicator jumped 1.3%, faster than 0.3% growth seen in September.\nThis week, RBA\u2019s Governor Michele Bullock also said before the parliamentary committee that monetary policy might need to be tightened if price pressures turn out to be sticky. \u201cIf inflation proves more persistent, it would have implications for policy,\u201d Bullock said.\nIn addition to the upbeat Australian Dollar, weak US Dollar (USD) is also contributing to the Aussie pair\u2019s rally. During the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, posts a fresh monthly low near 98.80.\nThe US Dollar has been battered by firm expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates in its monetary policy meeting scheduled next week.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.50%-3.75% in the December policy meeting is 89%.\nFed dovish expectations have been propelled by weak United States (US) job market conditions. The US ADP reported on Wednesday that the private sector shed 32K jobs in November, while it was expected to add 5K fresh workers.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is"

But that role could come under threat \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 if President Donald Trump selects his top White House economist, Kevin Hassett, to lead the Federal Reserve.\nLawrence Gillum, chief fixed-income strategist at Charlotte-based brokerage LPL Financial, warns that a Fed under Hassett might prioritize economic growth over price stability. Such a shift could unanchor inflation expectations and undermine the usefulness of bonds within diversified portfolios. Gillum describes this as a \u201cnon-base case,\u201d but one that deserves attention.\n\u201cWe believe inflation will ultimately return to 2% and that the Fed will remain a credible institution,\u201d Gillum said in a phone interview Tuesday. \u201cFor now, rate markets seem comfortable with the prospect of a Hassett appointment. But if markets sense that policy is tilting more toward growth at the expense of inflation control, it would put bonds in a difficult position.\u201d\nBonds\u2019 traditional role under pressure\nFor decades, bonds have balanced equity volatility during periods of market stress, forming the defensive anchor of the classic 60/40 portfolio used by moderate-risk investors.\nBut that stability depends on a low-inflation backdrop and a central bank committed to price stability. Rising inflation erodes the real value of bonds\u2019 fixed cash flows, while a central bank more focused on boosting growth tends to keep rates lower for longer than economic conditions justify.\nInvestors saw these dynamics firsthand in 2022, when both stocks and bonds fell sharply. It marked one of the worst years in history for the traditional 60/40 mix, and the usual negative correlation between the two asset classes has struggled to re-establish itself since.\nHassett emerges as Trump\u2019s likely pick\nOver the weekend, Trump said he knows whom he will select to lead the Federal Reserve but declined to reveal whether that person is Hassett, who currently heads the National Economic Council.\nPrediction markets such as Kalshi and Polymarket have assigned at least an 80% probability to Hassett becoming Trump\u2019s choice, as of Tuesday.

In USD/JPY, however, the broader bullish backdrop remains in-place as prices in the major pair are testing a significant area of support as taken from prior resistance of 154.45-155.00.\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nInterestingly, this was the same zone I was looking at two weeks ago before the USD pullback started to take over. At the time, such a move probably seemed pretty distant, as USD/JPY led the way higher and the US Dollar threatened a breakout at a major spot on the long-term chart. But as markets gear up for next week\u2019s FOMC rate cut and the possibility of assurance for more cuts in 2026, there\u2019s been a paring back in each trend that\u2019s allowed for pullback, and in USD/JPY, that has so far remained rather orderly.\nTo be sure there\u2019s a drumbeat calling for more Yen-strength and anytime a market trends as this one has since April, that can make sense. On the part of Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Ktayama, she believes the \u2018fair level\u2019 of USD/JPY is between 120 and 130. But ever since the carry trade took over in 2021 and launched the pair to fresh multi-decade highs, it\u2019s the 140.00 level that\u2019s been the major line in the sand. The question remains as to what the collateral damage could be of a diving USD/JPY pushing below that major psychological level that\u2019s now held three pensive support tests over the past two years.\nUSD/JPY Weekly Price Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nThis is seemingly at odds with newly-elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who has sounded very much against rate hikes, previously going so far as to call them \u2018stupid.\u2019 Perhaps ironically it\u2019s just a couple months after her election that the Bank of Japan is highly expected to hike again at their December meeting in two weeks, but like with the FOMC, the bigger matter is what happens after.\nThis puts Kazuo Ueda on a tightrope, as no further assurance of additional rate hikes could simply spin the Japanese Yen back into a pattern of continued weakness; something that would or at least could be addressed by a Japanese Finance Ministry charged with monitoring (and often defending) the currency. And then on the other side, sounding too hawkish especially if at odds with a dovish FOMC, could compel a carry unwind scenario similar to what sparked last year.\nThis is the elephant in the room, the 800 pound gorilla, as the massive rally in the USD/JPY pair saw almost 58% added \u2013 in a non-levered currency pair - in just three-and-a-half years. The carry trade was the main driver and this shows in a few different ways.\nIf you\u2019re a hedge fund or institution, you can go to Japan and borrow while rates are extremely low, helped along by low BoJ rates. That provides access to cheap capital which can then be invested elsewhere. The problem at that point is that you\u2019re essentially long the Japanese Yen because you got that loan from Japan in their native currency, so if JPY weakness continues, the entire spread (and perhaps even then some) can be wiped away. So to address that currency risk you can sell JPY in the open market against another currency, such as the US Dollar, and that supply/demand push further drives USD/JPY prices higher as USD strengthens and JPY weakens.\nFor retail traders, they might be more familiar with the carry trade in the form of rollover or swap payments driven by the growing rate differential. Traders holding long USD/JPY can earn rollover payments at the close of each trading day while those short, or in other words, short the high-yielder and long the low-yielder, are forced to pay rollover. This, of course, incentivizes longs and punishes shorts, further pushing the supply/demand equilibrium of the market.\nThis is all good and fine until the market becomes incredibly on"

                "body": "Japanese Yen stands firm near three-week high vs USD amid divergent BoJ-Fed expectations\n- The Japanese Yen retains bullish bias as BoJ rate hike bets offset dismal Household Spending data.\n- Dovish Fed expectations fail to assist the USD in attracting buyers and keep a lid on the USD/JPY pair.\n- Traders keenly await the US PCE Price Index for Fed rate-cut cues and a fresh directional impetus.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) continues with its relative outperformance against a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD) through the Asian session on Friday and climbs back closer to a nearly three-week high, touched the previous day. Data released earlier today showed that Household Spending in Japan unexpectedly fell at the fastest pace in nearly two years in October. The JPY buying, however, remains unabated amid rising bets for an imminent Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike, bolstered by Governor Kazuo Ueda's remarks earlier this week.\nFurthermore, a reflationary push by new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi keeps Japanese government bonds (JGB) yields elevated and underpins the lower-yielding JPY. Apart from this, the cautious mood around the equity markets is seen as another factor benefiting the safe-haven JPY. The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, struggles to capitalize on the overnight recovery from its lowest level since late October amid dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations and further weighs on the USD/JPY pair ahead of the key US inflation data.\nJapanese Yen continues to be underpinned by hawkish BoJ expectations\n- Data published by Japan's Internal Affairs Ministry showed this Friday that Household Spending fell 2.9% YoY in October 2025, missing market expectations for a 1.0% rise and reversing a 1.8% gain in the prior month. This also marked the first decline since April and the fastest pace of fall since January 2024, raising concerns about the economic outlook.\n- The Japanese Yen, however, remains on the front foot amid prospects for further Bank of Japan tightening. In fact, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Monday that the central bank would consider the pros and cons of raising the policy rate at the December 18-19 meeting. This was seen as the clearest hint so far of an impending rate hike and underpins the JPY.\n- Adding to this, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's massive spending plan, to be funded by new debt issuance, has been a key factor behind the recent sharp rise in government bond yields over the past month. The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB surged to its strongest level since 2007 on Thursday, while the 20-year reached a level not seen since 1999.\n- Furthermore, the 30-year JGB yield hit a record high, resulting in a further narrowing of the rate differential between Japan and other major economies. This raises the risk of the carry trade unwinding and further benefits the JPY. However, rising bond yields mean higher borrowing costs, which fuel concerns about Japan's fiscal situation and keep a lid on the JPY gains.\n- The US Dollar staged a modest recovery from a six-week trough on Thursday and drew support from a duo of upbeat US labor market reports. In fact, Global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said that planned job cuts declined 53% to 71,321 in November, from 153,074 in the previous month, which was the highest for an October month since 2003.\n- Adding to this, the US Labour Department reported that the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits decreased by 27,000 to 191,000 in the week ended November 29. This marked the lowest level in more than three years, which eased fears of a sharp deterioration in labor market conditions and prompted some USD short-covering.\n- Despite the supportive data, the USD struggles to attract any follow-through buying amid the growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will lower borrowing costs again at next week's policy meeting. This fails to assist the USD/JPY pair in registering any meaningful recovery from a nearly three-week"

The yen strengthened after BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda hinted that the central bank could lift its benchmark rate to 0.75% at the December 18\u201319 meeting, while U.S. economic data showed rapid cooling in labor and service activity, igniting heavy dollar selling.\nBoJ Policy Pivot Reshapes Yen Outlook\nUeda\u2019s remarks signaled the clearest path yet toward abandoning ultra-loose policy.

The ADP report showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 jobs in November \u2014 the steepest decline since early 2023 \u2014 while the ISM Services Employment Index slipped to 48.9, signaling contraction. These figures drove the Dollar Index (DXY) below 99.00, its weakest reading in over a year, as investors raised the probability of a Fed rate cut in December to 90%. The PCE inflation print, delayed to Friday, is expected near 2.7% YoY, a level consistent with Fed dovish bias.\nTechnical Structure: Pivotal 155 Zone in Focus\nTechnically, USD/JPY trades just above a dense confluence of supports. The pair\u2019s current floor sits at 154.82 \u2013 155.03, aligning with the 78.6% retracement of the 2024 range and the April median pitchfork support. This cluster defines the market\u2019s decision point: a sustained break below 154.80 would expose the 153.65 level, followed by 151.92 \u2013 151.94, the 2022\u20132023 swing highs. Conversely, resistance stands at 156.52, then 157.70, and the year-to-date top near 158.88. Above 159.00, technicals turn sharply bullish toward 161.95, the 2024 high close.\nMomentum indicators remain bearish; the RSI hovers near 38, confirming downside pressure, while the 200-period moving average near 154.40 acts as short-term magnet support. A weekly close beneath that level would formally end the seven-month uptrend that began in April.\nBond Market and Intervention Dynamics\nJapan\u2019s yield curve is now steepening rapidly as the market anticipates policy normalization. The 10-year JGB yield has reached 1.12%, narrowing the spread against the U.S. 10-year Treasury\u2014which fell to 3.94%\u2014to its tightest since 2022. This narrowing removes one of the core supports for USD/JPY. Additionally, Japanese officials have renewed FX-intervention warnings, signaling readiness to defend against \u201cexcessive yen weakness.\u201d Traders estimate that official intervention thresholds now sit between 155.00 and 156.50, with verbal defense intensifying once the pair breaches 156.00.\nFed Transition Adds to Dollar Pressure\nSpeculation that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett could replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair when his term expires in May has unsettled bond markets. Investors fear a politically driven, ultra-dovish pivot, which has already pressured U.S. yields and undermined the dollar. Combined with weak jobs data, traders are now pricing 125 basis points of cumulative cuts across 2025, pulling short-term Treasury"

                "body": "Stronger oil, record stocks, and upbeat data are keeping the loonie steady ahead of jobs numbers and the Bank of Canada\u2019s next rate call\nabout 11 hours ago \u2022 3 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nThe Canadian dollar held its ground on Wednesday, trading around 1.3945 per US dollar after briefly touching a five-week intraday high. Stronger oil prices, record Canadian stocks, and better-than-expected economic data are keeping the loonie steady ahead of Friday\u2019s jobs report and next week\u2019s Bank of Canada rate decision.\nWhat does this mean?\nThe loonie\u2019s latest move comes as several supportive forces line up at once. Canada\u2019s main stock index climbed to a record intraday high, helped by bank shares rallying on stronger-than-expected earnings and energy stocks rising alongside crude. Oil \u2013 one of Canada\u2019s key exports \u2013 was up about 1.5% to $59.84 a barrel, improving the country\u2019s terms of trade and typically adding a bit of support for its currency. On top of that, recent economic data has been beating expectations, with analysts like Monex Europe\u2019s Nick Rees pointing to stronger-than-expected GDP and the prospect of more fiscal spending as signs of a brighter outlook. Still, bond markets are staying cautious: ten-year Canadian yields inched up to 3.253%, shadowing US Treasuries but holding just below this week\u2019s near three-month high, as traders wait for fresh clues from Friday\u2019s jobs report and the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy call next Wednesday.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Cautious optimism is back in the mix.\nMoves in currencies, stocks, and bonds are all pointing in the same direction: investors are getting more upbeat on Canada, just not throwing caution to the wind. The loonie is hovering near its strongest level since late October, while the main equity index has pushed to a record intraday high on the back of solid bank profits and firmer energy prices. At the same time, bond yields edging up to 3.253% \u2013 just under a recent three-month peak \u2013 suggest traders are dialing back aggressive rate-cut bets rather than bracing for a fresh tightening cycle. With the Bank of Canada widely expected to leave its benchmark rate unchanged next week, markets will treat Friday\u2019s jobs figures \u2013 forecast to show a modest 5,000 drop in employment and unemployment ticking up to 7% \u2013 as a key test of whether this improving story can stick.\nThe bigger picture: Canada\u2019s outlook hinges on growth and policy support.\nRecent upside surprises in GDP and talk of extra fiscal spending hint that Canada\u2019s economy might be on slightly firmer footing than earlier this year. A sturdier growth backdrop, paired with higher oil prices, can help stabilize government revenues and corporate earnings, giving risk assets some longer-term support. But the labor market looks to be at a turning point: after two months of strong job gains, forecasts now point to job losses and a higher 7% unemployment rate in November. That mix of cooling employment and resilient output will determine how long the Bank of Canada can keep rates at a three-year low before even thinking about further cuts. For global investors, how Canada handles that trade-off will shape broader views on commodity-linked economies and their currencies at a time when growth and policy are still delicately balanced.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 15 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "source": "VT Markets",

                "body": "The USD/CAD exchange rate has witnessed a slight rebound from a low point near mid-1.3900s, as the US dollar attempts a mild recovery. This has been influenced by expectations of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, following a report showing a reduction of 32,000 jobs in the US private sector in November.\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s contrasting approach, indicating a pause in rate cuts, along with recovering crude oil prices, poses challenges for the USD/CAD pair. These economic dynamics place a cap on potential gains of the USD/CAD pairing. Succeeding economic data releases, such as the US PCE Price Index and the Canada jobs report, could guide future movements.\nFactors Influencing The Canadian Dollar\nThe Canadian Dollar\u2019s value is influenced by various factors including the Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate settings, crude oil prices, economic health, inflation, and trade balance. Generally, higher oil prices and interest rates tend to support the CAD. Economic indicators such as GDP and employment data also affect the currency\u2019s strength. A rise in inflation usually prompts a rate increase, attracting foreign capital flows and boosting the CAD\u2019s value.\nBased on the current outlook for USD/CAD, we see that any upward movement in the pair appears to be limited. The pair is struggling to gain traction above the mid-1.3900s, suggesting that underlying pressures are weighing on the US dollar relative to its Canadian counterpart. This presents a specific set of opportunities for option traders in the weeks ahead.\nThe main driver here is the diverging monetary policy between the United States and Canada. Markets are strongly anticipating another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week, with fed funds futures indicating an over 85% probability of a 25-basis-point reduction. In stark contrast, the Bank of Canada has signaled it is finished cutting rates for now, holding its policy rate steady at 4.75% in its October 2025 meeting.\nThis policy difference is further supported by a recent uptick in crude oil prices, a key Canadian export. WTI crude has climbed back above $85 per barrel, providing a fundamental tailwind for the commodity-linked Canadian dollar. This strength in oil, combined with the BoC\u2019s hawkish stance, creates a challenging environment for any sustained USD/CAD rally.\nImplications for Derivative Traders\nThe weakness in the US economy is becoming more apparent, justifying the Fed\u2019s dovish lean. The recent ADP report, which showed an unexpected private-sector job loss of 32,000 in November 2025, follows other signs of a cooling labor market. This data reinforces the view that the US economy is slowing, making further rate cuts more likely.\nFor derivative traders, this suggests that strategies capitalizing on limited upside are attractive. Selling call options or establishing bear call spreads with strike prices at or above the 1.4000 psychological level could be a prudent way to collect premium. These positions would profit if the USD/CAD pair stays below the strike price through expiration.\nAlternatively, for those anticipating a more significant move lower, buying put options offers a direct way to profit from a decline in the pair. With key data like the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index and the Canadian jobs report due shortly, using options can also be a way to define risk around this potential volatility. This current market action looks like a significant shift, especially after the pair\u2019s strong rally to near 1.4200 earlier in the summer of 2025."

From a wider perspective, however, the immediate trend remains bearish, amid the BoC-Fed monetary policy divergence, after depreciating more than 1% in less than two weeks.\nThe US labour market remains in focus on Thursday, following an unexpected 32K net loss of jobs in November, as reported by the ADP Employment Change. These figures contrast with the 5K increase anticipated by the market consensus and signal a significant deterioration, compared to October\u2019s upwardly revised 47K increase.\nOn Thursday, the US Challenger Job Cuts reported 71,321K layoffs in November, down from the 153,074K reported in September. The market is now focusing on the weekly Jobless claims, due at 13:30 GMT, which are expected to show that first-time applications for unemployment benefits increased to 220K in the last week of November from 216K in the previous one.\nIn Canada, the IVEY Purchasing Managers' Index is forecast to show an improvement to 53.6 in November's business activity, from the 52.4 reading seen in October. These figures come after the strong Q3 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data released last week, which, if confirmed, will support the view that the Bank of Canada (BoC) will keep interest rates on hold in December.\nThe US Federal Reserve (Fed), on the contrary, is widely expected to cut rates after its December 10 meeting. The CME Group's Fed Watch Tool shows an 89% chance of a 25 basis points rate cut next week and between two and three further cuts next year. This keeps the US Dollar on its back foot against most of its peers.\nEconomic Indicator\nInitial Jobless Claims\nThe Initial Jobless Claims released by the US Department of Labor is a measure of the number of people filing first-time claims for state unemployment insurance. A larger-than-expected number indicates weakness in the US labor market, reflects negatively on the US economy, and is negative for the US Dollar (USD). On the other hand, a decreasing number should be taken as bullish for the USD.\nRead more.Next release: Thu Dec 04, 2025 13:30\nFrequency: Weekly\nConsensus: 220K\nPrevious: 216K\nSource: US Department of Labor\nEvery Thursday, the US Department of Labor publishes the number of previous week\u2019s initial claims for unemployment benefits in the US. Since this reading could be highly volatile, investors may pay closer attention to the four-week average. A downtrend is seen as a sign of an improving labour market and could have a positive impact on the USD\u2019s performance against its rivals and vice versa.\nEconomic Indicator\nIvey Purchasing Managers Index s.a\nThe Ivey Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released on a monthly basis by the Ivey Business School at Western University, is a leading indicator gauging business activity in Canada. The data, which is seasonally adjusted, is derived from surveys of senior executives at private-sector companies. The PMI includes both the public and private sectors. Respondents indicate whether their organizations\u2019 activity is higher than, the same as, or lower than the previous month across the following five categories: purchases, employment, inventories, supplier deliveries and prices. The data can anticipate changing trends in official data series such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), industrial production, employment and inflation. The index varies between 0 and 100, with levels of 50.0 signaling no change over the previous month. A reading above 50 indicates that the economy is generally expanding, a bullish sign for the Canadian Dollar (CAD). Meanwhile, a "

Its liquidity, clear trend structure, and sensitivity to central-bank divergence keep it at the top. Traders are watching for a decisive move above 1.1680 as USD softness persists.\nWhy It\u2019s Ranked First: High liquidity, consistent volatility, and reliable reaction to macro data.\nApproximate Rate: ~155\nWith Japan signaling potential policy shifts and the USD weakening, USD/JPY volatility remains elevated. [1] This pair is experiencing large intraday ranges that attract both swing and short-term traders.\nApproximate Rate: 1.33- 1.34\nThe British pound continues to outperform due to stronger UK macro data. With USD weakness, the pair is trending upward and remains a strong candidate for continuation trades.\nSolid trend strength but slightly less volatility than USD/JPY.\nApproximate Rate: 0.66\nImproving sentiment in Asian markets and firm Australian labor data make AUD/USD a key watch for December. The pair benefits when global equities and commodities stabilize.\nApproximate Rate: 1.396-1.400\nUSD/CAD continues to trade in a tight but predictable range. Oil price movements and Canadian macro data keep it relevant for mean-reversion setups.\nApproximate Rate: 206\u2013207\nGBP/JPY shows large directional moves driven by both risk sentiment and yen policy speculation. This pair remains a favorite among momentum traders.\nApproximate Rate: 180\u2013182\nThe pair trades near multi-month highs and continues offering breakout opportunities. Euro strength vs. yen adjustments keeps it active.\nApproximate Rate: ~0.61 (Assumed based on recent ranges)\nNZD/USD has gained traction as New Zealand\u2019s data improves. The pair offers solid risk-reward setups near long-term support.\nApproximate Rate: 0.80\nSwiss franc strength has returned, making USD/CHF an important barometer for risk-off conditions.\nApproximate Rate: 7.06\nChina\u2019s manufacturing and export performance will influence the pair through year-end. Traders continue to monitor policy guidance and broader Asian market trends.\nFed vs BoJ divergence is intensifying. Markets now assign a high probability to a December 2025 Fed rate cut. Meanwhile, the BoJ is under increasing pressure to raise rates, a move nearly priced in by markets.\nChanging yield differentials create relative-value opportunities. With U.S. yields likely to fall and Japanese yields rising, the yen could strengthen versus the dollar , affecting USD/JPY, yen-crosses, and broader FX flows.\nYear-end flows and seasonality increase volatility. December tends to bring rebalancing of positions, holiday-related lower liquidity, and often larger moves, amplifying FX swings.\nGlobal macro and risk sentiment remain in flux. With ongoing geopolitical risks, uncertain economic data, and shifting commodity prices, currency pairs are likely to reflect sharp reactions to news or data surprises.\nVolatility may increase, with central bank decisions (especially BoJ and possibly BoE), expect sharp moves.\nWatch liquidity and spreads as year-end can bring thinner liquidity; risk of slippage or erratic moves.\nPosition sizing and risk control, cross pairs and commodity-linked pairs tend to swing more; use stops and avoid over-leverage.\nMacro and event calendar matters, track central bank meetings, key economic data, and global risk events.\nDiversify exposure, instead of focusing only on USD-based currenc"

But that wasn't the case over the past two months.\n- The market is now positioned for potential growth, with remaining ETF holdings reflecting long-term institutional investment.\nThe U.S.-listed spot bitcoin\nYet data analysis by Amberdata presents a far more nuanced picture: concentrated redemptions from \"basis trade,\" or arbitrage bets closures, not broad panic across ETFs, with total holdings staying robust at 1.43 million BTC.\n\"Nearly $4 billion in Bitcoin ETF outflows since mid-October. Price collapsed from $125,000 to the low $80,000s - a 35% drawdown that erased six months of gains. The prevailing interpretation: institutions had arrived, seen enough, and were leaving,\" Michael Marshall, head of research at Amberdata, said in a report.\n\"The selling, however, was highly concentrated among a few issuers and tied to a mechanical basis trade unwind, not broad investor fear,\" Marshall added.\nWhat capitulation?\nCapitulation in financial markets occurs when sellers exhaust themselves after prolonged declines, typically marked by panic selling, high volume, and extreme fear indicators.\nIn the ETF context, true capitulation would entail broad selling across issuers and massive redemptions. But that wasn't the case over the past two months.\nMarshall noted that BlackRock dominated 97%-99% of more recent weekly outflows despite holding only 48-51% of assets under management while Fidelity FBTC registered inflows and other smaller ETFs held steady.\nMeanwhile, over the full 53-day window from Oct. 1 to Nov. 26, Grayscale bled $923 million, which is 53.2% of total gross outflows, followed by 21Shares and Grayscale Mini. Together, these three accounted for 89.1% of outflows. By contrast, BlackRock and Fidelity registered inflows.\nThis dual framing underscores the point: no widespread capitulation, but targeted unwinds. The day-to-day fluctuations in ETF fund flows were highly variable, with a standard deviation of $372 million compared to an average daily flow of $27 million.\nTargeted unwinds driven by carry trades\nThe culprit? Collapsing basis spreads in the spot-futures arbitrage trade, also known as the basis trade, where funds bought ETF shares and sold futures to capture contango yield\u2014direction-neutral, not a BTC price view.\nThe annualized 30-day basis, or the spread between futures and spot prices, compressed 217 basis points from 6.63% to 4.46%, with 93% of recent days below the 5% breakeven threshold, according to Marshall.\nThis forced carry traders to unwind \u2013 sell spot and buy back futures. The decline in perpetual futures open interest alongside ETF outflows is evidence of that.\nPer data tracked by Marshall, BTC perpetual open interest plunged 37.7% ($4.23 billion peak-to-trough), \"correlating 0.878 with basis moves\", near-lockstep evidence of simultaneous ETF sales and futures short covers.\nWhat next?\nWith basis traders shaken out, the remaining ETF ownership represents sticky institutional capital betting on long-term price appreciation. In other words, the market is much cleaner and reset for a bigger rally.\n\"With the arbitrage overhang cleared, remaining flows increasingly reflect genuine allocation rather than yield harvesting. The market that emerges is less leveraged, more conviction-driven, and structurally cleaner than the one that entered October,\" Marshall said.\nMore For You\nProtocol Research: GoPlus Security\nWhat to know:\n- As of October 2025, GoPlus has generated $4.7M in total revenue across its product lines.

The firm noted that this was discovered after matching Bitcoin\u2019s post-ETF inflows against spot ETF creation capital.\nSince their launch, net capital inflows into Bitcoin have totaled roughly $661 billion.\nData from Glassnode shows that 5.2% of that can be traced directly to coins acquired by US spot ETFs, a proportion that aligns with the products\u2019 6-7% share of the circulating supply.\nConsidering this, Glassnode concluded that ETFs have reshaped the way Bitcoin is accessed, traded, and integrated into portfolios in under two years of their launch.\nHow ETFs rewired Bitcoin\u2019s flow dynamics\nThe introduction of regulated, brokerage-eligible Bitcoin exposure has led to a measurable shift in liquidity behavior.\nETF trading volume has grown from approximately $1 billion per day at launch to sustained levels above $5 billion. In fact, the sector has seen peaks exceeding $9 billion during periods of heightened volatility.\nThese flows have become a structural feature of the market, especially visible during inflection points when ETF turnover accelerates at the early stages of rallies and slows during corrective periods.\nThe pattern highlights the degree to which Wall Street volume now anchors price discovery.\nFor context, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT fund alone generated $6.9 billion of turnover during the record trading session following the October deleveraging event, highlighting how a single product can influence intra-day liquidity and sentiment.\nThis shift marks a quiet transfer of market power from crypto-native exchanges to regulated intermediaries whose flows increasingly set the tempo for Bitcoin\u2019s cycles.\nNotably, the assets under management of these products tell a similar story. US-listed Bitcoin ETFs now hold approximately 1.36 million BTC, totaling roughly $168 billion.\nThis represents nearly 7% of circulating supply, moving exposure away from self-custody wallets and toward custodial, audited vehicles that financial advisers and asset managers can deploy at scale.\nThe shift has altered the composition of long-term holders, embedding Bitcoin more deeply into institutional allocation frameworks.\nA new institutional complex emerges\nThe rise of spot ETFs has also reshaped the derivatives environment.\nBitcoin futures and perpetual swap markets have expanded in tandem with the growth of ETF exposure, with open interest across venues reaching an all-time high of $67.9 billion.\nWhile perpetuals remain the preferred tool for crypto-native traders, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has become the center of institutional positioning. CME now accounts for more than $20.6 billion of open interest, or roughly 30% of the global total.\nThe strong correlation between CME open interest and US ETF AUM is notable.\nGlassnode noted that institutional investors frequently pair ETF inflows with short futures positions to implement basis trading strategies, capturing yield through the spread between spot and futures markets.\nThis creates a feedback loop where ETF demand, futures hedging, and yield strategies reinforce one another, generating a market structure that differs materially from the retail-driven cycles of prior years.\nIn effect, the ETFs have established a two-tier Bitcoin market.\nOn-chain settlement continues to underpin the asset\u2019s monetary policy and security model, while off-chain financial products like ETFs, CME futures, and brokerage accounts now mediate most of the volume and much of the liquidity.\nThis institutional laye"

                "body": "Understanding Bitcoin's 2024 Movement: A Look at Recent Developments\nExploring Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 halving, new investment products, and shifting market dynamics shaping the crypto landscape.\nIf you follow financial markets, you\u2019ve likely noticed increased discussion around Bitcoin this year. Its price activity has captured attention, prompting both seasoned observers and newcomers to ask questions about what\u2019s happening. This article aims to provide a clear, straightforward overview of the key events and factors influencing the cryptocurrency landscape in 2024, separating observable developments from speculation.\nThe goal here is not to offer financial advice or hype, but to inform. We\u2019ll examine the recent Bitcoin halving, the introduction of new investment products, and the resulting market dynamics, all based on publicly available data and events.\nThe 2024 Halving: A Scheduled Update\nIn April 2024, the Bitcoin network underwent its fourth \u201chalving.\u201d This is a pre-programmed event written into Bitcoin\u2019s code that occurs approximately every four years. During a halving, the reward miners receive for validating transactions and securing the network is cut in half.\nThis time, the reward decreased from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This mechanism controls the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation. From a basic economic perspective, if demand remains constant while the rate of new supply decreases, it can create upward pressure on price. However, the effects are historically gradual and intertwined with broader market conditions.\nA Significant New Variable: Spot Bitcoin ETFs\nA major development that distinguishes 2024 from previous halving years is the regulatory approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States in January. These investment vehicles, offered by established asset managers, allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s price through a traditional stock brokerage account.\nThe operational reality of these funds is significant. When investors buy shares of a spot Bitcoin ETF, the fund provider must purchase an equivalent amount of actual Bitcoin to hold in reserve. This has led to substantial, sustained buying activity directly on cryptocurrency exchanges, as documented in public fund flow reports. This new source of institutional demand represents a structural change in the market.\nObserving the Market Response\nFollowing the halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price did not experience an immediate, dramatic spike. Instead, it entered a phase of consolidation, which many analysts view as a period of the market digesting the changes and establishing a new base level.\nThe interaction between reduced new supply from the halving and consistent demand from ETF inflows has created a unique environment. It\u2019s important to understand that cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and are influenced by numerous factors, including global macroeconomic trends and regulatory news.\nThe Wider Cryptocurrency Ecosystem\nBitcoin\u2019s activity often affects the broader digital asset space. When attention and capital flow into Bitcoin, other projects and tokens, often called \u201caltcoins,\u201d can also see increased activity. Key areas include:\n- Ethereum (ETH): The leading platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications often moves somewhat in correlation with Bitcoin, though based on its own technological developments.\n- Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Protocols for lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries see usage fluctuate with overall market sentiment.\n- Specialized Sectors: Projects focused on areas like digital identity, blockchain scaling solutions, and tokenizing real-world assets continue to develop independently, attracting interest based on their specific utility.\nA Necessary Emphasis on Caution\nWhile developments in 2024 are notable, a responsible discussion must include clear considerations:\n- Volatility is Inherent: The prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can "

This move, first reported by The Block, begins with Ethereum (ETH) trading and promises to reshape how traders interact with the platform. But what does this mean for the average DeFi user, and why is it such a pivotal development? Let\u2019s explore the details and implications.\nWhat is Lighter Spot Trading and Why Does It Matter?\nThe launch of Lighter spot trading represents a fundamental evolution from a specialized perpetual futures venue into a more comprehensive trading hub. Initially, users can trade ETH directly on the spot market. This service is crucial because it provides a foundational layer for the ecosystem. Spot trading involves the immediate purchase or sale of an asset, unlike derivatives. Therefore, introducing this feature directly addresses a core need for simplicity and immediacy in decentralized finance.\nHow Will This Benefit Crypto Traders?\nThis expansion offers tangible advantages for the community. First, it creates a seamless, all-in-one trading experience. Users no longer need to fragment their activities across multiple platforms. They can now manage both spot positions and perpetual contracts in a single, integrated environment. Here are the key benefits:\n- Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Traders can potentially use spot holdings as collateral for perpetual positions, optimizing their capital usage.\n- Improved Accessibility: By starting with ETH, Lighter spot trading lowers the entry barrier for newcomers who may find derivatives complex.\n- Reduced Counterparty Risk: As a decentralized exchange (DEX), Lighter allows users to maintain custody of their assets, aligning with core DeFi principles.\nWhat Challenges Does Lighter Face with This Launch?\nHowever, this strategic move is not without its hurdles. The spot trading landscape is intensely competitive, dominated by both centralized giants and established DEXs. Lighter must differentiate itself. Its success will likely depend on achieving deep liquidity from day one and ensuring a user experience that rivals its competitors. Furthermore, the platform\u2019s plan to \u201cexpand to other trading services in the coming days\u201d must be executed flawlessly to build and maintain user trust during this critical growth phase.\nWhat\u2019s the Future for Lighter and DeFi Trading?\nThe introduction of Lighter spot trading is more than just a new feature; it\u2019s a vision for a unified trading future. By bridging the gap between spot and derivatives markets, Lighter is positioning itself as a foundational DeFi primitive. This could pave the way for innovative products like integrated portfolio management or advanced cross-margin systems. The initial focus on ETH is a smart, pragmatic first step to ensure stability before a broader rollout.\nConclusion: A Significant Step Forward\nUltimately, Lighter\u2019s foray into spot trading is a confident and necessary evolution. It enhances the platform\u2019s utility, caters to a broader audience, and strengthens the overall DeFi infrastructure. While challenges around liquidity and competition remain, this launch marks Lighter\u2019s transition from a niche derivatives platform to a contender in the full-spectrum decentralized exchange arena. The coming days, as more assets are added, will be critical in determining its long-term impact.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nQ: What is Lighter spot trading?\nA: It is a new service from the Lighter decentralized exchange that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like ETH for immediate settlement, as opposed to trading futures contracts.\nQ: Which asset can I trade first on Lighter\u2019s spot market?\nA> The service is launching initially with Ethereum (ETH) trading.

                "body": "Revolutionary Bridge Connects Base and Solana, Unlocking a New Era of DeFi\nShare:\nBitcoinWorld\nRevolutionary Bridge Connects Base and Solana, Unlocking a New Era of DeFi\nIn a major leap for blockchain interoperability, a new secure bridge has officially launched. This innovative infrastructure directly connects Base and Solana, two of the most vibrant ecosystems in crypto. Powered by Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), this connection promises to reshape how users move assets and interact with decentralized applications. Let\u2019s explore what this means for the future of Web3.\nWhat Does This New Bridge Connecting Base and Solana Actually Do?\nThis bridge serves as a dedicated highway for digital assets. In simple terms, it allows tokens native to the Solana blockchain to be securely transferred to Coinbase\u2019s Layer 2 network, Base. Once there, these assets can be used within the growing universe of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Base. This solves a critical problem in crypto: isolated liquidity. Previously, assets and users on Solana and Base existed in separate silos. Now, they can interact seamlessly.\nThe core mechanism involves \u201cwrapping\u201d tokens. When you send a Solana-based token across, it is locked in a secure smart contract on Solana, and an equivalent, representative token is minted on Base. This process is secured and verified not by a single entity, but by Chainlink\u2019s decentralized oracle network.\nWhy Is Chainlink\u2019s CCIP the Game-Changer for Security?\nThe most crucial aspect of any bridge is security, as past exploits have shown. This is where Chainlink\u2019s CCIP provides a formidable advantage. CCIP isn\u2019t just another bridge; it\u2019s a standardized framework for cross-chain communication that leverages Chainlink\u2019s battle-tested decentralized oracle network.\n- Decentralized Validation: Instead of relying on a small set of validators, CCIP uses a large, independent network of nodes to confirm transactions, making it highly resistant to attacks.\n- Risk Management Network: CCIP includes an additional layer of monitoring that can pause suspicious activity, acting as a proactive safety net.\n- Proven Infrastructure: It builds on the same secure infrastructure that already secures tens of billions in value for DeFi.\nTherefore, this bridge connects Base and Solana with a level of security assurance that sets a new industry standard.\nWhat Are the Tangible Benefits for Crypto Users?\nThis connection is more than just technical news; it delivers real, actionable benefits for traders, developers, and the entire community.\n- Access to New Yield Opportunities: Solana users can now easily explore high-yield farming and lending protocols on Base without a complex multi-step process.\n- Expanded Liquidity for Developers: Builders on Base can tap into Solana\u2019s deep liquidity pools, making their dApps more attractive and functional from day one.\n- Enhanced User Choice: Traders gain the freedom to chase opportunities across both ecosystems with minimal friction and cost.\n- Stronger Network Effects: By combining communities, both Base and Solana become more valuable and resilient platforms.\nThis bridge effectively turns two powerful islands into a unified continent of financial activity.\nAre There Any Challenges or Considerations?\nWhile transformative, users should approach this new capability with informed caution. Always remember that bridging assets involves smart contract risk, even with a robust system like CCIP. It\u2019s wise to start with small test transactions. Furthermore, you will encounter bridge fees and potentially different gas dynamics on the destination chain. Understanding these mechanics ensures a smooth experience as you use the bridge that connects Base and Solana.\nThe Future of a Connected Blockchain World\nThis launch is a significant milestone. It demonstrates a clear path forward where blockchains are not competitors in walled gardens but collaborators in an open network. The use of a standardize"

The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, was 0.2% higher at 99.06. WTI crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, rose 1.2% to $59.65 per barrel, while gold futures were 0.2% higher at $4,240 per ounce.\nIn corporate news, shares of Meta Platforms (META) advanced 3.4% to lead the Nasdaq after Bloomberg reported that the Facebook parent is expected to slash spending on the so-called \"metaverse.\" The other Magnificent Seven large-cap technology stocks were mixed, with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), the world's most valuable company, up 2.2%.\nShares of Salesforce (CRM) rose 3.7% to lead the Dow after the software giant late Wednesday posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its outlook on the back of growth from its data products and AI offerings.\nIn other post-earnings stock moves, shares of UiPath (PATH) soared 24%; Dollar General (DG) jumped nearly 14% to lead the S&P 500; Hormel (HRL) rose 3.8%; Five Below (FIVE) advanced 3.2%; Snowflake (SNOW) sank 11%; and Kroger (KR) fell 4.6%.\nNoteworthy S&P 500 Movers on Thursday\nAdvancers\n- Dollar General (DG) shares surged 14% to log the S&P 500's top performance Thursday, after the discount retailer beat quarterly earnings estimates and lifted its full-year forecast.

                "body": "There is no better advert for good old-fashioned stock picking than a headline I saw this week suggesting that UK pension funds are dumping US shares for fear of an AI bubble.\nWith the so-called \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d accounting for a quarter of the value of the US stock market, investors are clearly exposed to a correction in the prices of tech stocks. The Nasdaq index has risen by more than a fifth again this year and doubled since 2023.\nSelf-evidently, some parts of the market are frothy, and there are echoes of the dotcom bubble of 25 years ago.\nAnother headline also jumped out at me this week. It said that so-called \u201cquality stocks\u201d \u2013 those with high returns on capital employed, generous dividends, and persistent earnings growth \u2013 are trading at their lowest price relative to the broader market in a generation.\nThere is a seeming contradiction in these two narratives. It feels like both can\u2019t be true at the same time \u2013 but in a market of stocks, where one size does not fit all, it can.\nTo get a better handle on whether investors are right to worry about exuberant market sentiment or are being misled by a handful of important but unrepresentative shares, I turned to Factset, a market information database.\nI looked at both the UK and US markets, as measured by their benchmark indices, the FTSE 100 and S&P 500.\nIn both cases, I ranked all their constituent companies on five metrics: valuation, as reflected in a share\u2019s price as a multiple of its earnings; a more sophisticated measure that compares this price/earnings ratio to a company\u2019s earnings growth rate (the PEG); their dividend yield; how volatile their shares have been; and how much profit they generate as a percentage of the total capital they put to work.\nThese are standard yardsticks for fund managers, and any that pick stocks on their fundamental attractions, rather than simply trying to match the performance of an index, will be looking at these numbers every day.\nI was struck by how much value there seems to be in the stock market today.\nI was also reminded of similar screens I conducted 25 years ago when, even as the dotcom bubble inflated in 1999 and 2000, there was no shortage of solid, but out of favour, investment opportunities.\nI demonstrated a couple of weeks ago here that rotating from the popular tech stocks into out of favour defensive shares was a sensible strategy in 2000 \u2013 and I suspect it will be so again today.\nLooking at valuation, I was surprised by how many cheap shares are lurking in a US stock market that is widely viewed as the most expensive in the world.\nIn fact, 73 of the top 500 companies can be bought for less than 12 times their expected earnings and about 125 for less than 15 times profit, a quarter of the total.\nHere in the UK, the situation is even better. Roughly half of the top 100 shares are priced at less than 15 times earnings.\nComparing that basic measure of value to the expected growth rate in earnings is an investment shortcut popularised as the PEG ratio by my old friend Jim Slater. It is shorthand for price-earnings-growth.\nHe looked for shares trading with a PEG of less than one \u2013 in other words with a growth rate that exceeds the PE ratio. Again, there is plenty to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic.\nAbout one in 10 US stocks have a PEG of one or less. They include well-known names like Citigroup and Hewlett Packard. Over here, about one in six FTSE 100 companies qualify. Vodafone and Barclays have growth rates of twice their PE ratio, or a PEG of just 0.5.\nWhen it comes to the dividend yield, the US is thought to provide thinner pickings than most other markets around the world. Investors there are more interested in growth than income \u2013 but a quarter of S&P 500 shares sport a yield of more than 3pc and 25 of them have a yield above 5pc.\nAs you might expect, the UK offers even more to income investors. Half the FTSE 100 yields more than 3pc and one in five companies pay over 5pc.\nThere are also plenty of companies p"

Both appear likely to contribute positively, even if the journey is expected to be choppier than the strong and steady gains seen during most of 2025. The FTSE 100 - up around 18% year-to-date - outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating unexpected strength.\nCorporate earnings among the UK's largest listed firms have proven remarkably robust in the face of stubbornly high interest rates, elevated financing costs and a sluggish domestic economy.\nProfit margins have held up better than feared as earnings growth has outpaced sales declines, suggesting firms have managed to control costs or reprice sufficiently to sustain profits even with weaker top-line growth.\nProductivity and global diversification support earnings\nThere are signs of productivity recovery - some measured improvement in output per hour/worker compared with pre-pandemic levels, which may help several firms remain competitive.\nFor certain globally-oriented FTSE 100 sectors (like energy, mining, large multinationals), revenue growth has been more stable because of diversified global operations.\nExporters also benefitted from a weaker pound sterling, which inflated the value of overseas earnings when converted back to sterling.\nThe gradual diffusion of AI-driven efficiency gains is beginning to benefit UK-listed multinationals as well, supporting margin stability.\nWhile much attention has been on the vast US tech spend, the FTSE\u2019s more mature sectors - from pharmaceuticals to financial services to industrials - are starting to realise operational improvements. These gains support margin stability and help offset cyclical headwinds, laying the groundwork for continued earnings momentum into 2026.\nBank of England easing path opens\nOn the policy front, the BoE has some room to ease without stoking renewed inflation fears. UK inflation - which rose to around 3.8% in the latter part of 2025 - seems to have renewed its downward trajectory.\nThis gives policymakers the flexibility to cut interest rates at a measured pace into 2026.\nUK inflation with BoE target rate graph\nThis loosening of financial conditions provides a constructive backdrop for risk assets, particularly for rate-sensitive sectors such as housebuilders, utilities and banks.\nA \"mild Goldilocks\" blend of modest growth and gently easing policy is exactly what the FTSE tends to respond well to historically.\nValuation discount presents opportunity\nConcerns around valuation should not be overstated. The FTSE 100 - with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 14 - continues to trade at a meaningful discount to global peers.\nThe S&P 500's P/E ratio of 25 creates a gap that has persisted despite improving earnings visibility for UK companies.\nRather than signalling structural weakness, this discount increasingly reflects an opportunity: strong cash generation, high dividend yields and robust balance sheets remain core attributes.\nMeanwhile, the concentration of returns in energy, banks and big pharma simply reflects where the durable earnings are located, with little reason to expect this leadership to falter.\nTechnical and fundamental alignment\nWith the UK autumn budget out of the way and corporate buybacks steady, cash levels high and liquidity conditions improving, the FTSE's path of least resistance in 2026 is still higher.\nPullbacks will inevitably occur, as they always do in functioning markets. But the underlying backdrop of stable earnings, supportive monetary policy and strong corporate fundamentals argues for viewing weakness as opportunity rather than a warning sign.\nThe bull cycle still has room to develop, particularly if internationa"

The markets are now pricing in the 90% probability that the Fed will reduce rates by 25 basis points on December 11th.\nMeanwhile, investors also continue to monitor developments in the Ukraine peace deal.\nDelving into sectors, industrial stocks are the biggest rises, with Schneider Electric and Siemens Energy rising 3.5% and 2.8% respectively, following a ratings upgrade by JP Morgan. Banks are also performing well.\nOn the data front, eurozone retail sales are expected to rise 0.1% month on month 0.1% in October. The data will provide some clues about the economy, but is not expected to impact the ECB's monetary policy outlook.\nThe ECB is expected to leave interest rates unchanged in December, and President Christine Lagarde confirmed that the central bank sees inflation remaining around the 2% target for the medium term.\nECB chief economist Philip Lane is due to speak later today.\nUS challenger job cuts and jobless claims could also influence sentiment in the US session.\nDAX \u2013 forecast technical analysis\nThe DAX trades within a familiar range, within which it has traded since late May. The DAX has recovered from the 22,900 low, rising back above the 200 SMA, the rising trendline resistance, and 23,700 as it heads towards the 50 SMA and 24,000. A rise above here brings the November high of 24,500 into focus. A rise above here brings the 24,775 record high into play.\nSupport can be seen at 23,540, the 200 SMA, and 23,350 support. A break below here opens the door to the 23,000 support zone. Should sellers take out this level, it creates a lower low and could spur a deeper selloff towards 22,000.\nGBP/USD consolidates around 1.335 ahead of US data\nGBP/USD is consolidating around 1.3350, a two-month high, after recent gains amid renewed USD demand. However, rising expectations of a December Fed rate cut mean USD gains are limited.\nYesterday, ADP payrolls came in weaker than expected, showing that payrolls fell by 32k, the steepest decline in 18 months, and defied expectations of a 5k rise. The data adds to evidence of a weakening labour market, which the Fed has noted as a reason to cut rates again this month.\nMeanwhile, ISM services PMI data came in at a nine-month high, but prices paid eased, suggesting slowing inflationary pressures.\nAttention today is on initial jobless claims and challenging job cuts, as the market prices in a 90% probability of a 25-basis-point cut next week.\nU.S. President Trump said on Tuesday he plans to announce his choice to succeed Jerome Powell early next year. Reports are circulating that Kevin has emerged as the frontrunner to be the next Fed chair. A monetary policy dove, he is likely to support further interest rate reductions.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates at its December meeting, which could limit upside in cable. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has emphasised the need to lower inflation and interest rates to boost investment and economic activity.\nData yesterday showed the UK services PMI grew at a slower pace in November, to 51.3, down from October's 52.3, as uncertainty surrounding the budget prompted firms to delay investment in new projects.\nGBP/USD \u2013 forecast technical analysis\nGBP/USD has recovered from the 1.3040 November 20 low, rising above the descending trendline, the 50 and 200 SMA to test the 1.3350 resistance zone.\nBuyers supported by the RSI above 50 will look to extend gains beyond 1.3350 to test resistance at 1.3480 and above. Here, 1.36 comes into focus.\nFailure to hold above the 200 SMA opens the door to support at 1.32 and 1.3140, the August low. Below here, 1.30 comes into focus.\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any "

                "body": "Big Tech Stocks: Earnings Season Winners and Losers\nHighly anticipated earnings releases saw most stocks down, but there have been winners.\nWith Nvidia NVDA reporting on Nov. 19, the Big Tech earnings season has come to an end, and the market\u2019s verdict is decidedly mixed, especially for the artificial intelligence boom.\nSome names were big winners, like Alphabet GOOGL, which has surged 8% since reporting, backed by strong AI momentum and cloud growth. At the other end is Meta Platforms META, which fell almost 22% amid concerns about its massive spending on AI projects. Then there was AI leader Nvidia, which slid 3% the day after reporting despite posting earnings that impressed Wall Street.\nHere\u2019s a look at how nine key technology stocks (some of which, like Amazon AMZN, are officially classified in other sectors) have performed since reporting earnings.\nPost-Earnings Big Tech Winners\nAlphabet saw its shares surge 8% after reporting earnings on Oct. 29. Morningstar equity analyst Malik Ahmed Khan says the firm\u2019s strong AI execution, highlighted by momentum for its Gemini app and solid ad performance, \u201ccontinues to drive results while refuting the AI-led disruption narrative.\u201d\nDespite the positive results, Khan believes there is still more to good news to come for Alphabet: \u201cContinued cloud momentum, coupled with search resilience and adoption of Gemini, will all serve as positive catalysts in 2026.\u201d At $289.45 per share, Alphabet trades at a 15% discount to its fair value estimate of $340.00. \u201cThe market reaction to earnings has been largely positive, but we believe there is more room to run and continue to view Alphabet as undervalued,\u201d says Khan.\nPost-Earnings Big Tech Losers\nFor the other tech stocks, earnings season did not go well. The big decline in Meta, which reported on Oct. 29, was fueled by concerns surrounding the firm\u2019s immense capital spending on AI. \u201cWe understand investors\u2019 fears around investment in AI,\u201d says Khan. \u201cAfter a scarring Reality Labs misallocation of capital, investors are again doubting Meta\u2019s capital allocation strategy for AI.\u201d\nHowever, Khan believes the heavy expenditures are justified from a strategic perspective: \u201cWe think it is important that Meta invests in its own foundation models. Simply put, the costs of running someone else\u2019s model at Meta\u2019s scale are not economically feasible and would cause material margin compression.\u201d At $589.15 per share, Meta trades at a 31% discount to its fair value estimate of $850.00. Khan believes Meta stock is undervalued: \u201cWe are not as pessimistic as the market appears to be.\u201d\nMicrosoft has also taken its lumps since reporting earnings on Oct. 29, falling 12%. Morningstar\u2019s Dan Romanoff observes that as with other software companies, investors have been concerned about AI\u2019s impact on its business model. \u201cAs customers continue to evaluate AI and what it might mean for them, their software spending has been more subdued, especially after the surge during the covid lockdowns,\u201d he explains. \u201cMeanwhile, software vendors in general are not showing much in the way of AI monetization within their own portfolios, so revenue growth is not picking up.\u201d\nAt the same time, Romanoff says Microsoft appears to be well-positioned with its cloud business Azure, due to rising demand for both traditional computing and AI workloads. Coupled with its partnership with OpenAI, this has \u201chelped catapult it into a position of strength.\u201d At $478.43 per share, Microsoft trades at a 20% discount to its fair value estimate of $600.00. \u201cThe stock remains one of our top picks,\u201d says Romanoff.\nOne of the hottest tech stocks in 2025 has been data surveillance company Palantir PLTR, which rose 165% before the firm reported earnings on Nov. 3. Since then, the stock has fallen 22% despite the strong results. \u201cPalantir\u2019s earnings were great in terms of operating performance, but perfection is baked in right now, so there is some investor skepticism on those high expectations pressuring the pri"

Bondi said that additional charges could be tacked on later in the investigation.\nThe night before the 2020 electoral votes were certified, a man \u2014 now believed to be Cole \u2014 was seen stalking around Washington, DC, and planting \u201cviable explosive devices\u201d outside the Republican and Democrats\u2019 respective headquarters.\nThe devices were uncovered the following afternoon, right as Congress was finalizing the votes \u2013 and a swarm of Trump supporters were clambering into the US Capitol.\nUnder the Biden administration, the FBI offered a $500,000 reward for any information leading to an arrest.\nThe Trump administration renewed the reward offer in early October alongside the release of a new video showing the suspect walking around a residential DC neighborhood the same night the bombs were planted.\nAuthorities alleged that Cole purchased items from several retailers around northern Virginia, including eight different Home Depots, a Micro Center, Lowes and Walmart. They believe he started building the bombs in 2019.\nThe bombs themselves were in 8-inch galvanized steel pipes with the ends capped. They were rigged with nine-volt batteries and white kitchen items, feds claimed."

                "body": "The U.S. Navy released summaries for four separate investigations into incidents that involved the USS Harry S. Truman between December 2024 and May 2025.\nThe investigation looked into the Truman\u2019s collision with a merchant vessel, along with the loss of three F/A-18 Super Hornets.\n\u201cThese investigations assessed underlying procedural compliance and standards and reviewed how a Carrier Strike Group prepares for and responds to adversity during combat operations,\u201d the investigation summary read.\nVice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby vowed that the service would learn from the incidents, especially in light of the investigation\u2019s findings.\nKilby added that the Navy would continue to invest in its service members to ensure they were ready for future challenges.\nThe USS Harry S. Truman collided with the merchant vessel Besiktas-M on Feb. 12 near Port Said, Egypt. No injuries or flooding were reported.\nRELATED\nShortly after, the service relieved Capt. Dave Snowden, commanding officer of the USS Harry S. Truman, due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command.\nThe investigation found that the collision was avoidable and that the \u201ccarrier\u2019s bridge team failed to safely navigate past the merchant vessel.\u201d\nRegarding the collision, the incident \u201ccould have caused catastrophic results,\u201d the report concluded.\nBetween December 2024 and May 2025, the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group was plagued with errors involving jets that each costs approximately $60 million.\nThe USS Gettysburg shot down an F/A-18F Super Hornet in December 2024 in an act of friendly fire, an F/A-18F Super Hornet attempting to land on the USS Harry S. Truman in May toppled overboard and an F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet fell off the hangar deck of the Truman in April.\nThe investigation found that the friendly fire incident resulted from misidentification that stemmed from a \u201clack of integrated training opportunities between USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser, and lack of cohesion across the Carrier Strike Group.\u201d\nThe April incident in which the jet and a tow tractor fell from Truman\u2019s hangar bay occurred as a result of evasive maneuvers in response to an incoming ballistic missile in the Red Sea, the summary stated. The investigation attributed the jet\u2019s loss to an aircraft brake system failure, as well as poor communication between the bridge, flight deck control and hangar bay control.\nThe investigation further found that the failed landing of an F/A-18 that forced two pilots to eject in May arose from a failure of the #4 arresting wire aboard Truman that resulted from \u201ca malfunctioning #4 starboard sheave damper.\u201d\nThe report also cited inadequate maintenance practices, low manning levels, limited knowledge, insufficient training, high operational tempo and combat conditions as catalysts for the incident.\nRiley Ceder is a reporter at Military Times, where he covers breaking news, criminal justice, investigations, and cyber. He previously worked as an investigative practicum student at The Washington Post, where he contributed to the Abused by the Badge investigation."

                "body": "Steve Cropper, acclaimed guitarist for Booker T. and the M.G.'s, dies at 84\nSteve Cropper, the lean, soulful guitarist and songwriter who helped anchor the celebrated Memphis backing band Booker T. and the M.G.'s at Stax Records and co-wrote the classics \"Green Onions,\" \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay\" and \"In the Midnight Hour,\" has died. He was 84.\nPat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, confirmed Cropper's death to CBS News. The foundation operates the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, located at the site of the former Stax Records, where Cropper worked for years.\nA cause of death was not immediately known. Longtime associate Eddie Gore told The Associated Press he was with Cropper on Tuesday at a rehabilitation facility in Nashville, where Cropper had been after a recent fall. Cropper had been working on new music when Gore visited, he said.\n\"He's such a good human,\" Gore said. \"We were blessed to have him, for sure.\"\n\"Steve was a beloved musician, songwriter, and producer whose extraordinary talent touched the lives of millions worldwide,\" Cropper's family said in a statement released through the foundation, describing his \"influence on American music is immeasurable.\"\n\"Every note he played, every song he wrote, and every artist he inspired ensure that his spirit and artistry will continue to move people for generations to come,\" the family wrote.\nThe guitarist, songwriter and record producer was not known for flashy playing, but his spare, catchy licks and solid rhythm chops helped define Memphis soul music. At a time when it was common for White musicians to co-opt the work of Black artists and make more money from their songs, Cropper was that rare White artist willing to keep a lower profile and collaborate.\nCropper was celebrated, respected by fellow guitarists\nCropper's very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \"The Blues Brothers\" and played on their hit cover of \"Soul Man.\"\nIn a 2020 interview with AP, Cropper discussed his career and how he mastered the art of filling gaps with an essential lick or two.\n\"I listen to the other musicians and the singer,\" Cropper said. \"I'm not listening to just me. I make sure I'm sounding OK before we start the session. Once we've presented the song, then I listen to the song and the way they interpret it. And I play around all that stuff. That's what I do. That's my style.\"\nRolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, asked once about Cropper, said simply, \"Perfect, man.\" On a YouTube instructional video, guitar virtuoso Joe Bonamassa says Cropper's moves are often copied.\n\"If you haven't heard the name Steve Cropper, you've heard him in song,\" Bonamassa said.\nCropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.\nCropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with \"Last Night.\"\nSatellite was later renamed Stax, where some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys formed Booker T. and the M.G.'s.

                "body": "Japan's Nikkei loses ground as investor focus shifts to BOJ, Fed meetings\nBy Rocky Swift\nJapan's Nikkei share average lost ground on Friday, pausing after a recent rally, as expectations of rising domestic interest rates weighed on sentiment.\nThe Nikkei 225 Index NI225 slid 1.4% to 50,299.09 in early trading, trimming its weekly gain to 0.1%. The broader Topix TOPIX fell 1.3%.\nAn 18-year peak in benchmark Japanese government bond yields dampened equities after a three-day rally, Nomura Securities strategist Maki Sawada said, as investors awaited policy decisions from the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee.\n\"Regarding the rise in the 10-year yield, one factor is growing speculation that the Bank of Japan may raise rates at its December meeting,\" Sawada said. \"With the FOMC looming next week, I think Japan's stock market is likely to face some selling pressure.\"\nThe BOJ is likely to raise rates this month with the government expected to tolerate such a decision, Reuters reported on Thursday. Meanwhile, traders are pricing around 86% odds of a Fed cut next Wednesday, and potentially 2-3 more reductions next year, according to LSEG-compiled data.\nThere were 26 advancers in the Nikkei index against 198 decliners. The largest losers in the index were Trend Micro 4704, down 7.1%, followed by tyre manufacturer Bridgestone 5108, which lost 4.4%.\nThe largest gainers were electronic component maker Ibiden 4062, up 4.6%, followed by nuclear industry supplier Japan Steel Works 5631, which gained 3.5%."

                "body": "TOKYO - The Nikkei stock index surged over 2 percent Thursday for the third straight day of increase, boosted by shares related to artificial intelligence amid optimism for further growth.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose 0.045 percentage point from Wednesday's close to 1.935 percent, its highest level since July 2007, amid speculation that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates at its policy meeting later this month.\nThe 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended up 1,163.74 points, or 2.33 percent, from Wednesday at 51,028.42. The broader Topix index finished 63.89 points, or 1.92 percent, higher at 3,398.21, hitting a record high.\nThe U.S. dollar, meanwhile, mostly moved narrowly in the lower 155 yen range in Tokyo due to a lack of fresh trading cues, dealers said.\nAt 5 p.m., the dollar fetched 155.24-26 yen compared with 155.17-27 yen in New York and 155.68-69 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Wednesday.\nThe euro was quoted at $1.1665-1666 and 181.09-13 yen against $1.1666-1676 and 181.01-11 yen in New York and $1.1641-1642 and 181.23-27 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday afternoon.\nThe Nikkei stock index advanced as heavyweight SoftBank Group, which saw sharp declines in November, jumped 9.2 percent to 18,200 yen after a report that the technology conglomerate plans to increase its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI by the end of the year.\nStocks of companies related to robotics technology using AI were also bought, with machinery maker Fanuc soaring 13.0 percent to 5,953 yen and robotics firm Yaskawa Electric climbing 11.4 percent to 4,769 yen.\nSoftbank shares had been under pressure as the future profitability of OpenAI came into question, partly due to Google's new Gemini AI model, said Shota Sando, an equity market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory Co.\nBut so-called \"physical AI (that integrates robotics and AI technology) emerged as a new theme for investors,\" Sando said.\nThe market was also supported by overnight Wall Street advances amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week to support the slowing labor market in the world's largest economy.\nOn the top-tier Prime Market, the main gainers were wholesale trade, information and communication and securities house issues.\nThe yield on the 10-year bonds, a key barometer of long-term interest rates, continued to climb amid growing concern that Japan's fiscal health could worsen under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's economic policy, which is accompanied by aggressive fiscal spending.\nConcerns about a lack of buyers of government bonds have grown after the government plans to issue additional debt to fund stimulus measures, while the BOJ has been slowing the pace of its bond purchases, analysts said.\n\"Caution has heightened after the government decided to increase new bond issuances in a supplementary budget,\" said Naomi Muguruma, chief bond strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.\nRising yields are likely to fuel worries about higher housing loan costs for households and borrowing costs for companies, which could adversely impact the economy."
