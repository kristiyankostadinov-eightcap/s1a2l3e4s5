                "body": "Gold prices continued their recent pullback as market participants awaited the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is scheduled to end tomorrow. Comex gold futures recovered from an intraday low of $3,901 to settle at $3,968, reflecting ongoing volatility in the precious metals market.\nThe current correction follows a remarkable rally that saw bullion prices surge more than 30% over the four-month period leading to last week's record high. According to Bank of America's \"Flow Show\" report, investor inflows into gold portfolios during this period exceeded the cumulative total recorded over the previous 14 years, underscoring the intensity of recent demand for the precious metal.\nWith gold prices holding below the psychologically significant $4,000 level, market attention has shifted to the Federal Reserve's forthcoming interest-rate decision and anticipated U.S.-China trade negotiations later this week. Bank of America analysts acknowledged the market's overbought conditions, stating that they \"agree that the market has become overbought, which finally gave rise to this week's correction.\" However, they emphasized that fundamental support for gold remains intact, noting that \"for rallies to end, the fundamental backdrop needs to change and so far that has not happened.\"\nThe precious metal has declined more than 10.5% from its record high of $4,355 established last week, representing a seven-day correction that has interrupted one of gold's most extended bull runs in history. Silver futures also experienced volatility, touching an exaggerated low of $45.51 before recovering to close at $47.14, registering a gain of $0.31, or 0.66%. The silver market found support from the possibility of easing trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.\nFundamental drivers continue to underpin the precious metals complex. Central bank purchasing has provided substantial support, with China alone accumulating 39.2 tons since resuming its gold acquisitions in November of last year. Meanwhile, gold-backed exchange-traded funds have attracted billions in new capital, with aggregate additions likely exceeding 100 tons during the three months ending in September. This figure represents more than triple the quarterly average observed over the past eight years, demonstrating sustained institutional and retail interest in gold as an investment vehicle despite the recent price correction.\nFor those that would like more information about our services click here\nWishing you as always good trading,"

                "body": "Gold prices experienced a significant surge following the release of new inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Statistics, with the precious metal climbing to $4,088.52 per ounce as investors turned to traditional safe-haven assets. The latest figures revealed that inflation increased by 3% over the past year, while the consumer price index rose by 0.3% in September alone, signaling persistent price pressures in the economy.\nThe movement in gold prices reflects growing investor concern about inflation\u2019s impact on traditional investments and currency values. As inflation erodes purchasing power and creates uncertainty in financial markets, gold has historically served as a reliable store of value during such periods. The current price surge demonstrates continued confidence in gold\u2019s ability to hedge against economic instability.\nMarket analysts anticipate that gold will remain highly sensitive to upcoming economic indicators, particularly the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decisions and future inflation reports. A confirmed interest rate cut by the Fed could provide additional momentum for gold prices, while any signs of sustained inflation may trigger further market volatility. This sensitivity underscores gold\u2019s role as a barometer for economic sentiment and monetary policy expectations.\nThe renewed interest in gold has also drawn attention to companies operating in the mining sector, such as Aston Bay Holdings Ltd., though specific details about their operations were not provided in the source material. Investors seeking additional information about mining companies can find updates through specialized financial communication platforms like MiningNewsWire, which focuses on developments in the global mining and resources sectors.\nThis latest gold price movement occurs within a broader context of economic uncertainty and shifting investment strategies. As traditional indicators like inflation continue to show strength, investors appear to be reallocating assets toward more defensive positions. The gold market\u2019s response to the inflation data suggests that many market participants view current economic conditions as warranting increased exposure to precious metals as part of a balanced investment approach.\nThis news story relied on content distributed by InvestorBrandNetwork (IBN).

                "body": "Trump says he expects to lower fentanyl tariff against China during Xi meeting\nGold and bitcoin are touted as the \u201canti-dollar\u201d, or in some people\u2019s minds, possible replacements for the US dollar. Thus, one would expect the dollar-debasement trade to benefit gold and bitcoin similarly. The reality throughout this year has not been what many would expect. For example, gold is up over 50% this year, while bitcoin is up about 13% and slightly underperforming the S&P 500.\nAs we share in the screenshot below, the excess returns for bitcoin (IBIT), gold (BLD), and the US dollar index relative to the S&P 500 over consecutive periods are not what one would expect. For example, over the last five days, gold has fallen by almost 5% but bitcoin is up 2%. This same pattern, with one of the two assets up versus the market while the other is down, has held throughout the seven consecutive periods, totaling 245 trading days. We also share the relative performance of the US dollar index in the graphic.\nIf gold and bitcoin are perceived as the investment of choice in a true US dollar debasement, why are they not acting very similarly? This question leads us to an answer we have recently been giving on why gold prices are surging. Our answer is speculation, not fundamentals.\nWhile the debasement narrative may seem strong, it has many holes as we have written recently- (US dollar Debasement & Money Supply Growth). Given our fundamental view, we find it highly likely that gold and bitcoin are not trading in sync because fast money is moving between the two, not into both simultaneously.\nThe divergence in returns suggests to us that speculative trading is playing a role in this year\u2019s outsized gold returns. Be careful trading the narratives!\nOverbought And Underperforming\nOnce again, the market is hitting record highs, and its breadth is far from ideal. The table below shows that on an absolute basis, about three-quarters of the stock factors are decently overbought. However, most are also oversold relative to the S&P 500. Presuming the bullish trend continues, we expect breadth to worsen further, as it has throughout the year.\nIt\u2019s worth adding that technically, there are negative divergences between the S&P 500 and its MACD and RSI. Bad breadth and negative divergences have been consistently appearing this year. This certainly doesn\u2019t mean the rally is ending, but it does mean we need to keep paying close attention to our risk measures. More simply, it\u2019s not a time to get complacent. Yet at the same time, the situation doesn\u2019t support meaningful risk reduction either.\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.

                "body": "The EUR/USD pair has posted a five-session winning streak, establishing a defined bullish bias in favor of the euro in the short term as key monetary policy decisions approach in both the United States and Europe. For now, buying pressure remains firm amid expectations that the Fed\u2019s rate-cut cycle will continue, which could reduce the attractiveness of the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain a neutral stance. If this monetary policy divergence persists, a stronger buying bias could develop in the EUR/USD pair in the short term.\nWhat\u2019s the Current Central Bank Dynamic?\nThe Federal Reserve is set to announce its policy decision on October 29, followed by the European Central Bank meeting on October 30, marking this week as a crucial one for both the euro and the dollar. Any comments related to monetary policy could have a significant impact on the performance of both currencies in the coming weeks.\nIn the case of the United States, expectations point toward another rate cut, bringing the current level down from 4.25% to around 4.00%, according to data from the CME Group, which assigns a 96.7% probability to a 25-basis-point reduction. It is unlikely that the decision will differ from expectations, mainly because the Fed has been unable to fully assess recent labor market data due to the government shutdown. Therefore, the central bank is expected to maintain its plan for gradual rate cuts until new economic data suggest otherwise. In fact, the probability of another reduction to 3.75% for the December 10 meeting stands at 87.9%, reinforcing the view that interest rates will continue to decline into late 2025.\nSource: CMEGROUP\nIn Europe, the outlook differs. For the October 30 meeting, the market assigns a 94.7% probability that the deposit rate will remain unchanged at 2.00%. The ECB has repeatedly emphasized that any future rate cuts will depend on further evidence of slowing inflation, allowing room for a more accommodative stance. For now, the ECB appears to have adopted a neutral position, in contrast to the Federal Reserve, which is clearly leaning toward a more dovish policy path.\nSource: ECB Watch\nFor several months, the Fed and the ECB have maintained an interest rate differential that favored U.S. investments. However, as the United States begins its rate-cutting cycle, this gap has started to narrow, benefiting euro-denominated investments. As the appeal of U.S. bonds diminishes, capital flows could shift toward more stable markets such as Europe. This could reduce demand for the dollar and support the euro in the short term.\nSource: Tradingeconomics\nFinally, if both central banks confirm their respective stances \u2014 with the Fed maintaining lower rates and the ECB remaining neutral \u2014 the rate differential between both regions may continue to narrow, reducing the appeal of dollar-based investments. This scenario could result in sustained buying pressure on the EUR/USD, provided there are no unexpected policy shifts as 2025 draws to a close.\nEUR/USD Technical Outlook\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Sideways Range: Since July 1, the EUR/USD has been trading within a sideways range, with resistance near 1.18219 and support around 1.15685. So far, price movements have not been strong enough to break this structure, which remains the dominant technical formation. As long as the pair stays within this range, it is unlikely to establish a clear directional trend in the coming weeks.\n- RSI: The RSI line continues to fluctuate around the neutral 50 level, indicating a balance between bullish and bearish momentum over the past 14 sessions. This behavior suggests a more pronounced neutrality in the short term until new fundamental catalysts emerge to drive a clearer directional bias.\n- MACD: The MACD histogram oscillates around the neutral line (0), reflecting a technical equilibrium in short-term moving averages. As long as this condition persists, indecision may continue to dominate pric"

Optimism surrounding US-China trade deals weighs on the riskier currency, like the Euro (EUR) against the US Dollar (USD). Traders brace for the Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision later on Wednesday. On Thursday, the attention will shift to the European Central Bank monetary policy meeting.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he expects to reduce US tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Beijing\u2019s commitment to curb exports of fentanyl precursor chemicals, per Reuters. US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent stated that he also anticipated that the Chinese officials would agree to increase purchases of US-grown soybeans, enhance cooperation with the US to halt the flow of chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl, and sign off on a finalized TikTok deal.\nTraders will closely monitor the meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea to decide on a framework that defuses trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Positive developments surrounding trade negotiations could lift the Greenback and act as a headwind for the major pair.\nOn the other hand, the Fed is expected to cut its benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at its October meeting on Wednesday, bringing the Federal Funds Rate target to 3.75%-4.00%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference will be closely watched, as it might offer some hints about the US interest rate path and provide insight into the economic outlook. Any dovish remarks from the Fed officials could drag the USD lower against the EUR.\nAcross the pond, the ECB is anticipated to hold interest rates steady on Thursday, marking the third consecutive meeting with no change to the key deposit rate. ECB President Christine Lagarde indicated that the current monetary policy is \"in a good place\u201d and will adopt a data-dependent approach without pre-committing to a future rate path.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on t"

The pair weakens as the Pound Sterling (GBP) declines following data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showing UK food prices falling at the fastest pace in nearly five years, strengthening expectations of upcoming Bank of England (BoE) rate cuts.\nTraders now assign roughly a 68% probability to a quarter-point BoE rate cut in December, as softer inflation and fiscal headwinds provide the central bank with greater scope to ease policy. Expectations for rate cuts also strengthened after reports that the Office for Budget Responsibility plans to lower its UK productivity growth forecast by about 0.3 percentage points, a downgrade that could widen the fiscal gap by nearly \u00a320 billion. The revision has intensified concerns ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s November budget, which is expected to address a potential shortfall of up to \u00a335 billion.\nHowever, the downside of the GBP/USD pair could be restrained as the US Dollar (USD) remains subdued ahead of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy decision due later in the day. The Fed is widely expected to lower interest rates by another quarter point, bringing the benchmark rate to 3.75-4.00%, at its October meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool indicates that markets are now pricing in a Fed rate cut in October and a 91% possibility of another reduction in December.\nTraders will be watching for any signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding the pace of future easing, as markets have already priced in another rate cut in December. The October CNBC Fed Survey also indicates that the Fed could implement additional rate reductions over the next two meetings.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pou"

Meanwhile, the GBP/USD pair later gained strength, reaching near 1.3365, supported by anticipation of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\nAustralian Inflation Data And RBA Meeting\nAustralia is set to release new inflation data on Wednesday, just before the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s policy meeting scheduled for November 3-4. The data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics will include two different inflation measures for the third quarter of 2025.\nGlobal markets started the week stronger following a trade deal framework between the US and China, led by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. This development was a positive shift after prolonged tensions and trade threats.\nIn the cryptocurrency market, Pump.fun (PUMP) continued its recovery, trading above $0.0050. This rise suggests growing optimism and the potential for a rally at the end of the month.\nWe are seeing significant pressure on the Pound as the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s planned productivity cuts point to a large hole in public finances. This news has already pushed the GBP/USD pair below the key 1.3300 level. UK public sector net borrowing is now forecast to be \u00a320 billion higher than previously expected, casting a shadow ahead of the new budget.\nFederal Reserve Rate Cut Expectations\nHowever, this Sterling weakness is being countered by growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut tomorrow. After a softer US jobs report earlier this month, the CME FedWatch Tool shows markets are pricing in over a 70% probability of a cut, which is weighing on the US Dollar. This central bank divergence explains why the pair is struggling for a clear direction, currently bouncing around 1.3350.\nFor derivative traders, this creates an environment ripe for volatility plays on Sterling, as we saw during the fiscal uncertainty back in late 2022. Buying straddles or strangles on GBP/USD could be a prudent way to trade the outcome of the Fed meeting and the lead-up to the UK budget announcement. Volatility options on the pound appear to be a sensible position for the coming weeks.\nLooking elsewhere, we see a clear event risk in the Australian Dollar with the quarterly inflation report due tomorrow. The market consensus is for a 1.1% quarterly rise, which would push the annual inflation rate back towards 4.5%. This data will be critical for the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s interest rate decision next week.\nA higher-than-expected inflation figure could force the RBA into a more hawkish stance, likely sending the AUD/USD pair higher. Traders should be prepared for a sharp move following the release. Positioning with puts or calls offers a defined-risk way to speculate on a surprise from the Australian Bureau of Statistics."

I suspect the figures won\u2019t reach the 0.9% q/q threshold highlighted by RBA Governor Michelle Bullock \u2014 a result that could keep hopes of a rate cut alive next week and weigh on the Australian dollar.\nA hammer candle has formed on the daily chart around the 100 handle, with Monday and Tuesday\u2019s highs resembling a tweezer top (or a potential double top on lower timeframes). While there may be some wriggle room around this week\u2019s highs, bears will likely look for confirmation of a false break above the tweezer top as a cue for a leg lower towards the January high near 99.17. A sustained move below 99.00 would open the door to a deeper pullback.\nThat said, a combination of softer Australian inflation and a hawkish Bank of Japan (BOJ) outcome would likely be needed to fuel a larger correction \u2014 unless broader risk-off sentiment provides an additional catalyst.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView AUD/JPY\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nBulls remain firmly in control of AUD/USD, which is currently enjoying its best two-day rally in six weeks. However, with the Aussie nearing a cluster of resistance levels \u2014 and with CPI data unlikely to completely rule out an RBA cut next week \u2014 I\u2019m leaning toward a short-term pullback.\nThe October VPOC, weekly R3 pivot, and monthly pivot point all converge just below 0.66. The fact that AUD/USD has reached its weekly R3 pivot in only two sessions also suggests the rally may be overstretched.\nThat said, I\u2019m not anticipating a large sell-off by any means.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) retains part of its recent gains, supported by reduced expectations of an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Markets now assign only a 15% chance of a rate reduction next week, down from 60% previously, following RBA Governor Michele Bullock's remarks on Monday that the labor market remains \"a little tight\", despite the unexpected rise in unemployment.\nInvestors now turn their attention to Wednesday's release of Australia's monthly and third-quarter inflation data, due on Wednesday, for further guidance on the future path of interest rates. Recent Australian data point to a mixed economic picture, with the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released last week, falling to 49.7, signaling contraction, while the Services PMI rose to 53.1, indicating continued expansion.\nOn the international front, the AUD benefits from optimism surrounding progress in trade negotiations between the United States (US) and China. Both sides reportedly reached a consensus on key issues, paving the way for US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet on Thursday. The prospect of a potential deal is boosting risk appetite, particularly as China remains Australia's largest trading partner.\nIn the United States, the US Dollar (USD) remains under pressure ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve (Fed) policy decision. Markets almost fully expect a 25-basis-point rate cut, which would bring the target rate range to 3.75%-4.00%. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there is a 96% chance of another rate cut in December, as softer-than-expected inflation and signs of a cooling labor market are reinforcing these expectations.\nOverall, hopes of a durable US-China trade agreement and growing market confidence in further Fed easing keep risk sentiment supported, limiting losses for the Australian Dollar despite an uncertain backdrop.\nAustralian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "Markets brace for what could be the most volatile week for USD/JPY this quarter. Traders face uncertainty as the Fed and the Bank of Japan\u2019s interest rate decisions loom. This week, the pair slid from 153.257 on Monday, October 27, to 151.759 on Tuesday, October 28.\nJapanese government threats of intervention triggered a sharp pullback. Traders will now briefly shift their focus away from US-China trade developments toward rising expectations of Fed rate cuts and a BoJ rate hike. Speculation about a BoJ rate hike has persisted despite Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy stance. USD/JPY reclaimed the 153 handle following Takaichi\u2019s appointment as Japan\u2019s prime minister before retreating.\nWhile speculation about monetary policy divergence will influence price trends, traders should consider upcoming economic indicators.\nEconomists forecast the Japanese Consumer Confidence Index to rise from 35.3 in September to 35.6 in October. A higher reading could signal a pickup in consumer spending, potentially fueling demand-driven inflationary pressures. Furthermore, consumer spending may also boost the Japanese economy as private consumption accounts for about 55% of GDP.\nThese scenarios could support a more hawkish BoJ policy stance, raising appetite for the Japanese yen. August\u2019s US-Japan trade deal, resulting in lower levies on Japanese shipments to the US, could boost consumer confidence. However, uncertainty about the election may have tainted sentiment, potentially limiting a marked jump in confidence.\nGiven that the Bank of Japan will announce its interest rate decision on Thursday, October 30, market reaction to the data could be relatively constrained.\nWhile Takaichi favors easy policy, economists expect the BoJ to act independently. According to the Reuters poll conducted between October 14 and 20, two-thirds of economists stated the BoJ would not delay rate hikes despite Takaichi\u2019s election victory. The poll also revealed:\nWith markets expecting the BoJ to hike rates and the Fed to cut rates, monetary policy divergence could narrow US-Japan interest rate differentials, favoring the Japanese yen.\nGiven these dynamics, a narrower rate differential may push USD/JPY below 150 and the 50-day EMA. A drop below the 50-day EMA would bring the 200-day EMA and the October low of 146.585 into play. If breached, the September low of 145.481 would be the next key support level.\nWhile economists speculate about the timing of a BoJ rate hike, the Fed will take center stage later on Wednesday, October 29.\nEconomists expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Unless there is a surprise 50-basis-point cut, Fed Chair Powell will set the tone for markets. Support for a December rate cut to bolster the labor market and acknowledgement that inflation has peaked could send USD/JPY toward 150 and the 50-day EMA. If breached, the 200-day EMA would be the next key technical support level.\nThe US government shutdown could extend to day 29, leaving the Fed flying blind on crucial labor market data. Fed Chair Powell had already taken a more dovish stance before the shutdown as labor market data signaled weaker conditions.\nBeyond Fed Chair Powell\u2019s views on interest rates, there is also the potential winding down of Quantitative Tightening (QT).\nOn October 14, 2025, Fed Chair Powell gave his strongest signal on QT, stating:\n\u201cOur long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions.\u201d\nHe also noted that there were early signs of tightening liquidity conditions.\nNotably, winding down QT would also narrow the US-Japan rate differential, favoring the yen, potentially being compounded by a hawkish BoJ policy stance. This scenario could trigger a market event similar to the yen carry trade unwind on July 31, 2024.\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nFor more in-depth analysis, review today\u2019s USD/JPY tra"

From a trading standpoint, losses would need to be limited to 1.3819 IF price is heading for a breakout on this stretch with a weekly close above 1.4019 needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\u201d Despite numerous attempts to breach this key resistance zone, the bulls have been unable to mark a weekly close above with USD/CAD now off more than 1% from the October high.\nWeekly support rests at 1.3874/81- a region defined by the 38.2% retracement of the June advance and the 2022 high-week close. Note that basic channel support converges on this threshold over the next few weeks and a break / close below this slope is needed to suggest a more significant high is in place / a larger reversal is underway. Subsequent support objectives rest at the 2025 low-week close (LWC) / 61.8% retracement at 1.3734/46 and the yearly close low at 1.3583- both levels of interest for possible downside exhaustion / price inflection IF reached.\nCritical resistance remains unchanged at 1.3978-1.4019- a region defined by the 2022 swing high, the 52-week moving average, and the 38.2% retracement of the yearly range. Note that the 2022 trendline also converges on this threshold and a breach / weekly close above is needed put the bulls back in control and mark resumption of the June uptrend. Subsequent resistance objectives are eyed at the February close low at 1.4183 with the next major technical consideration eyed at the 2025 high-week close (HWC) / 61.8% retracement at 1.4292-1.4315- look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nBottom line: The USD/CAD rally has stalled at key resistance for the past four-weeks with the bulls relenting ahead of major event risk over the next 24 hours. From a trading standpoint, the near-term risk is tilted to the downside, but losses should be limited to 1.3874 IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a weekly close above 1.4019 needed to fuel the next leg of the advance.\nThe highly anticipated Bank of Canada and Federal Reserve rate decisions are on tap tomorrow, with both central banks widely expected to deliver 25bps cuts. Traders will focus on forward guidance from the Fed, particularly regarding expectations for the December policy meeting and any signal on the future of quantitative tightening (QT). Markets currently assign an 88% probability of another rate cut before year-end. Stay nimble into the release & subsequent presser with Powell and watch the weekly / monthl"

The pair depreciates as the US Dollar (USD) remains subdued ahead of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy decision due later in the day.\nThe Fed is widely expected to lower interest rates by another quarter point, bringing the benchmark rate to 3.75-4.00%, at its October meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool indicates that markets are now pricing in a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in October and a 91% possibility of another reduction in December.\nTraders will be watching for any signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding the pace of future easing, as markets have already priced in another rate cut in December. The October CNBC Fed Survey also indicates that the Fed could implement additional rate reductions over the next two meetings.\nThe US Dollar received support from the optimism over the upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, due on Thursday. The Greenback may further draw support if the two leaders finalize a framework that could pause higher US tariffs and China\u2019s rare earth export controls.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) is also expected to implement a 25-basis-point rate cut later on Wednesday. However, Canada\u2019s relative rate outlook remains more favorable, as the 2.25% policy rate still provides positive real yields against a 2.4% headline CPI. Analysts believe October\u2019s cut will likely mark the end of the BoC\u2019s easing cycle, with policymakers expected to adopt a neutral-to-hawkish tone amid moderate inflation pressures and a higher unemployment rate.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a"

                "body": "- Fed and BoC both expected to cut 25bp today\n- USD/CAD 200-day moving average key for directional risks\n- Tone and guidance from Fed and BoC likely to drive volatility\nSummary\nToday\u2019s twin central bank decisions from the Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada come with high expectations of rate cuts, though the tone and guidance from policymakers will likely dictate market direction. With both central banks seen prioritising growth risks over inflation, attention turns to whether either delivers a surprise that shifts pricing along the curve. For USD/CAD, trade optimism has been the dominant influence recently, but the technical setup suggests a market leaning bearish heading into these events, with price action around the 200-day moving average likely to determine the next move.\nFed statement, vote split key\nThe Federal Reserve is fully expected to cut rates by 25bp today, lowering the funds rate to a range of 3.75\u20134%. Swaps suggest the move is a lock, with markets also pricing a roughly 95% chance of another cut in December. With no new forecasts due, attention will centre on the wording of the policy statement, the voting split, and Chair Powell\u2019s press conference.\nGiven limited data during the government lockdown, major changes to the statement are unlikely. The Fed may retain its view that job gains have \u201cslowed\u201d and inflation remains \u201csomewhat elevated,\u201d though softer September CPI data could see a slightly more dovish tone. There\u2019s also a chance the Fed signals an end to quantitative tightening, though December remains the more likely timing. Any such announcement would probably weigh modestly on the dollar.\nPowell is expected to sound dovish, reiterating that little has changed since the easing cycle resumed in September. A dissent from Stephen Miran in favour of a 50bp cut looks almost certain, while broader support for a larger move would send a strong dovish signal. For markets, the key takeaway will be whether Powell reinforces the idea that the Fed\u2019s bias has shifted more firmly toward supporting growth as labour market momentum fades.\nSource: Bloomberg\nRisks to guide BoC policy\nBefore the Fed decision, the Bank of Canada is also widely expected to cut rates by 25bp, taking its policy rate to 2.25% as it looks to cushion an economy hit hard by trade uncertainty and weak private demand. Swaps imply an 86% chance of a move at this meeting and around a one-in-five chance of another cut in December.\nDespite inflation accelerating and core measures remaining above 3%, the bank\u2019s focus appears to have shifted toward managing downside risks rather than reacting to data. Governor Tiff Macklem said last week the BoC would be \u201cputting more emphasis on potential risks\u201d when setting policy, noting there was \u201ca lot of uncertainty\u201d and that officials \u201cwill have to be humble about our forecast.\u201d That suggests policy may favour of supporting growth at the expense of tackling inflation, as seen with a number of other G10 central banks recently.\nPrime Minister Carney\u2019s upcoming budget is expected to boost spending and widen the deficit, but it\u2019s unlikely to offset weakness across the private sector. With trade tensions escalating and business confidence sliding, policymakers look set to prioritise risk management over inflation control for now.\nRates Reaction May Not Last Long\nWhile correlation analysis indicates that optimism over a lasting US-Canada trade truce ahead of this week\u2019s Trump\u2013Xi meeting has been the dominant driver of USD/CAD recently, similar to patterns observed in other cyclical currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, today\u2019s policy decisions remain highly relevant. Both the Fed and BoC could still move the dial, particularly if either delivers a surprise or attempts to steer market expectations further along the curve. However, while a spike in volatility is likely, the longer term influence on USD/CAD may be limited.\nUSD/CAD Slices Through 200DMA\nSource: TradingView\nFrom a technical standpoint, th"

                "body": "The GBP/JPY experienced a notable drop of nearly 200 pips, or 0.97%, falling below the 202.00 level for the first time since Friday. Trading at 201.94 as the Asian session begins, the pair is at its steepest daily decline in over a week.\nTechnical analysis suggests a possibility of further depreciation if GBP/JPY breaks below September\u2019s high of 201.27. Key support levels include the 50-day SMA at 200.63 and 100-day SMA at 199.29, with October\u2019s low at 197.49 acting as a further support.\nResistance After A Rebound\nShould the GBP/JPY rebound above 202.00, resistance may form at 203.00 and weekly highs at 204.24. Meanwhile, the British Pound weakened this week against several major currencies, seeing a loss against the US Dollar and others.\nPercentage changes depicted in a heat map show fluctuations among major currencies, with GBP facing notable declines against others. Each box provides the percentage change when comparing the base currency from the left column against the quote currency on the top row.\nThe article includes additional mentions of financial trends, decisions from the Fed and BoC, and US-China trade discussions, reflecting dynamic global market conditions.\nReacting To Retail Sales Figures\nThe sharp drop in GBP/JPY below the 202.00 level is a significant warning sign for us. This nearly 200-pip move broke the 20-day moving average, a key short-term support level that traders were watching closely. The immediate focus in the coming days should be on whether this level can be reclaimed or if it signals a deeper correction.\nWe believe this weakness in the Pound is partly a reaction to last week\u2019s disappointing UK retail sales figures, which came in at -0.3% against an expected 0.2% growth. This has led to some repricing of Bank of England rate hike expectations for early 2026. This data adds a layer of fundamental pressure on top of the bearish technical picture.\nOn the other side of the pair, Bank of Japan officials continue to signal a cautious approach to any policy changes, which keeps the yen fundamentally weak over the long term. This divergence is why the broader uptrend remains technically in place despite the recent sell-off. We saw a similar dynamic during the high inflation period of 2023, where dips were often seen as buying opportunities.\nGiven the uncertainty, we are seeing traders use options to manage their risk around these key levels. The break below 202.43 has led to increased demand for put options with strike prices near the 50-day moving average at 200.63. This strategy allows for downside protection while waiting for a clearer trend to emerge.\nConversely, if the pair manages a sustained recovery above 202.00, we anticipate a shift in derivatives positioning. Traders would likely look at short-dated call options targeting the 203.00 psychological level. A firm move back into the previous range could trap recent sellers and fuel a quick rebound."

                "body": "The GBP/JPY fell below 203.00 as speculation of Japanese intervention strengthened the Yen. Following a three-day rise to 204.25, the exchange rate dropped below 203.00 due to growing demand for the Yen and resulting in a potential end to its upward trend.\nJapanese Economic Minister Minoru Kiuchi emphasised the importance of stable currency moves reflecting fundamentals. Anticipation of Japanese government intervention caused Yen bears to reduce bets, impacting the GBP/JPY exchange rate.\nBank Of Japan Policy Expectations\nThe Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current stance during its upcoming meeting, despite increasing Japanese inflation pressures. Japan\u2019s inflation has consistently exceeded the BoJ\u2019s 2% target, suggesting a potential rate hike soon.\nA hawkish BoJ perspective contrasts with the Bank of England\u2019s potential easing measures. Concerns over the UK\u2019s fiscal outlook ahead of the Autumn budget further weaken the Pound, potentially leading GBP/JPY below 202.45.\nThe value of the Japanese Yen relies on the country\u2019s economic performance and the BoJ\u2019s policies. A narrowing yield differential with the US due to changes in monetary policies has affected the Yen, also considered a safe haven during market stress.\nTraders Strategic Consideration\nGiven the sharp drop in GBP/JPY below 203.00, we are seeing clear momentum driven by fears of Japanese intervention. These fears are not unfounded; we remember the significant yen-buying interventions in late 2022, which showed that authorities are willing to act when they feel currency moves are too rapid. The current verbal warnings from government ministers are creating a tense atmosphere ahead of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) meeting this Thursday.\nThe upcoming BoJ decision is the most critical event this week. While no immediate policy change is expected, we must pay attention to the persistent inflation data. Japan\u2019s core inflation has remained above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for over three years, with the latest figures for September 2025 showing a reading of 2.7%, keeping the pressure on for a potential rate hike in the near future.\nThis contrasts sharply with the situation in the United Kingdom, where the Bank of England (BoE) is facing a different challenge. UK inflation has cooled significantly, coming in at 2.2% last month, while recent quarterly GDP growth was a stagnant 0.1%. This divergence in economic outlooks supports a weaker pound sterling against a potentially more hawkish yen.\nFor derivative traders, this environment suggests positioning for further downside in GBP/JPY. Buying put options with a strike price around 202.00 could be a direct way to profit from a continued slide, especially with the BoJ meeting acting as a potential catalyst. The increased chatter around intervention has caused a spike in implied volatility, making options pricier but also reflecting the significant risk in the market.\nConsidering this heightened volatility, a bear put spread could be a more cost-effective strategy to express a moderately bearish view. This involves buying a higher-strike put and selling a lower-strike put to finance the position and cap potential gains. This would allow us to profit from a move down towards the 202.00 level while limiting our initial cash outlay."

                "body": "The British Pound weakened against the Japanese Yen, trading around 201.70, down nearly 1% for the day. This decline comes as the Yen strengthened, supported by calls for sound monetary policies and concerns over exchange rate volatility in Japan.\nJapan\u2019s Economy Minister acknowledged the mixed effects of a weaker Yen, which boosts exporters but increases import costs. Emphasising the need for stable foreign exchange rates, he cautioned against rapid fluctuations for Japan\u2019s economic stability.\nNew Agreement Between US And Japan\nIn separate talks, US and Japan reached a new agreement on rare-earth and critical minerals to enhance supply chain resilience. Japan committed to increasing imports of US agricultural products and vehicles.\nThe market now anticipates the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy decision, with expectations of maintaining the benchmark rate at 0.50%. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s focus is on the Bank of England meeting, where rates are expected to remain at 4.00% before possible cuts beginning in early 2026.\nA Reuters poll indicated inflation in the UK may ease to 3.6% this quarter, with a gradual decrease through to 2027. The Japanese Yen outperformed the British Pound among major currencies today.\nWith the Japanese Yen strengthening on intervention risk, we see growing pressure against the long GBP/JPY trend. The comments from US and Japanese officials are a clear warning that the days of unchecked yen weakness may be ending. This shift suggests that positioning for a downturn in the currency pair is becoming more prudent.\nProjected Market Volatility And Trading Strategies\nThe risk of direct market intervention by Japanese authorities is now the highest it has been all year, which means derivative traders should brace for a spike in volatility. We saw back in the spring of 2024 how quickly the Ministry of Finance can act, spending over 9 trillion yen to trigger a sharp rally in the currency when it was deemed too weak. One-month implied volatility for yen pairs will likely rise ahead of the Bank of Japan meeting, making options strategies like buying GBP/JPY puts attractive for downside protection.\nThis situation is magnified by the crowded nature of the anti-yen trade. For months, speculative positioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has shown a massive net short position against the yen. A sudden policy shift from the Bank of Japan or official intervention could trigger a violent short squeeze, forcing a rapid unwind of these positions and fueling a JPY rally.\nAt the same time, the Bank of England is signaling a dovish stance, with markets now pricing in the first interest rate cuts for early 2026. This contrasts sharply with the Bank of Japan, which is facing pressure to move away from its ultra-loose policy. The narrowing interest rate differential between the UK and Japan will remove a key source of support for the pound.\nLooking ahead to the BoE meeting on November 6th, the expectation of rates holding at 4.00% with a dovish bias presents an opportunity. Traders could consider selling out-of-the-money GBP/JPY call options with expirations in late November. This strategy would profit if the pair stagnates or falls, which aligns with both the threat of yen strength and the anticipated softness in the pound."

Yet the numbers reveal something far more fragile.\nOn Oct. 28, Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, noted that US-traded Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $26.9 billion in inflows year-to-date.\nHowever, that headline figure hides a stark imbalance that BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone accounts for roughly $28.1 billion of those flows.\nIn other words, Bitcoin ETFs would be in net outflows this year without IBIT. The product\u2019s relentless accumulation has single-handedly offset redemptions across competitors, keeping aggregate inflows positive and sustaining Bitcoin\u2019s narrative of institutional adoption.\nA market held by one fund\nSince launching in early 2024, IBIT has dominated every major performance metric in the ETF ecosystem.\nAccording to SoSo Value data, it has seen about $65.3 billion in lifetime inflows, compared to $21.3 billion across all other Bitcoin funds combined.\nMeanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC has suffered roughly $24.6 billion in redemptions, confirming that without IBIT, the aggregate picture would be deeply negative.\nThis effectively means that BlackRock\u2019s IBIT scale stands in a league of its own.\nThe fund drew $37 billion in its debut year and has added another $28 billion so far in 2025, pushing its total assets under management past $90 billion, which is well ahead of any competitor.\nAccording to Coinperps data, Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold about 1.3 million BTC, and IBIT accounts for over 60% of that entire stash.\nWhy BlackRock\u2019s IBIT was able to dominate\nA significant part of IBIT\u2019s growth can be linked to the fact that BlackRock has used its $12.5 trillion AUM, retail brokerage channels, and institutional relationships to channel demand into a single flagship product.\nThe asset manager\u2019s entry into the emerging industry instantly conferred legitimacy on a sector still reeling from the broader crisis of trust.\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF Analyst, said:\n\u201cWhen BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30,000 and the stench of FTX was still in air. It\u2019s now [over] $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.\u201d\nApart from that, the fund\u2019s recent success can also be linked to how Bitcoin has transformed BlackRock\u2019s investor base.\nLast year, the firm revealed that three out of four IBIT investors were entirely new to BlackRock\u2019s iShare product suite.\nThis shows that IBIT has become not just a crypto ETF but also a client-acquisition engine for the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\nIndeed, the asset manager\u2019s custom creation mechanisms have become increasingly popular among large Bitcoin holders, or \u201cwhales,\u201d who were once wary of traditional financial institutions. These mechanisms allow investors to transfer their Bitcoin directly to the ETF in exchange for new shares, bypassing the need to sell on the open market.\nSo far, the firm has reportedly processed over $3 billion in such in-kind transfers, reflecting the strong confidence in its custodial design and long-term exposure model.\nThis strong dominance has created a halo effect that has proven very profitable for BlackRock.\nBarely more than a year old, IBIT already ranks as BlackRock\u2019s top ten revenue generators, surpassing long-standing funds like the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF.\nWhat happens when the flows slow?\nIBIT\u2019s overarching dominance of the Bitcoin ETF space begs the question of what will happen when its numbers eventually slow down.\nIf IBIT\u2019s inflows taper, the immediate impact would be felt across market liquidity and price stability. At its current size, even a modest reduction in buying could remove a significant source of consistent demand. That demand has acted as "

                "body": "SharpLink Gaming, one of the largest publicly traded holders of Ethereum, announced Tuesday that it plans to deploy $200 million in ETH from its treasury onto the Linea layer-2 network.\nThe deployment will occur over multiple years using risk-managed strategies, the firm said in a statement, and will take place in collaboration with Linea creator Consensys. (Disclaimer: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)\nThe initiative enables SharpLink to generate enhanced yields on its ETH holdings through multiple sources: Native Ethereum staking rewards, restaking rewards from securing EigenCloud Autonomous Verifiable Services, and incentives from Linea and partner Ether.fi.\nSharpLink said that all operations will maintain institutional-grade security through its ETH custodian, Anchorage Digital Bank.\n\u201cAs one of the largest public holders of ETH, we manage our treasury with institutional rigor and discipline,\u201d said SharpLink Co-CEO Joseph Chalom, in a statement. \u201cThis deployment enables us to access the best of Ethereum\u2019s staking, restaking and DeFi yield, while maintaining the institutional safeguards our stockholders expect.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a foundational step in our broader strategy to responsibly generate enhanced staking yield and optimize treasury performance in a way that maximizes stockholder value,\u201d he added, \u201cand marks the beginning of a much larger effort.\u201d\nBeyond immediate yields, the partnership aims to pioneer institutional capital markets infrastructure on Ethereum, including on-chain capital raises, programmable liquidity tools, and tokenized equity strategies.\nChalom previously told Decrypt that the firm was weighing how best to tap into Linea for yield ahead of last month\u2019s launch of the LINEA token. SharpLink is a member of the Linea Consortium, a collective of firms and projects helping to distribute token rewards and drive adoption of the layer-2 scaling network.\n\u201cWhen you hold billions of dollars of ETH and you're looking at a portfolio of staking, there is going to be an ability to deploy that through staking opportunities on Linea,\u201d Chalom told Decrypt in early September.\nSharpLink Makes First Ethereum Buy in Over a Month as ETH Holdings Top $3.5 Billion\nSharpLink is currently the second-largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum with nearly 860,000 ETH, or about $3.56 billion worth. The firm\u2019s share price is slightly up on the day, with SBET recently trading hands at $14.34.\nEthereum is on the rebound, rising 8% over the last seven days to a recent price of $4,169 after diving below the $3,700 mark earlier this month. Users on Myriad\u2014a prediction market created by Decrypt\u2019s parent company, Dastan\u2014remain bullish on ETH\u2019s next step, giving a nearly 79% chance of ETH rising to a price of $4,500 sooner than it can plunge to $3,100."

                "body": "Is Ethereum Foundation changing its treasury management strategy?\nYes, the Ethereum Foundation has recently shifted from a passive \"hold ETH\" strategy to actively including decentralized finance (DeFi) tools in its treasury management. This means a significant amount of their assets are now in a new multisignature wallet, and they are looking to cap annual operational expenses while deploying assets into reputable DeFi protocols.\nWhat does this mean for operational efficiency and transparency?\nThis shift is expected to enhance operational efficiency as well as transparency. By leveraging DeFi protocols, the Ethereum Foundation aims to generate yield on their assets without needing to sell them, improving cash flow management and minimizing market volatility risks. The transactions made will be visible on the blockchain, thus enhancing trust.\nCan other companies benefit from this approach?\nAbsolutely. Other organizations, especially in the crypto space, might be inspired to adopt similar approaches to managing their treasuries. It could lead to a broader liquidity increase in the DeFi ecosystem.\nWhat risks should crypto-friendly SMEs be aware of?\nSmall and medium enterprises and crypto-friendly businesses should keep in mind the risks involved. Market volatility is a major concern as cryptocurrencies can experience swift price changes. Liquidity issues may arise when funds are locked in illiquid assets. Counterparty risks are also prevalent, particularly when holding crypto on exchanges, and regulatory complications can create compliance burdens.\nWhat can be the advantages of employing DeFi tools?\nThe benefits, however, are noteworthy. DeFi tools can offer diversification and income generation opportunities. Organizations can participate in yield farming or staking, securing returns on their digital assets. Utilizing decentralized custody solutions can further enhance security while automating processes can reduce transaction costs.\nHow can startups implement these strategies?\nStartups need to take a balanced and risk-aware approach when implementing these strategies. Creating a multi-year operating expense buffer in stablecoins can provide liquidity in market downturns. Excess reserves should also be invested in yield-generating opportunities. Prioritizing safety and aligning with decentralization principles is crucial, and startups can gradually increase their exposure to DeFi protocols for passive income.\nWhat are the best practices for crypto treasury management?\nFor optimal treasury management, organizations should diversify their assets across different cryptocurrencies to minimize volatility exposure. It is also wise to cap crypto exposure to keep a portion liquid and compliant. Cybersecurity measures are essential to guard against fraud and theft, and consulting financial experts might also aid in refining strategies.\nSummary\nThe Ethereum Foundation's treasury restructuring is a critical and forward-looking development in crypto finance management. As the industry evolves, the effects of DeFi adoption for treasuries will be observed, and it poses both opportunities and challenges for crypto-friendly enterprises."

(Nasdaq: SBET), one of the world\u2019s largest corporate holders of Ether (\u201cETH\u201d) and prominent industry advocate of Ethereum adoption, today announced a collaboration to deploy ETH from its corporate treasury onto Linea, a zkEVM Layer 2 network bootstrapped by Consensys. SharpLink plans to allocate $200 million in ETH for deployment on Linea in a risk-managed manner over a multi-year commitment period. As a public entity operating at the forefront of Digital Asset Treasury (\u201cDAT\u201d) innovation, SharpLink is leveraging Linea\u2019s institutional-grade infrastructure to make its ETH even more productive by unlocking scalable, secure and composable ways to optimize onchain yield.\nThis deployment on Linea brings together leading ecosystem participants in an innovative collaboration that allows SharpLink to capture highly competitive, differentiated, risk-adjusted, ETH-denominated returns. The strategy is supported by institutional-grade risk management, leveraging the scale of its digital asset treasury with the custodian protections of Anchorage Digital Bank, SharpLink\u2019s qualified custodian. The yield combines native Ethereum yield, restaking rewards from securing EigenCloud Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs), and direct Linea and ether.fi partner incentives, all within a compliant Layer 2 infrastructure.\nJoseph Chalom, Co-CEO of SharpLink, stated, \u201cAs one of the largest public holders of ETH, we manage our treasury with institutional rigor and discipline. This deployment enables us to access the best of Ethereum\u2019s staking, restaking and DeFi yield, while maintaining the institutional safeguards our stockholders expect. We are proud to be among the early institutional adopters of Linea\u2019s infrastructure, which leads the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem in terms of its standards for composability, scalability and security. This is a foundational step in our broader strategy to responsibly generate enhanced staking yield and optimize treasury performance in a way that maximizes stockholder value, and marks the beginning of a much larger effort.\u201d\nCollaboration Establishes New Institutional Pathway to DeFi Yield on Linea\nThis innovative partnership positions Linea as an emerging home for institutional ETH capital and EigenCloud as a trusted source of ETH-denominated yield. Moreover, it reinforces SharpLink\u2019s institutional approach to actively managing and deploying its treasury assets. This also reflects SharpLink\u2019s strategy to advance the Ethereum ecosystem, prioritizing institutional risk management while leveraging Ethereum\u2019s leading position in capital liquidity, trust and security.\n\u201cEthereum is becoming the programmable foundation for a new generation of financial markets,\u201d noted Joseph Lubin, Founder and CEO of Consensys, Co-Founder of Ethereum and Chairman of SharpLink. \u201cLinea was built to ensure that ETH is not just used but made more productive with every deployment. Through this initial innovative collaboration, SharpLink\u2019s ETH will earn enhanced native yield through Linea\u2019s ecosystem partners, ether.fi and EigenCloud. It\u2019s a model we believe other institutions will adopt as they look for safe, efficient ways to operate onchain.\u201d\nMike Silagadze, CEO of ether.fi, stated, \u201cWe are honored to be a primary staking solution for SharpLink\u2019s Treasury ETH. At scale, ETH treasury managers need trusted, efficient venues to put their assets to work \u2013 and these companies are setting the standard for doing so with both trust and operational excellence. We will continue to focus on bringing the best risk adjusted returns to institutions.\u201d\n\u201cSharpLink\u2019s "

The Solana (SOL) technical outlook shows consolidation near a historically strong trendline, while Hyperliquid (HYPE) price analysis points to a fresh rebound following institutional developments. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) continues to capture market attention through its Genesis Day momentum, sports partnerships, and ambitious\nTogether, these three highlight a shifting sentiment in crypto, where smart money is gravitating toward projects combining scalability, transparency, and real-world traction. Analysts now regard them among the best crypto to buy now, thanks to their strong fundamentals, active ecosystems, and growing adoption.\nThe Solana (SOL) technical outlook shows the network holding steady near $189, after testing its long-term five-year ascending trendline. Historically, this area has triggered multi-month rallies, marking it as a crucial level for future direction. Analysts note that support between $164 and $176 continues to act as a demand zone, while the recent bounce could mark the end of Solana's correction phase.\nInstitutional sentiment remains strong after Hong Kong's approval of the first Solana spot ETF, expected to attract inflows of up to $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, Solana's on-chain data remains robust, with tokenised real-world assets climbing 5.8% in a month to a record $707.79 million, and its stablecoin market cap growing 17.5% to $14.74 billion.\nThese fundamentals support a positive Solana (SOL) technical outlook, reinforcing analysts' calls that Solana could recover further from the $189 zone. With unmatched throughput exceeding 65,000 TPS, rising DeFi integration, and continued institutional exposure, Solana remains one of the best crypto to buy now for investors eyeing strong network utility and long-term upside.\nThe latest Hyperliquid (HYPE) price analysis shows a 9.43% daily rise, with HYPE trading near $38.08 after a steep correction from $59 earlier in the month. The surge followed Hyperliquid Strategies Inc.'s S-1 filing with the U.S. SEC to raise $1 billion through a public stock offering aimed at expanding its HYPE treasury. The move signals institutional-grade confidence, with funds earmarked for token buybacks and long-term ecosystem development.\nAt present, the company holds 12.6 million HYPE tokens, while another 18.43 million sit with affiliated treasury firms. Recent financial data show Hyperliquid's revenue rising 13.69% to $1.2 billion, while network value climbed to $1.28 billion. Over $644 million has already been spent on token repurchases, reinforcing market stability and signalling long-term commitment.\nHyperliquid (HYPE) price analysis shows recovery as perpetual volume jumps from $5B to $11.5B. Breaking EMA50 at $43 targets $51, with corporate backing and treasury integration boosting its Q4 2025 position.\nAmong current market frontrunners, BlockDAG continues to command global attention as it nears Genesis Day on 26 November 2025, the moment its presale transitions toward mainnet activation . The project has already raised over $430 million in its Batch 31 presale, maintaining a price of $0.0015 per BDAG. Analysts expect a listing price of $0.05, with long-term forecasts pointing toward a potential $1 valuation once network demand and miner activity scale post-launch.\nWith 312 000+ holders, over 27 billion coins sold, 20,000 hardware miners sold, and over 3.5 million X1 app miners, BlockDAG's adoption metrics stand far ahead of typical presale projects. Its hybrid Proof-of-Work + DAG architecture offers high throughput and EVM compatibility, bridging legacy Ethereum projects into faster, low-cost infrastructure.\nEqually crucial are BlockDAG's sports partnerships, led by its multi-year collaboration with the BWT Alpine F1(R) Team, which has solidified the brand's visibility across global circuits.

                "body": "In This Article\nWhen you\u2019re diving into the fast-moving Solana ecosystem, choosing the right wallet is more than just \u201cstore your tokens here\u201d. It\u2019s about usability, security, staking capability, NFT support and dApp integration.\nWith so many wallets out there, here are the top 5 picks for 2025 that cover different user-needs \u2014 whether you\u2019re a newcomer, a power user, a meme coin trader or long-term staker.\n1. Phantom Wallet\nPhantom Wallet is a sleek, user-friendly portal to the Solana ecosystem and beyond. As a non-custodial wallet, it gives you full control over your private keys, meaning you hold sole custody of your funds. The user-interface is clean and intuitive, allowing both beginners and more seasoned crypto users to easily send, receive, stake SOL, swap tokens, and manage NFTs.\nFrom the security standpoint, Phantom implements features like hardware wallet integration, private-key control and a multi-chain design which boosts its appeal. On the flip side, while it\u2019s praised widely for convenience and functionality, there are reported limitations: some users feel it lacks the depth of advanced features seen in more specialised wallets, and there have been isolated reports of interface or customer-service concerns.\nOverall, Phantom is a strong choice if you want a polished, versatile wallet that gives you quick access to the Solana ecosystem without a steep learning curve \u2014 but as always with hot wallets, you should take care of security practices (seed phrase backup, device hygiene) because the user remains responsible for their keys.\n2. Solflare Wallet\nSolflare Wallet is built with the Solana chain in focus \u2014 designed to function as an all-in-one gateway to Solana\u2019s ecosystem. Its strength lies in native features: you can easily trade Solana-based assets, stake SOL, manage tokens, connect with Solana dApps, and handle NFTs all in one interface.\nIt offers multi-platform support (web, desktop, mobile), hardware wallet compatibility, strong staking tools and a security-first posture. The user experience is generally intuitive and smooth, particularly for those who are already comfortable with crypto and want deeper ecosystem involvement.\nHowever, while the wallet is solid, some users point out occasional lag, or less breadth of multi-chain support compared to other wallets. If you are committed primarily to the Solana ecosystem, want a wallet that offers deeper Solana-native features (staking, validator access, NFT support) and prefer a wallet with strong Solana credentials, Solflare is a compelling option.\nOn the other hand, if you frequently hop between chains or use many blockchains, you might find some constraints compared to more multi-chain-first wallets.\n3. Backpack Wallet\nBackpack Wallet is a newer entrant in the crypto-wallet space, emerging with strong emphasis on the Solana ecosystem and modern features like xNFTs (executable NFTs), bridging and multi-chain support. It is designed as a self-custodial wallet (you control the keys) and has incorporated robust security features including hardware wallet integration, encrypted local key storage and scam detection.\nThe design is built to support users who want more than simple holdings: if you\u2019re interested in NFTs, executable NFTs (xNFTs), DeFi on Solana and cross-chain operations, Backpack has positioned itself as a \u201cnext-gen\u201d wallet.\nThat said, because it is newer, you might encounter fewer long-term track-record metrics compared to legacy wallets and some features are still evolving. User reviews suggest that while the interface is strong, certain advanced features (especially on mobile) may have minor bugs or limitations.\nIf your workflow involves NFTs, Solana dApps, or you\u2019re looking to explore the newer side of the ecosystem with a self-custody mindset, Backpack is an exciting option to consider.\n4. Ledger (Hardware Wallet)\nLedger hardware wallets remain the gold standard for security in crypto storage, especially when you are a serious holder of SOL and Sol"

                "body": "US stock futures had a mixed Asian market session on Wednesday, October 29, as traders brace for a potentially volatile US session. 10-year US Treasury yields hovered below 4% after two consecutive days of decline on expectations of the Fed cutting rates later today and in December. A dovish pivot could ignite a new risk-on rally.\nNotably, the Nikkei broke new ground in early trading, rising above 51,000 for the first time. Nvidia (NVDA) announced AI chip bookings worth $500 billion and an agreement to build supercomputers for the US Department of Energy, driving demand for tech stocks. The announcement came ahead of the upcoming MAG7s\u2019 highly anticipated earnings reports.\nAlthough US stock futures had a mixed start to the Wednesday session, markets are betting on a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut later in the day.\nGiven that markets have priced in the rate cut, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference and announcements regarding Quantitative Tightening (QT) will be focal points.\nFed Chair Powell\u2019s backing of an additional December rate cut, aimed at supporting a weakening labor market, and suggestions of inflation peaking, could send US stock futures to new highs. Furthermore, US stock futures could soar if the Fed signals an end to balance-sheet tightening.\n10-year US Treasury yields dropped below 4% on October 14. Markets reacted to Fed Chair Powell hinting at an end to QT. A 25-basis-point Fed rate cut and an end to QT could boost liquidity, lifting demand for US stock futures.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of 25-basis-point rate cuts in October and December stand at 99.9% and 91.0%, respectively. Notably, the chances of a December rate cut have fallen in recent sessions despite the US government shutdown extending to 28 days.\nA reopening of the government could expedite the release of crucial jobs reports, potentially shifting the Fed\u2019s policy stance. CN Wire shared details from a Bank of America research report on the potential scenarios, referencing the September dot plot, which stated:\n\u201cA slim majority of the committee felt these risks warranted at least 75bp of cuts this year. Without additional data, we think this group, which most likely includes Chair Powell, will want to follow through on the Sep dot plot. Some doves might even argue that a prolonged government shutdown amplifies downside risks to activity.\u201d\nHowever, the report signaled potential policy uncertainty if the government reopens, stating:\n\u201cIf the shutdown ends soon and the BLS simultaneously runs the Oct and Nov surveys, we might even get all three jobs reports (Sep through Nov) that would be due before the Dec FOMC meeting. In this scenario, our rule of thumb is that a Nov u-rate<=4.3% would keep the Fed on hold in Dec, while a u-rate >=4.5% (consistent with the SEP) would precipitate a cut. If we\u2019re at 4.4%, the Dec decision will be a close call, and will hinge on the broader data flow (including inflation).\u201d\nUS stock futures eye five-day winning streaks on Wednesday despite a mixed start to the day. The Dow Jones E-mini fell 49 points, while the Nasdaq 100 E-mini and S&P 500 E-mini advanced 80 points and 12 points, respectively.\nThe Fed interest rate decision, QT announcement, and Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference will be key market drivers. However, corporate earnings will also influence market sentiment.\nAlphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) will release earnings later today. Earnings will clash with the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision and Powell\u2019s press conference.\nMarkets are optimistic, leaving the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 exposed to disappointing earnings.\nBeyond policy, traders are also watching critical technical thresholds that could influence near-term momentum. Despite the mixed morning, US stock futures traded well above key technical levels after hitting record highs the previous day. The EMAs signal bullish momentum.\nThe near-term trends will hinge on the Fed, corporate earnings, the US Senate, and tra"

                "body": "FTSE 100 and Wall Street Climb to New Record Highs \u2013 Is There More Room to Grow?\nMarket analysts believe both the FTSE 100 and Wall Street have momentum to climb higher amid resilient economic data and corporate earnings, despite looming headwinds.\nGlobal stock markets are experiencing a period of remarkable growth, with new record closes becoming increasingly common. The UK's FTSE 100 hit an all-time high of 9,645.62 on 24 October 2025, maintaining its upward trajectory alongside the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe year-to-date performance of London's primary equities benchmark has surged by 18.02%, outperforming the broad S&P 500 Index (+15.5%) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+11%) in New York. Only the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has delivered a higher return since the end of 2024, gaining 20.2%.\nUK Stocks Show Strength and Confidence\nThe strong performance of the FTSE 100 reflects investor confidence and positive sentiment across markets. Notably, analysts point to the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as a key buy. Its shares rose nearly 5% to \u00a39,796 before the weekend, following robust income growth reported in the third quarter of 2025. LSEG's subsidiary, FTSE Russell, continues to maintain the FTSE 100 index.\nThe resilience of the FTSE 100 suggests that reaching the 10,000-point milestone is within reach. The index's appeal to income-focused investors is significant, thanks to its high dividend yields\u2014among the highest in developed markets.\nPotential Windfalls for UK Investors\nUK investors are poised to benefit from substantial financial gains this year, driven by dividend payouts and share buybacks. According to the AJ Bell investment platform, the FTSE 100's total cash payouts could reach \u00a379.4 billion, with an additional \u00a350.9 billion allocated to share buybacks.\nUS Markets Continue to Shine\nAcross the Atlantic, the US stock market's bullish momentum is led by the so-called 'Magnificent Seven'\u2014mega-cap technology stocks including NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple. These giants are among the world's most valuable companies by market capitalisation.\nInvestors are optimistic about the sector's prospects, driven by increasing investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation. The high projected demand for AI solutions suggests sustained gains not only for these stocks but also for the broader technology sector.\nUS Government Supports AI Growth\nThe Trump administration is actively promoting US dominance in AI through its Action Plan, which includes partnerships with industry to export American AI technologies. The US aims to deliver secure, full-stack AI solutions to allies and partners worldwide. Meanwhile, LSEG is integrating its data into Microsoft 365 Copilot and other AI tools, demonstrating cross-sector innovation.\nHeadwinds Cloud the Outlook\nDespite the positive momentum, geopolitical tensions and trade disputes threaten to dampen market enthusiasm. Recently, Canada was hit with additional US tariffs of 10%, with an exemption for imports protected under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA). The ongoing dispute between the US and Canada adds uncertainty to the trading landscape.\nUS President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are attending the ASEAN summit in Malaysia and the APEC forum in South Korea on 31 October 2025. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit.\nThere are signs that China may relax export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which could ease trade tensions. Bessent stated that 'the tariffs will be averted,' suggesting a thaw in US-China relations.\nResilience Amidst Global Tensions\nWhile US tariffs and geopolitical uncertainties have unsettled markets globally, both the FTSE 100 and Wall Street have demonstrated remarkable resilience. Factors that could sustain the rally include strong corporate earnings, an inflation rate that remains better than expected, and the possib"

                "body": "European Stocks Rise On Fed And Boe Rate Cut Optimism Amid US-China Trade Progress\nEuropean equity markets closed higher overnight, boosted by optimism about an anticipated Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut and a preliminary United States (US)-China trade framework agreed over the weekend.\nIn the United Kingdom (UK), the FTSE 100 hit a fresh record high of 9672 before closing 0.08% higher at 9653, continuing its rally following last week's cooler-than-expected UK inflation report, which showed core inflation at 3.5% year-on-year (YoY) in September (below the 3.7% expected).\nThis has fuelled expectations of further Bank of England (BoE) easing before year-end, with the UK rates market now showing a 15 basis point (bp) probability of a 25 bp rate cut for the BoE's December meeting.\nDAX faces challenges from international tensionsDAX 40 gained 0.28% to 24,307 ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank (ECB) meeting. While the DAX outperformed the FTSE 100 overnight, it is poised to underperform the FTSE 100 and its global peers again this month.\nGlobal indices performance month-to-date (MTD):\n- Nikkei 225: +12.42% MTD\n- Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI): +16.48% MTD\n- Nasdaq Composite Index (Nasdaq): +4.63% MTD\n- Cotation Assist\u00e9e en Continu (CAC 40): +4.18% MTD\n- FTSE 100: +3.24% MTD\n- Australian Securities Exchange 200 (ASX 200): +1.94% MTD\n- DAX: +1.79% MTD\n- China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300): +1.62% MTD\nThe DAX's underperformance likely stems from persistent investor caution over Germany's vulnerability to US tariffs, uncertainty about further ECB rate cuts, and concerns over escalating conflict in Ukraine, especially after President Zelenskyy signalled intensified long-range strikes on Russian energy infrastructure.\nECB interest rate meetingAt its last meeting in September, the ECB kept policy rates unchanged, including the Deposit Rate at 2%. This decision was widely anticipated and marked the second consecutive on-hold decision after the ECB cut interest rates by 175 bp between June 2024 and June 2025.\nSince September, there has been a slight uptick in headline inflation (2.2% YoY in September, up from 2.0% in August) driven by services and stabilising energy prices, while core inflation remains steady at around 2.3%.\nGrowth has been resilient but modest, with purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys indicating a pickup in business activity. Despite global trade tensions, notably US tariffs, the ECB views the economy as 'in a good place,' with balanced risks to inflation and growth, as reiterated by President Christine Lagarde's data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach.\nAs such, the expectation for Thursday's meeting is that the ECB will keep its key policy rates on hold. The European interest rate market is pricing just a 5% chance of another ECB rate cut before year-end.\nECB deposit rate chart Source: TradingEconomics Source: TradingEconomics FTSE 100 technical analysisLast night's rally in the FTSE 100 to a record high saw it lock in a sixth straight session of gains.\nFrom its April low of 7544, the FTSE 100 has now gained over 28%, which leaves it ripe for a short-term pullback. Notably, there is some bearish divergence evident on the relative strength index (RSI), with it failing to confirm FTSE 100's move to new highs.\nThis warns of a potential short correction towards the 9500 - 9400 area, after which we would expect to see the uptrend resume towards the psychologically important 10,000 mark.\nFTSE 100 daily candlestick chart Source: TradingView Source: TradingView DAX 40 technical analysisAfter a strong rally from the April low of 18,489 to the July high of 24,639, the DAX has spent the past three months consolidating its 33% gain from the April low, despite a false break to new highs in early October.\nThe corrective price action indicates that the DAX's next move will be to the upside, with a sustained break above 24,800 likely clearing the way for the rally to resume towards 25,500.\nUntil then, allow for"

But a dip in the index\u2019s \u2018current conditions\u2019 segment shows businesses are still navigating tough export and manufacturing conditions. ING analysts caution that, even with improved sentiment, the threat of stagnation is far from over \u2013 especially with German exporters facing headwinds from US tariffs and a firm euro. Meanwhile, investors are tuned in to central banks, with markets anticipating a US Federal Reserve rate cut while the European Central Bank is likely to hold steady. On the global front, the US and China have dialed back some planned tariffs and put off new rare earth restrictions, offering German industry a bit of breathing room.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Optimism meets a wall of caution.\nThe DAX\u2019s lift from business sentiment is being kept in check by ongoing export concerns and global uncertainty. Stocks like Gerresheimer and Vossloh outperformed the index on company-specific news, showing that single moves can still stand out in a cautious market. The upcoming Fed and ECB decisions could stoke volatility, especially with global trade tensions simmering just beneath the surface.\nThe bigger picture: Trade winds still blow cold.\nGermany\u2019s fortunes are tightly linked to global trade, especially with the US and China. While recent pauses on tariffs and export restrictions signal some relief, deeper challenges run through the eurozone\u2019s sluggish recovery. The final outcome of trade talks and central bank moves will likely steer Europe\u2019s economic course as it tackles thorny growth issues.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nResearch\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 11 hours ago\nQuick Take\nFinimize Newsroom \u2022 about 14 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Turbochargers have been injecting more power into engines for over 100 years, but never before have they been so prevalent in our cars. A little boost can add a lot of power and efficiency, too, making a turbocharger a great solution to eke maximum performance out of today\u2019s engines. Usually, though, that comes with the penalty of throttle lag: You put your foot to the floor, and nothing much happens for a beat or two.\nAs we\u2019ve recently seen in our review of the new 911 GTS, Porsche\u2019s engineers have worked some magic to create a turbocharger that provides all the power and fun of forced induction but with none of the throttle response penalty. If adding one high-tech, high-voltage turbocharger is good, surely two would be better, right? Indeed, it is, if you can afford the cost of entry. Meet the 701 hp (523 kW) 2026 911 Turbo S, Porsche\u2019s new most powerful 911 ever.\nTwinning the T-Hybrid\nFor Porsche\u2019s first hybrid 911, the GTS, the company didn\u2019t simply add an electric motor and bigger battery into the mix and call it a day. It also inserted another high-speed motor into the turbocharger, enabling it to spin up to maximum speed in less than a second, nearly eliminating turbo lag.\nThe same concept is applied here in the 911 Turbo S, except that where the GTS has one turbo, the Turbo S has a pair of them. They\u2019re slightly smaller here, 10 mm down on the compressor side and 15 mm on the turbine side, enabling them to spin up quicker still."

But Genghis Cohen is now reopened in a new space, with an even more elaborate dining room and new dishes and cocktails. It\u2019s also still on the same street, just a few blocks farther south.\nThe fabled New York-style Chinese American restaurant serving stir-fries, tropical drinks and house specialties like the \u201cKanton Knish\u201d hosted some of the world\u2019s most famous celebrities and generations of Angelenos in its roughly 40-year run at 740 N. Fairfax Ave. The location featured a dining room bedecked with red paper lanterns, an aquarium and a large paper dragon, as well as a tandem music venue.\nOwners Marc Rose and Med Abrous said they were unable to renegotiate Genghis Cohen\u2019s lease after years of attempts with the building\u2019s new owners, and devised a plan: reopen elsewhere in the neighborhood, first with takeout, then with dine-in service.\n\u201cWe have been working our tails off to find a solution, and I believe that we found the best possible solution to a real crappy situation that we were put in,\u201d Rose told The Times earlier this year.\nThey launched Genghis Cohen with delivery on June 1, taking over the former Sweet Chick space at 448 N. Fairfax Ave. Now they\u2019ve unveiled the new dining room, which features even more neon, color and the return of its red paper lanterns and dragon.\nAfter more than 40 years on Fairfax Avenue, Ghengis Cohen is set to close, but will be reopening nearby in a new format while its history-minded owners hunt for a new home.\nThat circle-cut fish tank is now embedded in the wall above the bar, which is also larger; given the additional bar seats, the team added a slew of new tropical cocktails, such as a boozy riff on Dole Whip dessert, plus a weekend-only late-night menu of bar bites like chicken lollipops and barbecue pork bao. New \u2019round-the-clock dishes include shrimp-and-chive dumplings and five-spice marinated Volcano chicken, which is set ablaze tableside.\nThe new Genghis Cohen lacks a private dining room as well as a music venue, but Abrous and Rose partnered with Canter\u2019s Deli and its adjacent bar and venue, the Kibitz Room, to host a music series called \u201cGenghis Cohen Live\u201d on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Genghis Cohen is open Monday to Thursday from 4 to 10 p.m., Friday from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday from midnight to 2 a.m., and Sunday from noon to 10 p.m.\n448 N.

No one was hurt in the fire, and Funke\u2019s team attempted to reschedule guests at the chef\u2019s other Los Angeles restaurants, Mother Wolf and Felix, while awaiting the reopening.\nThe celebrity chef\u2019s hyper-regional, pasta-focused restaurant in Beverly Hills is closed. The Beverly Hills Fire Department said Funke suffered minimal damage.\nAs of Oct. 1 Funke reopened for reservations in both its restaurant and rooftop bar. Funke is open Monday to Thursday from 5 to 10:30 p.m., and Friday and Saturday from 5 to 11 p.m. Bar Funke, on the roof, is open Monday to Thursday from 5 to 11 p.m., and Friday and Saturday from 5 p.m. to midnight.\n9388 S.
