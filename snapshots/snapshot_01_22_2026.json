                "body": "Trump says reached framework deal on Greenland, won\u2019t be imposing tariffs\nThe US Dollar is losing momentum fast after failing to reclaim a key resistance zone, and bears are now pushing for another leg lower.\nAt the same time, gold is taking full advantage of that weakness and just powered through major upside levels. Today is all about watching whether the dollar keeps bleeding - because as long as it does, metals stay in the driver\u2019s seat\nUSD Index (DX.F): Bears Are Back in Control\nLet\u2019s open today\u2019s Note by revisiting the quote from Jan. 14:\n\u201c(\u2026) Friday\u2019s failed move above the upper border of the mentioned rising channel translated into unsuccessful breakout above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. Additionally, bulls didn\u2019t manage to close the early-December gap, which together with the current position of the indictors (Stochastic has already printed a sell signal, while CCI is deep in overbought territory and close to rolling over) raises the probability that the dollar\u2019s next meaningful move will be to the south toward the downside targets we\u2019ve already discussed on Friday (\u2026)\u201d\nFrom today\u2019s perspective, we clearly see that the daily chart shows that despite multiple attempts to break above the resistance zone we discussed a week ago, bulls failed to close the gap, which triggered a strong bearish reaction.\nYesterday\u2019s session opened with another large red downside gap, and when you combine that with fresh sell signals, it basically gave bears a green light to execute the bearish scenario we outlined on Jan. 12:\n\u201c(\u2026) If sellers regain control and close the day under the upper line of the channel, their first downside target will likely be the previously broken area around 98.53. A clean break below that level could expose 98.26, and potentially even a move toward the lower border of the mentioned channel. (\u2026)\u201d\nAnd as we see, the market delivered: sellers pushed DX.F straight down into 98.09, printing a daily low slightly below both of our downside targets during yesterday\u2019s session.\nEven though we saw some rebound later, Wednesday opened with yet another red downside gap, which, combined with sell pressure still active, suggests another push lower could be right around the corner.\nFirst downside target? At least a retest of yesterday\u2019s low.\nIf bulls don\u2019t step in there, the next bearish destination becomes the next major support zone based on the October 6, 2025 upside gap (97.41\u201397.64) + the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. At this point, it is worth noting that this important support zone already stopped sellers twice in December, therefore, it\u2019s one of those \u201cwatch it like a hawk\u201d areas in the near term.\nUSD Index (H4): Breakdown Confirmed\nLet\u2019s recall one more quote from Jan.14:\n\u201c(\u2026) two unsuccessful attempts to go above the channel adds technical weight and strongly suggests the dollar may retest the 98.50 support zone in the near term. (\u2026)\u201d\nOn the H4 chart, we can clearly see that even though bulls managed to climb above 99, the upper border of the black rising channel + the red resistance zone was simply too much.\nAfter several days of consolidation, buyers finally ran out of fuel, and bears stormed the market.\nFrom this timeframe, we see that the latest decline took the dollar below the lower boundary of the black rising channel, which means that until we see an invalidation of this breakdown, any bounce should be treated as a corrective move inside a broader bearish swing.\nYes, H4 indicators did flash early buy signals, but as long as those daily red gaps stay open and DX.F remains below the channel, bears still have the upper hand.\nSo\u2026 what does this mean for gold?\nLast week\u2019s quote turned out to be a good compass for recent price action:\n\u201c(\u2026) As the chart above shows, the U.S. dollar has been rising since the start of the year, while gold and silver have not weakened. In fact, the correlation between USD and metals has increased, not decreased.\nHow to read this?\n(\u2026) That doesn\u2019t mean the relationship is broken forev"

That\u2019s a $120 uptick from the same time yesterday and a $1,981 gain over the past year.\nIf you want an investment that isn\u2019t directly impacted by inflation variance, gold may fit the bill. Gold has a long-term record of appreciating in value. One of the more common ways of buying and holding gold is a gold IRA. It\u2019s also a practical choice for those who want to avoid the cost and burden of storing physical gold.\nHistorical gold price chart\nGold doesn\u2019t outperform traditional stocks in every financial situation. In strong economic climates, stocks can deliver higher returns over both short and long periods. From 1971 to 2024, stocks averaged 10.7% in annual returns, while gold averaged 7.9%.\nBut in uncertain economic times, gold is seen as a safe, risk-averse asset. That\u2019s why many people view it more as a store of value than a typical investment like stocks or bonds.\nWhat does \u201cspot gold\u201d mean?\nThe spot gold price is the rate for immediate transactions when buying gold over-the-counter. This figure helps investors track real-time demand and trends. Simply put, a higher spot price reflects greater demand. Unlike futures, the spot price is for instant settlement.\nWhen the future price is above the spot price, it\u2019s called contango, which is common for commodities with high storage costs. If the futures price is below the spot price, it\u2019s known as backwardation.\nMany factors can affect the spot price, causing frequent changes. Active gold investors need to be prepared for this volatility.\nWhat is price spread in gold trading?\nA price spread is the difference between the buying and selling price of an asset.\nIn gold trading, the ask price is what you pay to buy, and the bid price is what you receive when selling. The bid is always lower than the ask.\nA smaller spread means the market is more liquid. When spreads are tight, it suggests strong demand for gold.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for January 21, 2026.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.18% for January 21, 2026.\n- Discover the best personal loan rates for January 21, 2026.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for January 21, 2026.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for January 21, 2026.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for January 21, 2026.\n- Discover the current price of silver for January 21, 2026.\n- Discover the current price of platinum for January 21, 2026.\nHow to invest in gold\nIf you picture gold investing as diving into a pile of coins, you\u2019re only half right. While you can buy physical bars, coins, or jewelry, gold is often traded as exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nPopular gold investment options include:\n- Gold bars: Also called bullion, sold by weight, with purity and manufacturer details stamped on the bar. Gold rounds are essentially the same, with the only notable difference being the shape of the bullion.\n- Gold coins: Collectible coins like the American Gold Eagle, often priced higher than bars of the same weight due to rarity.\n- Gold jewelry: Priced above gold content for design and craftsmanship.\n- Gold futures contracts: Agreements to buy gold at a set price in the future, allowing speculation without handling the physical metal.\n- Gold funds: Mutual funds or ETFs invested in gold assets, with values tied to the underlying portfolio.\nIs it a good time to invest in gold?\nWhether now is the best time to invest in gold is open to interpretation. Still, adding gold can help diversify your portfolio and reduce market volatility.\nGold remains a steady asset in today\u2019s unpredictable market. Prices have soared to all-time highs, up over 25% since the beginning of 2025, fueled by inflation and uncertainty. Many experts suggest this is a good time to diversify with gold.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 9:05 a.m. ET today\nSilver, platinum, and palladium are also favored by investors.

It stayed within a fairly flat range until the end of August, when it launched higher once again, breaking US$4,300 in mid-October.\nThe price of gold took a breather following that move, even falling briefly below US$4,000; however, its retracement was neither as steep nor as long as many market watchers expected it to be.\nGold began gaining steam again in mid-November, and took off again in earnest at the end of 2025.\nIn 2026, precious metals have continued to benefit from geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. Expectations of interest rate cuts after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term ends later this year have provided support too. Trump\u2019s feud with the Fed over rates took an eyebrow-raising turn on January 9, when the US Department of Justice served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas targeting Powell with a criminal indictment.\nThis latest upswing for the gold comes as investors moved out of global stocks following Trump\u2019s threats over the weekend that the European nations opposing his bid to acquire Greenland will face 10 percent tariffs starting February 1. That figure could rise to 25 percent if a deal to secure Greenland for the US is not reached by June.\nThe nations targeted by the new tariffs include France, Germany, the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland. The news has prompted fears of a full-blown US-Europe trade war, a weaker US dollar, higher inflation and a worsening outlook for the global economy. There are even concerns the conflict over Greenland could seriously weaken or dismantle the NATO alliance. Gold is traditionally used as a hedge against such risks.\nGreenland's key geographic position in the Arctic has long been coveted by the United States as a necessary strategic asset in its geopolitical struggle with Russia and China. \u201cChina and Russia want Greenland, and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \u201cOnly the United States of America, under PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP, can play in this game, and very successfully, at that!\u201d\n\"Gold\u2019s sharp response to tariff-related headlines highlights how market sentiment has shifted away from a narrow focus on growth or inflation, toward policy uncertainty as a primary driver. Tariffs do not only disrupt trade flows; they also pose spillover risks to supply chains, corporate margins, and medium-term growth expectations,\" Linh Tran, senior market analyst at XS.com, said in a market note shared with the Investing News Network (INN).\n\"As soon as the probability of escalation increases, defensive capital tends to move preemptively, rather than waiting for tangible impacts to materialize in economic data. In this context, gold functions as a portfolio risk-balancing asset.\"\nEuropean leaders have responded with vows that they will not be blackmailed into allowing Trump to take Greenland, and are now preparing counter measures to the president's tariffs.\n\"The most realistic option would be for Europe to strike back using the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument, a legal framework that allows the EU to respond collectively when"

                "body": "Is the First Majestic Silver (TSX:FR,NYSE:AG) CEO\u2019s silver price prediction of over US$100 per ounce about to come true?\nThe silver price had surged over 215 percent year-on-year as of January 20, 2026, on the back of economic uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions, as well as support from long-term demand fundamentals.\nThe silver price broke through its previous all-time high in October 2025, blasting through the US$50 per ounce mark. Since then, it has rallied to new highs again and again. Only a few weeks into 2026, the price of the metal is now within serious striking distance of the US$100 level. The latest catalyst is US President Donald Trump\u2019s threatened trade war with some of America's European NATO allies if they continue to balk at his bid for Greenland.\nWell-known figure Keith Neumeyer, CEO of First Majestic, has frequently said he believes the white metal could hit the US$100 mark or even reach as high as US$130 per ounce.\nNeumeyer has voiced this opinion often over the past decade. He put up a US$130 price target in a November 2017 interview with Palisade Radio, when silver was just US$17 per ounce. He has reiterated his triple-digit silver price forecast in multiple interviews with Kitco over the years, including one in March 2023.\nIn 2024, Neumeyer made his US$100 silver call in a conversation with ITM Trading\u2019s Daniela Cambone at the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) convention, and in April of that year he acknowledged his reputation as the \"triple-digit silver guy\" on the Todd Ault Podcast.\nSpeaking with Chris Marcus of Arcadia Economics on January 16, 2026, a day after the price of silver had broken through US$93 per ounce for the first time, Neumeyer stated that \u201ctriple digits is definitely on its way.\u201d\nAt times Neumeyer has been even bolder, suggesting in 2016 that silver could reach US$1,000 if gold were to hit US$10,000.\nIn order to better understand where Neumeyer\u2019s opinion comes from and why a triple-digit silver price is finally materializing, it\u2019s important to take a look at the factors that affect the metal\u2019s movements, as well as where prices have been in the past and where other industry insiders think silver could be headed.\nFirst, let\u2019s dive a little deeper into Neumeyer\u2019s US$100 silver prediction.\nWhy has Neumeyer called for a US$100 silver price?\nNeumeyer believes silver could hit US$100 due to a variety of factors, including its consistent deficit, its industrial demand and how undervalued it is compared to gold.\nWhen he first made the prediction more than a decade ago, there was significant distance for silver to go before it could reach the success Neumeyer had boldly predicted.\nNeumeyer expected a triple-digit silver price in part because he believed the market cycle could be compared to the year 2000, when investors were sailing high on the dot-com bubble and the mining sector was down. He thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time before the market corrects, like it did in 2001 and 2002, and commodities see a big rebound in pricing. It was during 2000 that Neumeyer himself invested heavily in mining stocks and came out on top.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been calling for triple-digit silver for a few years now, and I\u2019m more enthused now,\u201d Neumeyer said at an event in January 2020, noting that there are multiple factors behind his reasoning. \u201cBut I\u2019m cautiously enthused because, you know, I thought it would have happened sooner than it currently is happening.\u201d\nIn an August 2022 interview with Wall Street Silver, he reiterated his support for triple-digit silver and said he\u2019s not alone in this optimistic view \u2014 in fact, he\u2019s been surpassed in that optimism. \u201cI actually saw someone the other day call for US$500 silver,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure I\u2019m at the level. Give me US$50 first and we\u2019ll see what happens after that.\u201d\nAnother factor driving Neumeyer\u2019s position is his belief that the silver market is in a deficit at a time when demand is rising from new industrial sectors.

Historically, it trails other investment options, like stocks. From 1921 onward, silver has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 96%. That means an equal sum invested in silver and stocks back then would now be worth 96% less in silver holdings than stocks.\nInstead, silver is prized for its stability and its power to hedge against inflation. Often dubbed a \u201cstore of value,\u201d it tends to sustain purchasing power when inflation climbs.\nCompared with gold, silver prices generally swing more sharply due to industrial demand\u2014solar equipment, healthcare devices, and more\u2014whereas gold is almost purely a safe-haven asset.\nWhat does \u201cspot silver\u201d mean?\n\u201cSpot silver\u201d refers to the live market rate at which silver can be bought or sold instantly. That said, real-world buyers usually pay a premium over spot for markups, shipping, insurance, and other fees.\nThe spot price serves as a gauge of immediate market demand: a higher spot price means stronger buying interest.\nWhat is \u201cprice spread\u201d in silver trading?\nThe term \u201cprice spread\u201d describes the difference between the buying (ask) and selling (bid) prices for silver. Here\u2019s how those terms are defined.\n- Ask price: the cost to purchase silver.\n- Bid price: the amount you receive when you sell silver.\nA narrower spread indicates high demand.\nHow to invest in silver\nSilver exposure can be achieved through physical ownership or via silver-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs let you own a stake in a fund that holds silver, sparing you storage and insurance responsibilities.\nKey silver investment options include:\n- Bullion bars and rounds. These are sold by weight and purity\n- Government-minted silver coins. Iconic examples include American Silver Eagles and Canada\u2019s Silver Maple Leafs, which often trade at premiums for their rarity and backing.\n- Silver jewelry. Custom pieces that fetch prices above equal-purity bullion.\n- Silver mining equities. Stocks in companies extracting silver, offering a sort of indirect investment in silver.\nOn exchanges, bullion and coins must meet a minimum 99.9% purity. Lower-purity silver generally falls into collectible or industrial categories. Our guide to the best silver IRA companies provide more information on how to shrewdly invest in silver (and other precious metals).\nIs it a good time to invest in silver?\nSilver has surged more than 150% over the past year, hitting its highest levels in over a decade.\nDeciding whether to invest now depends on your unique attitude toward the market. If inflation is top of mind, adding precious metals can be prudent. Or, if you foresee rising industrial applications\u2014such as electronics\u2014demand could potentially push prices even higher.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 8:30 a.m. ET today\nGold remains the benchmark metal, while platinum and palladium exhibit volatility patterns similar to silver due to smaller market caps.

Instead, it's being pulled higher by structural demand from AI data centers, semiconductor manufacturing, and renewable energy \u2014 a shift that could permanently change how the metal trades.\n- Track silver-tracking SLV ETF here.\nFrom Macro Trade To Industrial Input\nIn an exclusive interview with Benzinga, Ed Egilinsky of Direxion highlighted how silver's usage in semiconductors and data centers is becoming \"transformative in nature.\"\nThese aren't speculative trends. They're capital-intensive, policy-supported investments with long time horizons.\nWhy Inflation Is No Longer Required\nUnlike past cycles, silver, and the iShares Silver ETF (NYSE:SLV) as a proxy, have rallied even as market volatility stayed subdued. \u201cThis is evident over the last two years where the VIX has been mostly muted, yet gold and silver have rallied sharply,\u201d said Egilinsky. That suggests demand is coming from physical consumption rather than financial hedging.\nSolar energy alone remains a major silver sink, and AI infrastructure adds another layer of steady, non-discretionary demand. \u201cThe weakening of the U.S. Dollar in 2025 also provided some added fuel to the silver rally,\u201d noted Egilinsky.\nSupply Constraints Add Fuel\nDownstream bottlenecks and export restrictions have limited silver's ability to respond quickly to demand spikes. When consumption rises, prices don't gradually adjust \u2014 they gap higher.\nThat dynamic makes the shiny metal more sensitive to structural demand shifts than markets may be pricing in.\nA Re-Rating, Not A Trade\nSilver is increasingly behaving less like gold's volatile cousin and more like a strategic industrial metal tied to the global electrification and compute buildout.\nInvestor takeaway: If AI and solar continue scaling, silver's cycle may be breaking \u2014 and long-term allocations may start replacing short-term trades.\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2026 Benzinga.com.

                "body": "The EUR/USD pair lost over 0.30% as US President Trump announced the cancellation of planned tariffs related to Greenland negotiations. This decision, shared on Truth Social from Davos, Switzerland, improved risk sentiment, boosting US equities with gains between 1.16% and 1.21% and strengthening the US Dollar Index by 0.20% to 98.75.\nEconomic updates ahead include US GDP figures, jobless claims, and the Core PCE Index, while in the Eurozone, the ECB\u2019s policy accounts and EU consumer confidence data are due. The Euro was weakest against the US Dollar this week, dropping 0.86%, and strongest against the Japanese Yen, gaining 1.18%.\nEur Usd Technical Outlook\nThe EUR/USD pair\u2019s technical outlook suggests a potential test of lower prices, having dropped below 1.1700, with a key support level at 1.1662. This currency pair is influenced by economic data including GDP, unemployment rates, manufacturing indices, and inflation. A strong economic performance can support the Euro by attracting foreign capital and prompting ECB interest rate hikes. Conversely, a negative trade balance or weak economic data can push the currency lower.\nLooking back at the events of 2025, we saw how quickly the market shifted when the former President dropped tariff threats related to Greenland. The US Dollar strengthened immediately, and the EUR/USD pair fell below the 1.1700 level. This dynamic, where geopolitical headlines can override short-term economic data, remains a key factor for us to monitor.\nThe data that followed those events last year has largely supported a stronger dollar. The final reading for US Q3 2025 GDP came in at a solid 2.2%, and more recently, the Core PCE inflation for December 2025 finished the year at 2.8%, well above the Fed\u2019s target. This reinforces the view that the Federal Reserve has little reason to consider cutting rates in the near term.\nOpportunities for Traders\nMeanwhile, the European Central Bank appears to be in a more difficult position. The latest German IFO Business Climate Index fell to 85.2, a worrying sign for the Eurozone\u2019s economic engine. This growing policy divergence between a firm Fed and a cautious ECB continues to put downward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate.\nFor derivatives traders, this environment presents clear opportunities. We observed last year how one-month implied volatility on EUR/USD jumped to over 8% during the tariff scare before collapsing once the threat was removed. This pattern suggests that selling volatility by using strategies like short strangles could be profitable after any future politically-driven market spikes.\nGiven the fundamental weakness in the Eurozone, we should also consider directional plays. The break below the key 1.1700 mark last year was technically significant, and the 200-day moving average, now near 1.1590, is a plausible target in the coming weeks. Purchasing EUR/USD put options or establishing bear put spreads offers a defined-risk way to position for further downside."

                "body": "The EUR/USD currency pair moved closer to 1.1700 on Monday, following a recent peak near 1.1768. This shift came after ECB President Christine Lagarde spoke on maintaining stable monetary policy amidst US tariff threats.\nLagarde remarked that the monetary policy settings remain favourable. She also suggested that the short-term impact of new US tariffs would be minimal.\nECB Policy and Market Predictions\nThe European Central Bank has ceased easing, predicting that the EUR/USD pair will continue to fluctuate between 1.1500 and 1.1800 over the coming months.\nThese insights were provided by the FXStreet Insights Team, who compile market observations from various experts.\nWe recall seeing this analysis back in 2025 when the euro was holding up against the dollar near 1.1700. The belief was that the European Central Bank was done cutting rates, which would keep the pair trading in a stable 1.1500 to 1.1800 range. That outlook hinged on the ECB maintaining a steady policy.\nMarket Implications for Traders\nAs of today, January 21, 2026, that range has clearly broken, with EUR/USD now trading much lower around 1.0950. The economic divergence we have seen is the primary cause, as Eurozone Q4 2025 GDP growth came in at a sluggish 0.1% while the U.S. posted a more resilient 2.0% expansion. This has reinforced the wide interest rate differential favoring the dollar.\nFor derivative traders, the old strategy of selling volatility within that 1.15-1.18 range is no longer valid. Given that Eurozone headline inflation has fallen to 2.1%, just above the ECB\u2019s target, the pressure is on the ECB to consider further easing, not hold steady. This suggests traders should look at buying put options to protect against or profit from a slide towards the 1.0800 level seen in late 2025.\nWith the market pricing in a higher probability of an ECB rate cut by mid-year compared to the Federal Reserve, any strength in the euro should be viewed with skepticism. Volatility has been low, with one-month implied volatility sitting near 5.5%, making options relatively cheap. This presents an opportunity to structure bearish positions, such as put spreads, that can benefit from a continued, gradual decline in the currency pair."

                "body": "GBP/USD, JPY/USD Forecast: Two trades to watch\nGBP/USD slips after CPI data & ahead of Trump\u2019s speech\nGBP/USD has given back earlier gains amid a modest USD recovery ahead of Trump\u2019s speech at Davos and as investors digest UK inflation data.\nUK CPI rose to 3.4% year on year, ahead of expectations of 3.3%, and up from November's reading of 3.2% on a monthly basis. Headline CPI is 0.4% after contracting 0.2% in November. Core CPI, which removes more volatile items such as food and fuel, remained at 3.2% year on year, in line with forecasts.\nThe increase in inflation was mainly driven by one-offs - a rise in tobacco duty and airfares. Service sector inflation, which is closely tracked by the BoE, rose to 4.5% from 4.4%, a smaller-than-expected increase.\nThe BoE expects inflation to reach its 2% target in the spring of this year and has forecast that the chancellor's budget will help remove 0.5% from price growth over the coming years. Market bets on interest rate cuts from the BoE are little changed following the data, pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut, with a 70% chance by the end of the year.\nThe US dollar is rising modestly, recovering from a two-week low against its major peers as investors await President Trump's speech at Davos. The speech comes following his tariff threats, which triggered a sell-off in US assets abroad at the start of the week. Fears of prolonged uncertainty, a loss of confidence in US leadership, and potential retaliation drove the 'sell America' trade.\nInvestors will wait to see Trump's tone when he speaks at the World Economic Forum. Should Trump continue to double down on his plans to acquire Greenland, the dollar could head lower. Any sense that Trump may soften his tone in order to get a deal done could help drive a dollar recovery.\nGBP/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nGBP/USD is trading sideways around 1.3440. The price holds above the 200 SMA, keeping the bias tilted to the upside. The RSI also holds above 50 amid a slight improvement in momentum.\nBuyers would need to rise above the 1.3485 resistance, a level which has capped gains on several occasions over the past few weeks. A rise above here brings 1.3550 into focus, the 2026 high.\nSupport is seen at 1.34, the 200 SMA and a horizontal support. A break below here brings 1.3350, the January low into play. A move below here creates a lower low.\nUSD/JPY hold steady ahead of Trump & Friday\u2019s BoJ meeting\nUSD/JPY is struggling for direction amid recent weakness in both the USD and the JPY, as investors await Trump\u2019s speech in Davos and the BoJ rate decision on Friday.\nThe USD fell sharply yesterday as the White House\u2019s threats over Greenland triggered a broad selloff in US assets. Trump has made it clear that securing Greenland for national security reasons is a core objective. The market is waiting to see whether Trump softens his tone in Davos, which could help drive a USD recovery.\nWhile the dollar is holding steady against the yen, the Japanese currency has suffered its own setback after Prime Minister Takaishi called a snap election on Monday for February 8th, and pledged a wave of measures to loosen fiscal policy.\nJapanese government bonds were hit hard, with the 40-year yield spiking 27.5 basis points to a record 4.215% on Tuesday, and has since eased slightly to 4.1% today.\nThe yen is trading at a record low against the Swiss franc and is close to a record low versus the euro.\nWhen bond yields rise, and the currency falls, it is a warning that the market doesn\u2019t like what it's seeing, putting Takaichi on track for her own \u201cLiz Truss\u201d moment.\nAttention is now turning to the Bank of Japan rate decision on Friday, but after hiking interest rates in December, no change is expected this month. Instead, attention will be on communication with policymakers, likely to maintain a slightly hawkish stance.\nUSD/JPY forecast - technical analysis\nUSD/JPY has trended higher since September, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows.

                "body": "GBP/USD remains confined in a range above 1.3400 as traders eye US PCE and GDP data\n- GBP/USD struggles to gain any meaningful traction for the second straight day on Thursday.\n- Easing trade war fears assist the USD to attract some follow-through buyers and cap the pair.\n- Traders now look forward to the US PCE Price Index and the US Q3 GDP for a fresh impetus.\nThe GBP/USD pair extends its sideways consolidative price move for the second straight day on Thursday and oscillates in a range above the 1.3400 mark during the Asian session. Moreover, a mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before placing directional bets as traders keenly await the crucial US macro data.\nThe US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index is due for release later today. It will be accompanied by the final US Q3 GDP growth report, which should offer fresh cues about the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) future policy path. This, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the near-term US Dollar (USD) price dynamics and provide some meaningful impetus to the GBP/USD pair.\nIn the meantime, the USD is seen gaining some follow-through positive traction and building on the previous day's move up in the wake of easing tensions over Greenland. In fact, US President Donald withdrew a threat to impose tariffs on a number of European nations and said in Davos on Wednesday that he had reached an agreement on a framework for a future deal on Greenland with NATO.\nThe comments eased trade war fears, which had revived the so-called 'Sell America' trade. Adding to this, reduced bets for a more aggressive easing by the Fed offer some support to the USD and act as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. The British Pound (GBP), on the other hand, struggles to lure buyers amid mixed expectations about future interest rate cuts by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe UK Office of National Statistics reported on Wednesday that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose for the first time in five months, to the 3.4% YoY rate in December. The data make it unlikely that the BoE will lower borrowing costs at its policy meeting early next month. Traders, however, are still pricing in one or possibly two quarter-point interest rate cuts by the BoE in 2026.\nThis, in turn, holds back traders from placing aggressive bets around the GBP/USD pair and contributes to the subdued range-bound price action. From a technical perspective, spot prices, so far, have managed to hold above the very important 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The said SMA is currently pegged near the 1.3365-1.3360 region and should now act as a key pivotal point for traders.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the strongest against the Euro.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row.

                "body": "GBP/USD experienced a slight dip to near 1.3430 as President Trump reduced tariff threats, boosting market sentiment. Although UK inflation exceeded forecasts at 3.4% in December, softer employment data sustained expectations for potential Bank of England policy easing.\nGeopolitical Developments\nThe market focused on geopolitical developments, especially following Trump\u2019s remarks in Davos, as economic data took a secondary role. US Pending Home Sales fell by 9.3% in December, while UK inflation rose slightly above expectations.\nDespite rising inflation, the BoE\u2019s rate-cutting prospects stayed unchanged, with markets pricing in 47 basis points of easing by year-end. The weakening UK job market, as reported by the ONS, may push the BoE towards rate cuts.\nThe GBP traded within a narrow range against the USD, held between the 200-day and 20-day SMAs, as the Dollar reduced earlier losses. Going forward, key technical levels to watch include the 20-day SMA at 1.3455 and support around 1.3338.\nThe Pound Sterling remains a prominent global currency, heavily influenced by BoE monetary policy, economic data like GDP and trade balance, and foreign exchange market dynamics. It is the fourth most traded currency worldwide, with significant pairs including GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, and EUR/GBP.\nMarket Consolidation and Strategy\nWe are seeing GBP/USD consolidating in a tight channel, defined by the 200-day moving average around 1.3403 and the 20-day average near 1.3455. This sideways action reflects the market\u2019s indecision, balancing hotter-than-expected UK inflation against persistent bets on Bank of England rate cuts. The weaker UK jobs data from last week seems to be weighing more heavily, keeping easing expectations firm.\nThe immediate focus must be on the upcoming US Gross Domestic Product and PCE inflation data. These releases will be crucial in breaking the current deadlock for the dollar and, by extension, for the pound. Looking back at 2025, we saw the Dollar Index move an average of 0.4% in the four hours following the core PCE release, showing how vital this data point is for setting near-term currency direction.\nGiven this expected volatility, traders could consider purchasing a strangle, which involves buying both an out-of-the-money call and put option. This strategy is designed to profit from a significant price breakout in either direction following the US data release, without needing to predict the outcome correctly. The cost of the options is the maximum risk, providing a defined-risk way to trade the event.\nAlternatively, for those who believe the pair will remain range-bound *before* the data release, selling an iron condor with a short-term expiry could be viable. This involves selling a call spread and a put spread, profiting from time decay as long as the GBP/USD stays between the sold strike prices. This is a higher-risk strategy that bets on continued low volatility ahead of the major news.\nLonger-term positions should still account for the 47 basis points of BoE rate cuts priced in for this year. We saw a similar situation in early 2024, when the market aggressively priced in BoE cuts that were later scaled back, leading to a sharp rally in Sterling. If we believe the recent 3.4% inflation print is the start of a stickier trend, buying longer-dated call options could be a way to position for a similar repricing that would lift GBP/USD later in the year."

Meanwhile, the Unemployment Rate declined to 4.1% from 4.3% prior, against the market consensus of 4.4%.\nSean Crick, head of labour statistics at the ABS, said that this month saw more people aged 15\u201324 move into employment, contributing to the increase in overall employment and the decline in the unemployment rate.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the RBA to remain cautious, highlighting that inflation has stayed above the Bank\u2019s 2%\u20133% target band for a prolonged period, even though headline CPI eased more quickly than anticipated in November.\nUS Dollar gains after Trump backs off tariff threat on Europe\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is holding ground after registering modest gains in the previous session and trading around 98.80 at the time of writing.\n- The Greenback gained ground after Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that US President Donald Trump said he would step back from imposing tariffs on goods from European nations opposing his effort to take possession of Greenland. He said earlier there is \u201cno going back\u201d on his ambitions regarding Greenland, alongside earlier threats to impose new 10% tariffs on eight European Union (EU) countries.\n- President Trump also said that the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had \u201cformed the framework of a future deal regarding Greenland.\u201d However, he did not outline the parameters of the so-called framework, and it remained unclear what the agreement would entail.\n- US labor market data has pushed back expectations for further Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts until June. Fed officials have signaled little urgency to ease policy further until there is clearer evidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% target. Morgan Stanley analysts revised their 2026 outlook, now forecasting one rate cut in June followed by another in September, compared with their previous expectation of cuts in January and April.\n- The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, announced on Tuesday that it would leave its Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) unchanged. The one-year and five-year LPRs were at 3.00% and 3.50%, respectively. It is essential to note that any changes in the Chinese economy could impact the Australian Dollar, as both countries are close trading partners.\n- China\u2019s Industrial Production rose 5.2% year-over-year YoY in December, accelerating from 4.8% in November, supported by resilient export-driven manufacturing activity. Meanwhile, Retail Sales rose 0.9% YoY, undershooting forecasts of 1.2% and November\u2019s 1.3%.\n- Australia\u2019s TD-MI Inflation Gauge, released on Monday, rose to 3.5% year-over-year (YoY) in December, up from 3.2% previously.

That kind of labor strength can keep wages and prices sticky, which pressures the central bank to lean hawkish. Some economists now see a 25-basis-point hike as soon as early February, and markets have sharply lifted the implied odds of a move, with a hike fully priced by May. Bond yields moved up alongside the repricing, a sign investors a..\nre taking the \u201crates stay higher\u201d story more seriously.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate expectations are steering the currency.\nThe aussie often tracks where investors think interest rates are headed. If incoming inflation data runs hot, bets on earlier tightening could strengthen the currency further while pushing Australian bond prices down. But if prices cool, those hike odds can unwind quickly, which tends to hit the aussie and relieve pressure on rate-sensitive stocks like real estate.\nThe bigger picture: Strong jobs can flip the soft-landing script.\nAustralia\u2019s surprise resilience is a reminder that inflation fights rarely move in a straight line. When employment stays firm, central banks have more room to keep policy restrictive even if growth slows. That matters beyond Australia \u2013 it\u2019s the same dynamic markets watch across developed economies, where a \u201chigher for longer\u201d stance can keep global borrowing costs elevated.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "US Dollar Today, January 22: Firm Data Caps AUD as Fed Cuts Pushed Back\nThe US dollar is firm today as strong US data and cautious Federal Reserve comments delay hopes for early Fed rate cuts. For Australian investors, this keeps AUD/USD under pressure while the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to hold with inflation still above target. We see near-term direction tied to Australia and China data, plus key US releases. In this note, we explain what is driving the move, what to watch this week, and how traders and households in Australia can respond.\nWhy the USD is firm and AUD/USD is heavy\nRecent economic surprises in the United States point to steady growth and sticky services inflation, which supports the US dollar. Futures now lean toward a first Fed cut around June, not March, reducing downside for the currency. As rate differentials stay wide, AUD/USD faces headwinds. See coverage on how resilient US data cooled early cut hopes at FXStreet.\nHigher US yields and a cautious risk tone favour the US dollar against pro\u2011cyclical peers. When investors expect tighter financial conditions, carry and safety flows tend to back the currency. Until US inflation softens clearly and growth slows, rallies in AUD/USD may be limited. A cleaner turn likely needs softer US prints or a strong upside surprise from Australia or China.\nRBA stance and Australia\u2019s sensitivity to China\nWith inflation above the 2 to 3 percent band, the RBA is set to hold for longer, even as markets watch for Fed rate cuts later this year. That policy gap still leans in favour of the US dollar. Without a decisive fall in Australian core inflation, the Australian dollar can stay vulnerable on global risk wobbles.\nAustralia\u2019s export mix ties the Australian dollar to China\u2019s activity. If Chinese demand steadies on targeted policy support, commodity prices can help the currency. If data soften again, AUD/USD could slip as traders prefer the US dollar. Watch China PMIs, credit growth, and any fresh support for housing or local government balance sheets.\nCatalysts to watch this week and next\nLocal focus is on Australia\u2019s inflation update, retail sales, and labour indicators, which shape the RBA path. Better prints could ease pressure on the Australian dollar by narrowing expected policy gaps. From China, PMIs and trade figures can sway risk appetite. A beat would aid AUD/USD, while misses would likely keep the US dollar bid against the Aussie.\nIn the United States, PCE inflation, GDP, and Fed communications remain key. Softer inflation plus slower growth would support the case for earlier Fed rate cuts and could weigh on the US dollar. Hotter data or hawkish remarks would do the opposite. Positioning around these releases often drives short-term swings in AUD/USD.\nPractical playbook for Australian investors\nWhile US yields stay elevated, traders often prefer to sell AUD/USD rallies into resistance and buy dips near prior supports. Range conditions can shift quickly on data, so risk controls matter. Day traders may track momentum on releases, while swing traders can wait for confirmation from inflation trends and China indicators before leaning against the US dollar.\nImporters and offshore borrowers can review currency hedges to manage budget rates if the US dollar stays strong. Households planning overseas travel might stagger conversions. Property watchers should note currency swings can feed into financing and sentiment, as seen in local analysis on 2026 housing drivers at API Magazine. Keep hedge sizes modest and revisit after key data.\nFinal Thoughts\nA firm US dollar reflects solid US growth signals and a slower path to Fed rate cuts, while the RBA holds with inflation still above target. That mix keeps AUD/USD biased lower unless Australia\u2019s data firms or China\u2019s demand improves. For traders, the edge remains event driven. Plan for volatility around Australia inflation, China PMIs, and US PCE or GDP. For businesses and households, steady, incremental hedges can pr"

Any hawkish remarks from Japanese policymakers could boost the JPY and create a headwind for the pair.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nAuthor\nLallalit Srijandorn\nFXStreet\nLallalit Srijandorn is a Parisian at heart.

                "body": "Goldman Sachs argues that the Japanese yen currency will continue to stay weak amid the latest economic and political developments domestically. The snap election called by Japan prime minister Takaichi is one key driver dragging down the currency, as she looks odds on to consolidate power to pursue her fiscal expansion further.\nThe focus on Japan's weakening and alarming fiscal position is continuing to pile more pressure on the currency, with the Takaichi trade still in full swing. However, Goldman Sachs says that USD/JPY upside may be more limited considering intervention risks at play currently.\n\"Overall, we think USD/JPY over the near term looks likely to be in the range of 155-160, as the rising odds of intervention limit the upside, but incoming data and election risk look set to push towards further JPY weakness.\"\nOn potential intervention action, the firm notes that a \"rate check\" is the next key thing to look out for. This is a move done by either the BOJ or MOF in order to \"gauge market levels\" supposedly. However, we all know that it is a signal that they are very much prepared to step in.\nAnd Goldman Sachs even points out how historically this has been a precedence before actual intervention. The last reported \"rate check\" was back in the middle of July 2024, just before Tokyo authorities stepped in to buy up the currency. And before that, the previous \"rate check\" was in 14 September 2022 and that was a week before actual intervention took place.\nBesides intervention risks, the firm also notes that there is a risk that the BOJ could decide to intervene via policy means by hiking rates sooner than expected as well. That is if the Japanese yen currency depreciation continues to persist, needing a fundamental call for change."

                "body": "USD/CAD remains below 1.3850 as Oil prices remains stronger\n- USD/CAD weakened as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar strengthened on higher Oil prices.\n- The WTI price may further rise as easing tensions reduces demand risks after Trump signaled a pause in tariffs on Europe over Greenland.\n- The US Dollar receives support from easing geopolitical tensions between the US and Europe.\nUSD/CAD remains in the negative territory for the fourth consecutive session, trading around 1.3830 during the Asian hours on Thursday. The pair weakened as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) strengthened on higher Oil prices, reflecting Canada\u2019s role as the largest crude exporter to the United States (US).\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price maintains its position after four days of gains, hovering around $60.50 per barrel at the time of writing. The upside of the Oil prices could be restrained as supply risks are offset by oversupply concerns, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) reiterating that global supply will significantly exceed demand this year despite a modest upgrade to demand growth. Industry data also showed the United States (US) crude inventories rose by about 3 million barrels last week.\nOil prices gained ground as easing geopolitical tensions helped lower downside risks to energy demand. US President Donald Trump ruled out the use of military force to acquire Greenland on Wednesday and said that he would step back from imposing tariffs on goods from European nations opposing his effort to take possession of Greenland.\nEasing geopolitical tensions between the US and Europe supported the US Dollar (USD), helping limit losses in the USD/CAD pair. Traders await weekly Initial Jobless Claims, Gross Domestic Product Annualized, and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data for fresh signals in the US economy.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) officials have indicated limited urgency to ease policy without clearer evidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target, even as markets still price in 50 basis points of rate cuts later this year.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rat"

                "body": "On Tuesday, the loonie strengthened to 1.3815 per U.S. dollar and briefly traded below 1.38 overnight, marking its strongest intraday move since January 7. Markets were rattled by President Trump\u2019s tough rhetoric on potential tariffs against Europe and by earlier comments suggesting the possible use of force to acquire Greenland, which triggered broad U.S. dollar weakness.\nBy Wednesday morning, after President Trump ruled out any military intervention during his speech in Davos, Switzerland, volatility eased and the Canadian dollar stabilized around the 1.3830 level.\nU.S. Dollar Takes the Hit\nThe primary driver of the move was a sharp selloff in the U.S. dollar. The greenback posted its largest single-day decline since August against a basket of major currencies.\nInvestor confidence weakened following renewed U.S. trade tensions with Europe, particularly tariff threats linked to the future status of Greenland. These developments triggered a broad \u2018sell America\u2019 trade, weighing simultaneously on U.S. equities, Treasuries, and the U.S. dollar.\nThis was not a Canada-specific rally. The Canadian dollar benefited because it sits directly on the other side of USD/CAD. When the U.S. dollar weakens sharply, the loonie typically strengthens by default.\nOil Prices Add a Tailwind\nOil prices provided additional support. U.S. crude futures rose 1.8 per cent to US$60.34 per barrel, driven by a temporary suspension of production in Kazakhstan and expectations of firmer global demand.\nEnergy exports remain one of Canada\u2019s largest sources of foreign-currency inflows. Rising oil prices improve the trade balance at the margin and reinforce Canadian dollar strength. While oil was not the primary catalyst, it helped limit downside risk once the loonie moved higher.\nPolitical Context, Limited Market Impact\nCanada\u2019s federal government publicly opposed any U.S. tariffs linked to Greenland and reiterated its interest in diversifying global trade relationships. Markets, however, remain realistic about Canada\u2019s economic structure.\nMore than 75 per cent of Canadian exports still go to the United States, including most oil shipments. As a result, FX markets continue to price the Canadian dollar largely as a function of U.S. dollar flows rather than long-term trade ambitions.\nBonds and Rates: Not the Driver\nCanadian bond yields moved higher alongside global yields as investors reacted to volatility in Japanese and U.S. government bond markets. The yield curve steepened, but interest-rate differentials versus the U.S. were largely unchanged and did not drive the currency move.\nThere were no new signals from the Bank of Canada this week that would justify a repricing of Canadian monetary policy expectations.\nShort-Term Outlook\nUSD/CAD remains U.S.-dollar driven, not Canadian-dollar driven. After briefly dipping below 1.3800, the pair found support following comments from U.S. leadership at Davos, which slowed the selloff in American assets.\nIn the near term, USD/CAD is likely to hover around the 1.38 level, with direction determined by upcoming U.S. data releases rather than Canadian economic news.\nBottom line: this was not a structural breakout for the Canadian dollar. It was a move driven by U.S. dollar weakness and supported by oil, and the Canadian dollar remains vulnerable to reversal if geopolitical conditions stabilize.\nThe Canadian dollar is currently trading at 1.38381 CAD against the US Dollar."

The USMCA renegotiations set for mid-year are a notable headwind and domestic terms of trade are soft with sluggish oil prices.\"\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which has shielded much of Canada's exports from U.S. tariffs, is set for review by a July 1 deadline.\nThe U.S. dollar (.DXY), opens new tab recouped some of the previous day's sharp decline against a basket of major currencies as U.S. President Donald Trump ruled out military action in Greenland but said he was seeking immediate negotiations to discuss a deal to acquire the northern island from Denmark.\nTrump chided Mark Carney in a Davos speech after the Canadian prime minister delivered a rousing address on a \"rupture\" in the international rules-based order.\nThe price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose 0.6% to $60.73 a barrel as investors assessed a temporary shutdown at two large fields in Kazakhstan. Still, oil was trading toward the bottom of its range in recent years.\nProducer prices in Canada fell 0.6% in December from November as energy prices declined.

Spot prices remain depressed around the 212.20-212.15 region through the first half of the European session and move little following the release of UK consumer inflation figures.\nThe UK Office for National Statistics reported that the annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.4% in December, compared to the previous month's reading of 3.2% and above the 3.3% increase expected. Meanwhile, the core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, was up 3.2% on a yearly basis, matching expectations and November's print. The data makes it unlikely that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates at its policy meeting early next month, though it does little to provide any meaningful impetus to the British Pound (GBP) or the GBP/JPY cross.\nMarket participants are still pricing in the possibility that the UK central bank will lower borrowing costs at least two more times in 2026. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to prospects for further policy tightening by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which is seen as a key factor behind the Japanese Yen's (JPY) relative outperformance against its British counterpart. Apart from this, the prevalent risk-off environment, fueled by rising tensions over Greenland and geopolitical uncertainties, benefits the safe-haven JPY and exerts some downward pressure on the GBP/JPY cross.\nThe JPY bulls, however, lack conviction and opt to wait for more cues about the likely timing of the next interest rate hike by the BoJ. Hence, the focus will remain glued to the outcome of a two-day BoJ policy meeting on Friday. In the meantime, concerns about Japan's fiscal health, amid Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's expansionary policies, could act as a headwind for the JPY and help limit the downside for the GBP/JPY cross. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before traders start positioning for any meaningful depreciating move in the near term.\nEconomic Indicator\nConsumer Price Index (YoY)\nThe United Kingdom (UK) Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly basis, is a measure of consumer price inflation \u2013 the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall \u2013 produced to international standards. It is the inflation measure used in the government\u2019s target. The YoY reading compares prices in the reference month to a year earlier. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the Pound Sterling (GBP), while a low reading is seen as bearish.\nRead more.Last release: Wed Jan 21, 2026 07:00\nFrequency: Monthly\nActual: 3.4%\nConsensus: 3.3%\nPrevious: 3.2%\nSource: Office for National Statistics\nThe Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation, as measured by the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) at around 2%, giving the monthly release its importance. An increase in inflation implies a quicker and sooner increase of interest rates or the reduction of bond-buying by the BOE, which means squeezing the supply of pounds. Conversely, a drop in the pace of price rises indicates looser monetary policy. A higher-than-expected result tends to be GBP bullish.\nAuthor\nHaresh Menghani\nFXStreet\nHaresh Menghani is a detail-oriented professional with 10+ years of extensive experience in analysing the global financial markets."

During the early European trading hours, the pair hovered near 212.20-212.15, showing little reaction after the latest UK inflation report.\nAccording to the UK Office for National Statistics, the annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed by 3.4% in December, up from November\u2019s 3.2% and slightly above the anticipated 3.3%. The core CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components, increased by 3.2% year-on-year, aligning with both forecasts and the previous month\u2019s figure. Despite these numbers, expectations for an imminent Bank of England (BoE) interest rate cut at the upcoming policy meeting remain low, and the data provided little support for the British Pound or the GBP/JPY exchange rate.\nTraders continue to anticipate that the BoE will reduce rates at least twice more by 2026, a stance that contrasts sharply with the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) potential for further tightening. This policy divergence has contributed to the Japanese Yen\u2019s (JPY) relative strength against the Pound. Additionally, ongoing risk aversion\u2014driven by escalating tensions around Greenland and broader geopolitical uncertainties\u2014has boosted demand for the safe-haven JPY, putting extra pressure on the GBP/JPY pair.\nDespite the Yen\u2019s recent gains, bullish sentiment remains cautious as investors look for clearer signals regarding the BoJ\u2019s next move on interest rates. Attention is now focused on the outcome of the BoJ\u2019s two-day policy meeting scheduled for Friday. Meanwhile, worries about Japan\u2019s fiscal outlook, especially in light of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s expansionary agenda, may weigh on the Yen and help cushion the GBP/JPY\u2019s decline. As a result, traders may prefer to wait for a decisive downward move before betting on a significant drop in the pair in the near future."

                "body": "Given that Cathie Wood and her team at Ark Invest are such big fans of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin (BTC 0.02%), it's only natural that the company has its own spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\nThe ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB +0.60%) tracks the price of Bitcoin by owning actual tokens of the world's largest cryptocurrency and distributing shares based on ownership. This makes it easy for investors of all kinds to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of purchasing Bitcoin directly and storing it in a crypto wallet.\nThe ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF charges a 0.21% management fee, which is the only fee charged when purchasing the ETF. Should you buy, sell, or hold the ETF in 2026?\nA unique diversifier\nGiven that the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF tracks the price of Bitcoin, the question really boils down to whether one should buy, hold, or sell Bitcoin. A main reason to hold the token is that it can provide unique diversification in one's portfolio. Bitcoin's finite 21 million tokens that will ever be mined, position the token as a potential form of digital gold.\nWhile Bitcoin at times trades like a high-beta tech stock, it has also tracked the movements of gold and other precious metals. Gold has surged in recent years due to geopolitical concerns and mounting U.S. government debt, which has raised concerns among investors, particularly in the bond market, about the U.S. government's financial situation and how sustainable it is.\nThe U.S. government now has a fiscal deficit of nearly $1.8 trillion and total debt of over $38 trillion. Each year, the government allocates a significant portion of the fiscal budget to interest payments on the debt.\nNYSEMKT: ARKB\nKey Data Points\nA cohort of economists and market strategists believes that, over time, this will contribute to U.S. dollar debasement, particularly if the government implements policies to boost growth, which could lead to higher or more prolonged inflation. This is the main case for gold, and it's an investment theory that has worked incredibly well in recent years.\nThere's still widespread dispute over whether Bitcoin is a form of digital gold. While I can't be certain, I think Bitcoin's ascent is telling that there is at least a good chance of Bitcoin being a form of digital gold, and therefore a unique diversifier in one's portfolio. For this reason, I think it's a good idea to at least have some Bitcoin in your portfolio.\nThe fact that over 95% of tokens have now been mined and are in circulation also sets up a strong supply-and-demand dynamic for Bitcoin."

                "body": "Bitcoin ETF Outflows Trigger Alarming Plunge: $490M Exit Wipes 2026 Gains\nShare:\nBitcoinWorld\nBitcoin ETF Outflows Trigger Alarming Plunge: $490M Exit Wipes 2026 Gains\nGlobal cryptocurrency markets witnessed a significant correction on Tuesday, March 18, 2025, as Bitcoin\u2019s price tumbled to approximately $87,000, decisively erasing its year-to-date gains for 2026. This sharp decline coincided with nearly $490 million in net outflows from U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a single trading session, according to data aggregated by Walter Bloomberg. The sudden shift highlights the fragile interplay between institutional investment vehicles and underlying asset volatility.\nBitcoin ETF Outflows and the $87,000 Breakdown\nThe reported net outflows of $490 million represent one of the largest single-day withdrawals since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Consequently, this substantial capital movement directly pressured Bitcoin\u2019s market price. Market analysts immediately linked the sell-off to a broad resurgence of risk-off sentiment across global financial markets. Furthermore, traditional safe-haven assets like gold and certain government bonds saw increased interest during the same period.\nWalter Bloomberg\u2019s report detailed that Bitcoin had been up as much as 12% for the year before this reversal. The swift downturn, therefore, underscores the cryptocurrency\u2019s continued sensitivity to macro-financial flows. Key data points from the event include:\n- Price Peak to Trough: A drop from yearly highs above $98,000 to the $87,000 level.\n- ETF Flow Impact: The $490M outflow suggests institutional and large-scale investor profit-taking or risk management.\n- Volume Spike: Trading volumes across major exchanges surged by over 40% compared to the weekly average.\nThis event provides a clear case study in how ETF flows, once hailed as a stabilizing force, can also accelerate downward momentum during market stress.\nAnalyzing the Drivers of Cryptocurrency Market Volatility\nSeveral interconnected factors converged to create the conditions for this sell-off. Primarily, escalating geopolitical tensions in several regions prompted investors to reduce exposure to perceived risk assets. Additionally, comments from central bank officials regarding persistent inflationary pressures contributed to uncertainty about future liquidity conditions.\nMarket structure also played a critical role. The growing dominance of ETF-held Bitcoin means large redemption requests from authorized participants force the underlying custodians to sell BTC on the open market. This mechanism can create a self-reinforcing cycle during periods of net outflows. Historical data shows similar, though less pronounced, patterns occurred during previous ETF outflow episodes in late 2024.\nExpert Warnings and Technical Support Levels\nFollowing the price action, several trading desks and analysis firms issued warnings. Notably, analysts cited by Walter Bloomberg indicated that Bitcoin could now test a crucial support band between $80,000 and $84,000. This zone represents a key consolidation area from Q4 2025 and a major on-chain cost basis for many recent investors.\nTechnical analysts point to the 100-day moving average, currently near $83,500, as a level that could provide dynamic support. A sustained break below $80,000, however, might signal a deeper correction toward the next significant support near $75,000. The increased volatility, measured by the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVOL), has more than doubled from its February lows, indicating trader anxiety.\nThe table below summarizes the key price levels and their significance:\nThe Broader Impact on Digital Asset Markets\nBitcoin\u2019s decline predictably exerted downward pressure on the wider digital asset ecosystem. Major altcoins, often correlated with Bitcoin\u2019s price movements, experienced declines ranging from 8% to 15%. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies fell by over $200 billio"

The latest inflow represents roughly 0.98% of the fund\u2019s $577.28 million in assets under management (AUM), a meaningful vote of confidence for a product tethered to a volatile crypto market.\nWhile the fund\u2019s size remains modest compared with the largest spot bitcoin ETFs, an inflow of nearly 1% of AUM in a single session suggests that some investors are using recent weakness in bitcoin as a chance to build or average into positions. The move bucks the narrative of continuous outflows that often accompany sharp drawdowns in digital assets.\nThe related asset, BTC-USD, is currently trading at $89,045.31, down about 17.38% over the past three months. Short-term sentiment is decidedly negative, with a 1-day technical signal flashing Strong Sell. That combination\u2014persistent price pressure and bearish technicals\u2014typically pushes more cautious investors to the sidelines, but the latest flow into EZBC indicates that a segment of the market is positioning for a potential rebound or at least a stabilization in bitcoin\u2019s trajectory.\nFor now, Franklin\u2019s ETF appears to be attracting opportunistic buyers willing to tolerate volatility in exchange for regulated exposure to the crypto asset class. Whether these inflows mark the early stages of a sentiment turn or merely a brief countertrend move will likely hinge on how bitcoin trades in the coming weeks and whether the Strong Sell signals begin to soften.\nFor a more detailed analysis and real-time sentiment trends, check the live cryptocurrency prices here."

Dow futures edge higher as markets brace for Trump\u2019s Davos speech and tariff fallout\nSynopsis\nDow Jones futures rise today as markets brace for Trump\u2019s Davos speech and tariff fallout. U.S. stock futures nudged higher Wednesday as Wall Street looks to recover from a massive 871-point Dow plunge. Dow Jones futures rose 49 points (0.10%), while S&P 500 futures climbed 0.18%. Investors are cautiously awaiting President Trump\u2019s high-stakes 8:30 a.m. ET speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Markets remain tense following threats of a 10% tariff on European allies over the Greenland dispute.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 871 points, or 1.8%, while the S&P 500 dropped 2.1% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.4%, with both indexes breaking below key 50-day moving averages. Heavyweight technology stocks led the decline, intensifying concerns that the market\u2019s recent rally is losing momentum just as earnings season accelerates.\nBeyond the headlines of trade wars and corporate earnings, the underlying macroeconomic data is sending mixed signals. The rise in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.29% indicates that the bond market is bracing for \"higher-for-longer\" interest rates. This environment is traditionally hostile to growth stocks and sensitive sectors like real estate and housing.\nThe SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) already reflected this pressure, dropping 2.3% on Tuesday. Simultaneously, a recent private payrolls report suggests that hiring is slowing significantly, with only about 8,000 new jobs being added per week. This cooling of the labor market creates a dilemma for the Federal Reserve: if they keep rates high to fight inflation, they risk a harder landing for the economy as hiring stalls.\nThe energy market is also witnessing extreme volatility. Crude oil futures fell 1% overnight after a 1.5% rise to $60.34 a barrel on Tuesday. More shockingly, natural gas futures skyrocketed 25.9%, marking the largest one-day gain in nearly three years. This surge in energy costs, combined with expensive borrowing, puts immense pressure on industrial companies and consumer discretionary spending.\nInvestors are now being advised to look toward dividend-paying stocks with yields greater than 3% as a way to generate income in a flat or declining market. As the \"known unknowns\" of the Trump administration's trade policy meet the \"known\" data of a slowing job market, the strategy for many on Wall Street has shifted from aggressive growth to capital preservation and tactical defensive positioning.\nInvestors are now focused on Trump\u2019s scheduled address at the World Economic Forum in Davos at 8:30 a.m. ET, an event that could reset global risk sentiment within minutes. With borrowing costs elevated and hiring slowing, markets are increasingly sensitive to political shockwaves.\nWhy Dow futures are steady despite rising global trade risks\nThe modest uptick in futures masks growing unease beneath the surface. Overnight gains reflect positioning rather than conviction, as traders hedge ahead of potential volatility tied to Trump\u2019s Davos remarks and European responses to new tariff threats.U.S. 10-year Treasury yields climbed to 4.29%, the highest level since August, reinforcing the message that financial conditions remain tight. Elevated yields keep pressure on interest-rate-sensitive sectors, including banks, real estate, and small-cap stocks, even as equity valuations remain historically stretched.\nAt the same time, economic signals are sending mixed messages. A private payrolls report shows job growth slowing to roughly 8,000 new jobs per week, suggesting the labor market is cooling. That softness could eventually support rate cuts, but for now, higher yields are outweighing the benefit of slower hiring.\nCommodity markets tell a similar story of stress. Gold and silver continue to attract safe-haven flows, while crude oil slipped 1% overnight after recent volatility. "

Sherrill did just that.\n\u201cFirst, I am issuing an executive order giving the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities the authority to pause new utility requests for additional rate increases, and I will freeze rate hikes to finally provide families with real relief on their energy bills,\u201d she said in her inaugural address.\nShe was met with loud applause as she signed the order while she spoke, holding it up to show the large crowd at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.\n\u201cSecond, I am issuing an executive order directing the Board of Public Utilities to open solicitations for new solar and storage power generation, to modernize gas and nuclear generation, so we can lower utility costs over the long term.\u201d\nShe signed that as well, pledging to end skyrocketing utility costs.\nThe first executive order calls upon the BPU to offset upcoming rate increases due to the actions of the PJM (Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland) Interconnection with what was called \u201cresidential universal bill credits.\u201d The PJM is the regional power grid serving 67 million people that oversees the movement of electricity and its markets in 13 states and the District of Columbia,\nThe order also called for a rate freeze, ordering the BPU to consider pursuing \u201ca pause, abeyance, or modification of the schedule governing any proceedings in which electric distribution utilities seek approvals for rate increases or cost recoveries to the extent permitted by law.\u201d\nThe governor additionally directed the board to \u201creview utility business models to ensure alignment with delivering cost reductions to ratepayers.\u201d\nThe second executive order declared a state of emergency over the energy crisis.\nAmong its directives:\n- State agencies were instructed to identify permit reforms to more rapidly deploy new energy projects.\n- The BPU was directed to take action on artificial intelligence \u201cghost loads,\u201d by requiring electric utilities to report on energy requests from data centers.\n- Programs to bring on thousands of megawatts of new solar and battery storage generation will be accelerated.\n- The state will establish a nuclear power task force with the aim of developing new nuclear generation facilities in the state.\nTaking a sharp swipe at President Donald Trump and his plans for a new White House ballroom, she remarked: \u201cI hope, New Jersey, you remember me when you open your electric bill and it hasn\u2019t gone up another 20%. I can promise you it won\u2019t be because I waste your money on a ballroom at Drumthwacket,\u201d in reference to the governor\u2019s mansion.\nBut Sherrill\u2019s clout as governor to drive down energy costs and utility bills may need more than a declaration and the stroke of a pen, in a complex regulatory environment marked by increasing demand and a shortage of generating capacity that has been driving up prices for residential, commercial and industrial customers for years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy soundbite solution. It\u2019s no simple fix,\u201d said attorney Adrian D. Newall, an energy practitioner for 25 years who has worked at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Exelon, and Public Service Enterprise Group, and is now director of the Lawyering Program at Seton Hall University School of Law.\nA blanket rate freeze is likely not legal, according to Newall. She added that the bulk of what New Jersey pays for power comes by way of the PJM capacity auction \u2014 which is something the new governor may not be able to control.\nPJM has been the target of mounting criticism by gove"

Springtime wage negotiations\u2013 which yielded bumper wage hikes for the last two years\u2013 are key to the BOJ\u2019s stance.\n\u201cAny firmer rhetoric from the BoJ on their expectation of solid wage hike may mean an earlier policy action,\u201d Frances Cheung, Head of FX and Rates Strategy at OCBC wrote in a note, stating that they saw potential 25 bps hike by as early as March.\nMarkets will also be watching to see how the BOJ reacts to expectations of looser fiscal policy under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Takaichi earlier this week declared a snap election for early-February, with the goal of gaining more seats in parliament and pushing for more fiscally expansionary policy.\nThis weighed heavily on the yen, with the BOJ also expected to potentially present a hawkish stance as it works to support the beleaguered currency.\nJapanese consumer price index inflation data is also due before Friday\u2019s decision, and is expected to show a sharp cooling in December inflation.\nING analysts said that any cooling in inflation could spur a rethinking in the BOJ\u2019s plans for future rate hikes.\n\u201cStrong wage growth and government aid will keep core inflation above 2%,\u201d ING analysts wrote in a note.\n\u201cOnce the BoJ confirms that core inflation will remain above 2% and outpace headline inflation, it will likely take the next step sometime in the second half of 2026.\u201d\nHow will USDJPY react?\nThe Japanese yen weakened substantially against the dollar in January, amid growing concerns over Takaichi\u2019s fiscal loosening plans.\nThe yen\u2019s USD/JPY pair\u2013 which gauges the number of yen required to buy one dollar\u2013 had risen as high as 159 yen earlier this month, hitting its highest level in 2-\u00bd years.\nWeakness in the yen came amidst a steep selloff in Japanese government bonds, as investors questioned just how Takaichi will fund her spending plans.\n\u201cBoJ officials may put more weight on the impact of a weak yen on inflation,\u201d OCBC\u2019s Cheung said. \u201cMore explicit comments on this front will be taken as hawkish.\u201d\nAny hawkish talk from the BOJ is likely to offer the yen some support, although the Japanese currency had taken few positive cues from the BOJ\u2019s December meeting, which was also viewed as hawkish.\nA more moderate or cautious stance from the BOJ may also spark extended losses in the yen.\nHow will the Nikkei 225 react?\nJapanese stock markets blazed past the BOJ\u2019s hawkish stance in December, as investors largely cheered the prospect of more fiscal spending under Takaichi, looking past the outlook for higher interest rates.\nThis trend may keep local stocks upbeat on Friday, even if the BOJ strikes a hawkish chord.\nThe Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indexes hit a series of record highs in January, and traded to close to these peaks ahead of the January meeting.\nBank stocks are likely to benefit further from any rate hike talk, given that higher rates stand to boost their lending margins.

Exports for the year rose 3.1%, while imports remained about the same on-year, gaining less than 1%.\nFor the month of December, Japan recorded a 105.7 billion yen ($669 million) trade surplus.\nThe monthly surplus was 12% smaller than what was racked up a year ago. Imports grew 5.3% from the same month a year ago, while exports grew 5.1%.\nBy nation, exports to the U.S. declined 11% in December, while exports to Britain, Africa and some other Asian countries rose. Imports from Europe were strong.\nThe United States has imposed a 15% tariff on most imports from Japan, a reduction from the 25% that Trump initially proposed but an increase from before he took office a year ago.\nAnother looming concern is the impact on Japanese manufacturing, including automakers, from China\u2019s curbs on exports of rare earths.\nThe controls were announced by Beijing after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a Chinese move on Taiwan could prompt a Japanese military response.\nTakaichi has called a snap elections for next month in hopes her party can gain strength in Parliament while she is popular with the public.\nOverall, Japan\u2019s economy has held up, despite grumbling from the public about rising prices and stagnant wages. The benchmark Nikkei on the Tokyo Stock Exchange keeps hitting new records.\n___\nYuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama"
