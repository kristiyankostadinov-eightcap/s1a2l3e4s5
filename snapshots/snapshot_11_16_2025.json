                "body": "Gold prices are dropping amid a fluctuating trading session, impacted by a robust US Dollar due to risk-averse sentiment. The precious metal fell below a previous resistance level at $4,150 before the US market opened, touching intraday lows of around $4,130.\nA bearish trend appears as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) show negative signals. Support stands at $4,100, near a trendline from early November, with a further focus on $4,050.\nResistance Levels For Gold\nImmediate resistance levels are at $4,210 and $4,245, with bulls needing to exceed these to aim for highs near $4,380. Gold has long served as a store of value, perceived as a safe haven during uncertain times.\nCentral banks, the largest gold holders, added 1,136 tonnes in 2022, reflecting high purchase rates especially by countries such as China, India, and Turkey. Gold typically inversely relates to the US Dollar and Treasuries, usually rising as the Dollar drops, allowing diversification.\nGeopolitical instability and recession fears can prompt Gold price hikes, as it climbs with lower interest rates but falls with higher ones. The US Dollar\u2019s behaviour significantly influences Gold movements.\nGiven the current pullback in gold, we are watching the US Dollar\u2019s strength closely, as it is the main driver of this move. The Dollar Index (DXY) has climbed back above the 106.00 level this week, fueled by Federal Reserve officials hinting that a December 2025 rate cut is now less likely. This sentiment is pushing gold below the key $4,150 support area.\nFed\u2019s Influence On Gold\nThe Fed\u2019s hawkish tone is supported by recent economic data, which we must factor into our strategies. The latest Consumer Price Index report for October 2025 showed inflation remaining unexpectedly stubborn at 3.5%, while the last jobs report added a solid 210,000 nonfarm payrolls. This strong data gives the central bank justification to delay easing, putting continued pressure on non-yielding assets like gold.\nFor the immediate weeks ahead, the bearish technical signals suggest a defensive posture is warranted. We see the break below $4,150 opening the door to the next support level at $4,100. Derivative traders could consider buying put options with a strike price near $4,100 or using bear call spreads to profit from a potential slide or sideways movement.\nHowever, we must remember the significant underlying support from central bank buying, which has been a powerful trend since the record purchases seen back in 2022. The World Gold Council confirmed this trend continued, with over 1,000 tonnes added to reserves in 2024 and another 950 tonnes purchased in the first three quarters of 2025. This persistent demand suggests that a deeper sell-off toward the $4,050 level would likely be viewed as a major buying opportunity by long-term players.\nTherefore, a contrarian strategy could involve positioning for a bounce from those lower levels. Selling cash-secured puts with a strike price around $4,050 could allow traders to collect premium while waiting for a potential entry point. If the market shows signs of bottoming out at that trendline support, we would see it as a signal to shift from a defensive to a cautiously bullish stance."

                "body": "Gold and silver prices in the global markets fell significantly on Friday as investor sentiment weakened following a series of hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve officials. The remarks dampened expectations of a possible interest-rate cut in December, pushing traders to reassess their positions in precious metals.\nThe decline was further reinforced by the resolution of the US government shutdown. With the shutdown ending, concerns about economic disruption eased, reducing the safe-haven appeal that had recently supported bullion prices.\nMarket analysts noted that the combination of firmer rate-cut expectations being pushed back and a fading flight-to-safety trade weighed heavily on both gold and silver through the session. Since these metals offer no yield, higher-for-longer interest rates make them less attractive compared with interest-bearing assets.\nExperts believe that the current softness in bullion may persist in the near term. Unless there is a renewed surge in risk aversion or a clear shift in the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy tone, gold and silver could remain under pressure as investors track upcoming US economic data and policy statements.\nIndia\nThe price trend in India for gold and silver showed a mixed but steady trend on Saturday, November 15, with both metals holding near recent highs despite a brief phase of consolidation. Domestic prices reflected the influence of global market cues, currency movements and the easing of festival-driven demand.\nGold prices remained firm, with 24-carat rates across major cities hovering around Rs 1.27 lakh per 10 grams. The metal has been under mild pressure after US Federal Reserve officials signalled a cautious stance on cutting interest rates. Their comments strengthened the US dollar, reducing the appeal of non-interest-bearing assets like gold. Even so, domestic demand from weddings and jewellery buyers kept prices supported, and local premiums remained intact in several markets.\nSilver prices softened slightly after their sharp rise in recent weeks. Rates on November 15 averaged around Rs 1.73\u20131.75 lakh per kilogram in key cities, including Chennai. The marginal dip followed a surge during the festive season, when industrial offtake and retail buying pushed silver to record levels. As festival demand tapered, premiums eased, but the broader uptrend stayed in place due to strong global industrial demand, particularly from electronics and clean-energy sectors.\nMarket analysts noted that both metals are in a consolidation phase after significant gains. Gold is trading just below its recent peak and could resume its upward move if global uncertainty persists or if the dollar weakens. Silver continues to show higher volatility and remains sensitive to shifts in industrial demand and speculative activity.\nFor buyers, the current level represents a stable but elevated price zone. Jewellery demand is expected to remain steady through the ongoing wedding season, while investors may prefer to wait for clearer global signals before making large purchases. The next direction for both metals will likely be shaped by US economic data, upcoming central bank communication and any movement in the rupee against the dollar.\nKey drivers behind global price trend\nThe precious metals lost ground as investors reassessed the outlook for US monetary policy. Since bullion offers no yield, expectations of higher-for-longer interest rates tend to reduce its appeal. Recent remarks from Federal Reserve officials, which played down the likelihood of a December rate cut, added to the pressure and weakened sentiment across precious metals. The prolonged US government shutdown had earlier created gaps in key economic data, making the policy path harder to gauge and pushing markets to temper their rate-cut expectations even further.\nWith the shutdown now resolved, the urgency for safe-haven assets has eased.

If you take gold out of the stuff we use to measure prices (CPI), inflation could be negative for the next couple of months. That means prices might actually drop a bit!\nLast October, India's inflation was super low at just 0.25 percent. This was because veggies, beans, spices, fruits, oils, and fats got cheaper.\nGold's Crazy Impact on Inflation\nSo, gold prices shot up, making personal care and effects inflation jump to a wild 57.8 percent! But, without gold, the main inflation number goes down to -0.57 percent. Regular inflation stayed about the same in October, but take out gold, and it drops to 2.6 percent. Those GST changes we had are helping lower inflation a lot, more than we thought.\nInflation Varies by State\nInflation is doing all sorts of different things depending on where you are. Kerala's got the highest at 8.56 percent, but Jammu & Kashmir and Karnataka are chilling below 3 percent. Out of 22 states, 12 have negative inflation, and the others are really low.\nRBI's Tricky Situation\nThe report says that low inflation and fast GDP growth (over 7 percent) are making things tough for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Next month, they have to be careful to help the economy grow but also not let prices go wild. Plus, the inflation numbers coming out for November and December, along with the Q3 GDP numbers, will help the RBI figure out what to do next.\nThe report also says that the RBI didn't change rates last time, so they don't have many options now. Any rate cuts they do will have to be done really carefully. Since inflation might stay low for a while, the RBI has to handle low prices and still help the economy grow."

That would drive prices up by 56% to 75% initially to between $140 and $157 a barrel, says the report.\nThe World Bank also describes a \"medium disruption\" risk scenario in which crude reaches $109 to $121 per barrel. In the case of a \"small disruption\" oil prices would increase to a range of $93 to $102 a barrel.\nThe report says high prices of oil and other commodities \"would intensify food insecurity in the region and across the world.\"\n\u201cIf a severe oil price shock materializes, it would push up food price inflation that has already been elevated in many developing countries,\u201d said Ayhan Kose, the World Bank\u2019s deputy chief economist.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the World Bank\u2019s baseline outlook, crude is expected to average $90 a barrel in the current quarter before declining to an average of $81 a barrel in 2024 as the global economy slows.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) crude futures hovered above $82 and $88 per barrel Tuesday midday, down about 8% over the last 10 days.\nPrices surged more than 4% in one day after Hamas attacked Israel earlier this month, amid fears the fighting would bring in nearby Iran, an oil-producing country.\nThe World Bank report points out the conflict's modest impact on commodity prices so far reflects a more diversified world oil supply market, individual countries' petroleum reserves, and reduced overall oil dependence.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                "body": "Brent and WTI crude jumped after a Ukrainian drone strike and new US sanctions on Russian oil, despite oversupply concerns and a shifting OPEC outlook.\n2 days ago \u2022 2 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nBrent and WTI crude prices leapt more than 2% after a Ukrainian drone strike hit a major Russian oil port, while new US sanctions on Russian oil giants added fresh fuel to supply worries.\nWhat does this mean?\nOil markets, recently weighed down by fears of oversupply, made a rapid U-turn after news broke that a Ukrainian drone strike damaged the Novorossiysk oil depot\u2014a critical Russian export hub on the Black Sea. That disruption rattled supply chains, sending Brent and WTI futures sharply higher after days of declines. Adding to the turmoil, the US slapped new sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft, cutting off many transactions after November 21. JPMorgan reports about 1.4 million barrels per day of Russian oil are now stuck on tankers, struggling to find buyers amid tightening sanctions\u2014a hurdle likely to grow as restrictions take hold. On top of this, OPEC revised its forecast to a slight global oil surplus by 2026, while the US reported higher-than-expected crude inventories. All together, these twists have made oil prices extra jumpy as traders try to make sense of the latest disruptions.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Supply risks keep oil traders guessing.\nThis week\u2019s rally shows how quickly oil markets can flip when new supply threats pop up. Even though OPEC sees a mild surplus ahead, immediate incidents\u2014like attacks and sanctions\u2014are keeping traders on edge. With Russian oil piling up on tankers and US stockpiles climbing, the near-term outlook is murky. All this uncertainty is fueling more volatility and a cautious approach from investors.\nThe bigger picture: Energy security moves to the forefront.\nGeopolitical flare-ups and sanctions are pushing energy security up the agenda for governments and companies alike. The difficulty moving Russian oil, shifting OPEC forecasts, and changing US inventories are prompting new strategies around where and how countries get their energy. This isn\u2019t just about short-term price moves\u2014these changes could reshape the way oil flows globally for years to come.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Euro Forecast: EUR/USD, EUR/JPY Show Relative Strength Amidst Major FX Consolidation\nEuro Forecast\nThe Euro remains as one of the stronger currencies in the FX market and that\u2019s on display best in EUR/JPY, where a strong Euro and weak Japanese Yen have combined to drive the pair to fresh all-time-highs, with the pair stalling just before its first ever test of the 180 psychological level.\nWhile most global central banks would probably like to see some element of currency weakness at the moment, the fact that the Bank of Japan is in a position where it\u2019s difficult to hike rates and the European Central Bank has already cut rates quite a bit, there\u2019s been a defined fundamental bias on the long side of the pair that can remain attractive as we move into next week.\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the long side of the pair and on EUR/JPY specifically as a way to work with Japanese Yen weakness that does not involve the US Dollar, because if we look at USD/JPY, we can see a bullish backdrop since the 140.00 support hold in April and even as DXY set fresh lows on day one of Q3 or on the Fed\u2019s rate cut on September 17th, USD/JPY has continued into higher-lows. The major pair had its first test of the 155.00 handle in nine months last week, and that makes the prospect of chasing USD/JPY a bit more daunting, although I don\u2019t expect 155.00 to bring on the intervention order from the Japanese Finance Ministry.\nEUR/USD\nIn the major pair of EUR/USD, I\u2019m still considering it as one of the more attractive venues for USD-weakness, as I had looked at in the Tuesday webinar. Bulls took a step forward this week in pushing a breakout from a falling wedge pattern to continue a series of higher-highs and lows that started after a failed run from bears at a really big level.\nA week earlier, EUR/USD was trading below the 1.1500 level and I warned then that a clean break of a major psychological level like that was not something that I was expecting. That led to a pullback to a Fibonacci level by the end of that week, and that Fibonacci level at 1.1593 remains a big spot for the pair as it\u2019s now higher-low support potential after functioning as prior resistance.\nEUR/USD Four-Hour Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/USD Daily\nFrom the daily chart we can see that bulls aren\u2019t exactly home free here, and this echoes the broader DXY backdrop where the Dollar set a fresh four-month-high two weeks ago and has been in pull back since. But \u2013 price in DXY held a big spot of support at the Fibonacci level of 98.98, and in EUR/USD, there\u2019s still a claim for bearish structure on the daily chart.\nThis puts emphasis on a couple of key levels. First, it\u2019s the swing high at 1.1668, which held two highs on the daily before sellers pushed down for a fresh low. And then it\u2019s the Fibonacci level at 1.1686, which held the daily high on October 17th before the bearish trend got back in order.\nIf bulls can pose a break above those levels, particularly with a closed daily bar, it\u2019s going to look more attractive for bullish potential in the pair \u2013 and for traders looking to work with USD-weakness, I still think this is one of the more attractive backdrops for such.\nAbove 1.1686 is the 1.1717 level followed by 1.1748, which was support-turned-resistance in September and early-October, just as the pair started to turn.\nEUR/USD Daily Chart\nChart prepared by James Stanley; data derived from Tradingview\nEUR/JPY\nI talk a lot about the Japanese Yen and it\u2019s been an interesting year for the currency, both from a technical and fundamental point of view. USD/JPY was hit hard when recession fears were taking over in the US and that pushed USD/JPY down for another test of the 140.00 handle in April.\nBut \u2013 since then \u2013 USD/JPY has been showing higher-highs and lows and this made the pair as one of the more attractive majors to work with USD-strength, so that when we did have episodes like the early-October breakout in DXY, USD/JPY showed that quite well.

Check our detailed guide-\nThe Eurozone data offered little support to the shared currency. The Q3 GDP rose by 0.2% QoQ and 1.4% YoY, signaling a stable economic momentum. Industrial production and sentiment data revealed mixed figures.\nMeanwhile, some ECB officials and President Christine Lagarde reaffirmed that the central bank remains vigilant and the euro holds a strong position in terms of economic and monetary policy.\nFrom the US, the dollar remained under pressure last week, despite optimism surrounding the end of the US shutdown. Markets awaited the delayed economic release, which the shutdown had halted. Softer labor data pressured the dollar. Meanwhile, hawkish remarks from Fed officials, including Schmid, Kashkari, Bostic, and others, reduced expectations of a December cut.\nOn Friday, markets priced in a 50% probability of a December Fed cut, down from 70% the previous week. The development stemmed from policymakers emphasizing caution and transparency in the economic conditions before implementing further easing measures. The Fed Chair Powell\u2019s statement regarding uncertainty over the December rate cut contributed to investor cautiousness.\nEUR/USD Weekly Key Events\nThe significant events in the coming week include:\n- EUR G20 Meeting\n- Fed\u2019s Williams Speech\n- Fed\u2019s Kashkari Speech\n- FOMC Minutes\n- Continuing Jobless Claims\n- Initial Jobless Claims\nNext week, traders anticipate the FOMC minutes, the G20 meeting, and speeches by Fed officials for further insights into policy cues and global risk sentiment. Markets also expect the long-overdue US NFP report on Thursday. However, the schedule is not clear yet.\nEUR/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Wobbling Near Key DMAs\nThe EUR/USD daily chart shows the pair in a slight bullish tone earlier in the week after stabilizing above the 1.1600 level. However, the broader trend remains neutral. The upside momentum remains limited, as the pair remains below the key 50-, 100-, and 200-day MAs.\n-If you are interested in forex day trading, then have a read of our guide to getting started-\nThe RSI holds near the mid-50s, indicating fading selling pressure.

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro Holds 1.1600 as Fed Resistance Cuts Odds Drop to 56% and Eurozone Growth Rebounds to 1.4%\nThe Euro stabilizes after a weekly 0.51% rise, supported by revised GDP and stalled U.S. data releases, while the Fed\u2019s hawkish stance and the DXY bounce from 98.99 set the stage for a breakout | That's TradingNEWs\nEUR/USD Price Dislocation And Policy Divergence\nThe EUR/USD pair holds the 1.1600 line after a turbulent week that redefined the balance between U.S. policy uncertainty and Eurozone stability. The pair\u2019s ability to end the week 0.51% higher, despite a 0.10% Friday pullback, reflects how aggressively markets repriced December rate-cut expectations from 70% earlier to 56% as hawkish Federal Reserve voices overwhelmed the absence of U.S. economic data during the shutdown. The U.S. Dollar Index rebounded to 99.31 after tagging 98.99, a Fibonacci pivot that halted a two-day sell-off and prevented EUR/USD from claiming a breakout above the 1.1659 50-day moving average. That failed breach kept 1.1659 as the ceiling, while 1.1600 remained the battlefield where intraday longs and shorts clashed into the weekend.\nEUR/USD And The Shifting Federal Reserve Narrative\nThe Fed delivered one of its most divided communication weeks of the year. Jeffrey Schmid, Kashkari, Musalem, Collins, Bostic, and other regional presidents leaned toward a more restrictive stance, warning that inflation remained \u201ctoo hot\u201d and policy was \u201conly modestly restrictive.\u201d Schmid\u2019s pushback was especially impactful because he dissented at the last meeting and signaled he would likely oppose any December cut without forceful evidence of deterioration. In contrast, Stephen Miran doubled down on his dovish view, emphasizing that the latest data\u2014what little was available\u2014should push the Fed toward easing, not away from it. Meanwhile, Powell\u2019s carefully-neutral tone, combined with Williams\u2019 restrained messaging, locked markets in a holding pattern. With no labor data, no CPI, and no clarity due to the shutdown\u2019s backlog, EUR/USD reacted to rhetoric rather than fundamentals, producing intraday spikes that failed to establish follow-through beyond the 1.1659 resistance.\nEUR/USD Anchored By Eurozone Stability And Revised Growth Data\nThe Eurozone provided a measurable counterbalance to U.S. policy turbulence. Revised Q3 GDP moving from 1.3% to 1.4% year-over-year, alongside a 0.2% quarterly gain, gave the euro just enough structural support to absorb dollar strength. Industrial production and sentiment data were mixed, but the absence of contraction allowed EUR/USD to remain resilient even as the U.S. dollar tried to rebound from deep oversold conditions. Christine Lagarde emphasized the bloc\u2019s steady footing and reiterated vigilance without signaling policy urgency, a tone that contrasted sharply with the Fed\u2019s contradictory messaging. The Eurozone data did not ignite a full bullish move, but it reinforced the floor above 1.1583, the 20-day moving average, and maintained 1.1500 as the deeper structural support that separates short-term noise from a real trend reversal.\nRead More\n-\nAlphabet Google Stock Price Forecast - GOOG Shares Surges Toward $288 as Massive $40B AI Investment\n15.11.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nXRP ETFs Ignite Wall Street: XRPI at $13.30 and XRPR at $18.61 as XRP-USD Stabilizes Near $2.25\n15.11.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas (NG=F) Drops to $3.89 as T\u00fcrkiye Spot Prices Spike and Global LNG Demand Accelerates\n15.11.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nStock Market Today: Nasdaq Rebounds to 22,900 as NVDA Stock at $190 and MU Rally While Dow Falls to 47,147\n15.11.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveMarkets\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Yen Surges Toward 154.60 as Fed Shifts to Neutral and Japan Raises Intervention Warnings\n15.11.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nEUR/USD Technical Posture And Momentum Alignment\nThe technical map shows EUR/USD navigating a narrow channel between resistance at 1.1650\u20131.1665 and foundational"

What is happening in GBP/USD right now is not drifting sentiment\u2014it is a direct and violent repricing driven by a sequence of data points that landed far weaker than expected across retail activity, labour markets, industry output and housing conditions. Retail sales slowed to 1.5%, crushing the 2.4% expectation and disappointing even the prior 2.0%, signalling consumers are retrenching. The labour market corrected aggressively as Claimant Count Change surged to 29,000, nearly double the 17,600 forecast, while unemployment pushed to 5.0% and wage growth slipped to 4.8% from 5.0%, reinforcing the pressure on households. This contraction in both spending and income momentum fed directly into GBP/USD weakness, pushing the pair below 1.3170, 1.3150, and back toward its seven-month lows near 1.3149.\nGrowth Deterioration And Industrial Collapse Deepen Downside Pressure On GBP/USD\nIndustry data intensified the bearish load on the pound. Manufacturing production collapsed \u20131.7%, more than double the \u20130.7% estimate, while industrial production fell \u20132.0% versus \u20130.5% expected, confirming a broad slowdown in real economy output. GDP readings offered no relief: monthly GDP printed \u20130.1% against a flat estimate, and preliminary quarterly GDP came in at only 0.1% instead of 0.2%. Housing sentiment reinforced the contractionary theme as the RICS House Price Balance fell to \u201319%, missing the \u201314% projection and holding only marginally better than last month\u2019s \u201317%, confirming the property market is losing confidence and liquidity. All these indicators collectively spell a deteriorating economic base\u2014one that forces GBP/USD traders to reassess whether the softening trajectory leaves the pair vulnerable to further slides toward 1.3058, 1.3012, or the deeper wave projection around 1.2831 derived from the extended corrective structure from 1.3787.\nFiscal Instability And Political Risk Amplify Sterling Volatility Across GBP/USD\nThe political layer worsened the sell-off. The UK government\u2019s decision to scrap planned income tax increases created significant unease about fiscal discipline, echoing the structural fragility seen in the 2022 mini-budget shock. With a budget deficit near \u00a330 billion, the market is now questioning how the government will stabilize finances without added revenue. This is why GBP/USD reacted instantly\u2014dropping to 1.3130, then 1.3149, and retesting 1.3150 during the Asian session. Investors immediately remembered the near-parity collapse from 2022, and the pound began to price a risk premium for policy inconsistency. The debt-to-GDP ratio hovering around 97.1% deepens investor scepticism and reduces the market\u2019s willingness to re-rate the pound higher until a credible fiscal trajectory emerges. This created the environment where every recovery attempt was sold into, preventing sustained rebounds above 1.3170\u20131.3188, the exact region capped by descending trendline resistance.\nUSD Strength And The Repricing Of Federal Reserve Expectations Reinforce GBP/USD Downside\nThe USD side of the cross turned simultaneously stronger. Markets scaled back expectations for a December Fed rate cut as officials adopted a more hawkish tone, replaying the 2024 \u201chigher for longer\u201d dynamic. Treasury yields recovered, money markets reduced rate-cut probability, and demand for USD surged across majors\u2014i"

Additionally, next week\u2019s RBA meeting minutes and FOMC minutes will guide traders on the economic outlook and future interest rate decisions.\nAUD/USD Weekly Technical Forecast: Consolidation Above 0.6500\nThe AUD/USD daily chart indicates the pair is in a neutral phase, trading above 0.6500.

                "body": "Bank of Japan policy uncertainty collided with fading Fed rate cut bets, sending USD/JPY to a nine-month high of 155.044. The Japanese government\u2019s fiscal policy plans and ultra-loose monetary policy stance also weighed on the yen as intervention threats fell on deaf ears.\nThe US government reopening, combined with FOMC members downplaying the chances for a December Fed rate cut, boosted demand for the greenback. Despite the US government reopening, a lack of key US inflation and jobs data left traders and the Fed focused on tariffs and inflation, a growing concern among FOMC members.\nUSD/JPY ended the week at 154.52, up 0.72% for the week ending November 14.\nIn the week ahead, several crucial Japanese economic indicators could shift sentiment toward the BoJ rate path, potentially triggering a USD/JPY reversal. Rising bets on a December or potentially January rate hike would narrow the US-Japan rate differential in favor of the yen.\nKey stats include third-quarter GDP, trade, inflation, and flash private sector PMI numbers.\nOn Monday, November 17, third-quarter Japanese GDP numbers are likely to fuel speculation about a BoJ rate hike. Economists forecast the economy to contract by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in Q3 after expanding 0.5% in the previous quarter.\nAn economic contraction would reflect the effect of US tariffs on external demand, dampening bets on a December rate hike. BoJ policymakers raised concerns about US trade policies adversely affecting the Japanese economy. For context, Japan\u2019s trade-to-GDP ratio sits above 45%, underscoring the importance of external demand for the economy.\nNotably, the third quarter numbers will not reflect the full effect of the US lowering tariffs on Japanese goods to 15% in September. Nevertheless, weakening external demand would likely fuel calls from policymakers for more time to assess the effects of tariffs on the economy.\nPrivate consumption trends will also face scrutiny amid concerns over the weaker Japanese yen pushing import prices higher. Rising import prices could weaken household purchasing power, potentially curbing consumption, while pushing consumer prices higher.\nEconomists expect private consumption to rise 0.1% QoQ, down from 0.4% in the third quarter.\nWhile economists expect external demand to weaken in the third quarter, October\u2019s trade data could shift sentiment. Economists forecast Japanese exports to rise 1.1% year-on-year (YoY) in October, down sharply from 4.2% in September. Meanwhile, economists expect imports to fall 0.7% (September: +3.3%), signaling weakening domestic demand.\nCooling external demand may further reduce expectations of a BoJ rate hike, weighing on the yen.\nCrucially, waning demand could indicate a further loss of economic momentum early in Q4, signaling a more dovish BoJ policy stance.\nOn Friday, November 21, traders should brace for Japanese inflation figures and flash PMI numbers, which are likely to face intense market scrutiny.\nEconomists forecast the so-called \u2018core-core\u2019 inflation rate to rise from 3% in September to 3.1% in October. Rising import prices could push inflation higher, potentially fueling calls for tighter monetary policy to support the yen. Hotter-than-expected inflation numbers may revive hopes for a BoJ rate hike, bolstering demand for the yen.\nMeanwhile, Japan\u2019s PMI reports will provide traders further insights into economic momentum midway through the fourth quarter. The S&P Global Services PMI will be the focal point, given that the services sector contributes over 70% to Japan\u2019s GDP.\nEconomists expect the Services PMI to drop from 53.1 in October to 52.8 in November. A sharper-than-expected drop would likely point to a less hawkish BoJ rate path, weighing on the yen.\nFollow our real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nAlthough Japanese data, BoJ commentary, and intervention jitters will influence yen demand, traders should closely track delayed US data and Fed speeches.\nAs Japan\u2019s policy out"

The price action reflects a fundamental reshaping of rate expectations between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, but the underlying forces driving this push are far more complex than a simple yield differential. Over the past five sessions, USD/JPY has gained more than 0.8%, a move powered by rising confidence in sustained U.S. rate stability combined with intense uncertainty stemming from the U.S. government shutdown, which left October CPI unreleased and pushed traders into a data-vacuum environment where policy commentary carries disproportionate weight.\nFederal Reserve Signals A Longer Plateau At 4.00% And Its Impact On USD/JPY Microstructure\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s shift from dovish assumptions to a more patient holding stance has realigned the forward curve. A month ago, futures implied only a 5.49% chance of maintaining rates at 4.00% in December, with markets betting aggressively on a cut to 3.75%. That probability has now surged to 54.25%, a tenfold reversal that directly strengthens USD demand across global currency baskets. Markets are adjusting not only to the Fed\u2019s refusal to promise cuts but to policymakers signaling the need for clarity on inflation and employment data that were never published due to the shutdown. Without CPI, the retail market and institutional desks rely on Fed speeches, and the messaging is unified: caution, patience, and a willingness to hold rates unchanged. This creates a critical asymmetry for USD/JPY, as Japan offers no equivalent upward adjustment in yields, amplifying demand for U.S. fixed-income assets.\nBank Of Japan\u2019s Neutral Stance And Japan\u2019s Fiscal Expansion Undermine Yen Stability\nThe Bank of Japan approaches its December 18\u201319 policy meeting with no urgency to alter its 0.5% benchmark rate despite internal discussions hinting at future tightening under stronger domestic conditions. The broader Japanese policy backdrop tilts in the opposite direction: aggressive fiscal spending initiatives paired with a BOJ hesitant to materially tighten create a structurally weaker yen. Japan\u2019s Finance Minister has publicly expressed concern over the yen\u2019s weakness and signaled readiness to monitor the currency with urgency. However, these statements alone carry little weight without matching policy action, and traders remember well that intervention levels sat near 150\u2013152 in 2022, making current levels historically vulnerable. Still, intervention risk is not symmetrical; the government tolerates gradual Yen depreciation but reacts sharply to fast disorderly moves. With USD/JPY testing 154+, this becomes a tactical risk embedded into all long positions.\nBond Market Dynamics Reinforce The USD Advantage And Anchor USD/JPY Above Key Thresholds\nThe U.S.\u2013Japan yield gap remains one of the widest globally, with the U.S. at 4.00% and Japan near 0.5%, creating a structural carry incentive favoring USD/JPY upside. The U.S. bond market is recovering as rate-cut bets collapse, drawing foreign capital into Treasuries for yield capture. In contrast, Japanese government bonds offer limited attractiveness, allowing outflows into higher-yielding USD assets. As long as this disparity persists, dollar demand continues to anchor USD/JPY near long-term highs, and the pair remains supported on dips, as seen in the rebound from 153.62 back to 154.60. The global risk environment further pushes investors into the USD as a defensive liquidity asset, particularly given the uncertainties create"

That gap has pushed Canadian assets out of favor, sending the loonie lower and driving usd/cad past 1.37 in early November. Trade friction with the US and jittery markets haven\u2019t helped matters either. That said, Scotiabank highlights a few silver linings\u2014fiscal support from Ottawa and easier money conditions are helping growth at home. Policymakers now say more rate cuts may not do much, and deeper trade issues aren\u2019t easily solved by monetary policy. Looking ahead, Scotiabank expects that when the Fed eventually begins to ease and Canada\u2019s central bank gets more hawkish by late 2026, the rate gap could narrow\u2014and the Canadian dollar could stage a stronger comeback.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate realignment could turn the loonie\u2019s luck.\nThe loonie\u2019s slide has been a defining currency story this year, driven by shifting policy and persistent trade uncertainty. Scotiabank now expects usd/cad to hit 1.40 by late 2025, before narrowing to 1.33 by late 2026 and 1.30 by 2027 as US and Canadian interest rates move closer together. That shift could set Canadian stocks and bonds up for a brighter outlook once currency pressures start to ease.\nThe bigger picture: Cross-border dynamics hold all the cards.\nThe Canadian dollar\u2019s fate is closely tied to decisions made in Washington as much as Ottawa, and lingering trade risks keep policymakers on edge. Even with a rosier forecast, open US\u2013Canada disputes could limit gains.

What is happening in GBP/USD right now is not drifting sentiment\u2014it is a direct and violent repricing driven by a sequence of data points that landed far weaker than expected across retail activity, labour markets, industry output and housing conditions. Retail sales slowed to 1.5%, crushing the 2.4% expectation and disappointing even the prior 2.0%, signalling consumers are retrenching. The labour market corrected aggressively as Claimant Count Change surged to 29,000, nearly double the 17,600 forecast, while unemployment pushed to 5.0% and wage growth slipped to 4.8% from 5.0%, reinforcing the pressure on households. This contraction in both spending and income momentum fed directly into GBP/USD weakness, pushing the pair below 1.3170, 1.3150, and back toward its seven-month lows near 1.3149.\nGrowth Deterioration And Industrial Collapse Deepen Downside Pressure On GBP/USD\nIndustry data intensified the bearish load on the pound. Manufacturing production collapsed \u20131.7%, more than double the \u20130.7% estimate, while industrial production fell \u20132.0% versus \u20130.5% expected, confirming a broad slowdown in real economy output. GDP readings offered no relief: monthly GDP printed \u20130.1% against a flat estimate, and preliminary quarterly GDP came in at only 0.1% instead of 0.2%. Housing sentiment reinforced the contractionary theme as the RICS House Price Balance fell to \u201319%, missing the \u201314% projection and holding only marginally better than last month\u2019s \u201317%, confirming the property market is losing confidence and liquidity. All these indicators collectively spell a deteriorating economic base\u2014one that forces GBP/USD traders to reassess whether the softening trajectory leaves the pair vulnerable to further slides toward 1.3058, 1.3012, or the deeper wave projection around 1.2831 derived from the extended corrective structure from 1.3787.\nFiscal Instability And Political Risk Amplify Sterling Volatility Across GBP/USD\nThe political layer worsened the sell-off. The UK government\u2019s decision to scrap planned income tax increases created significant unease about fiscal discipline, echoing the structural fragility seen in the 2022 mini-budget shock. With a budget deficit near \u00a330 billion, the market is now questioning how the government will stabilize finances without added revenue. This is why GBP/USD reacted instantly\u2014dropping to 1.3130, then 1.3149, and retesting 1.3150 during the Asian session. Investors immediately remembered the near-parity collapse from 2022, and the pound began to price a risk premium for policy inconsistency. The debt-to-GDP ratio hovering around 97.1% deepens investor scepticism and reduces the market\u2019s willingness to re-rate the pound higher until a credible fiscal trajectory emerges. This created the environment where every recovery attempt was sold into, preventing sustained rebounds above 1.3170\u20131.3188, the exact region capped by descending trendline resistance.\nUSD Strength And The Repricing Of Federal Reserve Expectations Reinforce GBP/USD Downside\nThe USD side of the cross turned simultaneously stronger. Markets scaled back expectations for a December Fed rate cut as officials adopted a more hawkish tone, replaying the 2024 \u201chigher for longer\u201d dynamic. Treasury yields recovered, money markets reduced rate-cut probability, and demand for USD surged across majors\u2014i"

On the upside, firm break of 204.22 will suggest that larger rally from 184.53 is ready to resume through 205.03. However, break of 202.31 minor support will turn bias to the downside towards 199.04, to extend the corrective pattern from 205.30 with another falling leg.\nIn the bigger picture, price actions from 208.09 (2024 high) are seen as a corrective pattern which might have completed at 184.35. Firm break of 208.09 high will resume the up trend from 123.94 (2020 low). Next target is 61.8% projection of 148.93 to 208.09 from 184.35 at 220.90. However, decisive break of 197.47 support will dampen this view and extend the corrective pattern with another fall.\nIn the long term picture, there is no sign that the long term up trend from 122.75 (2016 low) has concluded.

                "body": "Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment tools that let investors get a piece of the Bitcoin pie without actually buying the digital currency. Trading on conventional stock exchanges makes them easier for many investors, including big institutions. These ETFs are significant because they boost liquidity, help stabilize prices, and create a regulated arena for crypto investments. Come 2025, Bitcoin ETFs are ruling the crypto landscape, with titans like BlackRock and Fidelity at the helm.\nThe Impact of Bitcoin ETF Outflows on Market Liquidity\nBack in early November 2025, Bitcoin ETFs saw nearly half a billion dollars in outflows. This raised eyebrows about liquidity in the crypto market. Macro pressures and shifts in how institutions feel about crypto were the main culprits, triggering a risk-off attitude. As a result, Bitcoin dropped below $104,000, with Ethereum and DeFi assets also taking a hit. This situation lays bare how exposed the crypto market is to outside economic factors and how interconnected various crypto assets can be.\nHow European SMEs Can Respond to Bitcoin ETF Liquidity Issues\nFor small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe looking to dive into crypto, the liquidity issues stemming from Bitcoin ETFs come with both setbacks and openings. They need to keep several points in mind:\nThe European regulatory scene isn't as open as that of the U.S. and is far more fragmented. Directives like UCITS require diversification, limiting access to Bitcoin ETFs for retail investors. This means SMEs must navigate a complex compliance web to successfully integrate crypto into their financial plans. The volatility of Bitcoin's price can disrupt cash flow if payments or reserves are held in Bitcoin without efficient conversion methods. SMEs should have solid risk management tactics to counter these operational hazards. Despite regulatory roadblocks, regulated Bitcoin ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) are on the rise in Europe, adding liquidity and market access for SMEs. Using Bitcoin as a reserve asset can bolster the financial resilience of these companies.\nWhat Bitcoin ETF Outflows Mean for Asian Fintech Startups\nAsian fintech startups can take advantage of Bitcoin ETF outflows to refine their crypto payroll offerings. The market instability presents an opportunity to pitch their solutions as reliable and efficient. They might consider:\nIncorporating stablecoins into their payroll systems to sidestep the volatility linked with Bitcoin ETF outflows, guaranteeing employees stable pay. Using blockchain technology to lower transaction fees, speed up payments, and improve transparency, making crypto payroll more appealing to a tech-savvy workforce. Offering real-time or near real-time payment options to enhance worker liquidity and satisfaction, crucial during economic uncertainty. Staying ahead of regulatory compliance will build trust and ensure that their payroll solutions align with evolving regulations in Asia.\nAre Bitcoin ETFs Still a Smart Bet for Institutions?\nEven after the recent outflows, Bitcoin ETFs are still a sound investment for institutions in 2025. The structural benefits they provide make them the go-to option for large capital allocators. Some key takeaways include:\nBitcoin ETFs have established themselves as the primary vehicle for institutional exposure to cryptocurrencies, with big players like BlackRock controlling a huge share of the market. These ETFs offer straightforward operations and deep liquidity, eliminating many compliance hassles that often accompany direct cryptocurrency investments. Institutional money can help stabilize Bitcoin markets, absorbing liquidity shocks and lessening extreme price fluctuations, making Bitcoin a better diversification option. Institutions are advised to take a measured approach, gradually allocating a portion of their portfolios to digital assets while contemplating diversification into established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana.\nIn conclusi"

This shift is exemplified by a new crypto market structure bill put forward by Senators John Boozman and Cory Booker, which aims to place spot digital commodity trading under the CFTC\u2019s authority, moving away from the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) current enforcement-centric strategy.\nThere is also a notable rise in institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, with major entities such as Harvard University\u2019s $55 billion endowment making significant investments. The endowment recently revealed a $443 million holding in BlackRock\u2019s\nRockToken, a New Zealand-based platform specializing in infrastructure-backed crypto investment contracts, is also attracting attention from long-term investors. The company offers a range of plans\u2014from the entry-level \u201cGenesis Pass\u201d to the premium \u201cWhale Reserve\u201d contracts\u2014enabling users to earn yields on Bitcoin,\nMarket trends are pointing toward cautious optimism. The conclusion of a 43-day U.S. government shutdown in November 2025 brought temporary stability to crypto markets, with Bitcoin recovering above $102,000. Experts attribute this rebound to renewed regulatory clarity as both the SEC and CFTC resumed their activities. Blockchain data also shows that long-term investors are accumulating assets, with over $1.3 billion in Ethereum acquired by large holders, indicating sustained confidence in crypto despite short-term price swings\nThis regulatory evolution is not without its hurdles. Some critics caution that overlapping responsibilities between the SEC and CFTC could lead to regulatory confusion, though advocates believe the proposed legislation will create a more streamlined oversight process. Bernstein analysts, however, maintain that the U.S. is well-placed to emerge as a global leader in crypto, citing its robust infrastructure and flexible regulatory approach. Together with increased institutional involvement and DeFi advancements, these factors could reshape the role of crypto in the international financial system"

To make transactions sending digital dollars or to swap tokens on a decentralized crypto exchange, users need to pay gas fees in ETH.\nIt is because of the Ethereum network's use cases that, despite the approval of exchange-traded funds now trading on traditional stock exchanges, ETH still works less like a store-of-value asset compared to BTC\u2014and that the coins are less dormant.\nStill, ETH still can have store-of-value use cases, Glassnode noted, explaining that \"one out of every four ETH is locked in native staking and ETFs.\"\nEthereum's price recently stood at nearly $3,208, down 4.5% over the past week. The coin was slow in reaching an all-time high but finally did so in August, breaking a nearly four-year-old record. It has traded well below that level\u2014$4,946\u2014in recent weeks.\nBitcoin was recently trading at $95,992, falling by nearly 6% over the past seven days.

                "body": "Ethereum investors are offloading their tokens at a pace that is triple that of\nBitcoin\nholders,\nas highlighted in a recent study\n. This contrast highlights Ethereum's transformation into a utility-focused asset, setting it apart from Bitcoin\u2019s reputation as a digital store of value. The analysis notes that those holding Ethereum for the long term tend to move their assets more often, influenced by its use in decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and staking mechanisms.\nThe statistics show that a quarter of all Ethereum is tied up in staking or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), yet the overall activity among long-term ETH holders is still much greater than that of Bitcoin holders. This trend illustrates Ethereum\u2019s dual identity: it serves both as a reserve for institutions and as an active currency for on-chain operations. In comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s pattern is more similar to gold,\nwith more than 61% of its coins remaining untouched for over a year\nand a daily movement rate of only 0.61%.\nThe pace at which Ethereum is being utilized is picking up as more institutions get involved.\nFirms such as\nBit Digital\nand BitMine are rapidly building up their ETH reserves, with\nBit Digital announcing a fivefold jump\nin its Ethereum holdings, reaching 153,000 ETH in the third quarter of 2025. Samir Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital, pointed out that staking profits\u2014which totaled $2.9 million in Q3\u2014are set to become the company\u2019s main revenue stream as it shifts away from mining Bitcoin. Likewise, BitMine, which owns more than 3.5 million ETH valued at $11 billion,\nhas shifted its brand to concentrate on Ethereum treasury management\n.\nGlassnode\u2019s research also reveals fundamental shifts in the market. The amount of both Bitcoin and\nEthereum\nheld on exchanges is dropping as more assets move into ETFs and institutional investment vehicles. For Ethereum, this has resulted in a \u201cproductive float,\u201d with 16% of its supply engaged in liquid staking and collateral-backed systems,\nfueling DeFi platforms\n. On the other hand, Bitcoin\u2019s slow-moving nature strengthens its role as a savings vehicle, with more of its supply being locked away for the long term.\nThese developments have major market consequences. Ethereum\u2019s high transaction activity underpins its importance in blockchain-based applications, while Bitcoin\u2019s relative inactivity reinforces its use as a safeguard against economic instability.\nExperts observe\nthat investors should distinguish between the two: Bitcoin is best for preserving capital, whereas Ethereum offers access to a rapidly expanding suite of financial products.\nYet, Ethereum\u2019s increased turnover also brings certain risks. Some analysts, including 10x Research,\ncaution that its high activity could point to underlying vulnerabilities\nwhen compared to Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in institutional portfolios. Even so, the growth of Ethereum staking and ETF products indicates that demand for its practical uses is likely to continue, even if the broader market experiences turbulence.\nTo sum up, the active behavior of Ethereum holders highlights its unique position as both a value reserve and a functional asset. As the cryptocurrency sector evolves, recognizing these differing paths will be essential for investors aiming to balance the stability of Bitcoin with the innovative potential of Ethereum."

The total crypto market cap fell 6.1% during a volatile October, which also saw BTC\u2019s market cap drop 4%, ADA\u2019s value decrease by 24%, and SOL shed 12.7%.\nBinance Research has released a report discussing the monthly developments in the crypto market in October. The report stated that October was a volatile month across crypto markets, with major assets experiencing sharp corrections or selective resilience.\nIt also implied that the downturn in \u201cRed October\u201d was partly due to the October 10 event, which wiped out over $19 billion in positions. Broader macroeconomic factors also weighed on sentiment.\nHowever, Binance Research observed that despite the correction, the Binance token\u2019s October rally was fueled by strong ecosystem growth. The launch of Polymarket and Myriad prediction markets, along with the rollout of Ondo Finance\u2019s tokenized stocks and ETFs on BNB Chain, supported this growth.\nBNB Chain leads DeFi growth\nDespite the October downturn, BNB Chain led the growth of DeFi ecosystems, followed by Solana and Arbitrum. However, Ethereum and Tron posted slight drops. DeFi TVL (total value locked) also plummeted 4.85% MoM, as DeFi liquidity pulled out on market corrections.\nMeanwhile, stablecoin activity surged as investors sought safety. The total stablecoin market cap rose 3.54% as USDT continued to increase its lead over USDC.\nIn October, JPYC (pegged on Japanese Yen) and EUROD (backed by the Euro) were introduced to the BNB Chain. The two expanded the range of stablecoins tied to major currencies beyond the U.S. dollar, enhancing the efficiency of cross-border payment. Binance Research observed that BNB Chain transactions spiked 135%.\nMeanwhile, the spike was driven primarily by a memecoin frenzy that boosted token prices and attracted new traders. The memecoin excitement peaked in early October with over 100,000 new traders jumping into memecoins in a single day (October 7).\nNearly 70% of these newcomers ended up in profit, according to the report. Approximately 40 individuals earned over $1 million, and another 6,000 received $10,000 or more in compensation. However, many of these memecoins crashed by October 8 and 9.\nBinance token breaks $1,300\nThe report stated that activity on the BNB Chain not only boosted transactions but also propelled the Binance token to surpass $1,300 on October 13. Binance Research observed that even with the pullback, BNB remained up 6.6% for the month, providing the chain\u2019s resilience.\nThe rally also appears to have been fueled by rumors that Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was returning to the company. CZ previously explained that political, technical, and regulatory factors have fueled BNB\u2019s rally.\nAccording to CZ, political shifts have previously supported the rise in BNB prices. He emphasized that the new U.S. administration has created a favorable environment for crypto. The Binance token price also jumped due to rising hopes that President Donald Trump would grant CZ a full pardon.\nMeanwhile, MEXC presented a report detailing the expected prices of BNB under different scenarios. In the bull scenario, BNB is expected to test the prior resistance of $1,300-$1,400 in the short term (Oct-Nov).\nFor the medium term (Q4 2025), BNB prices are expected to range between $1,500 and $1,800 if the macro environment remains supportive. In the long term (by 2026), the price is expected to reach $2,292.\nIn the base case scenario, assuming normal volatility and corrections, BNB prices in the short term are expected to remain consolidated between $1,000 and $1,250. For the medium term, a gradual climb toward $1,500 is expected by the end of 2025. However, BNB is expected to maintain a conservative average price of $1,090 in the long term.\nIf you're reading this, you\u2019re already ah"

This divergence\u2014ETF inflows rising while price collapses\u2014reveals a market undergoing structural stress, driven by weakening liquidity, fading momentum, and a decisive loss of multi-year bullish structures that held since January 2023. The price deterioration is now interacting with the heaviest technical zones Solana has faced this year, and every layer of data\u2014from RSI collapse to UTXO clustering to ETF flow deceleration\u2014confirms that the token is entering a transitional phase where bulls must defend a shrinking list of remaining supports.\nInstitutional ETF Inflows Into SOL-USD Continue, But Their Momentum Is Deteriorating Faster Than Price Action\nThe 13 consecutive days of inflows\u2014with Thursday adding $1.49M\u2014show institutional buyers are still allocating to SOL, yet a deeper look reveals weakening conviction. Of every ETF, only the Bitwise BSOL product attracted inflows in the latest session, marking the softest day since ETFs launched on Oct 28. Total cumulative inflows of $370M sound strong, but the trend is sharply decelerating exactly as Solana breaks key supports. The timing is crucial: Bitcoin spot ETFs saw $866M in outflows\u2014the second-worst day since launch\u2014while Ether ETFs lost $259.2M, dragging cumulative ETH inflows to $13.3B. Institutions are rotating out of higher-beta crypto, and even though SOL inflows remain positive, the softness tells us Solana is no longer benefiting from the aggressive accumulation phase that defined Q3\u2013early Q4. This shift is material because ETF inflows were previously a stabilizing force; now they lag price deterioration instead of offsetting it, leaving SOL more vulnerable to technical breakdowns.\nSOL-USD Breaks Its Multi-Year Uptrend And Slips Below the 100-Week SMA, Triggering a Structural Bearish Signal for the First Time Since 2023\nSOL\u2019s collapse from $175 \u2192 $142 snapped the multi-year trendline established at the start of January 2023, and breaking below the 100-week SMA confirms a structural trend failure. This is not noise\u2014multi-year trend breaks signal regime changes. At $142, Solana sliced through every intermediate support between $150 \u2192 $140, leaving the next meaningful zones at $126, then the macro line at $100, which aligns with the 200-week SMA\u2014the final anchor that preserves long-term bullish structure. The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) from Glassnode shows a clear liquidity vacuum below $140, meaning few historical buyers exist to defend this range. That gap amplifies the risk of a cascading sell-off should $140 lose cleanly. With RSI collapsing to its lowest reading since April 2025, the breakdown has momentum behind it, not exhaustion.\nETF Demand Meets Technical Failure: SOL-USD\u2019s 34% Two-Week Collapse Highlights an Extreme Divergence Between Fundamentals and Price\nFor the first time this year, Solana\u2019s rising institutional interest and its collapsing spot price are moving in opposite directions. ETF buyers are still accumulating, but they are no longer absorbing sell-side pressure. Solana fell 34% in 14 days, even though inflows continued every single day\u2014something that did not happen during the June, March, or January corrections.

The token struggles to defend key support levels, and every rebound attempt results in violent rejection. Trading volumes also show traders\u2019 growing disinterest, who now prefer to position themselves in assets deemed more resilient.\nThe 2-week Order Block is even more revealing. Massive smart money distribution could push Solana\u2019s price down to $40 in the coming months.\nStructural Flaws Weakening the Ecosystem for Solana\nBeyond simple price action, Solana faces recurring structural problems. Network outages remain a major pain point. Despite promises of improvement, the blockchain has experienced several complete shutdowns in recent months, undermining the credibility of an infrastructure that claims to be ultra-performant.\nValidator concentration also raises questions. Unlike Ethereum or Bitcoin, the Solana network suffers from excessive centralization, with a handful of actors controlling a disproportionate share of staking. This architecture makes the network more vulnerable to coordinated attacks and manipulation.\nDespite everything, on-chain data, such as TVL and stablecoins, continue to grow. Moreover, Solana ETFs have outperformed those of ETH and BTC in recent weeks. Even though the medium term seems blocked by massive profit-taking, Solana remains a giant of tomorrow.\nCompetitive Environment: More Credible Alternatives\nFacing these difficulties, other blockchains are capitalizing on Solana\u2019s weaknesses. Avalanche, Polygon and Base are now attracting developers seeking stability and decentralization. These networks offer more balanced compromises between scalability and security, without sacrificing availability.\nThe layer 1 market is ruthless. Institutional investors, increasingly present, favor proven infrastructure. Ethereum remains the undisputed reference for institutional DeFi, while new generations like Sui or Aptos chip away at market share with innovative technical propositions. Solana finds itself stuck in an uncomfortable middle ground.\nThe question of long-term viability will always arise. But the correction will have more to do with a tenseanduncertain context rather than a loss of fundamentals.\nCharles Ledoux is a Bitcoin and blockchain technology specialist.

                "body": "The DeFi sector is experiencing significant changes as Solana-based projects such as Pump.fun emerge as influential forces for the 2025\u20132030 cryptocurrency era. With increased token repurchases, heightened network engagement, and strategic rivalry transforming the landscape, market experts are reassessing the future price outlook for Solana\u2019s core tokens.\nPump.fun, a prominent DeFi application on\nSolana\n, has\nrapidly advanced its standing\nby implementing assertive token buyback initiatives. Since July 15, 2025, the platform has reacquired $173.7 million in PUMP tokens, cutting the available supply by 10.928%.\nThis approach, together with Solana\u2019s soaring decentralized exchange (DEX) transaction volumes\u2014reaching $5.11 billion in daily trades\u2014has\nreinforced Pump.fun\u2019s significance within the network\n. The buyback activity aligns with a broader movement of capital retention in Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, as participants increasingly favor yield opportunities over simply holding stablecoins\nbased on recent market insights\n.\nAt the same time, Solana\u2019s influence in DeFi continues to grow. By November 2025, the platform\u2019s DEX trading volumes surpassed those of\nEthereum\n($3.8 billion) and\nBNB\nChain ($2.95 billion),\nindicating a preference for faster blockchain solutions\n. This\nupward trend\nis fueled by Solana\u2019s development activity score of 21.5, outpacing Ethereum\u2019s 14.3, and a three-day increase of 2.9 million SOL staked,\ntemporarily limiting the supply on exchanges\n. Experts point out that institutional investments and broader economic factors will likely influence whether Solana\u2019s value can surpass the $180 barrier, which currently has a\n29% likelihood, compared to a 62% chance of retreating\nto the $150 support level.\nAlthough Ethereum still holds 67.65% of the total value locked in DeFi, it is facing increasing competition from Solana and\nTron\n.\nTron\u2019s 25.78% portion of stablecoin issuance\n\u2014a vital area within DeFi\u2014has narrowed Ethereum\u2019s previous 55.55% dominance, emphasizing the value of affordable and efficient networks. While Solana\u2019s 8.9% share is much smaller than Ethereum\u2019s, it demonstrates a rising demand for scalability, especially among individual users and developers. \u201cThe rivalry is pushing Ethereum to evolve,\u201d a blockchain analyst commented, \u201cbut Solana\u2019s expanding developer community and active address numbers indicate it\u2019s becoming a permanent fixture.\u201d\nWider market developments add further layers.\nFlutter Entertainment is making moves\ninto prediction markets, launching FanDuel Predicts in December 2025 to offer contracts on sports and financial outcomes. This initiative brings fresh liquidity to platforms with DeFi-like features, potentially broadening capital movement. Likewise,\nPollard Banknote\u2019s third-quarter revenue increase\n\u2014driven by lottery deals in California and Belgium\u2014shows how traditional gaming is adapting to digital trends, though it remains separate from crypto-native platforms.\nPump.fun\u2019s future depends on maintaining scarcity through ongoing buybacks while capitalizing on Solana\u2019s technology. With growing institutional interest in Solana and technical signals pointing to short-term price swings, investors are divided between caution and optimism. \u201cThe main challenge will be whether Pump.fun can retain its users amid broader economic uncertainties,\u201d a crypto strategist observed.\nAs 2025 progresses, the interaction between token economics, network efficiency, and regulatory changes will shape Pump.fun\u2019s future. For now, Solana\u2019s DeFi sector is poised for a defining moment."

                "body": "2025 has proved another strong year for UK shares. The FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 have risen 19% and 7% respectively. And yet these indexes remain packed with great-value income stocks as we look towards 2026.\nThe following dividend stocks carry enormous dividend yields at today\u2019s prices. But that\u2019s not all, as they also look cheap based on expected earnings.\nHere\u2019s why I think they demand serious attention right now.\nHSBC\nThe HSBC (LSE:HSBA) share price has risen 43% in the year to date. And yet, at \u00a311.18, its dividend yield remains at a robust 4.8%, beating the broader FTSE average of 3.1%.\nOn top of this, predicted dividend growth over the medium term pushes the yield to 5.4% in 2026 and 5.7% in 2027.\nThese robust dividend projections are underpinned by HSBC\u2019s Solvency II capital ratio of 14.5%. This is the strongest across the UK banking sector, and at the top end of the bank\u2019s 14% to 14.5% range.\nThe bank\u2019s Asian focus leaves it exposed to China\u2019s spluttering economy and wider regional issues caused by trade tariffs. So that robust balance sheet helps to at least safeguard HSBC\u2019s progressive dividend policy.\nThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019m expecting a crisis to come along, mind. Indeed, HSBC\u2019s decision to upgrade full-year profit forecasts in late October underlines its reslience to tough conditions. Net interest income is tipped at $43bn, a target Hargreaves Lansdown analysts describe as \u201ca little conservative and\u2026 an easy hurdle to clear\u201c.\nI believe HSBC is in great shape to deliver robust earnings and dividend growth over time as wealth levels in emerging markets boom. Yet, I don\u2019t think this is reflected in the bank\u2019s current valuation. It trades on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.2 times.\nAviva\nAviva\u2018s (LSE:AV.) share price has also enjoyed similarly impressive gains in 2025. At 655.4p, it\u2019s risen 38% in value, driven by signs of impressive resilience in difficult conditions. Just on Thursday (13 November), it projected it would reach \u00a32.2bn of operating profit in 2025, a full year ahead of target.\nYet, despite its price gains, investors can still get excellent value for money from the insurance giant. Its dividend yield for 2025 is 5.9%. This rises to 6.3% for next year and 6.8% for 2027.\nLike HSBC shares, Aviva shares also look cheap based on expected earnings. A prospective P/E of 12.5 doesn\u2019t look much to shout about. However, its corresponding price-to-earnings growth (PEG) multiple of 0.5 does.\nAny reading below one implies that a share is undervalued.\nAs with HSBC, dividend forecasts are given strength by Aviva\u2019s impressive financial foundations. Its Solvency ratio was down in the year to September, but remained at a rock-solid 177%. This matters for a company that earns most of profits from the UK, where growth and inflationary pressures are growing."

                "body": "The electric vehicle revolution has brought remarkable advancements in battery technology and energy efficiency, yet one persistent challenge continues to perplex potential EV buyers: the gap between advertised EPA range estimates and real-world driving performance.\nWhile the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s standardized testing provides a benchmark for comparing vehicles, laboratory conditions rarely mirror the complexities of actual highway driving, varied weather conditions, and diverse driving styles that EV owners experience daily.\nRange is considered one of the most important factors when it comes to all-electric cars, and unfortunately, many shoppers have discovered that their new EV falls significantly short of its official ratings when put through real-world testing scenarios.\nThis disconnect has fueled range anxiety and skepticism about electric vehicle adoption, particularly among those considering their first EV purchase.\nHowever, not all electric vehicles suffer from optimistic range claims. Some manufacturers have engineered their EVs to not only meet but occasionally exceed EPA estimates in independent real-world testing.\nThese vehicles represent the gold standard in honest range ratings, offering buyers realistic expectations and genuine confidence for long-distance travel.\nEach has demonstrated the ability to deliver on its EPA promises under varying conditions, from highway cruising to mixed city-suburban driving.\nWhether you\u2019re a daily commuter seeking reliable transportation or an adventure enthusiast planning cross-country road trips, these seven electric vehicles prove that range anxiety doesn\u2019t have to define the EV ownership experience.\n1. Mercedes-Benz EQS 450+ SUV\nThe Mercedes-Benz EQS 450+ SUV stands as a testament to German engineering excellence in the electric vehicle segment, particularly when it comes to delivering on range promises.\nThis luxury electric SUV doesn\u2019t just meet expectations it consistently exceeds them in real-world testing, making it one of the most reliable range performers in the entire EV market.\nOn the Edmunds EV Range Test, the EQS 450+ achieved 407 miles, which is a 20.1% improvement over its 339-mile EPA range estimate.\nThis exceptional performance places it among the elite EVs that actually surpass their official ratings, a rare achievement that speaks volumes about Mercedes\u2019 conservative approach to range claims and the vehicle\u2019s exceptional efficiency engineering.\nThe secret to the EQS SUV\u2019s impressive real-world performance lies in several key factors. The 2024 model received a larger battery with a maximum capacity of 118 kWh, compared to the 2023 model\u2019s 108.4-kWh pack, providing more energy storage without compromising the vehicle\u2019s already impressive efficiency.\nThe aerodynamic design, despite being an SUV form factor, helps minimize energy consumption at highway speeds where many EVs struggle to maintain their EPA estimates.\nBeyond just range capability, the EQS 450+ delivers exceptional energy efficiency. The EPA expected it to use 39 kWh per 100 miles, but testing showed 32.7 kWh per 100 miles a significant improvement that translates to lower charging costs and fewer stops on long journeys.\nThis efficiency advantage means owners can maximize their charging sessions and spend less time tethered to charging stations. The interior of the EQS SUV embodies Mercedes\u2019 commitment to luxury, featuring the brand\u2019s signature MBUX Hyperscreen that spans nearly the entire dashboard width, creating an immersive digital experience.\nThe cabin is whisper-quiet, with exceptional sound insulation that makes highway cruising remarkably serene. Premium materials throughout the interior, spacious seating for up to seven passengers (in certain configurations), and advanced climate control systems ensure that maximizing range doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing comfort.\nThe EQS 450+ SUV ranks fourth place on Edmunds\u2019 EV Range Test leaderboard, right behind its sedan counterpart, making it the l"

                "body": "The total return for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last three years\nGenerally speaking, investors are inspired to be stock pickers by the potential to find the big winners. But when you hold the right stock for the right time period, the rewards can be truly huge. One such superstar is Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), which saw its share price soar 328% in three years. On top of that, the share price is up 110% in about a quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.\nIn light of the stock dropping 3.1% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive three-year return.\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring three years of share price growth, Western Digital achieved compound earnings per share growth of 37% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 62% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nWe know that Western Digital has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Western Digital's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.\nWhat About Dividends?\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Western Digital the TSR over the last 3 years was 468%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nA Different Perspective\nIt's good to see that Western Digital has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 234% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 38% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Western Digital better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for Western Digital that you should be aware of."

Nvidia\u2019s 1.8% rise was fueled by Morgan Stanley\u2019s upbeat forecast ahead of next week\u2019s earnings, highlighting strong demand and new Blackwell chips. Microsoft added 1.4% after launching its \u2018OpenAI for Ireland\u2019 initiative to back local tech startups. Micron Technology stood out too, jumping 4.2% as analysts spotlighted tighter memory chip supply and strong profit prospects. While technology and energy led the charge, materials, communication, and financial firms dragged on the S&P 500, pushing the Dow down 0.7%. Plus, with Treasury yields rising after Fed officials poured cold water on more rate cuts, S&P 500 earnings forecasts\u2014anchored by tech\u2014are now at all-time highs.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Tech stocks keep driving the market.\nTechnology companies are setting the pace, with Nasdaq edging up 0.1% as investors jump in on upbeat earnings outlooks for firms like Nvidia and Micron. Meanwhile, hopes for near-term rate cuts are fading, with December\u2019s odds down to 46% according to CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool. That could put more pressure on sectors that are less resilient if economic growth does slow.\nThe bigger picture: Earnings strength shapes market momentum.\nRecord-high forward earnings estimates for the S&P 500 are being driven mostly by tech leaders. Even as gold and silver take a back seat and oil edges up, the market is moving toward areas with real profit power. With Fed officials taking a cautious tone and inflation still a factor, investors are likely to keep favoring companies with dependable results\u2014especially in tech\u2014despite an uncertain policy backdrop.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

A spokesperson for the Israeli military branch overseeing the operation told FRANCE 24 that the \u201cthird country\u201d was in fact South Africa.\nTo display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.\nOne of your browser extensions seems to be blocking the video player from loading.

                "body": "Russell Brand had found his people, that much was clear. Last Saturday, in front of 800 fans in a hotel ballroom in Austin, the comedian doled out praise for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (whom he called \u201cGreat Brother Kennedy\u201d), disdain for the medical establishment (\u201cflat-out evil\u201d), and gratitude for Jesus Christ (\u201cThank God we have a forgiving God that died for us\u201d). He also told a bunch of dick jokes and, later, called me a Nazi.\nAfter the show, I\u2019d asked Brand for an interview, and he told me that the media are \u201cLuciferian,\u201d and that reporters are Nazis. \u201cDo you really think that?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re more like an individual Nazi,\u201d he said, seemingly a concession that I was just following orders. (I didn\u2019t get the interview.)\nBrand and his fans had gathered for the annual conference of Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit founded in 2018 by the current secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy wasn\u2019t there, but the movement\u2019s other headliners were. Brand\u2014who is awaiting trial for rape and sexual assault in the U.K. and has pleaded not guilty\u2014was onstage with Kennedy\u2019s wife, Cheryl Hines, to promote her memoir. Her publisher, Tony Lyons, was there in his role as president of MAHA Action, a nonprofit that holds weekly Zoom calls to galvanize support for Kennedy\u2019s agenda. Also on the scene were Andrew Wakefield, who\u2019s infamous for his discredited 1998 Lancet study on the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism, along with newer adherents such as Bret Weinstein, the evolutionary biologist, COVID-vaccine critic, and podcast host.\nEveryone I spoke with at the conference shared a distrust of vaccines and a sense that, after they\u2019d spent years on the fringes of scientific discourse, Kennedy\u2019s rise to power had given them the legitimacy they once lacked. (The theme of the event was \u201cMoment of Truth.\u201d) As Polly Tommey, the program director of the organization\u2019s video-and-audio operation, told the audience: \u201cWe never thought Bobby would be health secretary\u2014I mean, come on! We\u2019re in the best place we\u2019ve been for ages!\u201d But what should have been a victory lap at times felt like an attempt to rally the troops, or at least reassure them.\nKennedy\u2019s tenure has been turbulent. In less than a year, he\u2019s sent mixed signals about the benefits of vaccination during a measles outbreak, fired all of the CDC\u2019s outside vaccine advisers and replaced them with his allies, axed the director of the CDC just weeks after she took the job, and stoked fears about prenatal Tylenol use as a cause of autism despite recent conflicting evidence. A string of top CDC officials, including the chief science officer, has resigned, and those who remain say morale has never been lower.\nBut the Kennedy faithful don\u2019t care about the health secretary flouting institutional norms or sidelining subject-matter experts, because they view HHS, and the CDC in particular, as either useless or corrupt. In fact, some at the conference worried that Kennedy is not acting with enough urgency. (In an email, the HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote that Kennedy \u201cremains committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to accurate, evidence-based information about vaccines.\u201d)\nThey want Kennedy to investigate their belief that the government supposedly colluded with Big Pharma to hide the harms of vaccination. In a session on Saturday afternoon, former Republican Representative Dave Weldon, whose nomination to become CDC director was withdrawn in March amid outcry over his criticism of immunizations, called for the creation of an independent body to investigate vaccine-safety data and report only to Kennedy and President Donald Trump. \u201cIf it\u2019s in the hands of the CDC, you\u2019ll never get the answers you need,\u201d he told the crowd. During a session titled \u201cThe Enduring Nightmare of COVID mRNA Technology,\u201d Sherri Tenpenny, a veteran anti-vaccine activist who once said that one goal of COVID vaccination was to turn people into \u201ctranshumanist cyborgs,\u201d called for the mRNA"

Eyes are now on key US data releases, like September\u2019s jobs report, which could sway expectations for future interest rate moves. But not all uncertainty is gone \u2013 the White House has warned some economic data might be withheld permanently, leaving investors in a potential information gap. On the domestic front, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda are doubling down on supporting moderate inflation and wage growth, especially with producer prices rising 0.4% in October and 2.7% from a year ago, driven by higher costs for farm goods and metals.

Still, direction will depend on how upcoming US economic data shapes rate expectations, and whether policy signals stay steady. Robust earnings, like Sumitomo Rubber\u2019s profit surge, are pulling in investor attention, while buyout moves by firms like Star Micronics add an extra jolt of volatility. For now, the mood is upbeat but ready to adjust as new data or policy shifts emerge.\nThe bigger picture: Japan is walking a tightrope between inflation and growth.\nProducer prices on the rise mean inflation concerns aren\u2019t going away, so policymakers in Tokyo are sticking with low rates and pushing for wage increases to keep growth on track. At the same time, healthy dealmaking and strong profits in industries from manufacturing to rubber hint at underlying corporate strength.
