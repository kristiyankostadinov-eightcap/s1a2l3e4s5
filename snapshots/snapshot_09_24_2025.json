                "body": "The global financial markets are witnessing a significant surge in gold and silver prices, driven by a weakening US Dollar and the ongoing prospect of declining US interest rates. This dynamic, which has seen gold reach record highs and silver hit a 14-year peak in 2025, underscores the enduring inverse relationship between the greenback's strength and the value of these dollar-denominated precious metals. For international buyers, a softer dollar translates into more affordable gold and silver, fueling demand and reshaping investment strategies worldwide.\nThe Dollar's Dip: What Happened and Why It Matters\nThe recent rally in gold and silver is a direct consequence of the US Dollar's depreciation against other major currencies. Gold and silver, universally priced in US Dollars, become inherently cheaper for buyers holding Euros, Yen, or other non-dollar currencies when the dollar weakens. This increased purchasing power for international investors significantly boosts demand, pushing up the dollar price of these precious commodities. The catalyst for this dollar weakness largely stems from the Federal Reserve's dovish stance, with market expectations firmly set on further cuts to US interest rates.\nWhen US interest rates fall, dollar-denominated assets such as Treasury bonds offer lower yields, diminishing their attractiveness to foreign capital. This outflow or reduced inflow of investment demand for dollar assets contributes to the currency's depreciation. Furthermore, lower interest rates reduce the \"opportunity cost\" of holding non-yielding assets like gold and silver. In an environment where traditional interest-bearing investments offer meager returns, the appeal of precious metals as a store of value and an inflation hedge grows substantially, drawing in more capital and reinforcing their price appreciation. This confluence of factors creates a powerful updraft for gold and silver, reaffirming their role as critical components of a diversified portfolio, especially during periods of monetary easing.\nHow a Weak Dollar Might Affect the Market\nThe current market dynamics present a clear delineation of winners and losers within the precious metals industry and broader financial landscape. Mining companies stand to gain significantly from sustained high gold and silver prices. Companies like Barrick Gold (NYSE: GOLD), Newmont (NYSE: NEM), and Pan American Silver (NASDAQ: PAAS) will see their revenues per ounce sold increase, directly boosting their profit margins, particularly if their operational costs remain stable or rise at a slower pace. A weaker dollar also benefits miners with substantial international operations, as their foreign currency-denominated costs become relatively cheaper when converted back to a depreciated dollar. This increased profitability can enable greater investment in exploration, development of new projects, and potentially higher shareholder returns.\nConversely, a strengthening dollar and subsequent decline in precious metal prices would exert downward pressure on these companies' profitability, making new projects less viable and potentially leading to a contraction in the sector. Refiners and fabricators, such as Valcambi and Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT), also experience a boost. While their business often relies on processing fees, rising precious metal prices increase the value of their inventory and the overall market activity, leading to greater demand for their services and potentially higher revenues. Investors might also gravitate towards precious metals ETFs and related financial instruments, seeing them as a safer harbor against dollar devaluation and inflation.\nBeyond the direct players, the broader market implications are noteworthy. A weaker dollar can make US exports more competitive, potentially benefiting American manufacturing and export-oriented sectors. However, it also makes imports more expensive, which could contribute to inflationary pressures. For international investors, "

This development has contributed to a growing perception in the market regarding tightening supplies.\nBrent futures rose by 17 cents to $67.80 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures increased by 19 cents to $63.60. Both benchmarks surged by more than $1 a barrel on Tuesday, as a deal to resume exports from Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan faced setbacks. This situation has halted pipeline shipments of oil from the region to Turkey, despite optimism surrounding a potential resolution to the deadlock, particularly as two key producers requested guarantees for debt repayment.\nPipeline flows on hold\nThe agreement involving Iraq\u2019s federal and Kurdish regional governments, along with oil companies, aims to restart exports of approximately 230,000 barrels per day of oil. Notably, pipeline flows have been suspended since March 2023.\nLater in the day, figures released by the American Petroleum Institute revealed that U.S. crude and gasoline stocks experienced a decline, while distillate stocks showed an increase last week, as reported by market sources referencing the API data. The data indicated that crude stocks decreased by 3.82 million barrels in the week ending September 19. Furthermore, gasoline inventories dropped by 1.05 million barrels, while distillate inventories rose by 518,000 barrels.\nOfficial U.S. government energy data is scheduled for release on Wednesday, with expectations of an increase in both crude oil and gasoline stockpiles, alongside a likely decline in distillates.\nRead more: Crude oil prices dip to $66.21 as concerns over oversupply grow\nOPEC+ production adjustments\nGlobally, OPEC+ has been adjusting production cautiously amid a mixed outlook. After a series of output increases in recent months, including a collective raise by over half a million barrels per day in September, OPEC+ members continue balancing rising supply with evolving demand conditions. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait have notably contributed to increased output as the oil market navigates a fragile equilibrium between oversupply risks and geopolitical uncertainties such as EU sanctions on Russian oil and Middle East tensions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects growing global oil supply this year, potentially resulting in surpluses extending into 2026, which tempers expectations for price rallies despite current supply interruptions.\nPrice forecasts indicate decline\nMoreover, price forecasts suggest a possible downward adjustment in Brent crude prices in the coming months, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicting Brent could drop to around $59 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 2025 and potentially near $50 by early 2026, influenced by anticipated inventory builds and OPEC+ production increases. However, short-term volatility remains high due to geopolitical risks and supply chain uncertainties, including prospective new EU sanctions on Russian exports and disruptions in key producing regions."

The country has increased oil exports under the OPEC+ agreement, according to state oil marketing organisation SOMO, as reported by Reuters. It expects September's exports to range from 3.4-3.45 mn bpd, up from around 3.38mn bpd in August.\nBaghdad is also reported to have come to a preliminary agreement with the Kurdistan region to resume pipeline oil exports from the Kurdistan region through Turkey, amounting to around 230,000 bpd, after a two-year hiatus.\n\u201cThis shift comes as part of Iraq\u2019s broader effort to boost production after a relaxation of some commitments under the OPEC+ agreement and to strengthen the country\u2019s financial revenue,\u201d comments Yakout.\n\u201cHowever, despite the clear benefits of this move in terms of revenue generation and improved financial liquidity, multiple risks loom over the global oil market as the end of 2025 approaches. First, there's the risk of oversupply, especially if the Kurdistan pipeline returns to full capacity without alignment with global demand, which is expected to remain relatively weak due to global economic conditions and the accelerating shift toward renewable energy and electric vehicles.\n\u201cSecond, there are logistical, legal, and political risks related to the ongoing dispute between Baghdad and Erbil over export contracts, revenue sharing, or obligations to foreign companies. Any delays or sudden stoppages could disrupt pipeline flows and undermine investor and market confidence.\n\u201cThird, price volatility remains a major concern. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East or the imposition of sanctions on supplies from countries like Russia could trigger sharp market swings, especially if news is conflicting or if the implementation of agreements faces obstacles.\u201d\nYakout concludes that the oil landscape for Q4 2025 looks highly volatile.\n\u201cWhile the increase in exports offers an opportunity to bolster Iraq\u2019s financial position and improve revenues, the success of this strategy depends on legal and political stability, infrastructure reliability, alignment with global supply and demand, and effective risk management. If these factors are handled properly, Iraq stands to gain significantly, but if markets are caught off guard by any serious disruptions, prices could fall, and market tensions may rise.\u201d"

The pair trades with modest gains of 0.09%.\nDollar stays pressured by risk appetite; Fed-ECB policy divergence underpins Euro\nRisk appetite keeps the Dollar pressured, yet the Euro failed to capitalize on its weakness. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell crossed the newswires and nearly repeated what did he said at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference.\nHe said that the policy path is difficult as the central bank must look at both goals of the dual mandate \u201cequally.\u201d He reiterated the downside risks in the labor market hhad risen, though that inflation remains \u201csomewhat elevated,\u201d despite coming into better balance.

In the US, traders await for housing data and Fed speakers.\nDaily market movers: Euro consolidate despite US, EZ economic slowdown\n- Earlier, US S&P Global Manufacturing PMI dipped in September to 52.0 from 53.0 reported in the previous print. Meanwhile, the Services PMI fell to 53.9 from 54.5 in August. S&P Global revealed that prices paid rose to 62.6 in September, up from 60.8 last month as business mentioned tariffs \u201cas the principal cause of further cost increases.\u201d\n- Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned that \u201cdownside risks to employment shifted balance of risks, prompting to last week\u2019s rate cut,\u201d and that the rate cut moved policy to a more neutral stance.

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) sits at 97.39, slipping from Monday\u2019s high of 97.78 after dovish commentary from Fed officials, while expectations for Powell\u2019s upcoming remarks on Tuesday dominate sentiment. Futures markets are pricing a 90% probability of a 25 bp cut in October and nearly an 80% chance of another cut in December, keeping pressure on the greenback despite mixed internal Fed views.\nDivergent Fed Signals Keep Dollar Volatile\nFederal Reserve officials have split sharply, leaving markets without a clear anchor. Atlanta Fed\u2019s Raphael Bostic and Cleveland Fed\u2019s Beth Hammack warned against rushing into more easing, citing sticky inflation risks. St. Louis Fed\u2019s Alberto Musalem backed last week\u2019s cut as a labor market safeguard but stressed \u201climited room\u201d for more reductions. By contrast, Governor Stephen Miran pushed for an immediate 50 bp cut, calling current policy excessively restrictive with the neutral rate closer to 2%. This policy divide leaves the dollar exposed to each new data point, reinforcing volatility in EUR/USD.\nEurozone PMI Data Highlights Manufacturing Strain\nFresh Eurozone PMI readings underscore an uneven recovery. The manufacturing index fell deeper into contraction at 45.9, while services provided some relief at 50.5, keeping the composite index just above 48. Germany\u2019s data showed similar divergence, while French PMIs contracted across both sectors, raising concerns about Europe\u2019s second-largest economy. Despite this, Eurozone consumer confidence improved to -14.9 in September, beating August\u2019s -15.5, hinting that sentiment may be stabilizing. For EUR/USD, the resilience in services helps prevent a sharper breakdown below 1.1775, but structural headwinds remain.\nU.S. Data and Treasury Yields in Focus\nThe U.S. side offers a mixed picture. PMI readings are due Tuesday and could tilt market expectations quickly. Consensus forecasts U.S. GDP growth at 3.3% annualized for Thursday\u2019s release, while Friday\u2019s core PCE inflation is expected to hold at 2.6% YoY, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure. The 10-year Treasury yield at 4.12% reflects anticipation of Powell\u2019s direction, with traders wary of a hawkish pushback that could reignite dollar strength. A softer tone from Powell would likely send EUR/USD through 1.1820 resistance, opening a move toward 1.1874\u20131.1918, while hawkish signals could drag the pair back toward 1.1726 support.\nRead More\n-\nXME ETF at $91.50 With +59.7% YTD Rally, Uranium and Gold Drive Gains\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Surge $887M as BlackRock\u2019s IBIT Nears $85B AUM and 57.5% Share\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - NG=F Holds $2.85 as EU Storage Hits 81.6% and Options Price \u20ac50/MWh Surge\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen at 148.40 as Fed Cuts Clash With BoJ Hawkish Signals, CPI in Focus\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nTechnical Picture: Neutral but Skewed Bullish\nOn the charts, EUR/USD is consolidating above its 50-EMA at 1.1770 and 200-EMA at 1.1705, maintaining a slight bullish bias.

                "body": "- GBP/USD forecast remains modestly bullish despite UK growth concerns\n- Dollar weakness persists as markets eye dovish Fed expectations\n- Bank of England likely to lag Fed in rate cuts, keeping sterling supported\nThe pound edged higher against the dollar as the greenback lost steam following its brief post-FOMC recovery. What\u2019s interesting here is that the move came despite some rather disappointing UK PMI numbers, which showed momentum in Britain\u2019s economy slipping. Yet, the market seems more focused on the policy divergence story \u2014 with the Bank of England likely to keep rates elevated for longer than the Federal Reserve. This is preventing the GBP/USD forecast to turn bearish just yet, with the pair looking to consolidate around the $1.35 handle.\nDollar makes weaker start to the week\nThe dollar softened at the start of the week, even as several Fed officials struck a more cautious note on rate cuts. Today, the dollar index was trading flat-ish as the major currency pairs traded mixed and without much conviction.\nMeanwhile, from a data point of view, US PMIs came broadly in line with forecasts, though the Richmond manufacturing index disappointed, highlighting the softer tone in recent American data. This backdrop keeps pressure on the dollar, with downside risks dominating the near-term outlook.\nThis week we have plenty of Fed speakers. Yesterday, policymakers such as Musalem, Bostic, and Hammack all sounded relatively hawkish, but their stance failed to sway markets much. Investors appear more convinced by softer economic data and the Fed\u2019s own guidance pointing towards rate cuts ahead. More Fedspeak is on the way. Jerome Powell is due to speak today, though he\u2019s unlikely to deviate from last week\u2019s comments.\nUK PMIs signal weakening momentum\nAcross the Atlantic, UK business activity clearly slowed in September. The services PMI fell to 51.9 from 54.2, manufacturing slipped further into contraction at 46.2, and, as a result, the composite index dropped to 51.0 from 53.5. The figures underline a loss of confidence as firms brace for potential tax hikes in the coming budget.\nNormally, such soft data would weigh on the GBP/USD forecast. But the cablehas held up relatively well, partly because inflation in Britain is still running close to 4% \u2014 almost double the BoE\u2019s target. This keeps the prospect of UK rates staying higher for longer alive, contrasting with expectations of further Fed cuts.\nTechnical GBP/USD forecast: Key levels to watch\nWith EUR/GBP touching a two-month high, sterling\u2019s resilience may not extend across the board. But against the dollar, the narrative still tilts in favour of the pound, at least until the Fed\u2019s dovish turn is fully priced in. Indeed, the GBP/USD chart was holding steady around the 1.35 handle at the time of writing. Short-term resistance is seen around 1.3540 to 1.358, while support comes in between 1.3434 to 1.3460.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R"

The Composite PMI fell to 51.0, well below expectations of 52.7 and the prior 53.5, showing the expansion of business activity is losing steam. Manufacturing PMI contracted deeper at 46.2 versus consensus 47.0, while services softened to 51.9 from 54.2. These figures underscore the fragility of the UK economy, raising fears that growth momentum is fading just as inflation stays elevated. Sterling\u2019s fiscal backdrop is deteriorating as well, with August borrowing surging to \u00a318B, the largest in five years, and total borrowing already overshooting projections. The increase in gilt yields highlights growing investor concern about fiscal credibility ahead of Chancellor Reeves\u2019 autumn budget in November.\nBank of England\u2019s Stagnant Policy Stance\nThe Bank of England left rates steady at 4.0%, stressing caution on further cuts despite inflation lingering above its 2% target. Governor Bailey has signaled patience, but the weak data complicates the path. Stagflation risks loom as the economy faces slow growth and sticky inflation, a combination that historically undermines currency performance. UK policymakers face a dilemma: tightening too soon could worsen growth, but further easing risks fueling inflation expectations already reflected in rising wage settlements.\nUS Data and Federal Reserve Dynamics\nAcross the Atlantic, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25bps, its first reduction of 2025, yet Chair Powell balanced it with hawkish commentary, warning of ongoing labor market softness while emphasizing commitment to price stability. U.S. retail sales and jobless claims confirmed economic resilience, supporting the dollar\u2019s strength. The U.S. Manufacturing PMI eased to 52 from 53, while Services slowed to 53.9 from 54.5, both still comfortably above the 50 expansion threshold. The divergence between a slowing UK economy and a still-expanding U.S. economy has kept GBP/USD capped, with the Fed expected to deliver at least two more cuts this year while maintaining a hawkish narrative.\nMarket Positioning and Technical Levels for GBP/USD\nGBP/USD is consolidating around 1.3518, after a sharp slide last week to 1.3450. On the charts, the pair faces immediate support at 1.3500, followed by 1.3450 and then 1.3400 if selling accelerates. To the upside, bulls need to clear 1.3550, with the next ceiling at 1.3600. The RSI remains under 50, showing lingering weakness despite the recent bounce. Price action is clustered near the 20-day SMA at 1.3523, and a sustained push below the 100-day SMA at 1.3481 would hand momentum back to sellers.

The Composite PMI slipped to 51.0 against the expected 52.7 and previous 53.5. It suggests that business activity continues to expand, albeit at a slower pace.

The fear of stagflation also persists as growth stagnates while inflation lingers higher.\nOn the US side, the Federal Reserve delivered its first rate cut in 2025. Still, Fed Chair Powell struck a hawkish tone, warning of weakness in the labor market while emphasizing the Fed\u2019s commitment to controlling inflation. The retail sales data and jobless claims reinforced US growth momentum.\nThe combination of a hawkish Fed and a fragile UK fiscal situation is weighing on the GBP/USD, which is currently consolidating at 1.3500 after falling to the 1.3450 area last week.\nKey Events Ahead\n- US PMIs: The US PMIs could weigh on the pair as the data is important for the Fed to gauge economic sentiment.\n- Jerome Powell\u2019s speech: Markets await fresh guidance from the Fed Chair on future rate cuts and labor market conditions.\n- Comments from Fed officials: Michele Bowman, Raphael Bostic, Stephen Miran, and Beth Hammack may shape near-term USD expectations.\n- UK Autumn Budget (November): Investors will watch whether Chancellor Reeves signals fiscal tightening or additional borrowing.\n- Upcoming UK data: Inflation, retail sales, and consumer confidence figures will be key in shaping BoE policy expectations.\nGBP/USD technical forecast: Key MAs to set trend\nThe GBP/USD price wobbles around the key MAs around 1.3500 on the 4-hour chart.

The move helped the pair recover some composure after slipping to two-week lows the day before, as the US Dollar (USD) continued its choppy back-and-forth.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) inched higher too, clawing back some of Monday\u2019s losses as traders looked ahead to Chair Powell\u2019s speech and digested a weaker run of September PMIs.\nStubborn inflation keeps the RBA cautious\nAustralia\u2019s inflation problem hasn\u2019t gone away. July\u2019s Monthly CPI Indicator (Weighted Mean) accelerated to 2.8% from 1.9% in June, while Q2 CPI rose 0.7% QoQ and 2.1% YoY.\nThat\u2019s why the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is holding the line. With prices still running hotter than target, policymakers are reluctant to cut too quickly. Policymakers must strike a balance between supporting growth and preventing inflation from escalating.\nDomestic economy holding up better than feared\nEven with global uncertainty swirling, Australia\u2019s economy looks more resilient than expected. Early reads for September suggest Manufacturing PMI may ease to 51.3 and Services to 52.0, but both remain comfortably in expansion territory.\nOther data have been firmer too: Retail Sales rose 1.2% in June, the trade surplus widened to A$7.3 billion in July, and business investment ticked higher in Q2. GDP also surprised, up 0.6% QoQ and 1.8% YoY.\nThe labour market is showing a few cracks, though. Unemployment held steady at 4.2% in August, but total employment dropped by 5.4K.\nRBA sticks to data-driven path\nEarlier this month, the RBA trimmed the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3.60% and cut back its 2025 growth forecast. Governor Michele Bullock has since underlined that deeper cuts aren\u2019t on the table, making clear that policy will stay data-dependent.\nThe Minutes reinforced the point: if jobs weaken further, the RBA could accelerate cuts. But if the economy stays steady, easing will be gradual.\nSpeaking to the House Economics Committee, Bullock described both growth and inflation as being in a \u201cgood place\u201d, reinforcing that there's no urgency to shift policy. For now, markets expect the RBA to hold steady at next week\u2019s meeting, with pricing implying about 26 basis points of easing by year-end.\nChina still the swing factor\nAustralia\u2019s outlook is still tied to China\u2019s fortunes. Q2 GDP grew 5.2% YoY, but August retail sales undershot at 3.4%. PMIs were mixed: Manufacturing slipped into contraction at 49.4, while services barely stayed in growth territory at 50.3. Deflation worries linger too, with CPI down 0.4% YoY in August.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) kept its Loan Prime Rates (LPR) unchanged in September: 3.00% for the One-Year and 3.50% for the Five-Year, matching expectations.\nSpeculators pare back AUD shorts\nCFTC data for the week ending (September 16) showed speculators trimming bearish AUD bets, with net shorts dropping to 51.2K contracts, the lowest since May. Still, total open interest fell sharply to about 154K, suggesting traders have cut back exposure overall.\nTechnical landscape\nFrom a technical perspective, if buyers stay in control, AUD/USD could make another run at the 2025 ceiling at 0.6707 (September 17). A clean break above that would bring last year\u2019s high at 0.6942 (September 30) into view, just under the psychological 0.7000 mark.\nOn the downside, initial support lies at the 55-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), at 0.6537 and 0.6511. A drop below there would put the August low at 0.6414 (August 21) back in play, followed by the 200-day SMA at 0.6397 and the June trough at 0.6372 (June 23).\nMomentum indicators are sending mixed but mildly constructive signals.

Fed\u2019s easing cycle lifts yields while BoJ hints at hikes; Core CPI set to decide whether range breaks toward 150.88 or back to 144.10 | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY Tests 148.50 as Fed Cuts Collide With BoJ Hawkish Hints\nUSD/JPY is trading near 148.40, marking a sharp rebound of almost 2% from last week\u2019s FOMC lows at 145.49. The Federal Reserve\u2019s renewed easing cycle has fueled volatility, but the Bank of Japan\u2019s cautious hawkish tone is holding the yen in check. This divergence between a Fed easing into elevated inflation and a BoJ edging toward possible rate hikes is defining the current range. The pair has now spent seven consecutive weeks between 145.50 and 148.80, with traders positioning for a decisive breakout as September\u2019s U.S. Core CPI release approaches.\nTechnical Compression Signals Larger Move in USD/JPY\nCharts show a classic coiling structure. Support remains firm at 145.83, the 61.8% retracement of July\u2019s advance. Resistance is stacked at 148.55\u2013148.84, capped by the 200-day moving average and prior cycle highs. A close above 148.84 would expose 149.75 and eventually 150.88, the 100% extension of April\u2019s advance. A downside break below 145.83 would confirm a larger reversal, targeting 144.10\u2013144.40. For now, the higher lows since April keep buyers marginally favored, but momentum indicators like the RSI hovering near neutral reflect hesitation ahead of key data.\nRead More\n-\nXME ETF at $91.50 With +59.7% YTD Rally, Uranium and Gold Drive Gains\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Surge $887M as BlackRock\u2019s IBIT Nears $85B AUM and 57.5% Share\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - NG=F Holds $2.85 as EU Storage Hits 81.6% and Options Price \u20ac50/MWh Surge\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Forecast - GBP to USD Holds 1.3518 as Weak UK PMI and \u00a318B Borrowing Clash With Fed\u2019s Hawkish Cut\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nU.S. Inflation and Treasury Yields Drive Dollar Demand\nThe U.S. Core CPI and PCE inflation data this week are critical for direction. Last year\u2019s Fed cuts failed to bring yields down; instead, 10-year Treasuries rose as inflation stayed above target, making long bonds unattractive. The same pattern is re-emerging. Yields are climbing despite cuts, keeping the U.S. dollar resilient and preventing USD/JPY from breaking lower. The 10-year yield at 4.36% continues to support the dollar against lower-yielding currencies like the yen. Traders will be watching whether inflation eases enough to justify further cuts or forces the Fed to slow its easing pace.\nBoJ Policy and Yen Positioning Under Scrutiny\nThe BoJ\u2019s last meeting offered no fresh policy action but Governor Ueda signaled that rate hikes remain on the table if wage growth and inflation stabilize. This contrasts with the Fed\u2019s dovish pivot, reinforcing policy divergence. Japanese investors have also been unwinding carry trades selectively, but the yen remains one of the weakest majors this year. USD/JPY\u2019s failure to drop despite repeated retests of support reflects heavy Japanese demand for overseas assets, especially U.S. Treasuries. The 145.00 level is increasingly seen as the line where authorities might intervene verbally if yen weakness accelerates.\nGlobal Risk Sentiment Adds Volatility to USD/JPY\nBroader risk trends are feeding into USD/JPY flows. U.S. equities remain near record highs despite Fed cuts, and this risk-on backdrop reduces demand for the yen as a safe haven. However, if equity volatility spikes or if geopolitical risk in Asia escalates, demand for the yen could surge quickly. Hedge funds remain net long the dollar versus yen, but positioning is stretched, raising the odds of sharp corrections if macro surprises hit.

                "body": "Dollar forecast: USD/JPY and DXY analysis: Technical Tuesday\nAfter a rather quiet few months, the USD/JPY is shaping up to be rather intriguing. The Bank of Japan struck a marginally hawkish note last week, hinting that further rate rises could be on the horizon. That comes right when the Federal Reserve is now cutting rates again, a divergence that should in theory place downward pressure on the dollar-yen pair as the US dollar forecast remains modestly bearish. Yet, price action hasn\u2019t quite reflected this. Not yet, anyway. But is that about to change? That\u2019s what we will examine in this edition of Technical Tuesday.\nBefore looking at the USD/JPY, let\u2019s first quickly discuss levels on the Dollar Index chart, which remains entrenched in a bearish trend.\nDollar forecast: Dollar Index (DXY) technical analysis\nThe US dollar index staged a bounce following last week\u2019s FOMC rate decision, but the rally now finds itself pressing against resistance at around the 97.60-80 area. Here, the 21-day exponential moving average meets prior support and the underside of a bearish trend line given the confluence of these important technical factors here, this makes it a key resistance area to watch. A clean breakout above here would therefore put an end to the technical bearish dollar forecast, at least in the near-term.\nHowever, the broader picture still reflects a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, consistent with a corrective trend. The recovery we saw began after the index dipped beneath the July trough of 96.37, sweeping out liquidity before staging a rebound. Whether this proves to be a durable low, perhaps a double bottom or even a false breakdown, remains to be seen. For the moment, the market requires stronger bullish confirmation to convince traders this is anything more than a short-term reprieve. I\u2019m not persuaded just yet, so it\u2019s a case of watching how the week develops.\nDollar forecast: USD/JPY coiling for a potential breakdown?\nTurning our gaze to the USD/JPY chart now, and on the weekly we can see the pair has produced a string of indecisive doji-style candles over recent weeks \u2014 a classic signal that the market is coiling before a larger directional move. What will be the fundamental trigger of that remains to be seen, but with the US dollar being among the weakest of major currencies in recent months, it could simply be a case of rotations into the yen ahead of a possible rate hike or two from the BoJ in the coming months.\nAnyway, the USD/JPY chart continues to grapple with a major resistance band between 148.65 and 150.00. This zone, once a strong base in December and again earlier this year, has been retested multiple times since it broke down. So far, we haven\u2019t had a convincing break back above it to tip the balance in the bull\u2019s favour again. So, the sellers are still technically in charge, and this group of traders were encouraged by the appearance of an inverted hammer candle at those highs that was formed at the end of July. Yet, frustratingly for the bears, the follow-through has been conspicuously absent. Prices have merely drifted sideways. The question now is whether the Fed\u2019s dovish tilt can finally tip the balance lower. If so, the UJ bears could initially target liquidity resting beneath last week\u2019s low of 145.48, with the pair having already testing waters above the high of last week\u2019s range at 148.28, before turning modestly lower.\nTechnical analysis: Daily chart of the USD/JPY also indecisive\nOn the daily chart, the 200-day moving average is doing a fine job of capping rallies, reinforcing the importance of that 148.65\u2013150 resistance corridor. With this long-term moving average pointing lower, the broader trend is starting to lean bearish. However, conviction will only come if the market can break below some important support levels now. The first one is at 147.00. Beneath there, a descending trendline offers support at around 146.00, and if that were to give way, 145.00 becomes the logical next target"

                "body": "- The Japanese Yen drifts lower in reaction to the disappointing Japan Manufacturing PMI.\n- A modest USD uptick further contributes to the USD/JPY pair\u2019s modest intraday rise.\n- The divergent BoJ-Fed policy expectations could limit losses for the lower-yielding JPY.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) extends its steady intraday descent against a broadly firmer US Dollar (USD) and lifts the USD/JPY pair to the 148.00 mark during the Asian session on Wednesday. A private survey showed this Wednesday that manufacturing sector activity in Japan fell at the fastest pace in six months in September. This comes amid concerns that domestic political uncertainty and economic headwinds stemming from US tariffs could prompt the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to delay raising interest rates, which, in turn, is seen undermining the JPY.\nMeanwhile, there were two board members voting against the BoJ's decision last week to keep interest rates unchanged, which underscores mounting pressure within the central bank to phase out its massive monetary stimulus. This marks a significant divergence in comparison to the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) dovish signal that two more rate cuts will follow through the rest of this year, which might cap the USD and lend support to the lower-yielding JPY. Apart from this, rising geopolitical tensions should help limit losses for the safe-haven JPY.\nJapanese Yen bulls remain on the defensive on the back of weaker manufacturing data\n- The S&P Global flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined from 49.7 in August to 48.4 in September, or the steepest decline since March. This also marked the 14th month of contraction in the past 15 and exerts some downward pressure on the Japanese Yen during the Asian session on Wednesday.\n- Furthermore, a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election will take place on 4 October, and the outcome could delay the next interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan if a candidate with dovish views is selected. The BoJ, however, signaled that rate hikes remain on the table if the economy and prices move in line with forecasts.\n- Moreover, investors are still pricing in the possibility of a 25-basis-point rate hike by the BoJ in October amid signs of economic resilience. This contrasts with the US Federal Reserve (Fed) dovish pivot, which reinforces policy divergence and, in turn, should help limit any meaningful depreciating move for the lower-yielding JPY.\n- The US Dollar attracts some buyers and, for now, seems to have stalled a two-day pullback from an over one-week top touched on Monday in the wake of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Tuesday. Powell said that policymakers faced a challenging situation in deciding whether to prioritise fighting inflation or protecting jobs.\n- Powell added that easing too aggressively could leave the inflation job unfinished and need to reverse course. The comments pushed back against market expectations of more interest rate cuts in the coming months, which revived the USD demand and assisted the USD/JPY pair to gain some positive traction after a two-day downtick.\n- Traders now look to the release of New Home Sales from the US for some impetus later during the North American session. The focus, however, remains glued to other important US macro data scheduled during the latter part of the week, including the final GDP print and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index.\n- Apart from this, traders this week will also confront the release of Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Friday, which could influence BoJ rate hike expectations and drive the JPY. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop favors the JPY bulls and warrants caution before positioning for any meaningful USD/JPY appreciation.\nUSD/JPY could attract fresh sellers at higher levels; seems vulnerable while below 200-day SMA\nThe USD/JPY pair, barring a few knee-jerk moves in either direction, has been trading in a familiar range since early August.

                "body": "The USD/CAD has posted two consecutive bullish sessions, with a short-term gain of around 0.5%, strengthened after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Buying pressure has become more consistent, although still insufficient to establish a decisive path for the U.S. dollar. In this context, the market continues to show indecisive movements, without a clear short-term direction.\nWhat Updates Has the Fed Provided?\nToday, Powell highlighted that the central bank faces a delicate balance between persistent inflation and a weaker labor market, which has begun to show signs of slowdown in recent months.\nHe emphasized that the new cycle of rate cuts cannot progress too quickly, as this could reignite inflationary pressures. At the same time, he underscored that the Fed\u2019s short-term goal is to sustain a recovery in employment.\nThese remarks were interpreted as a signal that the Fed is not leaning toward overly aggressive cuts, which gave the U.S. dollar some temporary relief after trending lower for much of 2025. In fact, the DXY index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against a basket of currencies, has halted its recent declines and is holding above 97 points, reflecting a degree of recovery in recent sessions.\nSource: MarketWatch\nAs a result, this rebound in confidence in the dollar could cause the Canadian dollar to lose further ground in the short term. However, this appears to be a temporary development, particularly after last week\u2019s rate decisions from both the Fed and the Bank of Canada. If the Fed continues with a cycle of steady rate cuts and the Bank of Canada does not confirm additional reductions this year, the selling pressure that previously characterized USD/CAD could return in the medium term, especially given that the pair has yet to establish a clear directional move.\nNew Plans for Canada?\nOn September 18, a meeting took place between the Canadian Prime Minister and the President of Mexico, where both countries agreed to deepen cooperation in trade and security ahead of the scheduled USMCA review in 2026. During the meeting, it was noted that Canada seeks to expand its bilateral trade with Mexico, which reached nearly $56 billion in 2024, with expectations of further growth in the coming years.\nThese initiatives are part of Canada\u2019s broader strategy to diversify its economic policy, in response to the risk that trade relations with the U.S. could put pressure on its economy. At the same time, the government remains committed to its \u201cBuy Canadian\u201d policy, designed to boost domestic production and consumption as a way to mitigate potential risks to growth.\nIn this context, Canada\u2019s current measures aim to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on the U.S. If these efforts succeed, they could stabilize confidence in the Canadian dollar and enhance its attractiveness as an investment asset. In such a scenario, renewed selling pressure on USD/CAD could emerge, becoming a key factor for the pair\u2019s movements in upcoming sessions.\nUSD/CAD Technical Forecast\nSource: StoneX, Tradingview\n- Short-Term Sideways Range: Since late July, USD/CAD has been moving within a lateral channel, with resistance at 1.39036 and support at 1.37356. Recent moves have not been strong enough to break this formation, which remains the main technical reference in the short term. As long as the range holds, the market will likely continue in a state of indecision.\n- RSI: The RSI line continues to rise above the neutral 50 level, indicating that buying momentum has gained strength in the average of the last 14 sessions. If this trend continues, it could reinforce a short-term bullish bias.\n- MACD: The MACD histogram oscillates around the neutral zero line, signaling indecision in short-term moving averages. Unless a clearer direction emerges, the lateral range is likely to prevail.\nKey Levels:\n- 1.37356 \u2013 Crucial Support: Coincides with recent declines and the Ichimoku cloud.

                "body": "- USD/CAD appreciates as market sentiment weakens following fresh Trump tariff threats on Russia.\n- Trump also condemned European nations for purchasing Russian energy, insisting they are \u201cfinancing the war against themselves.\u201d\n- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney noted that the effects of US trade tariffs are becoming increasingly evident.\nUSD/CAD extends its winning streak for the third consecutive day, trading around 1.3840 during the Asian hours on Wednesday. The pair appreciates as the US Dollar (USD) receives support from increased risk aversion, driven by the fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump against Russia.\nAt the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on Tuesday, President Trump warned that the United States (US) is ready to impose a \u201cvery strong round of powerful tariffs\u201d if Russia refuses to end the war in Ukraine. Trump also criticized European countries for buying Russian energy, arguing that \u201cthey are funding the war against themselves,\u201d and urged the EU to join Washington in implementing tariffs to ensure their effectiveness.\nHowever, the Greenback faced challenges following the release of US S&P Global PMI figures for September on Tuesday. Composite PMI ticked down to 53.6 from 54.6 in August, pointing to a private sector that seems to be struggling to strengthen further. Manufacturing PMI eased to 52.0 from 53, signalling waning momentum in the sector. Services PMI slipped to 53.9 from 54.5, suggesting demand there may be easing.\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney noted that ongoing impacts from Donald Trump's trade tariffs are becoming more noticeable and acknowledged that trade discussions between the US and Canada are still ongoing.\nBank of Canada (BoC) Governor Tiff Macklem noted on Monday that Canada will need to continue charting a \"more independent course\" away from the US, citing the US Dollar's recent performance across the market. Trump's attempts to influence the Fed are raising questions about the continued independence of US monetary policy, Macklem added.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors se"

That\u2019s pushed the Canadian dollar down to around 72.25 US cents. The Bank of Canada cut rates for the first time since March, hoping to boost economic growth even as it keeps an eye on inflation. Now, traders are pricing in a 50% chance of another rate cut at the bank\u2019s meeting in late October\u2014which could mean more challenges ahead for the currency. While a jump in crude oil prices gave the loonie some support, it\u2019s still stuck in a tight trading range as investors brace for more rate moves.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Interest rate gaps set the pace.\nThe growing rate gap has driven down Canadian bond yields and left the loonie under pressure, making life trickier for currency traders and businesses with cross-border exposure. If the Bank of Canada cuts rates again, the currency could slide further, with possible ripple effects on Canadian stocks and other riskier assets.\nThe bigger picture: Balancing growth and currency strength in a shifting world.\nCanada\u2019s central bank is walking a fine line between supporting growth and keeping inflation in check\u2014a challenge faced by central banks everywhere.

Launched on Friday, the product gives investors access to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). Grayscale's crypto fund launched under the SEC's recently announced generic listing standards, which reduce approval timelines for ETFs under Rule 6c-11.\nAccording to Atkins, the new listing standards are \u201canother example of how we can move forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an ad hoc type of approach.

Fidelity trails at $22.8B, underscoring BlackRock\u2019s grip on institutional flows | That's TradingNEWS\nBitcoin ETF Inflows Reshape Institutional Market Dynamics\nBlackRock\u2019s BTC-USD ETF Dominance and Revenue Scale\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF (BTC-USD) has emerged as the clear anchor of institutional adoption. With assets under management approaching $85 billion and commanding 57.5% of the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market share, the iShares Bitcoin Trust has established itself as one of the largest ETFs globally. The fund\u2019s size is translating directly into revenue: BlackRock\u2019s combined Bitcoin and Ether products are generating $260 million annually, of which $218 million comes from Bitcoin ETFs alone. That revenue figure rivals long-standing profit centers in traditional finance and highlights crypto ETFs as a durable business model rather than a speculative experiment.\nWeekly Flows: $887 Million In, $363 Million Out\nThe past week underscored how volatile ETF flows can be despite their structural growth. Data shows that Bitcoin ETFs pulled in a net $887 million over five trading days, including $292 million on September 16 and $260 million on September 15, before registering a midweek outflow of $51.2 million on September 17. The week ended positive, but on September 22 the trend reversed sharply: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $363.1 million in net outflows, the heaviest single-day withdrawal since launch. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC led the exodus with $276.7 million in redemptions, ARK\u2019s ARKB lost $52.3 million, and WisdomTree\u2019s BTCW shed $24.6 million. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT was notable in showing no inflows or outflows, signaling that its investor base remains more anchored than peers.\nEthereum ETF Flows Support Broader Trend\nEthereum ETFs mirrored Bitcoin\u2019s volatile flow pattern. Across the week, they absorbed $557 million in inflows, including a single-day record of $359.7 million on September 15. However, that momentum was partially offset by $61.7 million in outflows the next day and a small $1.9 million dip on September 17. By September 19, renewed strength added $213 million, bringing cumulative inflows to their highest level since inception. Year-to-date, Ethereum ETFs have received $12.6 billion, underscoring how institutional money is no longer limited to Bitcoin.\nRead More\n-\nXME ETF at $91.50 With +59.7% YTD Rally, Uranium and Gold Drive Gains\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nSolana Price Forecast - SOL-USD Holds $214 as Institutions Add $1.7B, ETF Approval Odds Fuel $500 Bull Case\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast - NG=F Holds $2.85 as EU Storage Hits 81.6% and Options Price \u20ac50/MWh Surge\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nUSD/JPY Price Forecast - Dollar to Yen at 148.40 as Fed Cuts Clash With BoJ Hawkish Signals, CPI in Focus\n23.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nMacro Backdrop: Fed Policy and Rate Cuts\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut rates by 25 basis points for the first time this year served as a catalyst for late-week ETF demand.

The funds will be used to expand the company\u2019s Ethereum (ETH) holdings and strengthen its position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This shift in strategy is part of a broader trend where institutions are increasingly getting involved in Ethereum\u2019s growth, aiming to capitalize on both its market value and technological developments.\nWith this new funding, ETHZilla could potentially purchase an additional 120,000 ETH, nearly doubling its current holdings. This move places the company among the largest institutional holders of Ethereum, signaling its commitment to the blockchain and DeFi innovations. ETHZilla already holds 102,000 ETH, which makes it one of the top ten corporate holders of the cryptocurrency.\nFrom Biotech to Blockchain: ETHZilla\u2019s New Strategy\nETHZilla\u2019s pivot from biotechnology to cryptocurrency is significant. Founded in 2016, the company initially focused on clinical-stage biotech. However, after facing significant financial setbacks and a nearly 99% drop in stock value, ETHZilla decided to reinvent itself. Now, instead of biotechnology, ETHZilla is targeting cash-flowing assets within the crypto space.\nRather than just holding Ethereum as a treasury asset, the company is actively investing in Ethereum\u2019s growing ecosystem.\nThis includes initiatives such as Layer-2 networks, which enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like digital bonds or property. These investments are aimed at generating recurring revenue, which will further strengthen Ethereum\u2019s role in decentralized finance.\nStrategic Investments: Layer-2 and Tokenized Assets\nETHZilla\u2019s strategy goes beyond accumulating Ethereum. The company is also investing in Layer-2 networks, which help lower Ethereum\u2019s transaction costs and improve scalability. By deploying capital into Layer-2 projects, ETHZilla is positioning itself at the forefront of Ethereum\u2019s evolution.\nAdditionally, the company is investing in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), which expands the utility of Ethereum in areas like real estate and finance. Tokenized assets allow real-world goods and financial instruments to be represented on the blockchain, broadening Ethereum\u2019s practical applications in DeFi.\nETHZilla\u2019s investments are not limited to Ethereum itself but are designed to enhance the ecosystem around it. This broader approach provides more diversified revenue streams, making the company more resilient in the fast-changing crypto landscape.\nA New Era of Corporate Ethereum Treasuries\nThe scale of ETHZilla\u2019s investment in Ethereum aligns with a broader trend in the crypto industry, where corporations are increasingly holding and managing significant amounts of digital assets. Similar to Bitcoin-focused firms, ETHZilla\u2019s strategy of acquiring and holding large amounts of Ethereum mirrors the practices of corporate treasuries that use crypto as a reserve asset.\nThe rise of Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), including ETHZilla, has contributed to a tightening of Ethereum\u2019s available supply. As of now, ETHZilla and similar entities control roughly 4.34% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply. This strategy is seen as a way to help reduce the liquidity of Ethereum, which could have long-term effects on its price, especially with around 30% of Ethereum currently staked in the network.\nETHZilla\u2019s approach is notable for its focus on generating revenue from its Ethereum holdings through strategic inves"

Meanwhile, blockchain payment company Fnality raised $136 million from major banks to grow its settlement network, and US lawmakers pressed for crypto in retirement plans.\nUS SEC eyes \u2018innovation exemption\u2019 to fast-track digital asset products: Atkins\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission is working to create an \u201cinnovation exemption\u201d that would ease approval of digital-asset products by the end of the year, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said on Tuesday.\nDuring an interview on Fox Business, Atkins told anchor Maria Bartiromo that the SEC is working on \u201crulemaking in the coming months.\u201d\nAn \u201cinnovation exemption\u201d would function as a regulatory carve-out, giving crypto companies temporary relief from older securities rules to roll out new products under lighter oversight while the SEC develops tailored regulations.\nAtkins addressed a question about the recent approval of the first multi-asset crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United States. Launched on Friday, the product gives investors access to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). Grayscale's crypto fund launched under the SEC's recently announced generic listing standards, which reduce approval timelines for ETFs under Rule 6c-11.\nAccording to Atkins, the new listing standards are \u201canother example of how we can move forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an ad hoc type of approach. We\u2019re trying to give the marketplace some kind of stable platform upon which they can introduce new products.\u201d\nBlockchain payment firm Fnality raises $136 million in round led by major banks\nLondon-based blockchain payments company Fnality secured $136 million in a Series C funding round backed by some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions.\nBank of America, Citi, KBC Group, Temasek, Tradeweb and WisdomTree led the round, joined by returning investors including Goldman Sachs, Santander, Barclays and UBS, according to a Tuesday announcement by the company.\n\u201cThe closing of our Series C reflects a shared conviction that the future of money demands a new foundation,\u201d Fnality CEO Michelle Neal said. She added that the company\u2019s blockchain-based settlement systems offer \u201c24/7 payment rails, real-time settlement, and enhanced liquidity.\u201d\nFnality, which launched its sterling-denominated Fnality Payment System in the United Kingdom last year, aims to modernize wholesale payments through a blockchain-based infrastructure tied to central bank reserves. The new capital will help Fnality expand into the US dollar and euro markets, pending regulatory approvals, it said.\nUS lawmakers urge SEC to act on Trump\u2019s crypto retirement plan\nUS lawmakers have called on Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins to help accelerate the executive order enabling crypto investments in US 401(k) retirement plans.\nIn the letter on Monday, nine lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill and Subcommittee on Capital Markets Chairman Ann Wagner, said that Atkins was asked to \u201cprovide swift assistance\u201d to the Secretary of Labor and to make any necessary adjustments to its current regulations and guidance.\nThey also noted that under President Donald Trump\u2019s August executive order on \u201cDemocratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,\u201d the SEC was instructed to make alternative assets like crypto more accessible in participant-directed retirement plans, in consideration of accredited investor and qualified purchaser rules.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that such actions will help the 90 million Americans that are currently restricted from investing in alternative assets to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement,\u201d the nine lawmakers said."

                "body": "Ethereum (ETH) remains one of the top cryptocurrencies in 2025, valued for its robust ecosystem and role as the backbone of decentralized finance. Yet while ETH itself is solid, its potential for 2025 upside may be more limited than with newer cryptos. That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes into the equation.\nNow priced at just $0.035, MUTM is a DeFi-based token positioned to reshape lending and borrowing. Experts suggest that if MUTM can hit its projected growth margins, early investors can look forward to returns of up to 15x. That is, 1 ETH invested in Mutuum Finance today could become 15 ETH before the end of 2025.\nEthereum Stays Robust as DeFi Pillar\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at around $4,530 currently, staying strong as the second-largest market cap cryptocurrency and the foundation for decentralized finance. Its extensive ecosystem of layer-2 solutions, smart contracts, and institutional backing continues to build its foundation as a long-term market leader. But with ETH\u2019s size automatically limiting its potential upside compared to smaller-cap stocks, investors are turning their attention to new project Mutuum Finance that is seen as having more upside growth in the next cycle.\nMutuum Finance Presale and the Future of DeFi\nMutuum Finance presale has raised over $16.2 million in presale and more than 16,500 investors have bought tokens. Stage 6 is available for sale at the price of $0.035 per token.\nMutuum Finance aspires to long-term growth in the DeFi space. The project is promoting early adoption by running a $100,000 giveaway campaign where 10 users of the platform will get $10,000 MUTM each.\nMutuum Finance and CertiK also have an open Bug Bounty Program with a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. The Program is intended to encourage white-hat hackers and security researchers to reward them for identifying bugs in the project codebase. Bugs are ranked on severity level, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, and rewards are issued in same.\nMutuum Finance is in the shape of a balanced dynamic rate of interest liquidity model. Borrowing is extremely appealing during periods of low interest and triggers lending and usage. High interest induces repayment, as well as further injections of capital. The most suitable are fixed interest rates for highly liquid funds, anchored and reopenable on fluctuation in the market.\nBeing a fully decentralized system, rights ownership is in the hands of the MUTM token holders where lending and borrowing are distinguished from one another. The interest rate mechanism rewards long-term efficiency, increases portfolio auto-diversification, and grows as the DeFi market evolves.\nPrecise pricing facilitates lending, borrowing, and liquidation trades to be carried out profitably. Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles to obtain USD and natively native assets such as ETH, POL, and AVAX. The system utilizes fallback oracles, composite feeds, and time-weighted averages of decentralized exchanges to provide precise valuations even in stressed markets.\nTurn 1 ETH into 15 ETH\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) ranks amongst the top cryptos that have been attracting investor attention as one of the most promising opportunities in 2025. Stage 6 presale tokens are priced at $0.035 with over $16.2M raised and 16,500+ investors already on board. Experts are expecting returns up to 15x, i.e., 1 ETH today may become the value of 15 ETH by taking MUTM\u2019s route. Backed by a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and a safe oracle-powered lending protocol, Mutuum Finance is innovation meets growth potential. As Ethereum (ETH) remains flat at $4,530, MUTM offers the greater upside small-cap investors are looking for. Get your Stage 6 tokens now before the next presale price increase.\nFor more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance"

                "body": "Solana has emerged as a powerhouse in the blockchain ecosystem, showcasing impressive growth metrics that continue to capture the attention of investors and developers alike. The network's recent achievement of reaching $34 billion in Total Value Locked represents a significant milestone that underscores its growing dominance in the decentralized finance space and provides a strong foundation for future price appreciation.\nSolana (SOL) Price Strengthens with DeFi Expansion\nSolana keeps proving its strength as a top DeFi network. The latest numbers show Solana's TVL has hit a record $34 billion - that's almost 200% growth from last year. This massive jump shows people are really confident in what Solana can do.\nCrypto analyst @CryptosRUs pointed out that this isn't just good news for the ecosystem - it's also a solid reason why SOL's price could keep climbing. The steady increase in DeFi activity suggests Solana might be hitting a new level of mainstream adoption that could drive the price even higher.\nSOL Price Outlook: Ecosystem Leaders Drive Growth\nSolana's success comes from its top protocols growing fast. Circle, Kamino, Jupiter, Jito, and Sanctum are leading the charge, while established names like Raydium, Marinade, Drift Protocol, and Orca keep providing solid liquidity options. Big institutional players like BlackRock, VanEck, and PayPal joining the ecosystem makes it even more credible.\nThis variety of apps is crucial for keeping Solana's growth going without relying too heavily on just one protocol. Analysts think if this pace continues, Solana's TVL could hit $40 billion soon, putting it in an even stronger position against Ethereum and other major blockchains.\nBesides the TVL numbers, Solana has built a reputation as one of the fastest and cheapest blockchains out there. Its ability to process tons of transactions quickly and cheaply has attracted developers, DeFi projects, and even traditional finance companies looking into digital assets.\nFor investors, the picture is pretty clear: Solana's $34 billion TVL milestone shows exponential growth, making a strong case for SOL's price to keep rising. If market conditions stay positive, analysts believe Solana could be entering a new bull run powered by its rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem."

                "body": "Solana (SOL) is setting itself up for a possible new all-time high this weekend, as robust network activity and renewed investor enthusiasm continue to propel its price. But as Solana (SOL) dominates the headlines with its price, there is another project building strength even more quietly in presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM).\nSolana (SOL) is trading about $245.50, with intraday highs near $253 and lows near $243. Recent price action has shown steady buyer demand, but SOL is also increasing to areas of resistance that had earlier held it back from a solid breakout. Support is starting to develop in the $220\u2013$230 range, which gives some cushion to the downside.\nWhile bullish sentiment and Solana ecosystem activity continue to be confidence supportive, investors feel that newer DeFi venture Mutuum Finance, is offering more potential upside in the current market conditions.\nMutuum Finance is offering investors the opportunity to be early adopters of the project and invest in tokens at considerably lower rates than what they will be asked to pay after the project\u2019s launch. At presale Phase 6, where it is $0.035 per MUTM, the token will be priced at Phase 7 at $0.04. Presale has succeeded with over $16.05 million collected and over 16,450 token holders, a reflection of confidence and optimism on the part of investors in the market.\nAt yet another security level, Mutuum Finance has also initiated an official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK ensuring rewards of up to $50,000 USDT. Publicly announced, the program invites white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to test the codebase for any weaknesses. The bounties are rewarded on a severity level basis, so even low-level bugs are already resolved before release.\nMUTM is a two-layer hybrid lending protocol, with Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models, to ensure ultimate flexibility. The P2C model is used to enable the contracts to monitor the market round-the-clock so that interest rates can be decided. It is designed such that investors will earn passive income and lenders will lend at the lowest interest rates and the contracts will execute the transaction automatically.\nP2P model enables lenders and borrowers to interact directly in real-time without an intermediary. The more dynamic of the two provides the possibilities for riskier products such as meme coins and freedom and efficiency in a trustless setting.\nIn the interest of providing precise and current prices, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles that feed on high-cap token price aggregations such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are also used for security in a bear market. The stable foundation of sound pricing is used in stable collateral management, liquidation, and risk calculation for stability and efficiency of the protocol under all market conditions.\nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up great momentum while Solana (SOL) is racing towards a fresh ATH above $300. Stage 6 presale tokens are worth $0.035, and the price will go up 14.29% to $0.04 in Stage 7. The project has raised a notable $16.05M in funds with 16,450+ holders, which means investors have confidence in it. With its double lending model of P2C and P2P, Chainlink oracle integration, and $50K CertiK bug bounty, MUTM offers a mix of innovation, flexibility, and security. As Solana tests for resistance, early investors see MUTM as the higher upside bet through 2025. Lock in Stage 6 tokens today before the next price spike.\nFor more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:\nWebsite: https://mutuum.com/\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance"

Although this is still in expansion territory it suggests that the UK economy continues to lose momentum as we lead up the Budget. There were big losses for the manufacturing and the service sector indices. Manufacturing fell further into contraction territory at 46.2, while the service sector also fell to 51.9 from 54.2 in August.

The Survey also reported that the auto industry was particularly impacted, as a result of plant stoppages at Jaguar Land Rover.\nExport sales remain subdued, and total new orders fell to their lowest level since April, when Donald Trump announced his plans for tariffs. The survey recorded falling sales to both the US and Europe, in a sign that tariffs are hitting demand on both sides of the Atlantic. The recent state visit by Donald Trump to the UK was meant to have positive economic benefits for the UK, this report suggests that a good economic relationship between the US and the UK is more important than ever.\nInflation may have peaked, as price rises moderate\nThe one bit of good news in this report is that price pressures may have moderated in the UK this month. The price index recorded one of the smallest increases in change since the pandemic.\nThis PMI report suggests that the economy is almost stalling in the UK, and job losses are rising. The PMI employment sector report, suggested that the private sector may have shed another 50,000 jobs in the three months to September. The PMI survey noted a large fall in business confidence, as tax rises are once again on the agenda. The survey also suggests that the economy may continue to stall due to a lack of confidence.\nBudget risks mount once again\nNews on Tuesday suggests that the government may consider hiking income tax by 2%. This would break Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge and could have big political ramifications for the government. The suggestion comes from the Resolution Foundation, who also argue that the government should reduce the VAT threshold for business to \u00a330,000 from the current \u00a390,000. This would hammer small business at the same time as the private sector is suffering from weak orders here and abroad, as this PMI survey shows. Applying 20% of VAT to all small business activity could be the nail in the coffin for many. It would undoubtedly threaten jobs, and it could backfire dramatically. This PMI report should send a clear message to the government: tax rises should not take precedence over spending cuts, if tax rises are the centre piece of this Budget, then growth will be severely thwarted in the coming years.\nOECD calls out UK price rises\nThe bad news keeps piling up for the government. The OECD has said that the UK faces the highest level of inflation of any major economy this year. The OECD predicts that UK inflation rate will rise to 3.5% this year from 2.5% a year ago, and core inflation will rise to 3.7%, well above the G20 average rate.\nFrom hero to zero, UK growth set to slow sharply next year\nThe OECD has blamed food prices and has also poin"

                "body": "NFL Panic Meter: Michael Penix Jr.'s early-season struggle isn't great news for Falcons\nWhen Michael Penix Jr. didn't play well in Week 2, it didn't seem like it mattered much. The Atlanta Falcons won a tough road game against the Minnesota Vikings, and everyone understood the Vikings have an excellent defense.\nWhen Penix was even worse against a Carolina Panthers defense that hadn't played well since the start of the 2024 season, that was worrisome.\nPenix took a seat in the fourth quarter of a woeful effort against the Panthers. The Falcons were shut out. They never passed the 30-yard line. Last season the Panthers gave up the most points in a season in NFL history and they were allowing 26.5 points per game through two games this season. Then they looked like the 1976 Steelers against Penix and the Falcons. Kirk Cousins came in the game and Falcons coach Raheem Morris said the move was made because the game was out of hand. Morris quickly shot down any thought that the move was permanent, but everyone will be watching to see what happens if Penix struggles again. It was reasonable to keep Cousins, even at a high price tag, but it opened up the talk of a quarterback controversy if Penix ever struggled. And he has.\nIt's early this season and early in Penix's career as well, but all of a sudden the results don't look so good. This season he has 605 yards and one touchdown in three games. He has played in eight games, six of them starts, and has completed 58.3% of his passes for 1,380 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions. That's a 75.2 passer rating. The only regular starting quarterback lower than 79.4 last season was Anthony Richardson. Richardson was also the only starter last season to complete less than 60% of his passes. Richardson doesn't have a starting job anymore. And Penix isn't playing at a starting level so far this season.\nIf Penix doesn't improve, he can't be guaranteed to keep his job regardless of his first-round pick pedigree.\n\"I think he just missed his throws today. We won't make excuses for him,\" Morris said, via the team's site. \"We did not play well in any phase, and he did not play well himself, either, and we did not play well around him. We have to play better across the board.\"\nIt's early. Penix had some good moments late last season and played well in the season opener. He's only six games into his career, which is way too early to make any sweeping opinions about what he'll be as a player. But the Falcons need it to look better, and they can't wait around all season for that to happen.\nPanic meter: A little concerning, but let's give it some time\nRavens defense ranks among worst\nThe Ravens have given up the most yards in the NFL. Only one team has given up more points. The Ravens have a great offense and it has resulted in a 1-2 record. Before this season no quarterback had ever lost multiple games in a season when putting up a passer rating of at least 140; Lamar Jackson has had it happen twice already this season, according to NFL researcher Zak Koeppel.\nYou can't win a championship if you don't have a passable defense. Ask Joe Burrow. Do the Ravens have a terrible defense? The one factor to consider is two of their three games have come against elite offenses. The Bills are moving the ball on everyone and the Lions are just fine on offense. Still, not being able to stop either of those teams in the slightest was troubling. The Ravens had a slow start on defense last season and figured it out. They were one of the best defenses in the NFL over the second half of last season. That better happen again if they want to be a Super Bowl contender.\nPanic meter: Probably will correct, but there are some alarms\nTitans flailing\nAfter Week 1, Titans coach Brian Callahan didn't challenge a catch and said afterward that the receiver needed to have a foot in bounds in addition to an elbow, which was incorrect. An NFL coach not knowing a rule like that was stunning. Then came Week 3, when the Titans took"

He recorded 15 total tackles.\nThe move comes a day after Jimmie Ward came off the commissioner\u2019s exempt list \u2014 though Ward was placed on the physically unable to perform list.\nAccording to Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston, Gardner-Johnson\u2019s release comes after there was friction between him and the team behind the scenes. Gardner-Johnson complained about his role, wanted to blitz more, and was critical of his teammates. He also told the Texans that he didn\u2019t want to be traded.\nM.J. Stewart is set to be the next player at the position.\nHouston had traded offensive lineman Kenyon Green to Philadelphia as part of the deal for Gardner-Johnson. Coincidentally, Green was also waived on Monday.\nAt 0-3, the Texans will try to get their first win against the 0-3 Titans on Sunday."

                "body": "C.J. Gardner-Johnson\u2018s time in Houston has proven to be short-lived. The veteran safety is being released, as first reported by NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport.\n2025 has seen Gardner-Johnson serve as a starter for Houston, his fourth career team. The former Saint, Lion and Eagle (on two occasions) enjoyed a highly productive second Philadelphia stint last year. To his surprise, the 27-year-old was traded this offseason in a swap which saw former first-round guard Kenyon Green head the other way.\nThat move appeared to give Houston another veteran presence in the secondary and add further to a defense which faced high expectations entering 2025. That unit has fared well with an average of just 17 points allowed per game, but the Texans are moving on nonetheless. Jalen Mills was recently brought back into the fold as a depth option at safety, while Jimmie Ward was removed from the commissioner\u2019s exempt list yesterday. In the wake of those developments, Gardner-Johnson is being let go.\nFriction with teammates was an issue in this case, Aaron Wilson of KPRC2 reports. Gardner-Johnson criticized other members of the Houston secondary and was unhappy with his role in the team\u2019s scheme, per Wilson. Without even one month in the books, the decision has been made on the team\u2019s part to move on rather than attempting to salvage the situation. Wilson adds a trade request was issued prior to today\u2019s cut.\nTeam and player recently agreed to a restructure, with Gardner-Johnson\u2019s base salary for 2025 being reduced to the veteran minimum in exchange for a conversion to a signing bonus. That spread out guaranteed cap charges over several years, an indication this relationship would continue through at least the remainder of the campaign. Instead, Houston will take on a $5.66MM dead money charge for 2025 as a result of this move.\nMills and (when he is healthy) Ward represent options to take on a starting role at the safety spot. Ward has been a key figure when available during his Texans tenure, but an NFL investigation stemming from domestic violence allegations is ongoing and he is currently on the reserve/PUP list while recovering from offseason ankle surgery. In any case, Calen Bullock is set to remain in place as a safety starter moving forward. M.J. Stewart is currently in line to join him as a first-team presence.\nGardner-Johnson is now set to hit free agency. With two six-interception seasons and four campaigns of at least eight pass deflections to his name, the former fourth-rounder is not lacking in production. Today\u2019s move marks the latest example of a team preferring not to keep him in the fold in spite of that, however. As such, it will be interesting to see if a strong market develops over the near future."
