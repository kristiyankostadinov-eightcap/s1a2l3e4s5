Here's what you should keep in mind when deciding between gold and Bitcoin\nPeter Dazeley/Getty Images\nAs the stock market stumbles into the year\u2019s final stretch and investors brace for another dose of interest rate uncertainty, a big question is resurfacing: When markets fracture, what\u2019s the optimal safe haven?\nTwo high-profile alternative investment options come to mind.\nGold has reclaimed its shine as prices flirt with $4,000 an ounce, while Bitcoin, fresh off a run back above $100,000, is testing whether digital scarcity can outshine the world\u2019s oldest hedge. Both have moved in opposite directions at times, and they're telling a deeper story about where anxious investors are parking their portfolio cash when the traditional stock market playbook stops working.\nIndustry data confirms growing agitation on Wall Street. A new study from Charles Schwab notes that while most traders remain bullish on stocks, 67% also say the market is overvalued (up 10 points from three months ago). Another 57% say that stagflation, the dreaded combination of slow economic growth and persistent inflation, is \u201csomewhat or very likely in the next 18 months,\u201d the study reported.\nHere's what investors should know.\nWeighing the value of gold versus Bitcoin\nOngoing angst about the economy and the stock market is giving both the gold and crypto markets a shot of adrenaline, as the benchmark S&P 500 index fell about 2% over the course of five days.\nHere\u2019s where gold and Bitcoin stand right now.\nGold prices\nAs of late this week, gold prices stood at about $4,000 per troy ounce. Gold had recently crested above the $4,000 mark before retreating moderately as commodity traders weighed the impact of the U.S. dollar, which is tightly tied to gold prices, ongoing inflation concerns, and the Federal Reserve's response. Typically, gold acts as a hedge or \u201cinsurance\u201d in times of uncertainty.\nBitcoin\nThe highest-profile global cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was trading at about $102,000 late this week after losing some ground in recent days. The crypto market is in a holding pattern as investors weigh institutional ETF flows and as some macroeconomic data, such as the monthly jobs report, is in a blackout because of the record-long government shutdown. Investment experts deem Bitcoin a more speculative, higher-volatility \u201cgrowth-oriented\u201d risk asset, and you may allocate differently depending on your risk tolerance.\n\u201cBoth gold and Bitcoin continue to gather momentum but for very different reasons,\u201d said Eric Roach, partner at Summit Metals in Park City, Utah. \u201cGold tends to trade in a non-correlated fashion to the market, where Bitcoin remains much more correlated with the Nasdaq (QQQ). Although Bitcoin has a limited supply, much like safe-haven assets, it trades and acts much more like a technology stock.\u201d\nWhich is the real differentiator?\nIShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a leading Bitcoin ETF, is 37% correlated to the Nasdaq-100 (or QQQ) and the S&P 500. Gold stands at 4%, which means gold is the preferred stock market alternative play. Additionally, the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) ETF is correlated at 20% with the stock market and 74% with gold, providing a slightly more balanced portfolio play than pure gold.\n\u201cAs conditions change relative to a risk versus risk-on trade, the proportion of investment in Bitcoin versus gold will increase,\u201d Roach said. \u201cLikewise, should protecting against risk become your primary driver, then gold stands alone with its highly negative correlation to the stock market.\u201d\nFor investors seeking an ETF strategy for gold and Bitcoin, there are two main drivers to consider: management costs and liquidity. \u201cFor gold investors, the standby GLD ETF works very well, and for Bitcoin, the IBIT ETF commands the lion\u2019s share of the liquidity,\u201d Roach noted.\nWho\u2019s performing better?\nThe data shows safe-haven assets are clearly back "

                "body": "New Delhi: Gold and silver prices went up on Monday, driven by positive global cues and the possibility of the US Fed lowering interest rates next month. At around 10 a.m. on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), the price of the December 5, 2025 contract for gold rose 1.16 per cent to Rs 1,22,468 per 10 grams, and the price of the December 5, 2025 contract for silver rose 1.99 per cent to Rs 1,50,666 per kg.\nGold prices fell after reaching a record high in October. However, the fresh momentum in the yellow metal is being driven by growing concerns about the health of the US economy and the possibility of an interest rate cut next month. According to Rahul Kalantri, Vice President of Commodities at Mehta Equities, prices were highly volatile throughout the week but managed to recover from lower levels after weak US consumer sentiment figures and uncertainty over when the US government shutdown will end.\nThe shutdown has entered a record duration, increasing concerns about the broader U.S. economic outlook, prompting renewed safe-haven demand, he mentioned. Gold and silver also saw gains in the international markets. Gold was up 1.32 per cent at $4,062 per ounce on Comex, and silver up 2.32 percent at $49.26 per ounce.\nMarket watchers further stated that the dollar index softened as well, lending additional support to bullion prices. Gold has support at $3,955-3,920 while resistance at $4,040-4,065. Silver has support at $47.80-47.45 while resistance is at $48.55-48.85. In Indian rupee, gold has support at Rs 1,20,450-1,19,880 while resistance at Rs 1,21,790-1,22,400. Silver has support at Rs 1,46,850-1,45,900 while resistance at Rs 1,48,840, 1,49,780.\nAdditionally, WTI crude regained momentum on Monday, rising past $60 per barrel as traders awaited fresh insight from OPEC and the IEA. However, the broader picture remains mixed: OPEC+ (a coalition of 22 oil-exporting countries) is easing production limits, US producers are ramping up output and expectations of a looming supply surplus continue to weigh on confidence.\nDisclaimer: This story is from the syndicated feed.

Rystad has predicted that global liquids demand will peak in the 2030s at around 107 million barrels per day (bpd), maintain a plateau above 100 million bpd through the 2040s before declining to around 75 million bpd by 2050. According to the Norwegian energy consultancy, non-OPEC+ supply will be key to balancing the global market, with cheap oil from South America helping to offset slower U.S. shale growth. Non-OPEC+ producers are expected to account for around 5.9 million bpd, or nearly 60%, of new conventional oil currently under development through 2030 (total new capacity). South America will be the main source of this supply growth at 560,000 bpd of crude and condensate, with North America supplying ~480,000 bpd.\nRadhika Bansal, VP of Upstream Research at Rystad Energy, said today\u2019s producing wells are on track to deliver less than half of their current output by 2030, a trend that reinforces the need for sustained investment in both new and mature fields. She noted that undeveloped and discovered assets will continue to play a key role in meeting global supply needs through the mid-2030s. While the market could briefly tip into oversupply, Bansal cautioned that \u201cabove-surface risks could trigger delays in project timelines.\u201d She added that South America\u2019s deepwater track record positions it well to provide competitive barrels globally, with continued investment needed as the supply gap is expected to widen after the mid-2030s.\nSource: Rystad Energy\nBrazil is a leading source of production growth, especially from its prolific offshore ultra-deepwater pre-salt oil fields, which boast low break-even costs. Major investments are being made, with several new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) units scheduled to come online in the current year. Brazil's offshore oil production is a major driver of its economy, with production primarily from pre-salt fields like Lula and B\u00fazios, operated mostly by the state-owned company Petrobras (NYSE:PBR). The country has set new production records and continues to increase its output through the development of new platforms and exploration in deepwater fields, though it faces regulatory and infrastructural challenges. The Lula Field is one of Brazil\u2019s most significant offshore projects with estimated reserves of 8.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent(boe); B\u00fazios Field achieved a record 800,000 barrels of oil per day in February 2025, with more platforms being added to increase capacity.\nGuyana's oil production has increased rapidly, surpassing 770,000 barrels per day as of October 2025, primarily from the ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM)-led consortium's projects in the Stabroek Block. This surge was due to the start-up of the Yellowtail development, the fourth floating production vessel (FPSO). Guyana is expected to hit 900,000 bpd once the fourth facility is fully operational, with a long-term goal to eventually produce over one million barrels per day once projects like Uaru and Whiptail come online in 2026 and 2027. Indeed, Exxon says Guyana could be producing nearly 1.3m barrels daily by 2027, making it one of the most prolific per capita producers in the world.\nMeanwhile, Vaca Muerta shale oil production has surged 26% Y/Y to over 447,000 barrels per day, and now accounts for the majority of Argentina's total oil output, according to estimates by Rystad Energy.

Strength in the dollar also weighed on crude.\nBrent oil futures for January rose 0.7% to $64.06 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.7% to $60.03 a barrel by 20:32 ET (01:32 GMT).\nPositive inflation data from top oil importer China also aided sentiment.\nSeveral media reports on Sunday evening suggested that a group of Democrats had reached a deal to back a Republican spending bill to fund the government until January 30, 2026.\nVoting was still underway in a late-Sunday session in the Senate.\nBut the reports drummed up hopes that an end to the worst U.S. government shutdown in history was now in sight.\nThe shutdown had disrupted travel, especially by air, in several major cities, and had ramped up concerns over slowing fuel demand in the country.\nAn end to the shutdown could set the stage for strong air travel during the winter holidays, which is usually positive for oil.\nFocus among oil markets this week will be on monthly reports from two key industry groups\u2013 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the International Energy Administration.\nBoth groups have widely differing outlooks on oil demand and supply in the coming months, although investors use commentary from both reports to gain a clearer picture of oil markets.\nThe OPEC and IEA reports are due on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\nThe OPEC has been a key point of anxiety for oil markets, especially after the producer group hiked output by nearly 3 million barrels per day so far in 2025. These hikes drummed up concerns over a looming supply glut.\nFears of oversupply and weakening global demand, amid sluggish growth, battered oil prices in recent months.\nWritten By: Investing.com\nTrading in financial instruments and/or cryptocurrencies involves high risks including the risk of losing some, or all, of your investment amount, and may not be suitable for all investors.

However, its extraction is highly challenging.\nLocated in the Ordos Basin, Changqing Oilfield accounted for more than half of the country's total shale oil output in 2024, the Xinhua News Agency reported. It boasts proven shale oil reserves exceeding 1 billion tons. This year, the oilfield has accelerated its shale oil production by adding 144 new horizontal wells, achieving a daily output of over 10,000 tons, setting a new record, according to the CCTV News report.\nAccording to the report, a deputy director under the China National Petroleum Corp, the developer, Liu Yicang mentioned that the Changqing Oilfield is set to reach an annual shale oil production level of over 3.5 million tons in 2025. \u201cWe will continue to intensify our efforts in shale oil exploration and development,\u201d Liu said in the interview, adding that the company plans to reach an annual production of 4.5 million tons by 2030, further strengthening China's energy security.\nIt took Changqing Oilfield 12 years to reach a cumulative shale oil output of 10 million tons from the start of its shale oil exploration. However, it only took three years to double that amount to 20 million tons. Currently, Changqing Oilfield's shale oil output accounts for more than half of China's total shale oil production, making it the world's first land-based shale oil field to achieve scaled and efficient development.\nIn 2024, China's total oil and gas output surpassed 400 million tons of oil equivalent for the first time. Crude oil production hit 213 million tons, nearing the historical peak. Shale oil output broke through 6 million tons, up more than 30 percent year-over-year. Shale gas production exceeded 25 billion cubic meters, maintaining steady and sustained growth, official data showed.\nHere we are to serve you with news right now.

                "body": "EUR/USD falls to near 1.1550 as US government shutdown nears resolution\n- EUR/USD edges lower following the news that the US government shutdown is nearing an end.\n- Bloomberg reported centrist Senate Democrats backed a deal to reopen the government and fund key departments for the next year.\n- The Euro may find support from diverging policy outlooks between the ECB and the Federal Reserve.\nEUR/USD depreciates after three days of losses, trading around 1.1550 during the Asian hours on Monday. The pair loses ground as the US Dollar (USD) receives support after Bloomberg reported the record-breaking US government shutdown is nearing an end. A group of centrist Senate Democrats agreed to support a deal to reopen the government and fund some departments and agencies for the next year.\nThe agreement would ensure federal employees receive back pay and allow states to resume delayed federal transfers. It would fund some departments through January 30, while others would receive full-year allocations.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that the US federal shutdown impact getting worse for the economy. Making substantial progress on inflation and expecting prices to come down over the coming months, Bessent added.\nThe US Dollar weakened after consumer sentiment fell to a three-and-a-half-year low amid growing concerns over the government shutdown. The University of Michigan reported on Friday that its Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to 50.3 in November, the lowest since June 2022, down from 53.6 in October and below expectations of 53.2.\nThe EUR/USD pair may regain its ground as the Euro (EUR) could receive support from the diverging policy outlooks between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed). The ECB is expected to keep rates unchanged for some time, with money markets now pricing only a 45% chance of a rate cut by September 2026, down sharply from over 80% in October.\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau emphasized the need to keep policy options open, while Governing Council member Joachim Nagel called for vigilance on inflation. Meanwhile, Vice President Luis de Guindos said any drop in inflation below 2% would likely be temporary.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Service"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Euro to Dollar at 1.1566: Pairs Holds Fragile Recovery as Fed Paralysis and U.S. Shutdown\nAfter sinking to 1.1467, EUR/USD steadies near 1.1566 as missing U.S. data, Fed indecision, and ECB recession fears lock the pair in a 1.1445\u20131.1680 range | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Holds 1.1566 After U.S. Data Blackout, Fed Confusion, and European Stagnation Cloud Direction\nThe EUR/USD pair sits around 1.1566 in late New York trading, recovering modestly from last week\u2019s low of 1.1467, which marked its weakest level since early August. The rebound followed a two-day rally that lifted the pair above the 1.1550 handle, but the tone remains defensive as markets struggle with missing U.S. economic data, confusion around Federal Reserve policy, and deepening signs of stagnation in the Euro Area. After dropping from 1.1730 in mid-October when the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points but failed to signal any clear direction for December, the pair continues to trade inside a compressed range dominated by risk aversion and speculative short-covering.\nU.S. Fiscal Gridlock and Data Void Paralyze Monetary Expectations\nThe ongoing U.S. government shutdown, now stretching past six weeks, has halted the release of Non-Farm Payrolls and CPI data for two consecutive months, leaving traders without official confirmation of growth or inflation trends. This vacuum has paralyzed the Federal Reserve\u2019s guidance and eroded visibility across all dollar-denominated assets. In October the Fed\u2019s statement that it was \u201cdata-dependent\u201d instantly became meaningless, forcing money-market traders to price in only a 30 percent probability of another rate cut in December\u2014down from nearly 70 percent before the blackout.\nAt the same time, corporate America is flashing warning signals: large-scale layoffs at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS (NYSE: UPS), and regional lenders have dented confidence in labor resilience. The absence of official metrics leaves investors relying on alternative datasets that show hiring momentum collapsing to its weakest pace since 2020. This deteriorating U.S. backdrop has weakened the USD Index (DXY) by roughly 1.1 percent over the week, but the euro has struggled to capitalize because of its own growth constraints.\nEurozone Faces Stagnation While ECB Loses Narrative Control\nOn the European side, ECB President Christine Lagarde\u2019s tone has shifted sharply over recent meetings. In early September she declared that \u201cthe disinflationary process is over,\u201d implying the end of rate cuts, but by late October her tone cooled as industrial production and consumer spending data showed contraction in Germany (\u22120.4 percent m/m) and France (\u22120.2 percent). The eurozone composite PMI at 47.9 confirms recessionary momentum.\nInvestors now doubt whether the ECB can hold its deposit rate at 3.75 percent beyond Q1 2026 without risking deflation. The sharp divergence between the ECB\u2019s cautious optimism and hard data has left the euro exposed to yield-differential pressure. The German 10-year Bund yields 1.92 percent, compared with the U.S. 10-year Treasury\u2019s 4.55 percent, widening the carry spread to a three-year extreme of 263 basis points. That gap continues to anchor EUR/USD below 1.1600 despite dollar weakness elsewhere.\nTechnical Picture: 1.1500 Support Defines Market Psychology\nThe 1.1500 level is again the magnetic axis of the pair. It has acted as a pivot for nearly a decade\u2014first as resistance during 2018-2020, then as support after the 2022 energy-crisis rebound. Last week\u2019s dip to 1.1467 triggered heavy buying by European institutions that viewed the level as oversold territory, yet volume analysis shows only short-term positioning rather than genuine reversal flows.\nThe pair remains locked in a sequence of lower highs and lower lows since the Fed\u2019s September 17 decision. The 50-day moving average at 1.1628 caps recovery attempts, while the 200-day average near 1.1370 defines the long-term base. Daily RSI sits near 42, showing mild recovery"

The US Dollar (USD) strengthens against the Pound Sterling (GBP) amid positive signs that the record-breaking US government shutdown may end. Traders will keep an eye on the speech from the Bank of England (BoE) Clare Lombardelli later on Monday.\nBloomberg reported early Monday that the US government shutdown is nearing an end after a group of centrist Senate Democrats agreed to support a deal to reopen the government and fund some departments and agencies for the next year.\nThe source said that federal employees would receive back pay and states would resume delayed federal transfers under the agreement. The measure would fund certain departments through January 30, while others would receive full-year appropriations. Hopes for ending the US government shutdown could provide some support to the US Dollar (USD) and create a headwind for the major pair.\nOn the other hand, renewed US labor market concerns have resulted in a slight increase in investors' expectations, supporting more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) this year. Markets are now pricing in nearly a 66% odds of a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nThe BoE decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.0% last week, citing caution ahead of the UK government\u2019s Autumn Budget in November. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey signaled that rate reductions are coming, with economists now pricing in a pre-Christmas rate cut. The UK central bank cautioned that future rate cuts \u201cwill therefore depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns "

The pair, which hit a seven-month low at 1.2820 earlier this quarter, has staged an aggressive recovery as traders unwind dollar longs amid deteriorating U.S. data and collapsing consumer confidence. Market positioning has shifted sharply, with hedge funds rotating out of the greenback into higher-yield currencies like sterling.\nThe GBP/USD pair opened the week at 1.3045, extended to 1.3162, and is now trading at 1.3115, up roughly 0.55% over the past five sessions. In a single trading day following the BoE announcement, the pound spiked more than 0.8%, touching 1.3100 for the first time since mid-September, driven by aggressive short-covering as rate expectations stabilized.\nBank of England Vote Signals a Controlled Pause, Not a Pivot\nThe BoE Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-3 to maintain rates at 4.00%, marking the second consecutive hold since July. The three dissenters favored another 25 basis-point hike, citing persistent wage inflation near 6.8% YoY and services inflation at 5.4%. Governor Andrew Bailey reiterated that the fight against inflation \u201cis not yet over\u201d but acknowledged that headline CPI has peaked at 3.8% in September, its lowest in nearly two years.\nMarkets interpreted the tone as a \u201chawkish hold.\u201d Sterling traders were quick to price out rate cuts for early 2026, pushing gilt yields higher by 7 bps at the 10-year tenor to 4.19%, while 2-year yields firmed to 4.57%. This yield advantage relative to U.S. Treasuries has supported GBP/USD\u2019s climb above the 1.3100 threshold, despite broader market risk aversion.\nU.S. Dollar Index Collapses Under Shutdown Pressure and Weak Data\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slumped below the critical 101.00 level, its weakest since April, as prolonged fiscal gridlock in Washington delayed key data releases including Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI). Without fresh macro indicators, traders extrapolated from weaker-than-expected private surveys: U.S. job growth slowed to just 95,000 in October, while consumer sentiment (U-Mich) fell to 60.4, its lowest since 2023.\nTreasury yields plunged in sympathy, with the 10-year yield dropping 19 bps to 4.41%, and the 2-year yield sliding 22 bps to 4.65%, compressing the yield differential that previously favored the dollar. The market now sees only a 34% probability of another Fed rate cut by March, down from 56% two weeks ago. This collapse in rate premium directly weakened USD across the board, driving EUR/USD to 1.1600 and GBP/USD beyond 1.3150.\nSterling Strength Backed by Macro Stability and Fiscal Discipline\nSterling\u2019s rise is not purely a dollar story. The UK\u2019s Q3 GDP flatlined at 0.0% QoQ, narrowly avoiding contraction, but services output grew 0.3%, powered by financial and IT sectors. The Budget Office forecasts 1.1% growth in 2026, while wage growth outpaces inflation for the first time since 2021. Fiscal discipline remains tight\u2014public sector borrowing in September came in \u00a31.2 billion below projections, easing pressure on the Treasury and calming bond markets after the volatility of 2022.\nThe combination of a stable macro backdrop and moderating inflation has restored credibility to the pound.

Traders lacked fresh CPI and PPI data releases as the Senate gridlock postponed key economic indicators that could define the Federal Reserve\u2019s December rate decision. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 70% probability of a 25-basis-point cut, up from 63% a week earlier. Yet, the U.S. Dollar Index remains supported near 105.1, reflecting underlying resilience driven by stronger ISM Services PMI at 53.2 and better-than-expected ADP private payrolls showing 42,000 new jobs against expectations of 32,000. The divergence between robust U.S. services activity and weak manufacturing, which contracted at 47.8, keeps dollar sentiment conflicted. For USD/JPY, the absence of inflation data means policy clarity remains elusive \u2014 traders are instead following Fed speeches from John Williams, Christopher Waller, and Lorie Logan to gauge the direction of rates before the Dec. 10 FOMC meeting.\nBoJ Balances Yen Weakness and Wage Pressures Ahead of 2026 Policy Reset\nOn the Japanese side, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) faces a tightening conundrum. Its Summary of Opinions, released Nov 10, is expected to reveal a growing internal split. Two policymakers already favored a rate hike in October, breaking years of ultra-loose stance. Inflation remains steady at 3.0% YoY, down from 3.3% in August, while real wages fell 1.4% YoY in September.

While unemployment rate rose more than expected in September (4.5% from 4.3% prior), RBA noted that its other labour market indicators continued to signal underlying tightness.\nWhile a hawkish on hold decision would typically boost AUD/USD, its fall last week was the result of a sharp deterioration in global risk sentiment, with high-beta Nasdaq 100 plunging 3.09% \u2013 its worst week since April \u2013 dragging risk-sensitive currencies lower.\nUS government reopening and China optimism strengthen outlook\nAUD/USD has kicked off the new week on a stronger footing, currently trading 25 pips (0.40%) higher at 0.6520, buoyed by cautious comments on inflation and growth from RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser this morning, plus positive developments in both US and China.\nIn US, imminent reopening of government after a 40-day shutdown is a welcome boost, restoring pay to 800,000 federal workers and restarting vital programs that will lift consumer confidence, activity and spending. This should also help improve risk sentiment across markets, including for risk currencies such as AUD/USD.\nMeanwhile in China, optimism is building on two fronts: US investment bank Goldman Sachs recently raised its China gross domestic product (GDP) growth projections to 4.8% for 2026 (from 4.3% previously), and to 4.7% for 2025 (up from 4.0% previously).\nOctober consumer price index (CPI) data released over the weekend exceeded expectations, signalling a tentative stabilisation in consumer prices after months of deflationary pressures. Core CPI (excluding food and energy) hit 1.2% year-on-year (YoY) \u2013 the highest in 20 months \u2013 up from 1.0% in September.\nLooking ahead, key local driver for AUD/USD this week will be Thursday\u2019s Australian labour force report.\nEmployment\nDate: Thursday, 13 November at 11.30am AEDT\nFor September, employment in Australia rose by 14,900 jobs, falling short of the 20,000 gain market expected. Unemployment rate surged to 4.5% from 4.3%, as participation rate increased from 66.9% to 67%.\nThis marked the highest jobless rate since November 2021, reinforcing evidence of a softening labour market \u2013 a trend we expect to persist into 2026, and one we think will compel further RBA easing.\nOctober preview: Consensus expects a rise of 20,000 jobs, and for unemployment rate to ease to 4.4%. In-line data should keep RBA on hold, but a 4.5% or 4.6% print would sharply raise odds of a 25 basis point (bp) cut in coming months.\nAustralian interest rate market is currently pricing in 3.5 bp of easing for RBA\u2019s December meeting, and about 18 bp of cuts by June 2026.\nAU unemployment rate chart\nAUD/USD technical analysis\nAfter hitting a high of 0.6617 at end of October, AUD/USD slipped lower last week, before steadying ahead of a band of important medium-term support at 0.6450 - 0.6415 (coming from August lows and 200-day moving average).\nProviding AUD/USD remains above 0.6450 - 0.6415 support band, allow for it to retest resistance at 0.6620 - 0.6630, which has capped rallies in AUD/USD for past six weeks.\nAware that if AUD/USD were to first see a sustained break of support at 0.6445 - 0.6415, it would open the way for a deeper decline initially towards 0.6300.\nAUD/USD daily chart\n- Source: TradingView.

Their updated forecasts suggest just a single rate cut in 2026, and likely closer to the second half than the first. While some are speculating that the RBA\u2019s next rate change will now be a hike, I am not in that camp and still suspect a cut will arrive. Even if it is just the one. The RBA think the rise of inflation is temporary, so bets of another cut could be revived if quarterly inflation behaves itself, though we\u2019ll need to wait until January to see those figures.\nView related analysis:\n- EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD Outlook: Euro Dominates Commodity Currencies\n- 153 Remains Pivotal For USD/JPY, AUD/USD Stabilises with Wall Street Bounce\n- US Dollar Probes 6-Month High, AUD/USD Steady Into RBA\n- Australian Dollar Outlook: RBA, US ISM and ADP In Focus\nAustralian Dollar Performance\n- AUD/USD snapped a three-week winning streak after the RBA held rates steady and lowered its easing outlook to just one cut next year.\n- AUD/NZD climbed to a ten-year high as the New Zealand dollar weakened following a soft employment report, which boosted odds of a 50bp RBNZ cut in December.\n- AUD/JPY erased the prior week\u2019s gains, forming a mild bearish engulfing candle as the Japanese yen emerged as the strongest FX major of the week.\n- The Australian dollar also lost ground to the euro (EUR/AUD +1%), British pound (GBP/AUD +0.8%), Canadian dollar (AUD/CAD \u20130.6%), and Swiss franc (AUD/CHF \u20130.6%).\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nAustralia This Week: Economic Data and Events for AUD/USD Traders\nAustralia\u2019s Jobless Rate in Focus\nThe labour force report is Australia\u2019s biggest economic event on Thursday. While the RBA had inflation as the bigger factor over any rate change decision ahead of last week\u2019s meeting, they will surely take notice if the unemployment rate rises by another 0.2 percentage points.\nUnemployment rose 0.2pp to a 4-year high of 4.5% in August. Their updated forecasts have the UE rate at 4.4% through to December 2027. Given the past four changes to the UE rate over the past ten months have been to the upside, the last two of which at 0.2pp, it is fair to say the jobless rate is increasingly at a faster rate. And a 4.7% print would be hard to ignore as it could reignite bets of an RBA cut.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: ABS, LSEG\nUS Inflation Could Gently Rise\nUS inflation seems more likely to creep higher than delivery a surprise miss this week. Both headline inflation and core CPI rose to 3% y/y in August, below the 3.1% expected, though from the limited data available amid the US government shutdown, gentle inflationary forces remain at play. ISM non-manufacturing rose to an 8-month high and the \u2018prices paid\u2019 component rose to a near 3-year high of 70. This should help support the US dollar and taper hopes of a December Fed cut. Especially since Jerome Powell has set a high bar for a December rate cut.\nAUD/USD Correlations\n- The rolling correlation between the Australian and New Zealand dollars masks the fact that AUD/NZD climbed to a ten-year high, rising for eleven consecutive sessions by Friday\u2019s close.\n- The typically inverse relationship between the US dollar and AUD/USD is now almost non-existent on the 10- and 20-day timeframes, though it remains firmly negative over the 60-day period.\n- Correlation with copper remains strong on both the 10- and 20-day lookbacks, while WTI crude oil and iron ore also show solid short-term alignment with the Aussie.\n- Risk appetite continues to be a major driver, with strong positive correlations between the Australian dollar, the S&P 500, and SPI 200 (ASX 200 futures).\n- Meanwhile, the positive correlation between the Aussie and Chinese yuan (CNH) has weakened notably over the past two weeks.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - Source: LSEG\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe Australian dollar snapped a three-week winning streak, "

                "body": "The Bank of Japan\u2019s Summary of Opinions took center stage on Monday, November 10, spotlighting USD/JPY amid ongoing speculation about a near-term rate hike.\nRecent wage growth figures had tempered bets on a December BoJ rate hike, sending USD/JPY higher. However, Japanese government threats of a yen intervention have capped any USD/JPY upside. Lawmakers and the BoJ have raised concerns over the weaker yen pushing import prices higher, affecting Japanese households\u2019 purchasing power. Household spending remains a focal point for the BoJ, given that private consumption accounts for around 55% of GDP.\nThe highly anticipated Summary of Opinions provided insights into policymakers\u2019 views on the Japanese economy, inflation, and conditions needed to hike interest rates.\nNotably, some policymakers were less concerned about the effect of US tariffs on the Japanese economy. One policymaker stated:\n\u201cEven if the impact of U.S. tariff policy becomes pronounced, the expected scale of the impact has become smaller than it was before. Therefore, it is also likely that Japan\u2019s economic growth will not be too modest. As a baseline scenario, Japan\u2019s economy is expected to continue to grow at a pace slightly above its potential growth rate in both fiscal 2025 and 2026.\u201c\nMeanwhile, there was some uncertainty over the effect of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s policies on the economy and prices.\nOn prices, the BoJ had mixed views. Several policymakers called for close monitoring of wages, household income, and spending trends. However, the general consensus was that inflation would pick up, with the 2026 Shunto wage increases likely to deliver price stability, crucial for a rate hike.\nNevertheless, the BoJ was more divided on monetary policy, suggesting further delays to raising interest rates, weighing on the yen.\nOne policymaker called for the close monitoring of the effects of trade policy on the global economy, the Fed\u2019s rate path, and prices and wages. Another called for time to assess US trade policy and the new Japanese government\u2019s economic policies.\nFor context, just five of the thirteen opinions given on monetary policy had a more hawkish tone. The lack of a clear majority for rate hikes suggested that monetary policy tightening could be delayed further, weighing on the yen.\nOverall, the divergence between the BoJ\u2019s cautious stance and the Fed\u2019s easing bias remains the key driver of near-term USD/JPY direction.\nWhile the BoJ Summary of Opinions gave insights into the conditions needed for a rate hike, developments on Capitol Hill will also influence USD/JPY trends. Reports of lawmakers nearing an agreement on a federal budget lifted demand for the US dollar.\nThe Kobeissi Letter commented on the US Senate impasse nearing an end, stating:\n\u201cUS Congress is reportedly close to reaching a deal to reopen the government after Senate Democrats signaled they are ready to back a bipartisan proposal. At least 10 Democrats are expected to support advancing a spending and short-term funding bill.\u201d\nThe Kobeissi Letter added:\n\u201cA short-term funding bill is now expected to receive enough support to reopen the US government through January 31st. The measure would provide full-year funding for SNAP and Veterans Affairs.\u201d\nUSD/JPY rose 0.25% to 153.796 in early trading on Monday, November 10. A reopening would limit the shutdown\u2019s impact on the US economy. Furthermore, a reopening could expedite the release of key inflation and labor market data ahead of the Fed\u2019s December interest rate decision. The data would provide FOMC members with the necessary information to make an informed policy decision.\nWhile market focus will be on Capitol Hill, traders should closely monitor FOMC members\u2019 speeches. Views on inflation, the labor market, and the economic outlook will influence sentiment toward the Fed rate path.\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chances of a Fed rate cut in December were finely balanced, rising from 63.0% on October 31 to 66.9% on November 7.

After touching an eight-month peak near \u00a5154.48, the dollar-yen cross reversed as Japanese officials expressed \u201chigh urgency\u201d over the yen\u2019s depreciation, while mixed U.S. data left the greenback struggling to maintain momentum. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama\u2019s warning that \u201crapid, one-sided moves\u201d would not be tolerated signaled direct readiness for market action, cooling speculative longs above \u00a5154.25 and reinforcing near-term resistance at \u00a5155.00.\nFed Policy Fog and the U.S. Government Shutdown Pressure USD/JPY\nThe ongoing U.S. government shutdown, now in its 39th day, continues to distort policy expectations. Traders lacked fresh CPI and PPI data releases as the Senate gridlock postponed key economic indicators that could define the Federal Reserve\u2019s December rate decision. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 70% probability of a 25-basis-point cut, up from 63% a week earlier. Yet, the U.S. Dollar Index remains supported near 105.1, reflecting underlying resilience driven by stronger ISM Services PMI at 53.2 and better-than-expected ADP private payrolls showing 42,000 new jobs against expectations of 32,000. The divergence between robust U.S. services activity and weak manufacturing, which contracted at 47.8, keeps dollar sentiment conflicted. For USD/JPY, the absence of inflation data means policy clarity remains elusive \u2014 traders are instead following Fed speeches from John Williams, Christopher Waller, and Lorie Logan to gauge the direction of rates before the Dec. 10 FOMC meeting.\nBoJ Balances Yen Weakness and Wage Pressures Ahead of 2026 Policy Reset\nOn the Japanese side, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) faces a tightening conundrum. Its Summary of Opinions, released Nov 10, is expected to reveal a growing internal split. Two policymakers already favored a rate hike in October, breaking years of ultra-loose stance. Inflation remains steady at 3.0% YoY, down from 3.3% in August, while real wages fell 1.4% YoY in September. Unions such as Rengo and UA Zensen are demanding 5\u20136% wage increases during the 2026 spring negotiations, heightening pressure on the BoJ to raise rates sooner. Governor Kazuo Ueda has acknowledged the need for stronger wage-driven inflation before tightening but faces political pressure from the Finance Ministry to stem import-driven price surges. Producer prices, forecast to rise 2.5% YoY in October versus 2.7% in September, could reinforce dovish positioning if confirmed, although a surprise uptick could reprice BoJ expectations rapidly.\nTechnical Structure Shows USD/JPY at Crossroads\nTechnically, USD/JPY trades above both the 50-day EMA at \u00a5152.80 and the 200-day EMA at \u00a5150.50, sustaining a bullish medium-term structure.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) retreats from an over one-week high amid the uncertainty over the timing of the next interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The BoJ Summary of Opinions will be released later on Monday.\nJapan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is reportedly looking to finalize an economic stimulus package of around $65 billion to address inflation and growth by late November and pass a supplementary budget to fund it. Additionally, the Japanese central bank remains reluctant to commit to further rate hikes.\nNonetheless, Minutes from the BoJ\u2019s September meeting revealed that an increasing number of policymakers at the central bank believed that conditions were falling into place for interest rates to rise, with two members calling for an immediate hike. Board members noted that the BoJ may be able to return to a stance of raising interest rates, as the 2% price stability target has been more or less achieved.\nUS consumer sentiment was near a three-and-a-half-year low as the government shutdown fuels anxiety, which could exert some selling pressure on the Greenback against the JPY. The University of Michigan (UoM) reported on Friday that its Consumer Sentiment Index declined to 50.3 in November, the lowest level since June 2022, from a final reading of 53.6 in October. This figure came in weaker than the expectation of 53.2.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other currencies seen as more risky to invest in.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The Loonie pair faces selling pressure as the Canadian Dollar (CAD) broadly outperforms its peers, except antipodeans, following the release of the upbeat Canada labour market data for October on Friday.\nCanadian Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Canadian Dollar (CAD) against listed major currencies today. Canadian Dollar was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Canadian Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent CAD (base)/USD (quote).\nStatistics Canada reported that the economy surprisingly created 66.6K fresh jobs, while it was expected to show a reduction in the labour force by 2.5K. In September, employers hired 60.4K fresh workers.\nThe Unemployment Rate also decelerated to 6.9% after staying steady in the last two months at 7.1%, which is the highest level seen since July 2021.\nSigns of improving job market conditions are expected to have provided some relief to Bank of Canada (BoC) officials and would dampen market expectations of more interest rate cuts in the near term.\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar (USD) trades broadly calm on hopes that the historically longest 40-day United States (US) government shutdown will end soon.\nAccording to a Reuters report, Senators expect to vote Sunday night on advancing a House-passed bill that will be amended to combine the short-term funding measure, which would fund the government through January 2026, with a package of three full-year appropriations bills.\nSuch a scenario would improve the US consumer sentiment, which was impacted significantly due to the longest federal shutdown.\nOn Friday, the preliminary Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index came in at 50.3 in November, the lowest figure seen in three-and-a-half years. Investors expected the data to come in lower at 53.2 from the prior release of 53.6.\nUS Dollar FAQs\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard po"

This is a sign that the second-largest\nQuick overview\n- Ethereum is currently trading above $3,600, marking a 7% increase in the last 24 hours.\n- Bullish signals in the derivatives market indicate strong institutional interest, with a significant majority of options betting on price increases.\n- The upcoming Fusaka upgrade on December 3rd is expected to enhance Ethereum's scalability and efficiency, potentially driving demand.\n- Analysts predict that Ethereum could reach $6,000 by the end of the year if it breaks key resistance levels and capitalizes on positive market momentum.\nEthereum ETH/USD is trading above $3,600 right now, which is a rise of almost 7% in the last 24 hours. This is a sign that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is getting stronger again. Even while it is still 28% below its all-time high of $4,946, a mix of bullish derivatives positioning, whale accumulation, and an imminent network upgrade is making some hopeful that it could reach $6,000 by the end of the year.\nETH Derivatives Markets Flash Strong Bullish Signals\nThe futures and options markets for Ethereum are very positive. Total open interest in futures has grown to about $40.11 billion across all exchanges, which is almost 11.5 million ETH in total exposure. Binance has the most open interest at $8.15 billion, while CME is close behind with $7.57 billion. This shows that more institutions are getting involved in the ETH market.\nThe options market tells an even better story. Calls make up 65.05% of all open interest right now, while puts only make up 34.95%. There are almost 2.1 million ETH in call options and 1.13 million ETH in puts. This skew shows that traders are betting heavily on price increases instead of protecting themselves against price drops.\nThe most popular contracts on Deribit, the biggest crypto options exchange, are call options for December 2025 with strike prices of $6,000, $5,000, and $4,000. This shows that people are very sure that the value of these options will go up in the future. The peak pain point, when the most options lose value, is between $3,300 and $3,600. This means that a short-term consolidation around the mid-$3,000s is likely to happen before a big breakout.\nETH/USD Technical Setup Suggests V-Shaped Recovery Pattern\nFrom a technical point of view, Ethereum is starting to look like it is going through a traditional V-shaped recovery after dropping to $3,098 in early November. ETH started the month at $3,856 and briefly threatened to drop below $3,000 on November 4. However, it quickly bounced back and rose above the 200-day Simple Moving Average of $3,335.\nTrader Tardigrade, a technical expert, has found a bullish pattern that has happened before large upward advances in the past. $3,572 is the most important level to watch. If this resistance turns into support, it might mean that ETH is ready to attack the 50-day SMA at $3,981 and maybe even rise above $4,000.\nThe current long/short ratio of 2.8 demonstrates that only 26.3% of traders are betting against ETH, further bolstering the bullish argument. Big players are paying attention. Justin Sun staked 45,000 ETH worth $154.5 million on November 5th, and the next day, Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee bought $70 million worth of ETH.\nEthereum Gas Fee Paradox: Boon for Users, Concern for Network Economics\nTraders are happy about the recent price movement, but Ethereum has a fundamental problem that could affect its long-term value. Network gas fees have dropped to record lows of only 0.067 Gwei. The average swap costs only $0.11, and NFT sales cost $0.19.\nThis is a huge change from the bull run in 2021, when transaction fees may go over $150 during times of high traffic. The drop in fees\u2014down 99% since the March 2024 Dencun upgrade\u2014has made it much harder for Ethereum to make"

The dollar index\u2019s rally has stalled, and borrowing from the Federal Reserve\u2019s standing repo facility has dropped to zero.

Yet most of that institutional participation still happens off-chain.\nAs Annabelle Huang of Altius Labs wrote recently in a CoinDesk op-ed, crypto\u2019s largest investors continue to buy exposure through ETFs rather than directly on-chain, as they are not yet confident that the infrastructure meets Wall Street standards of reliability, keeping the market\u2019s liquidity and transparency potential only partially realized.\nIn a note to CoinDesk, market maker Enflux wrote the shift reflects a broader evolution in crypto itself, as speculative trading gives way to professional infrastructure and mainstream financial integration.\n\u201cWhen the Fed injects, Bitcoin rallies; when yields twitch, it falls,\u201d the firm said. \u201cThe dream of decoupling is gone for now, and what\u2019s left of the market will either professionalize or disappear.\u201d\nMore For You\nInside Zcash: Encrypted Money at Planetary Scale\nA deep dive into Zcash's zero-knowledge architecture, shielded transaction growth, and its path to becoming encrypted Bitcoin at scale.\nWhat to know:\nIn 2025, Zcash evolved from niche privacy tech into a functioning encrypted-money network:\n- Shielded adoption surged, with 20\u201325% of circulating ZEC now held in encrypted addresses and 30% of transactions involving the shielded pool.\n- The Zashi wallet made shielded transfers the default, pushing privacy from optional to standard practice.\n- Project Tachyon, led by Sean Bowe, aims to boost throughput to thousands of private transactions per second.\n- Zcash surpassed Monero in market share, becoming the largest privacy-focused cryptocurrency by capitalization.\nMore For You\nDogecoin Surges 6% as Trump Promised $2K Stimulus Brings Back 2021-Era DOGE, SHIB Rally Vibes\nFormer President Trump's comments on tariffs spurred interest in speculative assets, boosting meme coin sentiment.\nWhat to know:\n- Dogecoin surged 5.2% to $0.1811, breaking through the $0.1800 resistance as institutional buying increased.\n- Former President Trump's comments on tariffs spurred interest in speculative assets, boosting meme coin sentiment.\n- DOGE's breakout was supported by a 180% increase in trading volume, indicating strong institutional accumulation."

This comparison breaks down their costs, returns, risks, and key characteristics to help clarify which may align better for investors with different priorities.\nSnapshot (cost & size)\nHODL is slightly more affordable, with a 0.20% expense ratio compared to IBIT\u2019s 0.25% (as reported by Financial Modeling Prep). However, IBIT\u2019s AUM is significantly larger.\nWhat's inside\nIBIT\u2019s primary holding is bitcoin, with small amounts of cash also included.\u2014reflecting its goal to match bitcoin\u2019s price performance.

There are no embedded quirks or leverage resets to watch for.\nHODL, from VanEck, is similarly straightforward with just one holding: bitcoin, accounting for 100% of assets. Sector breakdowns are not reported, but like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, the VanEck Bitcoin ETF tracks the price of bitcoin passively and has no notable quirks or added complexity. Both funds are designed for pure bitcoin exposure, differing mainly in size, liquidity, and fee structure.\nFor more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link.\nFoolish take\nExchange-traded funds with larger assets under management tend to offer lower expense ratios than smaller funds that can't employ economies of scale. That is not the case with these two Bitcoin ETFs. The VanEck Bitcoin ETF is waiving all sponsor fees for the first $2.5 billion of the trust's assets through Jan. 10, 2026.\nAs of Nov. 3, 2025, the VanEck Bitcoin ETF had a market value of $1.96 billion, so there's still time to scoop up shares of the ETF without paying any fees. After Jan. 10, the fund will charge a 0.2% fee. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF manages over $85.3 billion worth of Bitcoin but it has a relatively large 0.25% expense ratio.\nDespite charging a larger fee, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF isn\u2019t delivering a more impressive performance. During the 12 months ended Nov. 4, 2025, it rose by 45.16%. Over the same time frame, the VanEck Bitcoin ETF delivered a slightly better 45.47% return.\nGlossary\nETF (Exchange-Traded Fund): An investment fund traded on stock exchanges, holding assets like stocks or commodities.\nSpot bitcoin exposure: Direct investment in bitcoin, aiming to match its current market price without using derivatives.\nAssets Under Management (AUM): The total market value of assets that a fund manages on behalf of investors.\nExpense ratio: The annual fee, as a percentage of assets, that a fund charges to cover operating costs.\nBeta: A measure of a fund's volatility compared to the overall market; higher beta means greater risk and potential return.\nMax drawdown: The largest percentage drop from a fund\u2019s peak value to its lowest point over a specific period.\nLiquidity: How easily an asset or fund can be bought or sold without affecting its price.\nPassive tracking: A strategy where a fund aims to replicate the performance of a specific index or asset, rather than outperform it.\nLeverage reset: The process of adjusting a leveraged fund\u2019s exposure, typically daily, to maintain a set leverage ratio."

                "body": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs are posting their heaviest withdrawals since May, signaling a clear shift in institutional positioning as risk conditions tighten across global markets.\nCryptoQuant data shows redemptions have climbed to roughly $2.3 billion from their recent peak, reversing a month-long stretch of inflows.\nBitcoin ETFs Face Sharpest Withdrawals in Months\nAccording to SoSo Value data, the weekly outflows from the Bitcoin ETFs underscore the shift.\nIn the last seven days, the spot Bitcoin ETFs shed nearly $2 billion, one of their steepest weekly declines since the products launched.\nNotably, the selling has been concentrated in a handful of large BTC investment vehicles of BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC. However, that total flow pressure is broad enough to suggest a wider retreat rather than isolated rebalancing among specific funds.\nMeanwhile, the current pace places redemptions at a six-month high. In May, investors pulled more than $4.8 billion from spot ETFs amid heightened volatility and a rapid repricing in derivatives.\nWhile conditions are less chaotic than earlier in the year, the flow pattern shows investors reducing risk. Rising Treasury yields are pulling professional allocators toward assets with more predictable income.\nIndeed, the US 10-year yield has risen sharply in recent weeks, and that shift has historically dampened demand for high-beta assets. Bitcoin typically weakens in these periods as investors rotate toward instruments with clearer yield profiles.\nBitcoin Price Stalls\nBitcoin\u2019s own price action reinforces the trend. According to BeInCrypto data, the asset has declined by approximately 16% since early October and trades at $101,804 as of press time.\nMuch of the drawdown occurred after the October 10 liquidation cascade, which wiped roughly $20 billion in market value and forced leveraged traders to reduce their exposure.\nThat shift reset positioning across perpetual futures and options, and the subsequent cooling in ETF demand reflects continued defensive posturing.\nAnalysts say the flow-price dynamic has become more pronounced as ETFs take on a larger share of market-moving liquidity. Heavy redemptions force issuers to unwind their underlying Bitcoin holdings, adding incremental selling pressure during periods of muted risk appetite.\nConversely, inflows tend to stabilize markets by absorbing spot supply. This structural link has made ETF flows a real-time gauge of institutional conviction\u2014and a key driver of short-term price behavior.\nStill, the latest withdrawals do not yet resemble capitulation. Portfolio managers appear to be rotating into duration-sensitive instruments rather than abandoning digital assets outright."

                "body": "Low Ethereum gas fees, recently hitting a record low of 0.067 Gwei, could be a double-edged sword for crypto enthusiasts. On one hand, they provide a much-needed respite from high transaction costs. This translates into savings for traders and everyday users alike, allowing for smoother asset transfers, token swaps, and DeFi protocol interactions. Users can now dabble with dApps without the heavy financial toll that often accompanies transactions, particularly if they are of lower value.\nOn the other hand, lower fees could invite more users into the crypto arena, as financial barriers diminish. This trend is promising, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe, who might take full advantage of these reduced costs to enhance their financial operations and integrate crypto solutions into their business systems.\nHow Do Low Fees Affect Ethereum's Revenue Model?\nThe downside to the drop in fees is the question of Ethereum's economic sustainability. Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) model depends significantly on transaction fees and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) to reward validators and secure the network. If fees dwindle, so too does the revenue available for validators, potentially threatening their economic motivations.\nThis situation presents a conundrum for Ethereum developers and the ecosystem at large. If the network operates at ultra-low gas fees for an extended period, it may find itself unable to fund ongoing development or maintain robust security. A decline in fees could indicate waning demand for the network or a temporary lull in activity, which could have serious long-term consequences for Ethereum\u2019s future.\nIs the Decline in Fees a Sign of Network Efficiency or Market Weakness?\nThe drop in Ethereum gas fees can be viewed through two lenses. It might indicate an improved network efficiency, thanks to recent upgrades and the growth of Layer 2 solutions that handle numerous transactions off-chain. These enhancements could boost scalability and lessen congestion, resulting in lower transaction costs.\nConversely, the fee drop might reflect a decrease in market interest. If the network isn't witnessing a rise in usage or new projects, low fees could mean a lack of enthusiasm or investment in the ecosystem. This dual interpretation complicates the analysis of low gas fees, emphasizing the importance for stakeholders to observe network activity closely.\nWhat Strategies Can SMEs Use to Leverage Low Gas Fees?\nFor crypto-friendly SMEs in Europe, the drop in gas fees represents a unique opportunity to refine their financial operations. Here are some practical strategies they can employ:\n-\nIncorporate Multi-Coin Payment Gateways: SMEs should consider adopting payment processors supporting various low-fee cryptocurrencies, like XRP, SOL, and USDC. This flexibility allows for adaptability as network conditions change, optimizing transaction costs.\n-\nLeverage Stablecoins for Payroll: Using stablecoins or low-fee tokens for payroll enables SMEs to attract tech-savvy talent and market themselves as modern employers. This tactic not only cuts costs but also boosts operational efficiency.\n-\nInvestigate B2B Crypto Platforms: Using platforms designed for business-to-business crypto payments can streamline operations and save costs. These platforms typically offer lower fees and quicker settlement times, ideal for SMEs aiming to enhance their financial processes.\n-\nEncourage Crypto Adoption: Offering cashback or loyalty rewards in cryptocurrency can foster engagement with the business and promote broader cryptocurrency usage.\n-\nDiversify Reserve Holdings: Storing a portion of reserves in stablecoins or low-volatility assets can help SMEs shield against fiat currency risks and facilitate rapid, cost-effective transactions.\nWhat Are the Challenges of Adopting Crypto Solutions?\nWhile low gas fees present opportunities, SMEs must contend with several obstacles when embracing crypto solutions:\n-\nVolatility Management: "

Institutional buying near $3,200 offsets $507M ETF outflows and a 24% TVL crash as traders eye the Fusaka upgrade | That's TradingNEWS\nEthereum (ETH-USD) Struggles at $3,517 as ETF Outflows, Weak DeFi Metrics, and Whale Accumulation Split Market Direction\nEthereum (ETH-USD) trades around $3,517, rising 3.7% in 24 hours after sliding 11% earlier in the week when prices briefly tested $3,130. Despite the short-term rebound, ETH remains trapped inside a corrective phase that began when the token failed to hold the $3,900\u2013$4,000 zone. The correction erased nearly $400 billion in total crypto market capitalization, mirroring weakness in equities after a 4% Nasdaq decline. Global uncertainty, cautious derivatives positioning, and weak ETF demand have left Ethereum under pressure, even as large investors quietly accumulate at multi-month lows.\nETF Outflows and Derivatives Data Show Defensive Positioning\nEthereum\u2019s U.S.-listed ETFs logged $507 million in net outflows during November, marking the steepest withdrawal streak since launch. Open interest on futures remains elevated, yet the annualized premium sits at 4%, below the normal 5\u201310% range, confirming a muted appetite for long leverage. This positioning reflects hesitation rather than capitulation\u2014traders are maintaining exposure but hedging aggressively against further downside.\nSentiment weakened further after the University of Michigan consumer expectations index hit its second-lowest level since 1978, coinciding with the longest U.S. government shutdown on record. Macro fear has spilled into digital assets, forcing funds to reduce beta exposure and increasing correlations between ETH-USD and traditional risk indices.\nOn-Chain Weakness: TVL and DApp Revenues Shrink\nThe total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum has fallen 24% in 30 days, sliding to $74 billion, the lowest since July. The decline accelerated following the $120 million Balancer v2 exploit, which shook confidence across DeFi liquidity pools. At the same time, Ethereum DApp revenues dropped 18% month-over-month to $80.7 million in October, pressuring staking yields and reducing burn activity from gas fees. Lower network congestion means fewer tokens are removed from circulation, weakening the supply-burn narrative that has supported Ethereum\u2019s long-term bullish case.\nNetwork Activity Stabilizes as Rivals Cool\nDespite revenue contraction, early November data show active Ethereum addresses up 5% week-over-week and transactions rising 2%, while Tron (TRX) and BNB Chain (BNB) both posted declines in activity. These upticks suggest user retention even in a cooling market. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade, scheduled for early December, aims to improve scalability and security efficiency, with developers targeting a 15\u201320% reduction in gas costs and enhanced validator throughput.\nTraders view Fusaka as the next technical catalyst after Shanghai and Dencun, although confidence will depend on post-launch stability and staking yield recovery above 3.5%.\nInstitutional Accumulation Reshapes Sentiment\nWhile retail flows remain defensive, institutional investors and whales have turned increasingly active. A single whale associated with Aave accumulated 394,682 ETH (~$1.37 billion) last week, according to on-chain analytics, the largest single accumulation since Q2 2024. Over $222 million in ETH left centralized exchanges during the same period, signaling long-term holding rather than short-term speculation. This pattern mirrors 2020 accumulation phases that preceded 4\u00d7 rallies within twelve months.\nInstitutional desks report rising demand for spot ETH custody, especially from Asian family offices and DeFi-fund hybrid portfolios seeking exposure at technical support zones between $3,100\u2013$3,200.\nTechnical Picture: Support Cluster at $3,130\u2013$3,200\nThe $3,130\u2013$3,200 band coincides w"

Reaching an astonishing $14 billion in on-chain liquidity, Solana asserts itself as a chief contender, trailing only Ethereum and TRON. But what does this remarkable ascent signify for the future of stablecoins and the ever-shifting currents of liquidity?\nThe Secret Sauce Behind Solana's Success\nUnmatched Speed and Affordability\nAt the heart of Solana's accomplishments lies its blockchain technology\u2014swift and cost-effective, it disrupts the norms of the industry. This rare blend of speed and low transaction fees positions Solana as the go-to option for stablecoin transfers. When network activity spikes, Solana proves its worth, ensuring projects can launch without the cumbersome delays experienced on traditional platforms. With its infrastructure continuously fine-tuned, Solana stands ready to grasp an even greater share of the market.\nDynamic On-Chain Liquidity Management\nWhen it comes to managing on-chain liquidity, Solana and its rivals operate on entirely different wavelengths. The ability for fast capital turnovers positions Solana favorably, especially as institutional interest escalates. This efficient liquidity movement crafts a compelling environment that draws DeFi protocols and startups eager to leverage Solana\u2019s advantages over slower giants like Ethereum.\nCircle's Bold Move in the Solana Realm\nDominance of USDC\nA significant catalyst behind Solana\u2019s liquidity explosion is Circle\u2019s USDC, commanding roughly 66% of the stablecoin realm on the platform. The recent minting of an additional $750 million USDC\u2014bringing the total to a staggering $5.25 billion\u2014shines a spotlight on Circle\u2019s influential presence. This surge not only amplifies liquidity but also supercharges transactional capabilities across various DeFi lending platforms and exchanges, paving the way for skyrocketing volumes and usage.\nUnlocking New Avenues for DeFi Innovation\nWith Circle fueling liquidity, a landscape for fresh innovation within Solana's DeFi ecosystem seems inevitable. This newfound capital efficiency minimizes trading slippage, particularly on platforms favoring USDC transactions. Such improvements not only attract institutional interest but also signal a shift towards a more robust DeFi framework where Solana emerges as a frontrunner.\nA New Chapter in Cryptocurrency\nThe rise of Solana's stablecoin ecosystem marks a defining chapter in the cryptocurrency saga. As USDC fuels capital influx and liquidity boosts, Solana is primed for groundbreaking advancements in DeFi. While both retail and institutional investments bolster the prospects of the SOL token, they simultaneously prompt significant discussions about the implications of centralization within decentralized networks. Solana is swiftly transforming from merely an alternative to Ethereum into a compelling competitor in the frenetic DeFi race, captivating investors eager to ride the next wave of innovation in digital finance.\nWith every stride forward, Solana not only shapes the future of stablecoins but also lays the groundwork for an exciting new era in decentralized finance\u2014one that thrills and captivates the crypto community."

However, key technical indicators now pose early warning signals of a potential short-term reversal as SOL approaches key resistance near the 20-day moving average.\nSolana top #1 in DEX Volume (last 24h) pic.twitter.com/TCf62gARzM\n\u2014 Solana Sensei (@SolanaSensei) November 9, 2025\nThe Solana price closed above $165 on Sunday, after consolidating below this level since November 5. Its performance aligned with the broader market recovery that saw most top 10-ranked cryptocurrencies post modest gains over the weekend. Bitcoin rose 3% to reclaim $104,000, while Ethereum advanced 6% to trade near $3,900.\nBeyond price action, investors demonstrated a preference for Solana in DeFi activity. Citing Defillama data on Sunday, a community contributor, posting as Solanasensie, highlighted on X that Solana\u2019s decentralized exchanges recorded $5.11 billion in daily volumes, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s $3.8 billion and BNB Chain\u2019s $2.95 billion.\nSpikes in metrics like DEX volumes during uncertain market phases reflect an intent to rotate capital within Solana-native DeFi protocols, potentially mitigating market downturns with passive yield rather than exiting or holding stablecoins.\nThis helps keep capital within the ecosystem, as affirmed by Solana\u2019s recent staking data. Between Friday and Sunday, the total SOL stake increased from 414.5 million to 417.4 million, according to StakingRewards.\nThe 2.9 million SOL staking surge temporarily reduces short-term supply on exchanges, which could insulate Solana price against sharp short-term drawdowns in the coming week.\nStrategic traders will look out for fresh institutional inflows or a macro-driven demand catalyst before entering large bets on a convincing Solana price breakout towards the $180 to $200 territories in the week ahead\nSolana Price Forecast: 62% Reversal Probability Caps Rally Below $180 Resistance\nSolana (SOL) experienced a positive weekend performance, reclaiming the $165 level after five days of consolidation. However, technical indicators on the daily chart suggest that while bullish momentum is building, the recovery may face resistance before breaching the $180 mark.\nAccording to the Breakout Probability (Expo) indicator, Solana currently holds a 29% chance of a bullish breakout toward $180, while the downside probability remains higher at 62%, signaling a potential early pullback toward the $150 support zone.\nThe Bollinger Bands (BB 20 SMA) indicate tightening volatility, with the middle band at $180.06 acting as immediate resistance and the lower band at $149.58 providing short-term support.\nMomentum signals reinforce this cautious outlook. The RSI (14) stands at 40.36, marginally above the oversold territories, suggesting that Solana is still in a fragile zone where sellers may regain control. Meanwhile, the MACD (12, 26) remains in bearish territory, printing negative histogram bars with the signal line at -9.24 and MACD line at -10.92, confirming that selling pressure, though reduced, has yet to reverse convincingly.\nProfitability metrics also reveal a moderate bias toward consolidation. The win-to-loss ratio of 1,307 to 733, translating to 64.07% profitability, supports a near-term rebound scenario but warns that gains may be limited until increased spot volumes support Solana\u2019s on-chain activity.\nIf Solana closes decisively above $170 on strong daily volume, the next target lies near $180, coinciding with the Bollinger midpoint. Conversely, failing to hold $160 could trigger a retest of $150, marked by the lower Bollinger band.\nnext"

                "body": "Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) have both had a volatile year. Ethereum hit a record high near $4,700 before slipping below $4,000 after the crypto flash crash. Solana followed a similar path, climbing to around $295 early in 2025 but later falling back to the mid-$100 range.\nNow, with 2026 approaching, investors are wondering which offers more upside. Will Ethereum\u2019s stability and institutional backing keep it climbing, or will Solana\u2019s faster transaction speed and lower fees lead to bigger gains next year?\nThe Bullish Case for Ethereum\nEthereum bulls believe the recent dip is just a brief pause before the next leg higher. Their confidence rests on three key pillars:\n1. Wall Street Money\nInstitutional adoption of ETH is stronger than ever. The launch of several Ethereum spot ETFs in 2025 has driven mainstream capital into the market. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other Wall Street giants have invested billions.\nSpot ETH ETFs saw record-breaking inflows of over $5 billion in one month in mid-2025, even outpacing Bitcoin fund flows at times. This wave of \u201csmart money\u201d signals that big investors view Ethereum as a long-term winner.\n2. Network Upgrades\nOn December 3, 2025, the Ethereum network is scheduled to implement the \u201cFusaka\u201d hard fork, introducing PeerDAS to boost scalability. Fusaka will increase Ethereum\u2019s throughput and lower gas fees, allowing the blockchain to process far more data and transactions without high costs.\nPast bull runs saw Ethereum struggle with sky-high fees. Now, metrics show network activity is near 2025 highs while fees remain manageable, a sign that scaling solutions (Layer 2 rollups and now Fusaka\u2019s improvements) are working.\n3. Bullish Price Targets\nWith ETH currently in the high-$3,000s, even a return to the $4,865 all-time high would mark a solid gain. But forecasts are more ambitious. Analysts recently projected that ETH could hit $5,000 if upcoming upgrades succeed, and some longer-term outlooks see five-figure ETH possible. The bull case frames it as a matter of when, not if, Ethereum powers back above $4K and keeps climbing.\nThe Bearish Case for Ethereum\nNot everyone is convinced that Ethereum\u2019s path goes straight up. Here are the two main concerns:\n1. Layer 2 \u201cValue Drain\u201d\nSome improvements to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem might undermine ETH\u2019s value. The rise of Layer 2 networks (like Coinbase\u2019s Base, Arbitrum, and others built atop Ethereum) helps scale Ethereum by handling transactions off-chain. However, these platforms can divert activity and fees away from Ethereum\u2019s main chain.\nBanks have noticed this \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d for ETH. Standard Chartered slashed its 2025 price target for Ethereum from $10K to $4K, citing how L2s are \u201creducing ETH\u2019s market cap\u201d by siphoning transactions that would otherwise burn ETH as gas. If users increasingly transact on L2s where ETH isn\u2019t needed for every transaction, Ethereum\u2019s own value capture could erode over time.\n2. Shifting Institutional Sentiment\nWhile institutions opened the door to Ethereum this year, there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll keep pouring in at the same rate. Late 2025 brought signs of profit-taking. By the end of October, Ethereum ETFs saw net outflows for multiple days straight, totaling nearly $1 billion in just one week.\nBlackRock\u2019s flagship Ethereum fund alone recorded over $100 million in outflows in a single day. These reversals suggest that big investors will sell if macro conditions turn sour or if Ethereum underperforms expectations.\nThe Bullish Case for Solana\nIn the Solana camp, the bullish arguments center on momentum and potential. Solana is often pitched as a higher-risk, higher-reward bet, and the upside case goes like this:\n1. High-Speed, High-Throughput Advantage\nSolana was built to do what Ethereum can\u2019t (yet): handle internet-scale transaction volumes with minimal fees. Its Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Stake design allows Solana to process 1,000+ transactions per second with finality under half a second. This makes Sol"

Investors seemed happy to hear, yesterday morning, that a U.S. trade court had decided to order President Trump to lift most of the tariffs he announced in April. But by evening the joy had faded, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stepped in to grant a temporary restraining order preventing the tariffs from being lifted.\nSo the on-again, off-again tariffs are right back \"on again\" -- and in fact, could be even more \"on\" than we thought last night.\nThis morning, in a post on Truth Social, the President accused China of having \"TOTALLY VIOLATED\" a trade agreement under which the President had cut China tariffs from 145% to 30% earlier this month. \"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!,\" posted the President, apparently threatening to raise tariffs even higher.\nHow high will tariffs go? No one knows, but investors are already spooked and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is predictably slumping in response.\nEarnings\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) and Costco (Nasdaq: COST) both reported earnings after close of trading last night.

On the plus side, Dell said both sales and earnings in Q2 will be better.\nCostco's report featured top-and-bottom line beats for that company's fiscal Q3.\nAdvertisement\nAnalyst Calls\nRegarding the effect of tariffs, Loop Capital observed that Costco is refraining from passing on higher costs from tariffs to its customers, which is helping the company to grow market share. Loop upped its price target on Costco to $1,115 per share, and maintained a buy rating on the stock.\nIn related trade news, and easily confused with Costco, JPMorgan upgraded Shanghai-based Cosco Shipping to overweight this morning, setting a target price of 19 Hong Kong Dollars ($2.42) on the stock. That's about 40% more than what Cosco stock costs now.\nSo at least JPMorgan seems to remain bullish on international trade. I guess that's good news.\nIf you\u2019re one of the over 4 Million Americans set to retire this year, you may want to pay attention.\nFinding a financial advisor who puts your interest first can be the difference between a rich retirement and barely getting by, and today it\u2019s easier than ever.

                "body": "The FTSE 100 has just concluded a tumultuous earnings week, leaving investors with a sense of cautious optimism tinged with indecision. Despite reaching new all-time highs mid-week, the index ultimately lost momentum, pulling back amidst global market jitters. This turbulent period has significantly shaped the immediate outlook for UK stock futures, which appear to be positioning defensively as market participants brace for key economic data and ongoing macroeconomic shifts.\nThe week culminating around November 9, 2025, proved to be a roller-coaster for the UK's benchmark index. Initially, the FTSE 100 rallied strongly, even touching a new record high of 9,798, buoyed by robust earnings reports from energy giants like Shell (LSE: SHEL) and a resilient banking sector. However, this upward trajectory was short-lived. A significant tech-led sell-off originating from the US, driven by concerns over margin pressure at major technology firms such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), sent ripples across global equities. The FTSE 100 subsequently faded, closing the week at 9,741, marking a 0.4% loss and signaling a clear loss of upward momentum.\nThe corporate earnings landscape presented a mixed bag. While internationally focused firms demonstrated resilience, several domestic sectors faced headwinds. Marks & Spencer (LSE: MKS) reported a significant profit plunge, attributed to a cyberattack, while International Airlines Group (LSE: IAG) noted a slowdown in US travel demand. Rightmove (LSE: RMV) also raised concerns over near-term profitability following plans for increased AI investment. Conversely, Metro Bank (LSE: MTRO) provided a positive update, showcasing pockets of strength within the broader market. This diverse performance underscores the selective nature of investor confidence in the current environment.\nCompanies Navigating the Storm: Potential Winners and Losers\nThe turbulent earnings week has created a distinct divide among companies within the FTSE 100, highlighting those poised to potentially gain and those facing significant challenges. The \"flight-to-quality\" theme observed during the week suggests a rotation into more defensive sectors, which traditionally fare better during periods of market stress.\nEnergy heavyweights, such as Shell (LSE: SHEL), along with the broader banking sector, demonstrated strong earnings and resilience, positioning them as potential winners. Their robust performance provided initial upward momentum for the index, and in a cautious environment, their stable cash flows and dividend yields can attract investors seeking safety. Similarly, other defensive stocks within consumer staples and utilities are likely to see continued interest as investors de-risk their portfolios. The FTSE 100's heavier weighting in these traditional sectors has contributed to its relative strength compared to some of its more tech-heavy European peers.\nOn the other hand, companies like Marks & Spencer (LSE: MKS), grappling with a significant profit plunge due to a cyberattack, and International Airlines Group (LSE: IAG), facing a slowdown in key travel markets, exemplify potential losers. Their vulnerabilities, whether operational or demand-driven, have been exposed during this period. Furthermore, growth-oriented companies, particularly those with high valuations like Rightmove (LSE: RMV), which is planning substantial AI investments impacting near-term profitability, may struggle as investors become more risk-averse and scrutinize future growth prospects more critically in the wake of global tech sector jitters.\nWider Significance: Macro Trends and Policy Crossroads\nThis turbulent week for the FTSE 100 is not an isolated event but rather a microcosm of broader industry trends and macroeconomic shifts. The global market jitters, particularly the tech-led sell-off in the US, underscore a re-evaluation of technology valuations and growth prospects worldwide. This has prompted a significant rotation of "

                "body": "Fed's rate decision looms as markets hover near records: What to watch this week\nStocks notched another week of record highs as investors bet on a Fed interest rate cut this week.\nThe central bank is widely expected to prioritize a cooling labor market even as sticky inflation complicates the picture, with investors overwhelmingly betting on a quarter-point cut. Futures markets put the probability at north of 90%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nThat sets the stage for a pivotal week in markets, where the Fed's call could determine whether the rally has more room to run.\nThe three major indexes closed mixed on Friday, but all logged solid weekly gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose nearly 1% for its first winning week in three weeks, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) turned in their best weekly performances since early August. Treasury yields hovered near recent lows, while gold (GC=F) set fresh records as markets braced for a potential Fed pivot.\nBeyond the Fed, the calendar brings a weekly update on jobless claims and fresh manufacturing data, offering more signals on the strength of the economy.\nMortgage rates will also be in focus after posting their biggest weekly drop in a year last week. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate slipped to 6.35% from 6.5% the prior week, according to Freddie Mac.\nMeanwhile, earnings season is winding down, but a handful of bellwethers remain. FedEx (FDX) is the main event, as results from the delivery giant are often viewed as a proxy for the health of global trade and the broader US economy.\nInvestors will also get updates from homebuilder Lennar (LEN), food giant General Mills (GIS), and restaurant operator Darden (DRI). Cracker Barrel (CBRL), which has made headlines in recent weeks over its back-and-forth rebrand, rounds out a more subdued docket.\nThe Fed's big decision\nThe Fed's interest rate decision, along with Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference, will be the key economic event of the week. Alongside its policy decision, the Fed will release its quarterly \"dot plot\" \u2014 a snapshot of policymakers' projections for the path of interest rates.\nIn June, officials penciled in two rate cuts for 2025, although the forecasts revealed a more divided committee. Seven members saw no cuts at all, compared with four in March. Powell acknowledged the divergence at the time, stressing that \"right now it's just a forecast in a very foggy time.\"\nInvestors will be looking for more clarity this week, but the backdrop isn't straightforward.\nTariffs are increasingly feeding into inflation after US customs duties surged to a record $29.5 billion in August following President Trump's new \"reciprocal\" levies.\nRead more: How jobs, inflation, and the Fed are all related\nAugust's Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed stubborn price pressures across categories such as food, vehicles, and household goods. Coffee, beef, and produce all spiked. Car parts, furniture, and even hardware equipment also moved higher. But not all of the stickiness is tariff-related. Services inflation remains elevated as well, with airline fares surging nearly 6%.\nAt the same time, labor market weakness has become harder to ignore. Jobless claims just hit their highest level in nearly four years. Payrolls grew by only 22,000 in August, while government revisions also revealed that nearly 1 million fewer jobs were created in the 12 months through March 2025 than initially reported.\nThat leaves Powell facing a difficult balance: Cut too slowly and risk a deeper labor downturn, or move too quickly and reignite inflation.\nFresh consumer data will add to the picture for policymakers. Tuesday brings the August retail sales report, a key gauge of household demand.\nAdvertisement\nRead more: August CPI report shows consumers feeling the heat of accelerating inflation\nWall Street's AI-fueled bull case\nAmid that backdrop, Main Street is flashing caution.

Here\u2019s what you should know before the ASX opens today\u2026\nAt 7 am AEST Monday, ASX futures were up about 0.25%, pointing to a relatively calm start to the week.\nHere\u2019s what went down Friday on Wall Street..\nThe Magnificent Meltdown\nWall Street limped into the weekend after its worst tech sell-off since April.\nThe Dow added 0.16%, the S&P 500 scraped 0.13%, but the Nasdaq slumped 0.21%, dragged down by Mag Seven\u2019s over-extended waistline.\nNvidia, the chipmaker that can apparently do no wrong, just did.\nIt shed more than 9% for the week, its worst run since April, after CEO Jensen Huang warned that the US was \u201cpoised to lose the AI arms race to China.\u201d\nMeta wasn\u2019t spared either, the stock slid about 4% for the week, hit by both the broad tech sell-off and a damning Reuters report claiming the company shows users 15 billion scam ads a day.\nThat means roughly 10% of its revenue came from dodgy or banned products. Meta then tried to win back hearts by promising to spend US$600 billion on US data centres and jobs over three years\nThe broader market vibe, however, was grim.\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index cratered to 50.3, its worst since 2022 as Americans grew anxious about their dwindling purchasing power.\nMeanwhile, there was no official jobs report, again, because the US government remains on shutdown. But private data shows layoffs piling up, with job cuts hitting their highest October tally since 2009.\nShould you buy the dip?\nThe S&P 500 has been hanging out around its 50-day moving average, with Goldman Sachs\u2019 Tony Pasquariello summing up the mood:\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that risk/reward is overly compelling, nor that this is an ideal location to add a bunch of incremental risk.\u201d\nIn other words, yeah, maybe buy, but don\u2019t blame me when it tanks.\nAnalysts also warn that the market\u2019s buying power is \u201cwaning,\u201d a way of saying traders might be out of ammo after chasing AI themes all year.\nGold: shiny but bored\nGold\u2019s sitting near US$4,001 an ounce after an insane run this year, and it\u2019s still on track for its best year since 1979.\nBut Macquarie reckons the party\u2019s over. Their chief economist Ric Deverell wrote, \u201cWith global growth beginning to rebound\u2026 we suspect the near-term peak is in.\u201d\nIn plain English, the gold rush might finally be catching its breath.\nPrices aren\u2019t expected to fall off a cliff, more like drift sideways as inflation cools, rate cuts start rolling in, and the world feels a touch less apocalyptic.\nThe week ahead\nThis week\u2019s economic diary looks like a half-empty calendar.\nAustralia drops its consumer confidence, business confidence, and employment data mid-week \u2013 numbers that could tell us whether the RBA gets itchy about rate cuts before Christmas.\nChina\u2019s up Friday with retail sales and industrial production, a litmus test for global sentiment.\nAnd the US?

                "body": "Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) Released Earnings Last Week And Analysts Lifted Their Price Target To US$1.89\nIt's been a mediocre week for Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) shareholders, with the stock dropping 16% to US$6.56 in the week since its latest third-quarter results. The results don't look great, especially considering that statutory losses grew 68% toUS$0.12 per share. Revenues of US$915m did beat expectations by 3.7%, but it looks like a bit of a cold comfort. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\nTaking into account the latest results, the nine analysts covering Opendoor Technologies provided consensus estimates of US$4.23b revenue in 2026, which would reflect an uncomfortable 10% decline over the past 12 months. The loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 29% to US$0.30. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$4.25b and losses of US$0.38 per share in 2026. Although the revenue estimates have not really changed Opendoor Technologies'future looks a little different to the past, with a favorable reduction in the loss per share forecasts in particular.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Opendoor Technologies\nThese new estimates led to the consensus price target rising 65% to US$1.89, with lower forecast losses suggesting things could be looking up for Opendoor Technologies. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Opendoor Technologies, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$6.00 and the most bearish at US$0.70 per share. As you can see the range of estimates is wide, with the lowest valuation coming in at less than half the most bullish estimate, suggesting there are some strongly diverging views on how analysts think this business will perform. With this in mind, we wouldn't rely too heavily the consensus price target, as it is just an average and analysts clearly have some deeply divergent views on the business.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. One more thing stood out to us about these estimates, and it's the idea that Opendoor Technologies' decline is expected to accelerate, with revenues forecast to fall at an annualised rate of 8.4% to the end of 2026. This tops off a historical decline of 0.8% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for companies in the broader industry, which suggest that revenues (in aggregate) are expected to grow 10% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while it does have declining revenues, the analysts also expect Opendoor Technologies to suffer worse than the wider industry."

                "body": "What an earnings season it\u2019s been for mega-cap tech stocks. Earnings beats, guidance raises, and expectations of future revenue and profit growth led many of the most closely-watched tech giants to see some meaningful price appreciation following the release of their results.\nHowever, for investors in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), the feeling likely couldn\u2019t have been further from that reality. Shares of META stock dropped around 9% on October 29, following the company\u2019s Q3 earnings. That\u2019s despite earnings and revenue which smashed expectations.\nLet\u2019s dive into Meta\u2019s recent earnings, what led to this decline, and why this stock market reaction to some rather incredible results could lead to a massive buying opportunity for investors who are willing to take the other side of this bet right now.\nWhat Happened?\nWith shares of META stock now trading around $635 per share at the time of writing (down from almost exactly $750 per share heading into this print), that\u2019s a decline of more than 15% in the span of around one week.\nThat\u2019s a big drop in that amount of time, but even bigger for a company with a market capitalization that was pushing $2 trillion heading into the print.\nWith Meta posting $7.25 in EPS compared to analyst estimates of $6.69, and revenue beating estimates by nearly $2 billion ($51.2 billion versus $49.4 billion expected), that\u2019s a big beat. And on top of that, Meta provided a forward revenue guidance range that was higher than what the consensus on Wall Street suggested would be the case.\nThat said, what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also announced during this earnings call was that he plans to ramp up capital expenditures dramatically to around $72 billion this year, and suggested that spending in 2026 could be \u201cnotably larger.\u201d\nCue investors who harken back to the reinvention of the company and its renaming from Facebook to Meta Platforms. Remember the metaverse \u2013 that whole ordeal where the company formerly known as Facebook decided to go all-in and spend billions of dollars on an idea that never panned out?\nI\u2019m not saying AI is the same thing at all. It isn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s a technology that\u2019s going to reshape our economy moving forward. I think the jury has come back with a verdict on that front.\nBut I also think that the parallels between how capital spending in the past has played into a 77% crash from 2021 peak to 2022 trough for META stock is worrying for many investors right now.\nIs There Any Good News?\nI\u2019d say the positive narrative that can come out of this recent decline is that Meta is still a world-class cash cow, generating sky-high margins and incredible profitability from its core social media operations and its empire which has been successful in dominating mind share for users all around the world. And with the vast majority of the world on one of the company\u2019s core platforms, the opportunities for continued monetization are ample, particularly for those bullish on global population growth and surging social media usage.\nIn a sense, one could view the whole metaverse debacle at Meta Platforms as an opportunity to buy. Though, when the stock was down more than 75% from its peak, it didn\u2019t feel like that was the time to sell.\nThis decline is a lot smaller than the company\u2019s 2022 drop, and it\u2019s possible we have further to go here. But in my view, Meta remains a top world-class tech giant that\u2019s worth dollar cost averaging into over time. I\u2019ll stand by that, even if this spending is indeed going to be proven to be out of control in hindsight.\nIf You\u2019ve Been Thinking About Retirement, Pay Attention (sponsor)\nRetirement planning doesn\u2019t have to feel overwhelming.

                "body": "- United States\n- /\n- Biotech\n- /\n- NasdaqGS:REGN\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:REGN) Anemic Earnings Might Be Worse Than You Think\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:REGN) stock showed strength, with investors undeterred by its weak earnings report. We think that shareholders might be missing some concerning factors that our analysis found.\nThe Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit\nImportantly, our data indicates that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' profit received a boost of US$619m in unusual items, over the last year. While it's always nice to have higher profit, a large contribution from unusual items sometimes dampens our enthusiasm. When we crunched the numbers on thousands of publicly listed companies, we found that a boost from unusual items in a given year is often not repeated the next year. And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'. If Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't see that contribution repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to drop over the current year.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Profit Performance\nArguably, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' statutory earnings have been distorted by unusual items boosting profit. Because of this, we think that it may be that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power. The good news is that its earnings per share increased slightly in the last year. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. While it's really important to consider how well a company's statutory earnings represent its true earnings power, it's also worth taking a look at what analysts are forecasting for the future. Luckily, you can check out what analysts are forecasting by clicking here.\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts\nOur new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities.\n\u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.\nHave feedback on this article?

In brief:\n- JPMorgan Chase cut its year-end forecast for the yen to 156 per dollar from 142, and now sees 152 by March 2026 instead of 139.\n- MUFG Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. made similar downward revisions, signalling broad skepticism that the BOJ will tighten policy anytime soon.\nAt its most recent meeting, the BOJ left interest rates unchanged\n- Governor Kazuo Ueda said the bank needed more time and data before deciding on rate hikes, prompting traders to interpret his stance as cautious.\n- \u201cIt\u2019s not a stage to proactively buy yen,\u201d said Hirofumi Suzuki, chief FX strategist at SMBC, adding that there was \u201cno groundwork\u201d for an early move.\n- Market pricing implies only a 57% chance of a rate hike in December.\n- Analysts note that monetary policy expectations have become less influential than politics and fiscal signals.\nConcerns are growing over Takaichi\u2019s plans for \u201cresponsible and proactive\u201d fiscal spending, with investors wary that a large supplementary budget could further weaken the yen.\nMUFG\u2019s Teppei Ino said the market will likely remain under selling pressure until the scale of the new stimulus is revealed.
