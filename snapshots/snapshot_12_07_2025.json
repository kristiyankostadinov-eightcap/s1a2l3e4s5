                "body": "Gold Price: Gold\u2019s remarkable rally shows little sign of slowing as it heads into 2026, and market experts believe the precious metal may now be positioned for yet another powerful surge.\nIn a recent report, brokerage house Ventura said that it believes a \u201ccocktail powered by central bank buying, stubborn inflation, widening US deficits, and concerns around the US economy and tariffs\u201d could propel gold prices to a target range of $4,600\u2013$4,800 in the coming year.\nAn expectation of 75 bps worth of US Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026 is expected to keep strong bidding interest alive and deepen the metal\u2019s multi-year bull market.\nVentura highlights that gold\u2019s bullish cycle remains \u201cfar from over\u201d as institutional investors increasingly seek an inflation hedge, followed by rising retail and speculative participation. The firm notes that this layered demand is strengthening the foundation of gold\u2019s long-term rally.\nMeanwhile, last month, Deutsche Bank had lifted its 2026 gold price forecast to $4,450 an ounce, up from $4,000 earlier, citing steadier investor inflows and sustained central-bank buying. The bank now anticipates gold to trade in a $3,950\u2013$4,950 range next year, with the upper end sitting roughly 14% above the current December 2026 COMEX futures price.\nIt described a \u201cpositive structural backdrop,\u201d noting that strong central-bank purchases and ETF inflows are absorbing a large share of available supply, leaving less metal for jewellery demand even as total demand continues to exceed supply. Deutsche Bank kept its 2027 forecast at $5,150, saying the estimate \u201cstraddles the uncertainty\u201d between a normalised market environment and a scenario of prolonged elevated official-sector buying.\nFurther more, Morgan Stanley, in an earlier report, had predicted that gold could rise to $4,500 per ounce by mid-2026, supported by firm physical demand from exchange-traded funds and ongoing central-bank purchases amid a cloudy global economic outlook. The bank noted that gold had recently entered overbought territory on the RSI gauge, but the latest pullback has \u201creset the market to a healthier level,\u201d improving positioning. Morgan Stanley expects ETF inflows to strengthen as interest rates fall, while central-bank buying should continue\u2014though at a more moderate pace\u2014alongside stabilising jewellery demand.\nThe brokerage also warned of downside risks, including bouts of volatility that may drive investors toward alternative assets, as well as the possibility of central banks trimming their gold holdings, which could weigh on prices.\nMeanwhile, brokerage house HDFC Securities notes that gold\u2019s investment appeal has strengthened significantly amid persistent inflation, expectations of lower real interest rates and weakening faith in fiat currencies. The brokerage emphasises gold\u2019s ability to hedge against geopolitical conflict, market volatility and deteriorating fiscal conditions across major Western economies.\nHDFC Securities recommends that investors allocate 5\u201310% of their portfolios to precious metals such as gold and silver, with scope to increase exposure gradually depending on risk appetite. Despite short-term volatility, the firm believes gold\u2019s medium-to-long-term outlook remains \u201cstructurally strong.\u201d\nStrong rally to $4299 was driven by expectations of a Fed rate cut (Dec 9th \u2013 10th). The prospect of lower US interest rates continues to support gold and building confidence in December rate cut. Investors betting that softening inflation and signs of cooling labor conditions will give policymakers room to ease while dollar weakened.\nAccording to Ventura, gold has printed new highs for nine consecutive quarters, including Q4 2025, reflecting one of the most powerful multi-year rallies in modern history. The surge signals what Ventura calls a systemic deterioration in fiat currency value, a trend reinforced by gold now ranking as the second most important reserve asset among global central banks.\nIn India, the bullishness appears"

The report had been delayed by the recent government shutdown, but when it finally arrived, it delivered few surprises. With inflation matching forecasts, markets held onto strong expectations for a rate cut after this week\u2019s Fed meeting, with CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool showing just a slight dip in odds to 87.2% from 88.2%. Meanwhile, the ICE dollar index was nearly flat, edging up only 0.01 points to 99.0, while yields on government bonds climbed, with the two-year Treasury note at 3.573% and the ten-year at 4.145%.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Gold\u2019s luster holds as traders track the Fed.\nGold managed a modest rise, even as government bond yields crept up\u2014normally a drag for the metal. Investor focus is firmly on Fed policy signals, with rate cut hopes still supporting gold and other rate-sensitive assets. And with the dollar barely moving, traders seem poised for more clarity from the central bank before making bigger shifts.\nThe bigger picture: Steady inflation keeps expectations grounded.\nA stable PCE reading gives the Fed no reason to change course abruptly, dialing down market uncertainty. This predictability helps businesses and governments plan with more confidence. For global investors, consistent US inflation and a steady hand from the Fed play a big role in shaping international trade and investment flows.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nWeekly Brief\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 6 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

Silver futures for the March 2026 contract increased by Rs 4,288, or 2.41 per cent, to Rs 1,82,426 per kilogram, up from Rs 1,78,138 in the previous session.\nAlso Read\nA weakening US dollar also lent support to bullion prices, with the dollar index trading 0.13 per cent lower at 98.87. Globally, Comex gold for February delivery was up USD 17.45, or 0.41 per cent, at USD 4,260.45 per ounce, while silver for March 2026 traded 2.25 per cent higher at USD 58.78 per ounce.\nKotak Securities noted that gold was trading above USD 4,205 as markets awaited the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data, a key indicator for the Fed\u2019s December policy direction. Rahul Kalantri of Mehta Equities said gold strengthened while silver experienced mild profit-booking on Thursday after positive US jobless claims.\nAdd Mathrubhumi English as atrusted source on Google\nHe added that weaker labour indicators, including a sharper-than-expected fall in ADP payrolls and persistent layoffs, have increased market expectations of a rate cut at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with odds approaching 87 per cent.\nGold futures in India extended gains on Friday, tracking firm global trends ahead of the release of US PCE inflation data. On the MCX, gold for February delivery rose to Rs 1,30,829 per 10 grams, a gain of 0.58 per cent. Silver futures for March 2026 strengthened by 2.41 per cent to Rs 1,82,426 per kilogram.\nThe uptick coincided with a softer US dollar, which typically boosts bullion demand. The dollar index fell to 98.87 during early trade. Internationally, Comex gold and silver also climbed, with traders positioning themselves ahead of US inflation numbers that could influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate outlook.\nAnalysts said investor sentiment has been shaped by mixed US economic data. While jobless claims came in positive, weak private payroll numbers and rising layoffs point to easing labour-market strength. This has increased expectations that the Fed may consider a rate cut at its upcoming policy meeting.\nMarket watchers note that bullion prices remain sensitive to macroeconomic indicators, particularly inflation and labour-market performance, as these guide the Fed\u2019s decisions on interest rates. A dovish outlook could further support gold and silver in the near term.\n(With PTI inputs)\nRelated Topics\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.

Many members are running close to capacity limits and some are tasked with extra cuts to compensate for earlier overproduction, limiting the impact of further increases.\nUnder an agreement by eight OPEC+ members covering November output, the five of them that are OPEC members \u2013 Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2013 were to raise output by 85,000 bpd before the effect of compensation cuts totalling 140,000 bpd for Iraq and the UAE.\nThe survey showed that the actual increase by the five was 40,000 bpd.\nIraq posted lower exports, according to data and sources in the survey, due to pipeline maintenance.\nIn Nigeria, a fire on the Yoho production platform and its resulting shutdown helped lower shipments.\nEstimates of output in Iraq and the UAE varied widely, with many outside sources putting the countries\u2019 output higher than the countries themselves.\nWhile the Reuters survey and data provided by OPEC\u2019s secondary sources showed they are pumping close to the quotas, other estimates, such as those of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said they are pumping significantly higher volumes.\nMeanwhile, oil prices edged up nearly 1 per cent to a two-week high at the weekend on increasing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week, which could boost economic growth and energy demand, as well as geopolitical uncertainty that could limit supplies from Russia and Venezuela.\nBrent futures rose 49 cents, or 0.8 per cent, to settle at $63.75 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 41 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to settle at $60.08.\nThose were the highest closes for both crude benchmarks since November 18. For the week, Brent was up about 1 per cent and WTI was up about 3 per cent, marking a second straight weekly gain for both contracts.\nInvestors digested a U.S. inflation report and recalibrated expectations for the Fed to reduce rates at its December 9-10 meeting. U.S. consumer spending increased moderately in September after three straight months of solid gains, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy at the end of the third quarter as a lackluster labor market and the rising cost of living curbed demand.\nTraders have been pricing in an 87 per cent chance that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by 25 basis points next week, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool. Separately, top Chinese and U.S. officials held a call on Friday to discuss trade, including ongoing efforts to implement an agreement to their trade war.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he will meet with the leaders of Mexico and Canada to discuss trade issues on Friday after they gathered in Washington for the 2026 World Cup draw.\nAny talks that could reduce trade tensions between the U.S. and other nations could boost economic growth and energy demand.\nInvestors also focused on news from Russia and Venezuela to determine whether oil supplies from the two sanctioned OPEC+ members will increase or decrease in the future.

Investors are still paying a premium for geopolitical risk, as ongoing Ukrainian strikes on Russian refineries and export terminals keep uncertainty high. Meanwhile, US diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire haven\u2019t gained traction, and experts like PVM Oil Associates see little chance of a breakthrough anytime soon. On top of that, OPEC+ is ramping up supply by 2.6 million barrels a day to reclaim market share, joining record US production and new flows from Canada and South America. Stockpiles are climbing as a result: Energy Information Administration data pointed to a 0.6 million barrel uptick in US inventories last week, defying expectations for a drawdown.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Supply is outpacing demand for now.\nRight now, global oil supply is running ahead of demand, causing inventories to build up and putting a lid on prices. OPEC+ and the US are pumping at full throttle, fueling the oversupply, but ongoing geopolitical risks are giving prices a bit of support. This tug-of-war has markets treading carefully \u2013 any change in supply or further conflict could jolt prices either way.\nThe bigger picture: A complex web of politics and production.\nOil\u2019s story is being shaped by two heavyweight forces: rising geopolitical tension and a flood of new supply. With peace talks stalling, conflict risk continues to hang over the market, while global producers jockey for a bigger slice of demand. The interplay between these factors is set to drive volatility and influence energy strategies for businesses and governments worldwide.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nWeekly Brief\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 6 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "Latest Headlines\nOPEC Oil Output Slips in November Amid Nigeria\u2019s Production Decline\n*At $63.75 per barrel, Brent crude climbs to two-week high\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\nOil output from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) edged lower in November, despite an agreement to raise production for the month, due to outages in some member nations.\nOPEC pumped 28.40 million barrels per day last month, down 30,000 bpd from October\u2019s total, the survey showed, with Nigeria and Iraq recording the largest declines, a Reuters report showed.\nThe survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on flow data from financial group LSEG, information from other companies that track flows, such as Kpler, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.\nOPEC+, comprising OPEC and allies including Russia, has slowed the pace of its monthly output increases amid concerns of a supply glut. Many members are running close to capacity limits and some are tasked with extra cuts to compensate for earlier overproduction, limiting the impact of further increases.\nUnder an agreement by eight OPEC+ members covering November output, the five of them that are OPEC members \u2013 Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2013 were to raise output by 85,000 bpd before the effect of compensation cuts totalling 140,000 bpd for Iraq and the UAE.\nThe survey showed that the actual increase by the five was 40,000 bpd.\nIraq posted lower exports, according to data and sources in the survey, due to pipeline maintenance.\nIn Nigeria, a fire on the Yoho production platform and its resulting shutdown helped lower shipments.\nEstimates of output in Iraq and the UAE varied widely, with many outside sources putting the countries\u2019 output higher than the countries themselves.\nWhile the Reuters survey and data provided by OPEC\u2019s secondary sources showed they are pumping close to the quotas, other estimates, such as those of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said they are pumping significantly higher volumes.\nMeanwhile, oil prices edged up nearly 1 per cent to a two-week high at the weekend on increasing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week, which could boost economic growth and energy demand, as well as geopolitical uncertainty that could limit supplies from Russia and Venezuela.\nBrent futures rose 49 cents, or 0.8 per cent, to settle at $63.75 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 41 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to settle at $60.08.\nThose were the highest closes for both crude benchmarks since November 18. For the week, Brent was up about 1 per cent and WTI was up about 3 per cent, marking a second straight weekly gain for both contracts.\nInvestors digested a U.S. inflation report and recalibrated expectations for the Fed to reduce rates at its December 9-10 meeting. U.S. consumer spending increased moderately in September after three straight months of solid gains, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy at the end of the third quarter as a lackluster labor market and the rising cost of living curbed demand.\nTraders have been pricing in an 87 per cent chance that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by 25 basis points next week, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool. Separately, top Chinese and U.S. officials held a call on Friday to discuss trade, including ongoing efforts to implement an agreement to their trade war.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he will meet with the leaders of Mexico and Canada to discuss trade issues on Friday after they gathered in Washington for the 2026 World Cup draw.\nAny talks that could reduce trade tensions between the U.S. and other nations could boost economic growth and energy demand.\nInvestors also focused on news from Russia and Venezuela to determine whether oil supplies from the two sanctioned OPEC+ members will increase or decrease in the future.

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast - Eur Steadies at 1.1640 Eurozone Growth Lifts Outlook Toward 1.22\nThe euro holds firm near 1.1640 as markets anticipate an 86% probability of a December Fed rate cut | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Bulls Hold 1.1640 Ahead of Fed Pivot as Eurozone Growth Outpaces U.S. Slowdown\nEUR/USD Trades at 1.1640, Holding Weekly Gain as Dollar Weakens Into Fed Meeting\nThe EUR/USD pair trades near 1.1640, marking a 0.39% weekly gain, as investors weigh a dovish shift from the Federal Reserve and the stabilizing macro picture in the Eurozone. Market sentiment has turned cautiously bullish, with traders positioning for a break above 1.1740, which could trigger an extended rally toward 1.22, levels unseen since early 2021. The euro\u2019s resilience comes despite ongoing geopolitical risk and mixed retail data, while the U.S. dollar remains pinned under 99.00 on the DXY Index.\nFed Policy Outlook: Rate Cut Odds at 86% Pressure the Dollar\nThe upcoming December 9\u201310 Fed meeting dominates the short-term landscape. The CME FedWatch tool shows an 86.2% probability of a 25 bps rate cut, with markets now projecting up to 75 bps of additional cuts through 2026. The dollar\u2019s bearish tone deepened as November\u2019s ADP report showed a 32,000 job loss, the sharpest decline since 2020, while the three-month moving average of private payrolls turned negative for the first time in five years.\nThe Core PCE Index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, rose just 0.2% month-over-month and 2.8% year-over-year, confirming inflation is cooling but still above target. This moderation gives policymakers room to pivot without sparking runaway inflation. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index rose to 53.3, with long-term inflation expectations falling to 3.2%, supporting the case for a softer policy tone.\nPolitical Shifts and Market Positioning Undermine Dollar Confidence\nReports indicating that Kevin Hassett could replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair have intensified bearish sentiment around the dollar. Hassett is seen as more dovish, potentially accelerating rate cuts into 2026. The prospect of earlier easing has already pressured Treasury yields lower, with the 10-year yield dropping below 3.9%, its lowest since August. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) fell 0.09% to 98.98, marking a clear technical breakdown below the 99.30\u201399.50 resistance band. The index\u2019s weakness aligns with broader softness across USD pairs \u2014 including declines in USD/CHF (now 0.8045) and USD/JPY (below 155.00).\nEurozone Data Strengthens the Euro\u2019s Base\nThe Eurozone\u2019s Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.3%, beating the previous 0.2% estimate and signaling steady expansion despite external headwinds. Employment grew 0.2% quarter-on-quarter and 0.6% year-on-year, while inflation continues to normalize. Headline CPI for 2025 stands near 2.2%, allowing the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintain a cautious but supportive stance.\nECB officials, including Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, have warned that inflation risks remain \u201ctwo-sided,\u201d but the real shift is toward maintaining accommodative conditions rather than tightening. Combined with steady fiscal spending and moderating energy prices, this gives the euro a structural tailwind against the dollar\u2019s policy-driven weakness.\nEUR/USD Technical Structure: Compression Near 1.1740 Suggests Breakout\nThe EUR/USD technical profile shows strong medium-term support between 1.1460 and 1.1480, with resistance aligned at 1.1740, a level repeatedly tested over the past three months. The price remains comfortably above both the 50-day SMA (1.1550) and the 200-day SMA (1.1320), reinforcing the bullish bias.\nMomentum indicators confirm rising demand: the RSI hovers around 60, signaling strength without overheating, while the ADX near 33 shows a trending structure forming. The MACD has turned positive again, supporting upward continuation. A weekly close above 1.1740 would validate a breakout toward 1.1910 initially, then "

                "body": "EUR/USD is trading near 1.1640 after giving up earlier gains during Friday\u2019s session. In my view, this backdrop sets the stage for a potential breakout toward 1.22 over the coming weeks. Below, I present the macroeconomic shifts, policy divergence, and technical signals that support the bullish outlook for EUR/USD.\nEUR/USD erased most of its weekly gains on Friday and now trades flat near 1.1640. The pair remains steady ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on December 10. Markets are pricing in an 86.2% chance of a quarter-point rate cut, with expectations of up to three more cuts in 2026. These policy expectations weaken the U.S. dollar and support the euro.\nThe U.S. economic data has turned mixed. The ADP National Employment report showed a loss of 32,000 jobs in November. Additionally, the 3-month average turned negative for the first time since August 2020, reinforcing the case for rate cuts.\nThe chart below shows that Initial Jobless Claims dropped to 191,000, marking the lowest level in three years. This decline is likely due to seasonal distortion related to the Thanksgiving holiday.\nOn the other hand, the core PCE price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, rose by 0.2% in September, in line with previous months. Year-on-year inflation slowed to 2.8%, which remains above target but appears stable. This stability gives the Fed more room to pivot toward easing without triggering fears of runaway inflation.\nMoreover, political developments are also weighing on the dollar. Reports suggest that Kevin Hassett may replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair. Bond investors are concerned that Hassett could pursue aggressive easing, which may push yields higher as inflation risks increase.\nOn the other hand, the Eurozone macro picture is improving modestly. The chart below shows that Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.3% from 0.2%, beating earlier estimates and the previous quarter\u2019s 0.1% expansion. Employment also increased, rising 0.2% quarter-on-quarter and 0.6% year-over-year. Although the euro\u2019s reaction was muted, the data reflect steady resilience in the euro area.\nHowever, not all Eurozone data was supportive. October retail sales posted 0% growth, missing expectations. The upbeat manufacturing data earlier in the week and stable employment figures helped offset this weakness. On balance, Eurozone fundamentals appear to be stabilising while the U.S. outlook continues to deteriorate.\nIn summary, macro drivers currently favour a bullish bias for EUR/USD. A dovish Fed, soft US job data, and relative eurozone strength all point toward potential upside in the pair over the coming weeks.\nEUR/USD closed the week at 1.1641 after a substantial correction on Friday. Despite the intraday pullback, the broader trend remains constructive. The price action over the past few months has formed a compression zone just below the 1.1740 resistance. This compression zone suggests a possible breakout in the coming weeks.\nThe weekly chart below shows a clear bottom in 2023 and early 2025, with the rally in EUR/USD triggering a constructive development throughout 2025. The pair reached resistance near 1.191 and entered a compression pattern marked by lower highs and higher lows.\nThis coiling structure suggests a potential impulsive move ahead, with the key level at 1.1740. The key support rests in the 1.146 to 1.148 region. This compression pattern is also viewed as a bull flag pattern when measured from the 2025 lows.\nThe daily chart for EUR/USD shows that the pair formed a rounding bottom in early 2025, before starting a strong rally for the remainder of the year. The breakout from 1.05 triggered a sharp surge, pushing the pair up to the 1.12 level.\nA subsequent breakout above 1.12 has firmly established a strong bullish trend. The pair is currently trading above the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, reinforcing the bullish bias. The RSI is now approaching the 60 level, which signals rising momentum.\nA weekly close above 1.1740 would confirm a breakou"

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Extends Advance as Dovish Fed Expectations Lift Sterling to 1.3350\nDollar Weakens as Rate Cut Bets Surge\nThe GBP/USD (British Pound\u2013US Dollar) pair is strengthening, climbing toward 1.3349, marking a 0.19% daily gain. The move follows consistent dollar weakness tied to firm expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut next week. Traders now assign an 84\u201390% probability of a 25 basis-point reduction, a sharp shift from last month when odds were near 60%.\nThe U.S. Core PCE Price Index rose 0.2% MoM in November, steady from October and aligning with an annualized 2.8% rate. This soft reading confirms disinflation, reinforcing the case for easing. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index jumped to 53.3, the highest since July, while inflation expectations cooled from 4.5% to 4.1% (1-year) and from 3.4% to 3.2% (5-year). Together, these indicators weakened the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which remains anchored around 98.9\u201399.3, its lowest range since May.\nSterling Finds Momentum as Traders Position for Fed Shift\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) trades firmly near 1.3360, reflecting relative outperformance against the dollar ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement. Since early November, GBP/USD has rallied from 1.3150 lows, breaking key resistance levels that capped price action throughout Q3.\nDerivatives traders have increased exposure to upside bets \u2014 call volume on the pound rose 26% week-over-week, indicating growing conviction in extended dollar softness. The breakout above 1.3300, once a ceiling through 2024, now acts as a structural support base.\nStill, market participants warn of a \u201cbuy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact\u201d dynamic. Once the Fed confirms its first rate cut, the greenback could stage a short-term recovery if profit-taking accelerates. Historical context supports this \u2014 during the 2019 easing cycle, the dollar rallied 1.8% within two sessions post-cut.\nU.K. Outlook and BoE Policy Outlook\nAcross the Atlantic, the Bank of England (BoE) faces its own inflection point. The central bank is expected to trim rates by 25 bps to 3.75% on December 18, responding to soft growth and moderating inflation. The U.K.\u2019s Q3 GDP grew only 0.1% QoQ, while wage pressures are easing from 7.7% to 6.9% annually.\nWhile the BoE\u2019s anticipated move should weigh on GBP longer-term, the relative policy divergence still favors the pound near-term: the Fed\u2019s policy pivot appears deeper, with cumulative 75\u2013100 bps of cuts projected by mid-2026. This divergence explains why GBP/USD continues to attract capital inflows even amid fragile U.K. fundamentals.\nTechnical Structure: Breakout Still Developing\nFrom a technical standpoint, GBP/USD is consolidating above 1.3330, with intraday resistance at 1.3365 \u2014 the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A sustained close above that level opens the door to 1.3471, the October swing high, followed by 1.3500, where the pair last encountered multi-month resistance.\nKey support levels remain at 1.3300, 1.3250, and 1.3186. A failure to defend 1.3186 could invalidate the bullish bias and signal a corrective pullback toward 1.3040. Indicators favor the bulls for now \u2014 the RSI holds at 61, while the MACD histogram prints a widening bullish divergence.\nMarket Volatility and Strategy Considerations\nVolatility expectations are climbing ahead of back-to-back Fed and BoE meetings. The implied volatility (1-week tenor) for GBP/USD rose to 8.6%, up from 6.1% last week. This reflects a market bracing for policy-driven swings similar to those seen in the 2024 pivot, when volatility briefly exceeded 10.4%.\nTraders positioned for upside are favoring call spreads targeting 1.3450\u20131.3500, while option writers are collecting premium through short puts at 1.3200, betting that support holds. Futures positioning data shows leveraged funds now net long GBP by 28,000 contracts, up from 18,000 a month ago \u2014 the highest since early 2023.\nIntermarket Correlations: GBP Tracks Broader Dollar Slide\nThe dollar\u2019s weak"

On the downside, below 0.6604 minor support will turn intraday bias neutral and bring consolidations, before staging another rise.\nIn the bigger picture, the break of multi-year falling trend line resistance suggests that rise from 0.5913 is possibly reversing whole down trend from 08006 (2021 high). Decisive break of 38.2% retracement of 0.8006 to 0.5913 at 0.6713 will solidify this case, and bring further rally to 61.8% retracement at 0.7206. On the downside, however, firm break of 0.6420 support will suggest rejection by 0.6713 and retain medium term bearishness.\nIn the long term picture, fall from 0.8006 is seen as the second leg of the corrective pattern from 0.5506 long term bottom (2020 low). Hence, in case of deeper decline, strong support should emerge above 0.5506 to contain downside to bring reversal. On the upside, firm break of 0.6941 will argue that the third leg has already started back to 0.8006 and above."

The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points to a range of 3.50%\u20133.75%, while the Bank of Japan prepares for a possible rate hike to 0.75%, its highest level since 1995. The narrowing yield differential\u2014now just 1.81 percentage points between U.S. and Japanese 10-year bonds\u2014marks the smallest spread in nearly a decade, reshaping carry trade dynamics that have long defined USD/JPY movement.\nJapan\u2019s Inflation Pressure and Wage Growth Ignite Monetary Shift\nTokyo\u2019s core CPI rose 3.0% year-over-year in November, remaining above the 2% target for 43 consecutive months. Coupled with average wage growth exceeding 5%, the Bank of Japan now faces inflation driven by domestic demand, not only by import costs. BOJ officials signaled readiness to tighten at the December 18\u201319 policy meeting, with an 80% market-implied probability of a 0.25% hike. This potential move would push Japan closer to policy normalization after years of ultra-loose conditions and could sustain yen demand into early 2026.\nFederal Reserve Turns Dovish as Liquidity Expands and Dollar Weakens\nIn contrast, the Federal Reserve\u2019s halt of balance sheet reduction and potential rate cut inject fresh liquidity into U.S. markets. M2 money supply rose to $22.3 trillion in November, while expectations for three total cuts in 2025 are priced in. The DXY index remains below 100, reflecting persistent dollar weakness amid falling Treasury yields. The 10-year yield has eased to 3.72%, down from 4.3% earlier in the quarter, reducing demand for dollar-denominated assets. As Fed Chair Powell signals flexibility, USD/JPY remains vulnerable to short-term downward pressure.\nCarry Trade Unwinds as Japanese Assets Regain Global Appeal\nThe yen\u2019s rebound is being driven by the partial unwinding of the $5 trillion USD/JPY carry trade, which had financed global investments in U.S. equities and emerging-market debt. Japan\u2019s rising yields now attract repatriation of capital, with Japanese investors selling $12.7 billion in U.S. Treasuries in November. This reversal, combined with the BOJ\u2019s hawkish stance, strengthens the yen and challenges the long-standing assumption that Japan\u2019s rates will remain near zero. Analysts estimate that if the yield gap falls below 1.5 percentage points, at least $600 billion could flow back into Japanese markets, amplifying yen strength and pressuring USD/JPY toward the 153.00\u2013151.00 zone.\nTechnical View: Bearish Momentum Deepens, Key Supports in Focus\nTechnically, USD/JPY has broken its aggressive uptrend line established since October. The pair faces stiff resistance at 157.90 and 158.88, the yearly highs. Immediate support lies at 153.30, aligning with the 50-day moving average, followed by 151.55 and 151.00 as deeper targets if momentum accelerates. The RSI sits near the neutral 50 level, while MACD remains below zero, confirming a bearish bias. Price action below 154.45 could validate further downside, while only a break above 157.90 would restore short-term bullish control.\nMarket Sentiment and Positioning Ahead of Dual Policy Announcements\nTraders are positioning cautiously before the FOMC decision and BOJ meeting, viewing the dual events as pivotal for the yen\u2019s trajectory. The CFTC data shows Japanese net long positions at \u00a5681,000 contracts, up sharply from \u00a570,400 the prior week, reflecting growing speculative demand for yen exposure.

                "body": "USD/JPY fell for the second week as key economic indicators and hawkish BoJ chatter fueled market bets on Fed rate cuts and a BoJ rate hike.\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled a rate hike, citing wage growth and easing US tariff risks. The BoJ Governor also fueled uncertainty about the number of rate hikes to reach monetary policy normalization, sending Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) to their highest level since Q3 2007.\nRising bets on a BoJ rate hike coincided with softer US inflation figures, supporting a more dovish Fed rate path. The US Core PCE Price Index rose by 2.8% year-on-year in September, down from 2.9% in August. The prospect of BoJ rate hikes and Fed rate cuts set the stage for a USD/JPY drop below 150. A yen carry trade unwind would likely trigger a sharper fall toward 140.\nBelow, we examine the upcoming economic calendar, the medium-term catalysts (4-8 weeks), and the technical levels traders should watch.\nIn the week ahead, Japanese economic indicators and BoJ commentary will fuel speculation about a December rate hike. Key data includes finalized Q3 GDP, wage growth, and producer prices.\nOn Monday, December 8, finalized GDP figures will face scrutiny after preliminary data showed a 0.4% quarter-on-quarter contraction in the third quarter. Softer private consumption and a drop in external demand affected the economy. Revisions to third-quarter components will be key as traders consider the December 19 BoJ interest rate decision.\nUpward revisions to private consumption and external demand would boost yen demand, sending USD/JPY lower.\nHowever, wage data will also require attention, given the BoJ\u2019s focus on wage growth. Economists forecast average cash earnings to rise 2.2% year-on-year in October, up from 1.9% in September.\nStronger wage growth would suggest a pickup in consumer spending, fueling demand-driven inflation. Moreover, a rebound in spending would lift economic momentum, given that private consumption accounts for roughly 55% of Japan\u2019s GDP.\nOn Tuesday, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda will be in the spotlight after last week\u2019s hawkish spin. Further hints of a rate hike would strengthen the yen, pushing USD/JPY lower.\nSince last week\u2019s hawkish comments, Japanese economic data sent mixed signals. Services sector inflation edged higher in November, with consumer confidence improving, supporting a more hawkish BoJ policy stance. However, household spending unexpectedly plunged 3.5% month-on-month in October, weighing on the yen.\nDespite the household spending slump, Governor Ueda will likely maintain his hawkish position. Wage negotiations for the 2026 cycle have reportedly been positive, and the weaker yen continues to raise concerns about import prices and household purchasing power.\nOn Wednesday, December 10, producer prices will provide insights into the demand backdrop and inflation outlook. Economists forecast producer prices to rise 0.3% month-on-month in November, down from 0.4% in October, and an increase of 2.7% year-on-year (October: 2.7%).\nA larger-than-expected rise in producer prices would indicate a pickup in consumer prices. Typically, producers adjust prices based on demand, passing cost savings or price hikes on to consumers.\nThese forecasts align with the bearish short- to medium-term outlook for USD/JPY.\nFollow our real-time updates to stay ahead of USD/JPY market developments.\nAs speculation intensifies about a BoJ rate hike, the Fed will deliver its final interest rate decision of the year, setting the stage for a volatile week. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s decision, labor market data will draw interest, while inflation figures will influence bets on a Q1 2026 rate cut.\nKey data releases for the week ahead include:\nWeaker labor market data and softer producer prices would weaken demand for the US dollar, sending USD/JPY lower. However, the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision, economic projections, and Fed Chair Powell\u2019s press conference will be the key drivers for the US dollar and the"

                "body": "- Fed decision and dot plot are the key risk for USD/JPY\n- 25bp cut expected, but tone, vote split and dots will drive reaction\n- Hawkish cut risks upside, dovish dots could sink the dollar\n- Technical picture neutral, leaving price action to guide direction\nUSD/JPY Summary\nUSD/JPY enters a critical week dominated by the Fed. While Japanese yields have influenced recent moves, that theme takes a back seat to Wednesday\u2019s FOMC decision. A 25bp cut is widely expected, but the real volatility trigger will be the statement, vote split and updated dot plot. With technical signals offering no clear bias, Powell\u2019s tone could tip the scales, setting up a decisive move for the pair.\nBOJ Speculation Is Moving the Yen\nWhat\u2019s noticeable in the five and 10-day correlation coefficients in the middle and right-hand panes of the graphic below is that USD/JPY has had a far stronger relationship with Japanese bond yields recently, flipping the script on what is usually seen, where it\u2019s the U.S. rate outlook that tends to influence direction.\nSource: TradingView\nFor large parts of November, USD/JPY and Japanese rates were positively correlated, with higher yields driven by increased fiscal spending contributing to weakness in the yen, presumably on concerns about servicing Japan\u2019s enormous debt load. However, over recent weeks the relationship has flipped entirely, with a tight inverse relationship now evident. Higher yields driven by speculation over a rate hike from the Bank of Japan on 19 December now seem to be supporting the yen.\nOver the past fortnight, the correlation coefficient between USD/JPY and Japanese two and 10-year bond yields sit at -0.89 and -0.91 respectively, far stronger than anything seen with yield spreads, U.S. yields or volatility measures such as VIX futures over the same period. That means for USD/JPY traders, the week is not just about what the Fed does. Events that influence Japanese bond yields could easily impact the yen.\nBut Fed May Flip the Script\nZooming in, while the relationship between USD/JPY and Japanese yields remains intact, the strength weakened a touch over the latter part of last week, replaced by a strengthening relationship with short-end U.S. interest rates, which are heavily influenced by monetary policy expectations from the Fed. That was evident on Friday, where pricing for Fed rate cuts out to the end of next year skidded to just 78.5 basis points of easing, down from over 90 basis points at the start of December. That coincided with a meaningful bounce in USD/JPY, underlining that the key event for USD/JPY traders will be the FOMC decision on Wednesday.\nSource: TradingView\nDots, Dissents and Powell\nUnless the Fed stuns markets by doing something other than reducing the funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5 to 3.75% as is favoured, what\u2019s likely to drive the rates reaction and USD/JPY is what the Fed offers in terms of forward guidance on the policy path moving forward.\nClues may be found in the statement, both through wording and the vote split for and against the decision. As was the case last meeting, Stephen Miran will likely vote for a 50 basis point cut, but that should not come as a surprise. What will be more interesting is how many members vote to keep policy unchanged. There was one dissenting member last meeting, and there may well be more on Wednesday given the vastly differing opinions offered by members prior to the Fed\u2019s media blackout.\nThe perception is the FOMC is divided between inflation hawks and labour market doves, so that\u2019s what will be expected. What would likely deliver a meaningful market reaction would be if the vast majority of the committee vote in favour of a 25-point reduction, likely bolstering pricing for rate cuts next year and weighing on USD/JPY.\nBeyond the statement, it will be all about what the updated dot plot of individual year-end rate forecasts shows, along with the tone from Jerome Powell at his post-meeting press conference which will likely "

Meanwhile, the US dollar came under pressure from intensifying expectations of a Fed rate cut.\nIf you are interested in automated forex trading, check our detailed guide-\nWhat happened last week\nOn Friday, the official Canada employment data showed 53,600 new jobs in November, while the unemployment rate dropped to 6.5%, well below expectations. The strong figures renewed confidence that the Bank of Canada is in pause mode at least if not completely done with the easing.\nAt the same time, oil prices, being a key driver of CAD, ticked higher as global energy markets remained firm, adding further support to the loonie. The USD/CAD prices reached below 1.3900, the weakest level in around two months.\nFrom the US, the growing conviction that the Fed will cut rates next week has weakened the dollar. Following the recent mixed signals on inflation and labor, markets now price in a 90% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut. This continues to weigh on the greenback broadly.\nWhat could happen next week?\nThe three major scenarios persist for the next week:\n- If oil prices stay firm and Canada\u2019s economic momentum holds, the USD/CAD could face further downside pressure, especially if US data remains negative.\n- If the US jobs data comes upbeat while the Fed maintains a hawkish tone, the pair could face upward pressure towards 1.4000 and above.\n- If the US data remains mixed while the BoC leaves a neutral tone, the price could stay in a familiar range near 1.3900.\nMajor USD/CAD Events to Watch Next Week\nThe key events ahead include:\n- Bank of Canada Overnight Rate\n- Bank of Canada Press Statement\n- US JOLTs Job Openings\n- US Weekly ADP Employment\n- FOMC Rate Decision\n- Fed Chair Press Conference\n- US Employment Cost Index\n- US Jobless Claims\nThe Fed Chair\u2019s statement remains pivotal, as the markets have already priced in the rate cut decision.\nUSD/CAD Weekly Technical Forecast: Bearish Below 200-DMA\nThe USD/CAD daily chart shows Friday\u2019s candle piercing below the 100-day and 200-day MAs near 1.3900, while the 20-day and 50-day MAs are going to form a bearish crossover.

That kind of data caught investors off guard and shifted bets firmly toward the Bank of Canada holding interest rates steady at next week\u2019s meeting, scrapping talk of a rate cut anytime soon. Now, the market fully expects a rate hike sometime in 2026 \u2013 a shift from just 20% odds before the report. Higher oil prices boosted the momentum, as US crude rose 1.2% to $60.37 a barrel, giving more lift to the Canadian dollar and pushing two-year government bond yields to their highest since early September. With core inflation remaining above the central bank's target, economists point out that these combined forces make a strong case for the Bank of Canada to keep policy tight.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: The loonie leads the charge.\nStrong hiring and rising oil prices have given the Canadian dollar fresh energy, catching markets off guard after months of expecting easier monetary policy. Bond yields are climbing, which means higher borrowing costs across the economy and more pain for sectors sensitive to rate changes. It\u2019s a reminder that the loonie can quickly turn into a top performer when the right data lines up.\nThe bigger picture: Canada bucks the global trend.\nPersistently robust employment and steady energy exports are making investors rethink what Canada can weather. Instead of gearing up for looser policy, attention has shifted to whether the economy can handle tighter conditions next year.

                "body": "Dollar spent most of the week pinned to the bottom of the performance board, as a steady flow of data reinforced expectations for a Fed rate cut in December. Even though selling pressure eased slightly into Friday\u2014thanks in part to a surprisingly firm rebound in longer-dated Treasury yields\u2014the greenback still struggled to find a foothold.\nRisk sentiment improved across major markets, and that shift alone did much of the heavy lifting. The notable underperformance of the Swiss Franc highlighted the change in tone, with safe-haven demand fading while yields elsewhere climbed. Euro was also heavy.\nAgainst that backdrop, the outperformers told their own story. Aussie surged to the top of the weekly rankings as traders began to position for the possibility of an RBA hike in 2026. Governor Michele Bullock\u2019s message to the parliament\u2014signaling that policymakers may need to pivot back toward tightening if inflation re-accelerates\u2014gave markets a narrative they were quick to embrace.\nCanada\u2019s Dollar was not far behind, propelled by another impressive labor-market beat that further cemented expectations for the BoC to hold rates unchanged through 2026. Sterling also benefited from persistent optimism following the well-received Autumn Budget, helping it round out the top three.\nYen and Kiwi held the middle ground but for very different reasons. In Japan, rising expectations for a December BoJ rate hike were tempered by stronger global risk appetite. For Kiwi, the tone was firm but restrained, with investors largely respecting the RBNZ\u2019s hawkish hold last month, without chasing the move.\nUS Stocks Hold Their Nerve, but Santa Needs More Data\nWhether US equities are entering a genuine Santa Claus rally remains an open question, but last week\u2019s performance at least showed that dip buyers are still very much alive. The brief pullback in mid-November was swiftly absorbed, with major indexes defending near-term technical supports and re-establishing upward momentum. That resilience alone keeps the year-end rally narrative on the table.\nStill, the conviction behind the move is less than overwhelming. Many investors are reluctant to chase the highs given the sheer volume of event risk ahead. Markets have already fully priced in a Fed rate cut this month, and incoming data last week largely validated that view. What remains uncertain is the path beyond December, and that lack of clarity is holding sentiment in check.\nThe next two weeks could change that. The December 10 FOMC meeting is clearly a consequential one\u2014not because of the cut itself, which markets assume\u2014but because of the updated economic projections and the new dot plot. These will effectively set the tone for how aggressively the Fed expects to\u2014or is willing to\u2014ease through early 2026.\nIn parallel, the following week\u2019s heavy-weight data\u2014NFP and CPI\u2014will give markets a more concrete read on whether pricing pressures are merely stabilizing at a still-elevated level, and whether the deterioration of job market is already in the rear mirror. For equities, \u201cbad news is good news\u201d still applies, but only up to a point. Softer data would strengthen the case for earlier or deeper Fed cuts, thereby supporting valuations.\nFed fund futures, meanwhile, reflects a lot of uncertainty. The odds of another 25bps cut by March sit just under 50%, essentially a coin toss. That pricing highlights how divided the market is on whether the Fed pauses in Q1 or continues easing. Until that gap closes one way or the other, equities could remain reactive rather than directional.\nTechnically, for DOW, break of 48,431.57 will resume the long term up trend to 78.6% projection of 28,660.94 to 45,701.29 from 36,611.78 at 49,510.32, or even further to 50k psychological level in the near term. However, on the downside, break of 47,263.92 support will suggest that corrective pattern from 48,431.57 has started a third leg, and would target 47,528.93 support again.\nSimilarly, break of 24,019.99 will resume NASDAQ\u2019s up t"

Firm break of 208.09 high will resume the up trend from 123.94 (2020 low). Next target is 61.8% projection of 148.93 to 208.09 from 184.35 at 220.90. However, decisive break of 199.04 support will dampen this view and extend the corrective pattern with another fall.\nIn the long term picture, there is no sign that the long term up trend from 122.75 (2016 low) has concluded.

                "body": "- Fed decision and dot plot are the key risk for USD/JPY\n- 25bp cut expected, but tone, vote split and dots will drive reaction\n- Hawkish cut risks upside, dovish dots could sink the dollar\n- Technical picture neutral, leaving price action to guide direction\nUSD/JPY Summary\nUSD/JPY enters a critical week dominated by the Fed. While Japanese yields have influenced recent moves, that theme takes a back seat to Wednesday\u2019s FOMC decision. A 25bp cut is widely expected, but the real volatility trigger will be the statement, vote split and updated dot plot. With technical signals offering no clear bias, Powell\u2019s tone could tip the scales, setting up a decisive move for the pair.\nBOJ Speculation Is Moving the Yen\nWhat\u2019s noticeable in the five and 10-day correlation coefficients in the middle and right-hand panes of the graphic below is that USD/JPY has had a far stronger relationship with Japanese bond yields recently, flipping the script on what is usually seen, where it\u2019s the U.S. rate outlook that tends to influence direction.\nSource: TradingView\nFor large parts of November, USD/JPY and Japanese rates were positively correlated, with higher yields driven by increased fiscal spending contributing to weakness in the yen, presumably on concerns about servicing Japan\u2019s enormous debt load. However, over recent weeks the relationship has flipped entirely, with a tight inverse relationship now evident. Higher yields driven by speculation over a rate hike from the Bank of Japan on 19 December now seem to be supporting the yen.\nOver the past fortnight, the correlation coefficient between USD/JPY and Japanese two and 10-year bond yields sit at -0.89 and -0.91 respectively, far stronger than anything seen with yield spreads, U.S. yields or volatility measures such as VIX futures over the same period. That means for USD/JPY traders, the week is not just about what the Fed does. Events that influence Japanese bond yields could easily impact the yen.\nBut Fed May Flip the Script\nZooming in, while the relationship between USD/JPY and Japanese yields remains intact, the strength weakened a touch over the latter part of last week, replaced by a strengthening relationship with short-end U.S. interest rates, which are heavily influenced by monetary policy expectations from the Fed. That was evident on Friday, where pricing for Fed rate cuts out to the end of next year skidded to just 78.5 basis points of easing, down from over 90 basis points at the start of December. That coincided with a meaningful bounce in USD/JPY, underlining that the key event for USD/JPY traders will be the FOMC decision on Wednesday.\nSource: TradingView\nDots, Dissents and Powell\nUnless the Fed stuns markets by doing something other than reducing the funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5 to 3.75% as is favoured, what\u2019s likely to drive the rates reaction and USD/JPY is what the Fed offers in terms of forward guidance on the policy path moving forward.\nClues may be found in the statement, both through wording and the vote split for and against the decision. As was the case last meeting, Stephen Miran will likely vote for a 50 basis point cut, but that should not come as a surprise. What will be more interesting is how many members vote to keep policy unchanged. There was one dissenting member last meeting, and there may well be more on Wednesday given the vastly differing opinions offered by members prior to the Fed\u2019s media blackout.\nThe perception is the FOMC is divided between inflation hawks and labour market doves, so that\u2019s what will be expected. What would likely deliver a meaningful market reaction would be if the vast majority of the committee vote in favour of a 25-point reduction, likely bolstering pricing for rate cuts next year and weighing on USD/JPY.\nBeyond the statement, it will be all about what the updated dot plot of individual year-end rate forecasts shows, along with the tone from Jerome Powell at his post-meeting press conference which will likely "

The ETF\u2019s decline came amid a massive $194.6 million combined outflow from all U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs on Thursday \u2014 the largest single-day withdrawal since November 20.\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT alone accounted for $112.9 million of that total, representing over 58% of net redemptions. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC followed with $54.2 million in outflows, while VanEck\u2019s HODL, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, and Bitwise\u2019s BITB also reported redemptions. Trading volume across all spot Bitcoin ETFs fell sharply to $3.1 billion, down from $4.2 billion a day earlier, signaling waning institutional activity ahead of key U.S. inflation and Federal Reserve data.\nBTC-USD Consolidates Below $90,000 as ETF Flows Shift to Defensive Mode\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) slipped 1.4% over the last 24 hours, trading around $89,439 after recovering from a brief dip near $84,000 earlier in the week. The coin remains under pressure as futures-spot spreads narrow below break-even, forcing arbitrage funds to unwind basis trades. Analysts from LVRG Research report that leveraged desks closed positions as the CME premium collapsed, draining liquidity from Bitcoin ETFs and dragging down IBIT along with other spot products.\nMarket sentiment turned cautious as accumulation slowed and exchange inflows climbed. Glassnode data show exchange balances at 1.8 million BTC, the lowest level since 2017 \u2014 evidence that long-term holders continue to withdraw coins from exchanges, while short-term participants rotate into cash ahead of macro catalysts.\nETF Rotation Highlights Diverging Investor Sentiment Across Assets\nThe flight from Bitcoin ETFs stands in stark contrast to rising inflows into XRP ETFs, which logged $10.23 million in net purchases on Friday, bringing total holdings to $861.23 million. Investors are gradually diversifying across regulated altcoin products, with XRP\u2019s momentum echoing the early adoption stage of BTC spot ETFs in 2024. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs reversed sharply with $41.6 million in outflows, led by Grayscale\u2019s ETHE, reflecting cautious positioning in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s December 10 policy announcement.\nInstitutional investors appear to be temporarily rotating out of Bitcoin exposure toward shorter-duration risk assets, waiting for confirmation that rate cuts will materialize. Bank of America expects a 25 bps cut this month and two additional in 2026, but traders remain skeptical until official guidance is issued.\nBitcoin ETF Market Dynamics \u2014 From Launch Euphoria to Structural Consolidation\nThe current retracement marks a notable shift from the exuberance seen earlier in the year when cumulative Bitcoin ETF inflows exceeded $57 billion within the first 20 months of trading. Since the January 2024 approval, IBIT and FBTC have dominated the landscape, capturing nearly 75% of all spot ETF volume. The recent $194.6 million withdrawal, though significant, represents less than 0.35% of total Bitcoin ETF assets under management \u2014 suggesting that the move is corrective rather than panic-driven.\nAt its 2025 peak, IBIT\u2019s price reached $71.82, marking a 67% premium from its year low of $42.98. The ETF\u2019s current valuation near $50.69 keeps it 29% below its mid-year average, but technicals indicate solid support around $49.80\u2013$50.00, where institutional bids are expected to stabilize price action.\nCorrelation Between ETF Flows and BTC-USD Price Action\nSince their debut, Bitcoin spot ETFs have shown a 0.87 correlation with the underlying asset.

That price comes just as the network was poised to ship its Fusaka upgrade earlier this week, and as spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. continue to pull in institutional capital.\nDo those strengths, among others, make Ethereum the single best cryptocurrency to buy while it's under $4,000 today, or is there a better option?\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThis network is (still) attacking the pain points that kept people away\nPerhaps the biggest argument in favor of buying Ethereum at any price is that when you buy Ethereum, you're buying exposure to the single biggest and most important platform for decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset tokenization, and smart contract finance. Despite this year's volatility, Ethereum still hosts the largest pool of total value locked (TVL) into DeFi of any chain, with $65.6 billion.\nFusaka, the chain's newest update, is designed to reinforce that position by making the network's gas fees cheaper for users and more scalable in real usage for decentralized app developers and operators. In particular, Layer-2 (L2) rollup networks are expected to see their transaction costs fall by roughly 40% to 60%, which should help them to take on some additional traffic and relieve even more congestion on the main Ethereum network. Fusaka also adds a mechanism that makes fees less likely to surge during busy periods. Taken together, these structural changes could make Ethereum's perennial bad habit of meteoric fee spikes during periods of heavy network load a thing of the past, which could in turn make its user experience a lot less frustrating.\nBut if you are thinking of buying Ethereum at $3,100 on the expectation that Fusaka will instantly turn it into a low-fee paradise like Solana, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. If it's anything like past updates, including the Pectra package launched earlier this year, improvements to gas fee economics will be incremental and will still leave the chain with dramatically higher fees than some of its competitors.\nIs there a better investment?\nSo is Ethereum the best cryptocurrency under $4,000?\nIf you want a single growth-oriented crypto investment centered around exposure to the growth of DeFi and/or smart contract finance, the only real competitor to Ethereum is Solana. Solana is faster and cheaper to use, but its DeFi segment is far smaller with only $8.7 billion in TVL. And considering that capital tends to beget inflows of more capital, it's presently hard to say that Solana is clearly a better option based on the above criteria.\nAdvertisement\nBut if you're starting a new crypto portfolio from zero, and you're not too concerned about which drivers the upside is going to come from, Bitcoin is probably the better core holding for you. Ethereum has many more moving parts, many more competitive threats, and much more technology risk compared to Bitcoin. But buying Ethereum is still a reasonable second position for investors who already own some Bitcoin and who are comfortable taking on more complexity in exchange for potential extra upside.\nIn practice, that means Ethereum under $4,000 is somewhat attractive to purchase, but only if you size your position appropriately (which means for now, keeping it on the small side) and are prepared to hold through another full cycle of upgrades, ecosystem development, and a lot of competitive jostling along the way. If you can do that, the odds look favorable that today's price will "

                "body": "On Thursday, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) products will begin trading for the first time on its registered futures exchanges.\nHere are three reasons why this is a big deal for the top two cryptocurrencies heading into 2026.\nKey takeaways:\nCFTC oversight gives BTC and ETH gold-like legitimacy, opening the door to larger institutional flows.\nRegulated US trading boosts liquidity, cuts volatility, and shifts crypto activity back onshore.\nBitcoin and Ethereum can scale like gold\nOne of the strongest historical parallels for the CFTC decision came from the gold market .\nWhen gold was formally opened to trading on regulated US futures exchanges in the 1970s, the shift transformed it from a fragmented, over-the-counter commodity into a globally recognized investment asset.\nLiquidity concentrated on COMEX, institutions entered for the first time, and transparent price discovery created a foundation for long-term capital flows.\nSince its COMEX debut, spot gold prices gained 4,000%, illustrating how regulatory clarity can reshape an asset\u2019s market trajectory.\nXAU/USD yearly performance chart. Source: TradingViewThe CFTC placed Bitcoin and Ethereum under a similar commodity framework with its latest announcement, thus removing the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) issuer-focused requirements.\nIt also filled a long-standing gap: US traders could access crypto on platforms like Coinbase and Kraken but lacked regulated spot leverage, deep liquidity tools, or exchange-level protections.\nThat absence forced liquidity offshore, with recent 2025 data showing Binance capturing roughly 41.1% of global spot activity, far ahead of US-based venues.\nWith regulated spot markets now approved domestically, Bitcoin and Ethereum gain the same structural foundation that helped gold evolve from a niche hedge into a mature, globally traded asset class.\nSource: XCFTC improves institutional exposure for BTC, ETH\nPension funds, banks, and hedge funds that previously sat on the sidelines can now treat Bitcoin and Ethereum like other CFTC-recognized commodities, with standardized rules, surveillance, and custody requirements.\nRelated: Can Bitcoin really be a store of value? What pension funds are starting to discover\n86% of institutional investors already have or plan to gain crypto exposure, and most increased their allocations in 2024 as US regulation improved, according to a joint survey conducted by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon in January.\nSource: XA majority also preferred accessing crypto through regulated investment rails, such as commodity exchanges or ETFs, rather than offshore venues.\nFollowing the CFTC decision, institutions can now access Bitcoin and Ethereum through regulated exchanges, audited custody, and supervised pricing, setting the stage for stronger, more durable mainstream adoption.\nBitcoin, Ether may see better liquidity growth\nHistorical evidence suggested that commodities expanded rapidly after debuting on regulated trading venues.\nA case in point is the launch of WTI oil futures in 1983, whose trading exploded from just 3,000 contracts in the first month to over 100,000 per month within a year, and then to over 2 million contracts per month by the late 1980s.\nWTI two-week chart. Source: TradingViewToday, WTI often exceeds a million contracts in daily volume, a testament to how regulation can foster colossal market growth.\nBitcoin and Ethereum can witness a similar liquidity boost, with CFTC-approved spot trading likely to attract many more US traders and market makers, thus increasing order book depth and reducing spreads.\nDeep liquidity and robust volume on US soil can also reduce volatility over time , as large buy or sell orders are more easily absorbed."

Analysts attributed the slide to liquidity concerns in the DeFi sector, which rattled investor confidence across digital-asset markets.\nMid-week trading saw some stabilisation. By Dec 5, Bitcoin had recovered to around US$92,500, fluctuating within a range of US$91,000-US$94,000, while Ethereum traded near US$3,178.\nDespite the rebound, both cryptocurrencies remained below recent highs, reflecting lingering market headwinds.\nMarket observers say the week underscores a broader \u201crisk-on/risk-off\u201d dynamic, driven by global monetary policy developments, institutional flows and market sentiment.\nBitcoin appears capped near the psychological US$100,000 level, while Ethereum showed pockets of strength, buoyed by ongoing institutional interest in Ethereum-linked products.\nLooking ahead, investors will be closely watching developments in global monetary policy, DeFi market stability and on-chain ETF flows, all of which could determine whether the current volatility transitions into a sustained recovery or further consolidation."

                "body": "The crypto ecosystem moves faster each month, but some updates shift the entire landscape. The launch of the Solana Base bridge feels like one of those moments. Coinbase and Chainlink worked together to open a direct link between Solana and Base. The move changes how users move value, build apps, and trade across networks.\nDevelopers pushed for simpler ways to link ecosystems for years. Many bridges created complexity or security issues. Chainlink offers a different path with better safety and cleaner design. The new Solana Base bridge uses Chainlink\u2019s interoperability protocol to transfer data, value, and messages across both chains with high speed. The update unlocks fresh opportunities for traders, builders, and liquidity providers.\nThis launch also strengthens the role of Chainlink inside the broader Web3 stack. Chainlink\u2019s protocol now powers many major chain connections. Solana and Base joining through one secure route signals an important shift. Users get faster movement, cheaper transactions, and new ways to use liquidity. Builders also gain simpler tools to design cross chain experiences.\nSolana leads with high throughput and low fees. Base grows fast because Coinbase supports it and thousands of apps adopt it. Chainlink secures data across the crypto world. Each chain has strength, but connecting them opens a much larger environment.\nThe Solana Base bridge allows developers to combine Solana\u2019s fast execution with Base\u2019s strong onboarding pipeline. Many users start their crypto journey on Coinbase. They now gain direct access to the Solana ecosystem without complex steps. This flow improves adoption and boosts new activity.\nThe connection also supports cross chain interoperability at scale. It brings better user experience because traders no longer bounce between several smaller bridges. One core route handles transfers, data, and coordination. This structure reduces friction and helps protocols build larger liquidity pools.\nUsers always want lower fees, faster execution, and clear steps. The Solana Base bridge delivers all three. Traders can move assets between both chains with fewer costs. DeFi users gain access to more opportunities on Solana and Base. NFT traders also unlock cross chain flows for collectibles, identity tokens, and digital items.\nDevelopers see even larger benefits. They now build one system that reaches two major user groups. They also reach Coinbase\u2019s strong community, which drives adoption for many new apps. This link makes cross chain interoperability practical instead of experimental.\nBuilders also use new blockchain bridge technology that reduces security issues. Instead of controlling their own fragile bridge, they rely on Chainlink\u2019s strong network. This shift frees up teams to focus on product, not infrastructure.\nThe launch marks more than an update. It signals a transition. Chains now work together as large modular systems. The Solana Base bridge creates a model for future connections. Each new link allows more liquidity, more utility, and more real use cases.\nUsers benefit because they no longer think in isolated chain silos. They choose apps that work best, then move assets with ease. Developers also gain universal access to large communities without extra cost. Over time, this model builds a more open and connected Web3. Chainlink also strengthens its role as the core layer for secure cross chain activity. As more chains join through one standard, builders gain confidence to scale bigger ideas."

The total stablecoin supply jumped from the low-teens to the mid-teens in billions, signaling capital deployment from institutional players rather than retail speculation. This liquidity expansion improves depth in DeFi markets, bolsters automated market maker efficiency, and enables larger transactional throughput for payment and settlement apps. The data suggests that the network\u2019s structural health is strengthening even as price action cools near the $132 zone, reinforcing that Solana\u2019s infrastructure growth remains intact beneath short-term volatility.\nRevolut Integration Adds Millions of Potential Users to Solana\u2019s Ecosystem\nA major catalyst emerged as Revolut integrated Solana\u2019s blockchain into its payments platform, granting direct on-chain access for millions of users. The update allows deposits, withdrawals, and transfers of SOL through Revolut\u2019s app\u2014transforming the token\u2019s accessibility across retail markets. Following the announcement, SOL-USD briefly broke through its descending channel, touching intraday highs around $145, before losing momentum. Technical resistance now sits at $146\u2013$150, with interim support forming between $128 and $130. Analysts highlight that if daily volume confirms the breakout, a secondary leg toward $155\u2013$175 could follow, but weak ETF inflows continue to limit confirmation.\nETF Outflows Pressure Market Confidence\nThe enthusiasm from Revolut\u2019s listing collided with institutional profit-taking. U.S.-listed Solana ETFs saw record single-day outflows during the first week of December, erasing nearly $110 million in managed assets. This mirrored a broader pullback across altcoin funds after Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped below $90,000, dragging sentiment into fear territory. With SOL-USD down roughly 5% on December 5, buyers retreated toward defensive positioning. For context, Solana remains 35% below its November highs near $200, but the chain continues to attract steady capital through decentralized protocols, evidenced by total value locked (TVL) climbing 14% month-over-month to $5.9 billion.\nTechnical Outlook \u2014 The $130 Inflection Zone\nFrom a chart perspective, SOL-USD is consolidating within a broad $120\u2013$150 horizontal range. Momentum indicators show mixed signals: the MACD remains in mild bearish territory, while Stoch RSI approaches oversold conditions. If buyers defend $130, a short-term rebound to $138\u2013$145 is plausible; failure to hold that level could trigger a slide toward $120 or even $118. The realized profit/loss ratio also reflects rising stress, as more holders are capitulating at a loss. Exchange net-position data from Glassnode shows alternating green and red bars, implying intermittent inflows and outflows\u2014a sign of uncertainty rather than directional conviction. Traders are watching for a decisive break above $145 before labeling a true reversal.\nMacro Context \u2014 Fed Cuts and Capital Rotation Support the Setup\nThe macro backdrop favors digital assets if liquidity expands. Bank of America expects the Federal Reserve to reduce rates by 25 bps in December and project two additional cuts in 2026, lowering the terminal rate to 3.00\u20133.25%. Historically, Solana rallies during early easing cycles as risk assets reprice higher. However, dissenting views\u2014such as investor Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stance that inflation may delay any cut\u2014create a split narrative, resulting in choppy trading conditions. Still, with bond yields"

These are all applications built on Base.\nPollak framed it as bidirectional pragmatism: Base apps want access to SOL and SPL tokens, Solana apps want access to Base liquidity, so Base spent nine months building the connective tissue.\nVibhu Norby, founder of Solana creator platform DRiP, saw it differently. He posted a video of Aerodrome co-founder Alexander Cutler, who said at Basecamp in September that Base would \u201cflip Solana\u201d and become the largest chain in the world.\nNorby\u2019s read:\n\u201cThese are not partners; if they had it their way Solana would not exist.\u201d\nPollak replied that Base just built a bridge to Solana because \u201cSolana assets deserve to have access to the Base economy and Base assets should have access to Solana.\u201d\nNorby fired back, alleging that Base didn\u2019t set up Solana-based applications for launch, nor did they align with the Solana Foundation marketing or operations team.\nThe thread escalated when Akshay BD, a top voice tied to Solana\u2019s Superteam, told Pollak:\n\u201cCalling it bidirectional doesn\u2019t make it so. It\u2019s a bridge between two economies that has net import/export result based on how you roll it out. I don\u2019t mind that you\u2019re competitive\u2026 I mind that you\u2019re being dishonest.\u201d\nAnatoly Yakovenko, Solana\u2019s co-founder, joined to deliver the sharpest version of the critique:\n\u201cMigrate Base apps to Solana so they execute on Solana and the transactions are linearized by Solana staked block producers. That would be good for Solana developers. Otherwise it\u2019s alignment bullshit.\u201d\nThe debate highlights the incentive mismatch between what \u201cinteroperability\u201d means to an Ethereum layer-2 and to an alternative layer-1 blockchain.\nBase sees the bridge as unlocking shared liquidity and cross-chain UX without relying on third-party infrastructure.\nPollak said Base announced the bridge in September, began discussing it with Yakovenko and others in May, and has consistently said it\u2019s bidirectional.\nHe insists that Base and Solana developers benefit from access to both economies.\nOn the contrary, Solana voices argue that the method Base used to launch the bridge, integrating only Base-aligned apps, coordinating no Solana-native partners, and skipping Solana Foundation outreach, reveals the real strategy: siphon Solana capital into Base\u2019s ecosystem while marketing it as reciprocal infrastructure.\nThe asymmetry\nAccording to Yakovenko, the bridge is bidirectional in code but not in economic gravity.\nIf the bridge just lets Base apps import Solana assets while keeping all execution and fee revenue on Base, it extracts value from Solana without reciprocating. That\u2019s the vampire attack thesis.\nPollak\u2019s counterargument is that interoperability is not zero-sum. He argues that Base and Solana can compete and collaborate simultaneously, and that developers on both sides want access to each other\u2019s economies.\nHe pointed out that Base tried to engage Solana ecosystem participants during the nine-month build process, but \u201cfolks weren\u2019t really interested.\u201d However, meme projects like Trencher and Chillhouse did collaborate.\nNorby and Akshay dispute that framing, arguing that dropping a repo without coordinating launch partners or working with the Solana Foundation is not genuine collaboration, it\u2019s tactical extraction dressed up as open-source infrastructure.\nThe friction is that Base and Solana occupy different positions in the liquidity hierarchy.\nBase is an E"

Explore key drivers, technical signals and market structure that affect the Dow\u2019s price action.\nImportant information: This article is for informational and educational purposes only. It does not constitute financial,investment advice or a solicitation to trade. All forecasting methods, scenarios, and examples are illustrative and subject to market uncertainty. It is essential to do research and due diligence to make the best possible judgment, as any purchases shall be your sole responsibility. All trading involves risk and you could lose your entire investment.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the world\u2019s most recognized equity benchmarks. But its movements behave differently from the US 500 or the Nasdaq, largely because it\u2019s a price-weighted index, not a market-cap-weighted one.\nThis guide explains the factors that typically influence the DJIA.\nUnderstanding the DJIA: What makes the Dow different?\n1. A price-weighted index, not market cap weighted\nUnlike the US 500, the Dow\u2019s movement is driven by the absolute dollar price of each stock, not its market capitalization.\n- Higher-priced components have more influence.\n- Stock splits reduce a company\u2019s weight.\n- A $10 move in UnitedHealth affects the index far more than a $10 move in Apple.\nThis can sometimes lead to instances where the Dow moves differently from broader indices, reflecting the influence of a few higher-priced components rather than market-wide performance.\n2. More \u2018old-economy\u2019 exposure\nThe Dow leans toward:\n- Industrials\n- Healthcare\n- Financials\n- Energy\n- Consumer staples\nAnd less toward:\n- High-growth tech\n- Software\n- Internet services\nBecause of this composition, the Dow has historically shown movement patterns that differ from technology-heavy benchmarks, particularly during periods when cyclical or value-oriented sectors are more active.\n3. Sector concentration and component selection\nThe Dow contains only 30 companies, making individual earnings reports more impactful compared to the US 500.\nKey influencers include:\n- UnitedHealth (UNH)\n- Goldman Sachs (GS)\n- Microsoft (MSFT)\n- Home Depot (HD)\n- McDonald\u2019s (MCD)\nLarge price swings in these higher-weighted components have, at times, resulted in noticeable movement in the index even if most other constituents remain relatively stable.\n4. Relationship with bonds, yields, economic data\nThe DJIA is highly sensitive to:\n- Interest rate expectations\n- Corporate earnings trends\n- Manufacturing and services data\n- Consumer spending\n- Geopolitical stability\nBecause many Dow components are established businesses with consistent cash-flow profiles, the index has historically shown sensitivity to changes in financing conditions and macroeconomic data releases.\n5. Lower volatility, but meaningful rotation signals\nWhile the Dow often exhibits lower volatility compared to technology-heavy indices, shifts within its constituent sectors have sometimes been viewed as reflections of broader sentiment toward economic conditions.\nEssential technical analysis tools referenced by traders\n1. Price action and key levels\nAnalysts sometimes reference round-number areas (such as 38,000 or 40,000) as psychological zones that have historically attracted increased market attention.\nThese levels are typically discussed in terms of how they have functioned as areas of buying or selling interest in past market conditions, rather than as predictive signals.\n2. Moving averages\nPopular reference points include:\n- 20-day: short-term behaviour\n- 50-day: intermediate trend\n- 200-day: longer-term context\nSome market observers use moving-average crossovers as a way to contextualize momentum shifts, rather than as indicators of future performance.\n3.

                "body": "Billionaire Warren Buffett Owns 6 Dow Jones Stocks. Here's My Top Buy for 2026.\nKey Points\nMany of Berkshire's top holdings are industry-leading companies that deliver consistent results.\nVisa has a predictable runway for future growth.\nThe payment processor just rewarded shareholders with over $22 billion in stock buybacks and dividends.\nWarren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) holds positions in over 40 publicly traded companies, six of which are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI).\nThe Dow has 30 components in total, and four out of five of Berkshire's largest holdings are Dow stocks: Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks \u00bb\nAdditionally, Berkshire owns Amazon, which was added to the Dow last year, and Visa (NYSE: V).\nHere's why Visa is my top buy of these six names for 2026.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nA high-margin cash cow\nBerkshire's public equity portfolio is worth approximately $302 billion. But its controlled businesses are arguably even more valuable. The crown jewel is its property and casualty insurance businesses. Given Berkshire's expertise in finding value in the financial sector, it's no surprise that it owns all three of the major credit card companies -- American Express, Visa, and Mastercard.\nVisa is the largest of the three, both in terms of market capitalization and transaction volume. The more cards that enter the Visa network, the greater the incentive for merchants worldwide to accept Visa, which boosts revenue that can be used to partner with even more financial institutions, in turn leading to more card issuances. Rinse and repeat.\nAs you can see in the chart, Visa is converting nearly half of its revenue into free cash flow (FCF) -- which showcases just how efficiently its business operates.\nV Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\nVisa's main expenses are related to maintaining and expanding its network, labor, and marketing. It's a very capital-light business model, especially considering that Visa partners with financial institutions to issue cards. By not issuing its own cards, Visa doesn't have to worry about bearing the credit risk. So it's not liable for how responsibly or irresponsibly its card users manage their spending.\nAnother benefit is that it doesn't have to pay its users rewards. That's also done by financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase's Chase Sapphire and Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Bank of America Customer Cash Rewards card, or the Wells Fargo Active Cash card, which are all Visa cards. By comparison, American Express spends more than double on cardmember perks than it collects in annual fees (but it makes up for that shortfall in other ways).\nVisa passes along its free cash flow to shareholders\nVisa's high-margin business makes it arguably the greatest cash cow in the financial services industry.\nBecause Visa has low capital expenditures, it is able to convert nearly all of its operating cash flow into FCF. Visa returns that FCF to shareholders through dividends and more, importantly, stock buybacks.\nAdvertisement\nData source: Visa. Fiscal year 2025 ended Sept. 30.\nIn Visa's 2025 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2025, the company returned roughly 4 times more cash through stock buybacks than dividends. Here lies Visa's ace in the hole. By using its FCF on buybacks over dividends, Visa consistently reduces its share count. With fewer shares to go around, Visa's earnings per share increase from the core business growing earnings as well as through a lower outstanding share count.\nBuybacks are a significant reason why Visa is still a good value. Despite Visa's stock price increasing over fourfold in the last decade, Visa's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still just 32.3 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is lower than its 10-year median P/E of 34"

                "body": "Simon Jack: Businesses left asking - what happened to growth?\nNot a single measure in the government's policy-packed Budget will change the growth forecast for the next five years - that was the damning assessment of the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Reponsibility (OBR).\nFor a government that has declared economic growth as its top priority it is surely a disappointment.\nWorse than that, although the OBR upgraded its growth forecast for this year \u2013 it downgraded them every year thereafter till 2030.\nAlthough businesses were relieved they didn't get clobbered the way they did at the last Budget - at which they were handed a \u00a325bn employer national insurance hike \u2013 genuinely significant pro-business measures were thin on the ground.\nLittle wonder many business leaders are asking: \"Where is the growth?\"\nEven the sectors that did get a mention as receiving special help \u2013 such as High Street retailers and hospitality \u2013 insist their costs of doing business are going to rise significantly through higher business rates and labour costs.\nBusiness rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices.\nThe government said it would calculate business rates for 750,000 High Street retail and hospitality firms using a lower percentage of the rateable value of premises, but this lower tax rate wasn't as generous as expected.\nAt the same time, many firms have seen their rateable value increase and face the phasing out of a Covid-era 40% discount from April.\nThe net result is that, despite some transitional relief, lots of them will see significant increases in their business rates bill.\nAn 8.5% pay rise for 18-20 year olds on the national living wage is good news for young people in work and an incentive for those who aren't to find a job, but on top of 16.3% rise for the same group last year, it may put employers off taking on new people.\nAdvertisement\nAs one FTSE 100 boss told the BBC: \"They are hurting the very people they are trying to help and it will mean fewer jobs, fewer hours, fewer premises, lower growth.\"\nThe cap on salary sacrifice arrangement will hit both workers and businesses, who may reduce future pension contributions, pay rises or investment in growing their business.\nBudget 2025\nOne measure that got little attention but could prove important is expanding schemes that give tax breaks for investors in young companies \u2013 the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trusts \u2013 and allow them to invest in companies that have grown bigger.\nA Treasury spokesperson said the economy was \"already outperforming forecasts\" and it was driving growth \"with billions of pounds in new capital spending, strong private investment and bold planning reforms\".\n\"This Budget doubles down on our long\u2011term plan to grow the economy and create good jobs,\" they added.\nThe truth is that any government or chancellor's ability to \"unleash\" growth is pretty limited.\nMost people just want not to be over-molested by tax and regulation and allowed to get on with their lives. On that score, this Budget is a big improvement on last year's.\nBy building in a lot more wiggle room in her tax and spending plans over the next five year, Rachel Reeves has reduced the likelihood we will need such a bewildering smorgasbord of policies next year.\nStability can be a powerful fertiliser for growth.\nThe former chief economist of the Bank of England Andy Haldane may have over egged it by saying that the \"fiscal fandango\" - the months of speculation before this year's Budget - was the single biggest reason for growth to flatline for the second half of the year, but it sure didn't help.\nAhead of the Budget, Steve Rigby, the boss of large private company Rigby told the BBC, \"we just hope [it] isn't too catastrophic for business and we can get on with it\".\nTest passed he says - but that's a pretty low bar for a government desperate for growth."

The FTSE 100\u2018s up a stunning 17% in the year to date, driven by surging demand for value shares.\nThe party\u2019s not over yet either, if City brokers are to believed.\nTake the following bangers: Rolls-Royce (LSE:RR), Lloyds (LSE:LLOY), and Prudential (LSE:PRU). Many analysts rank each of these FTSE 100 shares as brilliant Buys heading into 2026.\nAre they right?\nRolls-Royce\nOf the 17 who analyse Rolls-Royce shares, 11 rate the engineer as a Strong Buy. Given the firm\u2019s impressive momentum since the end of the pandemic, I\u2019m not wholly surprised.\nThe company\u2019s firing on all cylinders thanks to strength across its operations. A robust airline industry is driving demand for its plane engines and aftermarket services. Defence sales are recovering as Western countries rebuild their militaries. Rapid data centre growth is boosting activity at Power Systems.\nTo cap things off, restructuring work continues to outperform expectatations, boosting margins and cash flows.\nBut is the good news now baked into Rolls-Royce\u2019s share price? I think it may be.\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37 times, I think the stock may struggle to keep rising. I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s the Strong Buy most analysts think.\nLloyds\nBrokers are similarly impressed by the investment potential of Lloyds shares. Of the 19 analysts who cover the bank, 11 rank it as a Strong Buy.\nThere\u2019s more of an opinion split than with Rolls-Royce shares, though. One rates the company a Sell. Six have slapped a Hold rating on it. But overall, the City clearly likes its investment prospects.\nRobustness in the housing market and a pivot towards fee-based services as interest rates fall should support the bank\u2019s profits. Ongoing work to improve its digital banking proposition should also help drive growth.\nBut there are also significant risks here. Intense competition and interest rate cuts threaten margins. Loan growth is also uncertain as the UK economy struggles. Finally, the bank also faces huge misconduct costs for mis-selling car loans that are yet to be determined.\nLloyds\u2019 share price currently attracts a forward P/E ratio of 13 times. This is high from an historical perspective and fails to reflect those risks, in my opinion.\nPrudential\nI\u2019m far more convinced by Prudential\u2019s Buy credentials at the moment. Out of a total 18 brokers, 11 consider the financial services giant a Strong Buy.\nOf the remainder, four class it as a bog-standard Buy. One has placed a Hold on the FTSE firm.\nI\u2019m not surprised by the City\u2019s love-in given Prudential\u2019s continued outperformance. Economic bumpiness remains a problem in keymarkets like China. But the company continues to shrug off these troubles and punch terrific profits growth.\nNew business profit rose 13% during Q3, beating The Pru\u2019s short-term target of 10% once again. It has market-leading positions in the insurance and asset management segments, underpinning its momentum. And it has significant growth potential as wealth levels in Asia boom.\nPrudential\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 13.6 times is historically on the high side. But I think this quality business still offers good value on balance."

                "body": "Overview \u2013 A choppy but positive week for German equities\nThe German stock market ended the first week of December with a cautiously upbeat tone. The DAX 40 index finished Friday, 5 December, at 24,028.14 points, around 0.8% higher week-on-week and marking its second consecutive weekly gain. [1]\nAfter a sharp drop on Monday, the index clawed back losses on the back of:\n- Stronger\u2011than\u2011expected German factory orders for October,\n- Growing confidence in a Federal Reserve rate cut next week,\n- Political relief after Chancellor Friedrich Merz pushed a contentious pensions bill through parliament, and\n- Ongoing expectations that eurozone inflation will stay near the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) 2% target. [2]\nMid\u2011caps and tech names participated in the rebound: on Friday alone, the MDAX added about 0.3% and the TecDAX roughly 0.6%, while the main DAX 40 gained around 0.7%. [3]\nDAX 40 Weekly Performance: Weak Monday, Strong Finish\nDay\u2011by\u2011day moves on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nBased on exchange data, the DAX 40 traded as follows between Monday 1 December and Friday 5 December: [4]\n- Monday, 1 Dec \u2013 23,589.44 (\u20111.04%)\n- The DAX started December on the back foot as investors took profits after strong gains in late November. European indices opened the month lower, with cyclicals and defence names under pressure. [5]\n- Tuesday, 2 Dec \u2013 23,710.86 (+0.51%)\n- The index stabilised and moved modestly higher, tracking a broadly flat pan\u2011European session. Investors stayed cautious ahead of key U.S. inflation data and eurozone releases, but selective buying returned in large caps. [6]\n- Wednesday, 3 Dec \u2013 23,693.71 (\u20110.07%)\n- A classic consolidation day. The DAX drifted sideways with a slight loss as markets waited for new macro catalysts and clarity on the Fed\u2019s next move. [7]\n- Thursday, 4 Dec \u2013 23,882.03 (+0.79%)\n- German equities broke higher, with the DAX closing at a three\u2011week high near 23,900. Trading Economics and Dow Jones data show a gain of about 0.8% on the day, helped by a rally in autos and industrials as global risk appetite improved. [8]\n- Friday, 5 Dec \u2013 24,028.14 (+0.61%)\n- The index pushed back above the psychologically important 24,000 mark, briefly crossing 24,100 intraday \u2013 a level last seen in mid\u2011November \u2013 before settling near 24,028. [9]\n- According to Dow Jones and Investing.com, this left the DAX around 0.8% higher for the week, confirming a second weekly advance. [10]\nEuropean equities overall logged modest gains, with the STOXX 600 up roughly 0.4% week\u2011on\u2011week, as markets priced in a high probability of a 25 bps Fed rate cut next week. [11]\nMacro Backdrop: Mixed German Data, but Factory Orders Surprise on the Upside\nPMI shows manufacturing still in contraction\nThe week began with sobering news on the real economy. The HCOB Germany Manufacturing PMI for November fell to 48.2 from 49.6 in October, a nine\u2011month low and firmly below the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction. [12]\nKey details from the survey: [13]\n- New orders declined at the fastest pace in ten months,\n- Export demand weakened across Asia, Europe and North America,\n- Manufacturing employment continued to fall, and\n- Business confidence improved only marginally and remained below its long\u2011term average.\nIn short, Germany\u2019s industrial engine is still far from firing on all cylinders.\nIndustrial orders: one bright spot with caveats\nLater in the week, October industrial orders offered a rare positive surprise:\n- Orders rose 1.5% month\u2011on\u2011month, beating expectations for a 0.4% increase. [14]\n- The jump was driven by an 87% surge in \u201cother transport equipment\u201d orders, a category that includes aircraft, ships, trains and military hardware. [15]\n- Domestic orders rose 9.9%, which economists linked partly to Berlin\u2019s \u201cinvestment booster\u201d programme and increased defence spending. [16]\n- By contrast, foreign orders fell 4%, and a three\u2011month comparison showed total orders still 0.5% lower than in the previous three\u2011month period \u2013 evidence tha"

Discovery raised questions among investors.\n1 day ago \u2022 2 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nThe Nasdaq Composite racked up its fourth win in a row, rising 0.3%, as traders priced in a likely Federal Reserve rate cut next week and Netflix made headlines with a $72 billion offer for Warner Bros. Discovery.\nWhat does this mean?\nTech stocks took center stage, with the Nasdaq outperforming other major indexes thanks to renewed hopes for lower interest rates. The market is banking on an 87% chance of a Fed rate cut, backed by softer jobs data, cooling inflation, and weaker consumer spending. Communication services stocks shone after Netflix revealed plans for a mega-acquisition, though most other sectors\u2014particularly utilities\u2014lagged behind. The deal sent Netflix shares slightly lower, while Warner Bros. Discovery shares jumped, raising questions about regulatory approval and strategic direction for the streaming giant. Meanwhile, Victoria\u2019s Secret leapt 18% after upbeat holiday sales boosted its outlook, and oil prices edged higher amid ongoing global tensions.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate cut optimism meets merger scrutiny.\nIf the Fed slices rates, growth stocks could get another push, but higher Treasury yields\u2014like the two-year at 3.57% and ten-year at 4.14%\u2014are flashing caution for investors. Communication services are leading the pack, boosted by industry deals, while utilities are struggling. Netflix\u2019s bold move to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery is putting deal-making and regulation in the spotlight, as analysts debate whether this sets the stage for more media shakeups or exposes deeper challenges in big streaming platforms.\nThe bigger picture: Inflation anxiety continues to cool.\nAmericans are feeling more hopeful as expectations for future inflation fall to their lowest in nearly a year, according to the University of Michigan. A steadier job market and the prospect of higher tax refunds are helping ease consumers\u2019 minds. Still, there are crosscurrents: RBC Capital sees oil oversupply risks even as prices nudge up, and gold\u2019s small dip shows investors are still hedging. With Fed policy and major media mergers now in play, both businesses and households face an uncertain but possibly brighter road ahead.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nWeekly Brief\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 6 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ:SENE.A) stock is up an impressive 177% over the last five years. It's also up 11% in about a month.\nWhile this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Seneca Foods actually saw its EPS drop 1.0% per year.\nBy glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.\nWe are not particularly impressed by the annual compound revenue growth of 2.3% over five years. So why is the share price up? It's not immediately obvious to us, but a closer look at the company's progress over time might yield answers.\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Seneca Foods' earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nA Different Perspective\nIt's good to see that Seneca Foods has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 54% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 23% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Seneca Foods better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Seneca Foods .\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of undervalued small caps that insiders are buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place\nWe've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free.\n\u2022 Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\u2022 Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\u2022 Track the Fair Value of your stocks\nHave feedback on this article?

Dugger has started all five games alongside Jalen Ramsey since joining the Steelers before their Nov. 2 win over the Indianapolis Colts, and he has recorded 1 interception, 4 passes defensed and 23 combined tackles.\nWith Dugger out, the Steelers will likely turn to former Raven Chuck Clark, whom the team signed during training camp. The Steelers previously had safety Juan Thornhill on the roster but released him in late November.\nThough the Steelers will be without Dugger, swing tackle Calvin Anderson (knee) and defensive tackle Derrick Harmon, who was previously ruled out with a knee injury, the team will have quarterback Aaron Rodgers on the field for a second consecutive week as he continues to play through a fractured left wrist."

                "body": "The U.S. Navy released summaries for four separate investigations into incidents that involved the USS Harry S. Truman between December 2024 and May 2025.\nThe investigation looked into the Truman\u2019s collision with a merchant vessel, along with the loss of three F/A-18 Super Hornets.\n\u201cThese investigations assessed underlying procedural compliance and standards and reviewed how a Carrier Strike Group prepares for and responds to adversity during combat operations,\u201d the investigation summary read.\nVice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby vowed that the service would learn from the incidents, especially in light of the investigation\u2019s findings.\nKilby added that the Navy would continue to invest in its service members to ensure they were ready for future challenges.\nThe USS Harry S. Truman collided with the merchant vessel Besiktas-M on Feb. 12 near Port Said, Egypt. No injuries or flooding were reported.\nRELATED\nShortly after, the service relieved Capt. Dave Snowden, commanding officer of the USS Harry S. Truman, due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command.\nThe investigation found that the collision was avoidable and that the \u201ccarrier\u2019s bridge team failed to safely navigate past the merchant vessel.\u201d\nRegarding the collision, the incident \u201ccould have caused catastrophic results,\u201d the report concluded.\nBetween December 2024 and May 2025, the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group was plagued with errors involving jets that each costs approximately $60 million.\nThe USS Gettysburg shot down an F/A-18F Super Hornet in December 2024 in an act of friendly fire, an F/A-18F Super Hornet attempting to land on the USS Harry S. Truman in May toppled overboard and an F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet fell off the hangar deck of the Truman in April.\nThe investigation found that the friendly fire incident resulted from misidentification that stemmed from a \u201clack of integrated training opportunities between USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser, and lack of cohesion across the Carrier Strike Group.\u201d\nThe April incident in which the jet and a tow tractor fell from Truman\u2019s hangar bay occurred as a result of evasive maneuvers in response to an incoming ballistic missile in the Red Sea, the summary stated. The investigation attributed the jet\u2019s loss to an aircraft brake system failure, as well as poor communication between the bridge, flight deck control and hangar bay control.\nThe investigation further found that the failed landing of an F/A-18 that forced two pilots to eject in May arose from a failure of the #4 arresting wire aboard Truman that resulted from \u201ca malfunctioning #4 starboard sheave damper.\u201d\nThe report also cited inadequate maintenance practices, low manning levels, limited knowledge, insufficient training, high operational tempo and combat conditions as catalysts for the incident.\nRiley Ceder is a reporter at Military Times, where he covers breaking news, criminal justice, investigations, and cyber. He previously worked as an investigative practicum student at The Washington Post, where he contributed to the Abused by the Badge investigation."

According to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool, traders now see a higher chance of a cut at next week\u2019s meeting. That sense of certainty, plus some dovish hints from Fed officials, buoyed major equity indexes into year-end\u2014especially stateside, where Wall Street posted its second straight weekly gain, led by sectors like tech, energy, and communication services.

As the yield gap between the US and Japan narrows, funds that flocked to US markets may start to reverse, shaking up stocks, currencies, and commodities alike.

                "body": "Tokyo\u2019s stock market ended a volatile first week of December with the Nikkei 225 at 50,491.87 on Friday, up about 0.5%from the previous week, while the broader TOPIX finished at 3,362.56, down roughly 0.5% over the same period. [1]\nBehind those modest weekly moves was a dramatic tug\u2011of\u2011war: growing conviction that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will raise rates to 0.75% later this month, a sharp rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yields, a firmer yen, and global optimism that the U.S. Federal Reserve will deliver another rate cut in December. [2]\nKey takeaways for the week (Dec 1\u20136, 2025)\n- Nikkei 225: +0.5% week\u2011on\u2011week; still about 4% below its record high near 52,637 but trading close to historic levels. [3]\n- TOPIX: \u20130.5% on the week, even after touching a fresh 52\u2011week high area around 3,400 intraday on Thursday. [4]\n- Macro driver #1: Markets now treat a December BOJ rate hike to 0.75% as the base case, with odds around 80%+ after Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s hawkish speech. [5]\n- Macro driver #2: The 10\u2011year JGB yield climbed toward 1.95%, its highest level since 2007, keeping rate\u2011sensitive sectors, especially banks and exporters, on edge. [6]\n- Macro driver #3: The yen strengthened into the mid\u2011154 per dollar as BOJ hike bets grew while markets priced in a widely expected Fed rate cut next week. [7]\n1. Headline performance: Nikkei edges up, TOPIX slips\nNikkei 225\n- Previous Friday (Nov 28): 50,253.91\n- This Friday (Dec 5): 50,491.87\n- Weekly move: +237.96 points (about +0.47%) [8]\nThe Nikkei remains roughly 4.1% below its 52\u2011week high of 52,636.87, highlighting how close Japanese equities still are to record territory despite the recent pullback. [9]\nTOPIX\n- Previous Friday (Nov 28): 3,378.44\n- This Friday (Dec 5): 3,362.56\n- Weekly move: \u201315.88 points (about \u20130.47%) [10]\nTOPIX\u2019s 52\u2011week range runs from 2,243.21 to 3,400.28, with this week\u2019s high of 3,400.28 reached on Thursday before Friday\u2019s pullback. [11]\nThe divergence \u2014 Nikkei slightly up, TOPIX slightly down \u2014 reflects index composition: heavyweight exporters and tech names helped lift the Nikkei on days when broader, domestically oriented shares lagged.\n2. BOJ rate\u2011hike bets, JGB yields and the yen: the dominant story\nBOJ signals December hike to 0.75%\nOn Monday, December 1, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered his clearest signal yet that the central bank is ready to raise its policy rate from 0.5% to 0.75% at the December 18\u201319 meeting. He said the BOJ would weigh the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of a hike and described it as \u201ceasing off the accelerator rather than applying the brakes,\u201d stressing that real interest rates would remain deeply negative even after a move. [12]\nAfter the speech:\n- Markets quickly priced in roughly an 80% chance of a December hike, up from about 60% the previous week. [13]\n- The yen climbed, and 2\u2011year JGB yields \u2014 most sensitive to BOJ policy expectations \u2014 hit their highest levels since 2008. [14]\nA separate Reuters piece later in the week noted that investors now almost fully price a move to 0.75%, bringing the policy rate close to the bottom of the BOJ\u2019s estimated neutral range of 1\u20132.5%. [15]\nJGB sell\u2011off and \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d\nThe 10\u2011year JGB yield surged to around 1.94\u20131.95%, its highest level since mid\u20112007, before slipping back after a strong long\u2011bond auction. [16]\n- Analysts at Nomura Asset Management estimate that futures markets were pricing in about an 82% probabilityof a December hike, noting that higher yields had already done some of the tightening for the BOJ and triggered an early\u2011week stock sell\u2011off. [17]\n- Former BOJ officials told Reuters they expect the bank to adopt \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d on how far rates can rise, avoiding a precise target for the neutral rate to preserve flexibility and avoid sparking another bond rout. [18]\nYen strength vs. Fed cuts: carry trade in focus\nIn FX markets, the dollar slipped nearly 1% against the yen on Monday after Ueda\u2019s remarks, with the pair trading around \u00a5155 as traders bet on a BOJ hike"
