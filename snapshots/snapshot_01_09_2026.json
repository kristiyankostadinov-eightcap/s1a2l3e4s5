                "body": "Gold (XAUUSD) prices slipped from fresh record levels of $4,550 to establish new support for 2026. This decrease is because profit is taking place after a good run in 2025. The rebound in the US dollar is also weighing in on gold which limits gains even with supportive macro conditions.\nIn addition, geopolitical uncertainty is another factor supporting wider margin for caution in the markets. The increasing tension between the U.S. and Venezuela as well as new statements issued by President Trump regarding Greenland and Russian oil sanctions are adding to the risks across the board. Trump\u2019s plan to make money from Venezuelan oil is a sign of new stage of geopolitical leverage.\nOn the other hand, economic data from the U.S. is sending mixed signals. The chart below illustrates that the ISM Services PMI rose to a 14 month high of 54.4. This is well above the 52.3 forecast.\nMoreover, the ADP Employment report revealed only 41K new jobs in December missing the mark and barely overcoming a disappointment in a prior reduction.\nMeanwhile, job openings fell sharply to 7.146 million. That is well below the 7.6 million forecast. This confusion could keep the Fed from making aggressive rate cuts in the near term.\nThe market is awaiting the announcement of Nonfarm Payrolls that might make a drastic change on the policy expectations of the Fed. The rate cuts are still expected to be made following the sluggishness in the labour market. However, robust activity in the services aspect could put the Fed process at a slow pace. This uncertainty provides the gold market with a mixed touch which is supported by the macro and central bank policy risks.\nThe daily chart for spot gold shows short-term price fluctuations above the strong support at $4,360 level. The price is again approaching the $4,360 level and a breakout will indicate further downside toward the $4,250 level. Moreover, a break below $4,250 will indicate further downside toward the $4,000 area.\nHowever, the respect of $4,360 will indicate a buildup of positive energy to break above $4,550. A breakout above $4,550 will initiate a strong move to the upside toward $5,000 level.\nThe 4-hour chart for spot gold shows strong price fluctuations above the strong support of the red highlighted region. This consolidation indicates a buildup of positive energy. However, this positive price action will likely remain valid until a break of the $4,260 level. A break below $4,260 will indicate negative price development in the short term.\nThe daily chart for spot silver (XAG) shows the buildup of a topping pattern at the $84 area, as the price is exhausted in the short term. The price is forming a double top pattern with a neckline at the $70 area. A break below $70 will confirm the double top pattern and indicate further downside towards the $60 to $65 level support.\nAs long as the $60 support holds, the next move in the silver market will likely be higher towards the $100 area. A break below the $60 area will take silver prices towards the rising black trendline around $50 area, which serves as the long-term support for 2026.\nThe ascending broadening wedge pattern is also observed on the 4-hour chart. The price is consolidating below the $84 area that serves as the topping pattern. A break above $84 is required to negate this bearish development and indicate further upside towards the $100 area. However, a break below $70 in the spot silver market will confirm the double top pattern and indicate a downside move towards the $65 to $60 area.\nIf silver fails to break below $70 and consolidates above this level, it will increase the possibility of upside breakout.\nThe negative price action in spot silver and spot gold has emerged due to the rebound in the U.S. Dollar Index, as seen in the daily chart below. The index is now attempting to break above the 200-day SMA.\nA confirmed break above the 99 level will indicate continued upside towards the 100.50 area. Moreover, a break above 100.50 will indica"

                "body": "During the Asian trading session on Friday (January 9), spot gold struggled to extend the strong rebound seen the previous day from near the $4,400 level and faced renewed selling pressure, declining approximately 0.2% on the day and currently trading around $4,470 per ounce. The US Dollar Index maintained its gains over the past two weeks and briefly touched a near one-month high, nearing the 99.00 mark, which weighed on dollar-denominated commodities.\nHowever, ahead of the release of key US non-farm payroll data, dovish expectations for the Federal Reserve curbed further upside for the dollar and helped limit downside risks for the non-interest-bearing asset gold.\nThe highly anticipated US non-farm payroll data will be released at 21:30 Beijing time on Friday, expected to provide more clues about the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting trajectory, which in turn will play a crucial role in shaping the near-term dynamics of the dollar and offer fresh directional impetus for gold. Amidst the risks associated with key US data releases, escalating geopolitical tensions could lend support to precious metals with safe-haven appeal.\nAhead of the non-farm payroll report, a stronger dollar discouraged gold bulls.\nPosition adjustments ahead of the US non-farm payroll report saw the US Dollar Index touch its highest level since December 10 during the Asian session on Friday (98.99), exerting some pressure on gold prices.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated in an interview on Thursday that lowering interest rates is the only missing factor for achieving stronger economic growth, which is why the Federal Reserve should not delay action.\nMeanwhile, traders are pricing in the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut in March and another later in 2026. This could limit the upside for the dollar and provide support for non-interest-bearing gold.\nHowever, before establishing new directional positions, traders are awaiting more clues regarding the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-cutting path. As such, market focus remains on the closely watched US employment data due later today.\nMarket expectations indicate that the US economy added 60,000 jobs in December, down from 64,000 in the previous month; however, the unemployment rate is expected to edge down slightly from 4.6% in November to 4.5%.\nMeanwhile, heightened geopolitical uncertainties stemming from the US invasion of Venezuela, its coveting of Greenland, and the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict may also lend support to gold prices.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview on Wednesday that he expects the United States to take control of Venezuela and exploit its vast oil reserves in the coming years.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that, given Russia's stance, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has lasted nearly four years, is \"far from over.\" He also described Europe's plan to send troops to Ukraine as dangerous.\nBullish sentiment for gold remains intact.\nSpot gold remains stable above the upward-trending 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA, 4315.87), keeping the overall trend biased towards bullishness. The rising slope of this moving average provides support against pullbacks in gold prices. The negative histogram of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is contracting, indicating diminishing bearish pressure.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 56, above the neutral level of 50, consistent with improving momentum and not signaling overbought conditions. If momentum continues to strengthen, bulls may extend the rebound; meanwhile, the current overall trend will cushion declines in gold prices. Staying above the 200-period EMA will maintain a bullish tone, while a decisive break below it would trigger a deeper correction.\n(Spot Gold 4-Hour Chart, Source: Yi Hui Tong)\nAt 14:01 Beijing Time, spot gold was trading at $4470.01 per ounce."

                "body": "Gold and silver see rollercoaster end to blockbuster year\nGold and silver have seen a rollercoaster end to a year in which their prices are on track to record their biggest annual gains since 1979.\nThe price of gold soared by more than 60% this year to hit a record high of more than $4,549 (\u00a33,378) an ounce before falling after Christmas to stand at about $4,330 on New Year's Eve.\nAt the same time, silver was trading at about $71 an ounce after hitting an all-time high of $83.62 on Monday.\nThis year's gains were driven by several factors including expectations of more interest rate cuts, but experts warned sharp increases over the year could lead to a drop in gold and silver prices in 2026.\n\"Gold and silver prices are experiencing a notable rise due to the interplay of several economic, investment, and geopolitical factors,\" said Rania Gule from trading platform XS.com.\nThe main driver of the price rises of precious metals, she added, are expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in 2026. Prices of gold and silver were also buoyed by gold purchases by central banks and investors buying so-called \"safe haven\" assets due to concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.\nDan Coatsworth, head of markets at investment platform AJ Bell, said soaring gold and silver prices had been driven by investors \"latching onto precious metals in response to concerns over inflation\" as well as volatile stock markets.\n\"The market backdrop looks unchanged as we move into 2026,\" he added.\nMr Coatsworth said high government debt in the UK and US, as well as Donald Trump's tariffs and nerves over a potential AI bubble, would encourage investors to \"stay bullish on gold and silver\".\nBut he warned sharp gains for the assets in 2025 make them vulnerable to a sharp pullback next year.\nAdvertisement\nHe said: \"If financial markets go through a difficult patch, investors looking to liquidate positions might first reach for assets that have delivered strong gains in the past year or so, or ones that are easy to sell. Gold ticks both boxes.\"\nMs Gule said she expects gold to continue to rise in 2026 but \"at a more stable pace compared to the record highs observed in 2025\".\nAlso this year, central banks around the world added hundreds of tons of gold to their reserves, according to the World Gold Council trade association.\nDaniel Takieddine, co-founder of investment firm Sky Links Capital Group, points to \"supply tightness and industrial demand\" for helping to push up the price of silver.\nChina, which is the world's second biggest producer of silver, has said it would restrict the export of the precious metal.\nIn October, China's Ministry of Commerce announced new restrictions on exports of silver as well as the metals tungsten and antimony to \"to step up the protection of resources and the environment\".\nResponding to a post on social media about Chinese government restrictions on silver exports, Tesla boss Elon Musk said: \"This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes.\"\nMr Takieddine also highlighted the large amounts of money that have flowed into the precious metals market through investments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nETFs are baskets of investments that trade on a stock exchange like a single stock. They can be seen as a convenient way to trade precious metals as investors do not have to take possession of physical bullion.\nSilver also has the potential to rise again in the coming year, said Mr Takieddine. But he warns \"rallies may be followed by sharper corrections.\""

                "body": "Silver price today: Silver rises, according to FXStreet data\n|Silver prices (XAG/USD) rose on Friday, according to FXStreet data. Silver trades at $77.91 per troy ounce, up 1.29% from the $76.92 it cost on Thursday.\nSilver prices have increased by 9.60% since the beginning of the year.\nThe Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, stood at 57.43 on Friday, down from 58.19 on Thursday.\nSilver FAQs\nSilver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.\nSilver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply \u2013 Silver is much more abundant than Gold \u2013 and recycling rates can also affect prices.\nSilver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals \u2013 more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers\u2019 demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.\nSilver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.\n(An automation tool was used in creating this post.)\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

                "body": "(Kitco Commentary) -Gold demonstrated notable resilience during Thursday's trading session, recovering from an intraday low of $4,415 to close at $4,487, marking a $20.80 gain. The recovery underscored the yellow metal's ability to maintain its footing near historically elevated levels, even as broader market dynamics suggest increasing uncertainty ahead.\nSilver futures, however, faced considerably more pressure throughout the session, declining $1.30 or 1.67% to settle at $76.89. The white metal touched lows near $73.52 during early trading before mounting a modest recovery into the close. The divergence in performance between the two precious metals highlights shifting investor sentiment and differing fundamental drivers at play in each market.\nBCOM Rebalancing to Drive Volatility\nBoth precious metals may experience heightened volatility in the coming days due to the annual rebalancing of the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM), scheduled for January 9-15. This rebalancing ensures the index accurately reflects current global commodities market conditions by adjusting component weightings based on liquidity and production data from the previous year.\nHistorically, BCOM rebalancing periods have generated increased trading activity and temporary price dislocations as passive funds and algorithmic traders adjust their positions to match the new index composition. Market participants should prepare for potentially wider bid-ask spreads and increased intraday price swings as this technical event unfolds. The magnitude of any rebalancing-related moves will depend on how significantly gold and silver weightings change within the index structure.\nEmployment Data in Focus\nMarket participants will closely monitor Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls data for further monetary policy signals that could influence Federal Reserve decision-making. Wednesday's economic data revealed that U.S. job openings declined to a 14-month low in November, registering 7.7 million vacancies compared to expectations of 7.8 million. Hiring activity remained subdued, indicating weakening labor demand that could support the case for additional monetary easing.\nThe softening employment picture presents a complex backdrop for precious metals investors. While weaker labor data typically supports gold by increasing expectations for lower interest rates, the relationship has become more nuanced given the Fed's current policy stance and persistent inflation concerns. A surprisingly weak payrolls number could reignite safe-haven demand for gold, while stronger-than-expected data might trigger profit-taking across commodity markets.\nDollar Strength Goes Unnoticed\nDespite gold maintaining levels near its December 29 record high, the U.S. Dollar Index has quietly strengthened, rising 1.23% over the past nine trading sessions with surprisingly minimal impact on precious metals prices. This decoupling from the traditional inverse correlation represents a notable market development and suggests that other factors\u2014particularly geopolitical risk and central bank buying\u2014are currently overriding currency dynamics.\nDuring the same period, gold declined 2.34% and silver fell 4.49%, though these losses appear driven primarily by profit-taking following a substantial rally rather than dollar strength. The modest declines mask what has been an extraordinary performance for both metals, with gold having appreciated over 27% in 2024 and silver posting even more impressive gains.\nProfit-Taking After Historic Rally\nThe recent pullback in precious metals appears to be a natural consolidation following a monumental rally that may have concluded at the start of the year\u2014or alternatively, may represent merely a pause before further gains. Traders who accumulated positions during the multi-month advance have been booking profits at current elevated levels, creating selling pressure that has temporarily overwhelmed new buying interest.\nTechnical analysts note that both metals remain in well-define"

                "body": "OPEC\u2019s grip on the global oil market is facing one of its stiffest challenges in years. The threat does not come from rival producers or a collapse in discipline among its members, but from a more subtle and potentially more durable shift: the growing power of American refiners, backed by Washington\u2019s expanding authority over Venezuelan crude.\nAccording to energy analysts and asset managers we spoke with this week, the centre of gravity in oil markets may be moving away from producer cartels and towards governments and downstream players. As the United States reassesses its approach to Venezuela\u2019s energy sector, refiners rather than oil ministers are positioning themselves to become the next arbiters of pricing power.\nThe immediate catalyst is renewed interest in Venezuelan supply. Traders and refiners in America are scrambling to secure barrels following reports that Chevron is seeking a broader operating licence and that Citgo, the US-based refiner owned by Venezuela\u2019s national oil company, could resume crude purchases. These moves would mark a sharp reversal from years in which sanctions kept Venezuelan oil largely locked out of mainstream markets.\nBig Oil still needs Washington\u2019s blessing\nWhat is striking is the degree to which corporate strategy now hinges on political approval. American firms are seeking explicit assurances from Washington before committing capital, while Chinese oil companies are turning to Beijing for guidance on how to safeguard their existing interests. The implication is clear: control over Venezuelan oil is migrating from corporate boardrooms to government offices.\nIf the US administration expands permissions, the consequences would be swift and structural. Refineries along the Gulf Coast are among the few globally capable of processing Venezuela\u2019s heavy, sour crude efficiently. Years of sanctions forced these plants to rely on alternative heavy grades, many of which have become scarce. Restrictions on Iranian and Russian oil have further tightened the market, leaving refiners competing for an ever smaller pool of suitable feedstock.\n- Beginners Guide to Commodities\n- Beginners Guide to Investing in Crude Oil\n- Venezuela crisis: Is oil market calm a little premature?\n- Balancing act ahead for oil traders\n- How will Russian oil sanctions change energy market dynamics?\nGuaranteed access to Venezuelan barrels would transform that equation. For American refiners it would mean lower input costs, healthier margins and a competitive edge that rivals would struggle to match. For the wider market it would signal a redistribution of pricing power away from producers and towards those who refine and consume.\nWhere to now for OPEC?\nFor decades, OPEC has shaped oil markets through coordinated production decisions. That influence remains substantial, but it weakens when access to supply is determined less by cartel policy and more by political authorisation. OPEC controls barrels; Washington controls licences. As those forces collide, the balance of power inevitably begins to tilt. Venezuelan oil now sits squarely at the centre of that collision.\nThe stakes are high. Venezuela holds the world\u2019s largest proven crude reserves, yet output remains constrained by sanctions, dilapidated infrastructure and diplomatic isolation. Any loosening of restrictions by the US would instantly recast Venezuelan oil from distressed supply into a strategic commodity. Firms permitted to lift it would gain not only commercial advantage but also geopolitical leverage.\nThis helps explain the unease in Beijing. Chinese oil companies understand that access to Venezuelan energy is no longer merely a matter of price and contracts, but of diplomacy. If Washington determines who can buy, ship and refine Venezuelan crude, global energy flows will increasingly follow political lines.\nWill OPEC become irrelevant?\nFor OPEC, this presents an uncomfortable reality. The cartel can still adjust output targets, but it cannot override US sanctions pol"

Earlier this week, the president said that U.S. companies could be \u201cup and running\u201d in Venezuela within 18 months. \u201cA tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,\u201d Trump also said.\n\u201cTo me, the signal from the administration is: we\u2019d rather spend our American money on propping up a Venezuelan oil business than supporting our current independent businesses,\u201d the chief executive of Latigo Petroleum told the Financial Times.\nIndeed, only Big Oil supermajors can afford the investment necessary to revitalize Venezuela\u2019s oil industry\u2014which is why Trump is meeting with their executives later today to discuss just that. It is also Big Oil supermajors that are best placed to withstand lower oil prices\u2014something that smaller field operators in the U.S. shale patch cannot afford.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an appropriate reaction by US shale to be miffed,\u201d Dan Pickering from Pickering Energy Partners told the FT. \u201cNot just because Venezuelan production might go up but because the US government, in theory, is going to subsidise that.\u201d\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nIrina is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry."

The market has shrugged off the stronger-than-expected Eurozone Retail sales figures, as the US Dollar (USD) remains buoyed in cautious markets, with all eyes on US Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) figures and the ruling on US President Donald Trump's tariff policies.\nEurozone retail consumption grew 0.2% in November, according to data released by Eurostat, following a flat performance in October and beating market expectations of a 0.1% increase. ear on year, Retail Sales jumped 2.3% beyond the market consensus of 1.6% and following a 1.9% increase in October. The impact on the Euro, however, has been minimal\nThe focus on Friday is on the US Supreme Court, which will meet later on the day to decide the legality of Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act from 1977 to issue trade tariffs. In case of a negative ruling, US companies are expected to request the reimbursement of nearly $150 billion for levies already paid on imports.\nBefore that, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release December's Nonfarm Payrolls report, the first complete payrolls report after the largest US government shutdown in history. The data is expected to show a moderate increase in net jobs, which is unlikely to clarify the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy path. Markets will also be attentive to the Unemployment Rate.\nIn the European session, the focus will be on November's Eurozone Retail Sales report and the speech of the European Central Bank's (ECB) board member, Philip Lane. The impact of these events is likely to be limited, with investors awaiting more relevant developments in the US.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Subdued trading ahead of US developments\n- FX volatility remains low, with major currencies trading within tight ranges as investors hold their breath ahead of the US Supreme Court's decision on tariffs and the release of December's US employment report.\n- Nonfarm Payrolls data is expected to show a 60K increase in net employment in December, after a 64K rise in November.\n- Beyond that, the Unemployment Rate is expected to decline to 4.5% from 4.6% in November, and wage growth is expected to have accelerated 0.3% in the month and 3.6% year-on-year from 0.1% and 3.5% respectively in the previous month.\n- Later on, January's preliminary Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index report is expected to show some improvement, to 53.5, from December's 52.9 reading.\n- Data released on Thursday revealed that weekly Jobless Claims increased to 208K in the last week of 2025, from 200K in the previous week. The numbers, however, were lower than the 210K increase forecasted by the market, and the US Dollar appreciated following the release.\n- German data has been mixed on Friday. Industrial Production rose against expectations, but the trade balance narrowed due to a significant decline in exports, which has reactivated concerns about the outlook of the region\u00b4s leading economy.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD's next bearish target is at the 1.1615 area\nThe EUR/USD broke and confirme"

Traders remain cautious ahead of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, which is expected to offer further insight into labor market conditions and the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) policy outlook. December NFP is forecast to show job gains of 60,000, down from 64,000 in November.\nHowever, the pair could face further downside as the US Dollar (USD) strengthens following the release of US weekly labor market data. The US Department of Labor (DOL) reported on Thursday that Initial Jobless Claims rose modestly to 208,000 in the week ended January 3, slightly below market expectations of 210,000 but above the previous week\u2019s revised 200,000.

Consumer Confidence strengthened to -13.1 from -14.6, while the Economic Sentiment Indicator edged down to 96.7 from 97.1.\nEurozone Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.5% month-over-month (MoM) in November, accelerating from 0.1% previously and well above market expectations of 0.2%. On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, producer prices declined 1.7%, extending the run to a fourth consecutive month of annual contraction. Meanwhile, the Eurozone unemployment rate edged down to 6.3% in November from 6.4%.\nECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Thursday that the current level of interest rates is \u201cappropriate,\u201d adding that inflation is now at target, though uncertainty remains very high.\nBBH FX analysts report that the ECB\u2019s latest consumer survey shows inflation expectations holding steady, reinforcing the case for keeping rates unchanged at 2.00%. The ECB\u2019s November CPI consumer expectations survey suggests the central bank is well positioned to remain on hold. Inflation expectations for 1, 3, and 5 years were unchanged at 2.8%, 2.5%, and 2.2%, respectively, consistent with inflation stabilizing around the ECB\u2019s 2% medium-term target.\nRead more\n* The content presented above, whether from a third party or not, is considered as general advice only.

                "body": "GBP/USD outlook: Forex Friday January 9, 2026\nGBP/USD outlook: US payrolls take centre stage\nThe US dollar remained on the front-foot Friday morning. Today\u2019s US nonfarm payrolls report looks set to be the main event for FX markets, with expectations firming that the data will be solid enough to keep the Federal Reserve on hold for longer. Alongside this, markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility that the Supreme Court will rule against Trump\u2019s tariff proposals, a combination which, taken together, would likely prove mildly supportive for the dollar. Against that backdrop, the near-term GBP/USD outlook is increasingly looking mildly bearish.\nUS data sends mixed signals ahead of jobs report\nThis week\u2019s US macro picture has been anything but straightforward. The ISM services survey surprised on the upside, ADP payrolls were respectable rather than spectacular, while JOLTS data disappointed, highlighting a continued cooling in labour demand. Jobless claims, meanwhile, have held up well enough to reinforce the view that the US economy is slowing, but not rolling over. Challenger job cuts, released earlier this week, showed a sharp drop in December.\nThe overall mixed employment indicators have helped underpin cautious optimism ahead of today\u2019s payrolls report. Expectations have risen over the past couple of days, rising from around 50k to 65k, with consensus now sitting close to 70k. The unemployment rate may attract even more attention than the headline jobs number, echoing the Fed\u2019s own focus on labour market slack. A modest improvement here, combined with payrolls around consensus expectations or slightly higher would be enough to keep the odds of a March move below 50%.\nAdding another layer of uncertainty, many are watching for a potential Supreme Court ruling on Trump\u2019s tariffs today \u2014 though timing remains far from guaranteed. A rejection of those measures would remove a tail risk for the global economy, but paradoxically could still offer near-term support to the dollar.\nPound weighed down by BoE rate cut expectations\nFor sterling, the focus remains firmly on the Bank of England. UK data continues to point towards a cooling economy and easing inflation pressures, keeping the door open to further rate cuts. While February still looks a step too far, the balance of evidence suggests March is increasingly plausible, potentially followed by another move in early summer.\nThe labour market remains a key concern for the more cautious members of the MPC. Vacancies have fallen sharply and now sit below pre-pandemic levels, while redundancies appear to be picking up. Wage growth has slowed noticeably, with private sector pay increases dropping from around 6% earlier last year to just under 4% by the autumn. If this trend continues, services inflation should ease further as food prices, rents and energy costs all cool. Base effects from last year\u2019s tax changes are also likely to push headline inflation lower from April onwards, potentially keeping CPI close to 2% for much of the year.\nMarkets currently favour April for the next cut, but March still looks the more likely option in our view, assuming incoming labour and wage data continues to soften.\nGBP/USD outlook: technical picture remains fragile\nTechnically, the GBP/USD outlook is starting to look a bit shaky. The prior bullish momentum has clearly faded following the rejection from the 1.35 area, which coincides with a broader long-term resistance zone. The lack of upside follow-through suggests bullish conviction is waning. Traders who chased the recent upside are already under pressure, as we have now seen the cable break below Monday\u2019s low at 1.3415. A sustained break below this level past the NFP data could accelerate position unwinding, especially if we also see rates hold below the 1.34 handle where the 200-day moving average comes into play. A clean break below this level would shift the balance towards a deeper corrective phase with the location of the next support"

Traders exhibit caution as they await the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, impacting short-term market strategies.\nThe NFP data will influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s potential rate changes, which are integral to short-term US Dollar dynamics. Expectations of future Fed policy easing, combined with consistent equity market performance, restrain the USD from rising further and offer support to the GBP/USD pair.\nThe Bank Of England\u2019s Stance\nThe Bank of England\u2019s stance, indicating that interest rates are nearing neutral, supports the British Pound, limiting the downside for the GBP/USD pair. Spot prices are expected to conclude the week relatively unchanged, but the overall economic context may favour bullish trends and encourage purchasing at lower levels.\nFor the GBP/USD to decline further, it must break below the 1.3400 mark. The Nonfarm Payrolls report highlights changes in US job creation, released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure\u2019s volatility can influence forex markets significantly, with high readings generally strengthening the USD, while low ones weaken it. Substantial market movements are often seen upon the release of actual figures.\nWith the market holding its breath for today\u2019s US jobs report, we see GBP/USD consolidating near its weekly low around 1.3435. The immediate price action will be driven by whether the Nonfarm Payrolls number comes in above or below the 60K consensus. A significant miss would likely accelerate dollar weakness and push the pair higher.\nThis jobs report is critical because we have seen other data points in late 2025 suggesting a cooling US economy. For instance, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, dipped below 3% in the fourth quarter of 2025 for the first time in over two years. This trend reinforces the market\u2019s expectation that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates soon, which puts underlying pressure on the dollar.\nDifferent Challenges For The Bank Of England\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England faces a different challenge, as UK inflation remained stubbornly above 4% for much of 2025. This fundamental divergence, with the Fed poised to ease policy while the BoE may need to hold firm, supports the pound. Therefore, we should be cautious about placing aggressive bearish bets on the GBP/USD pair.\nFor derivative traders, the expected volatility around the jobs data makes buying short-dated straddles or strangles an interesting strategy. This approach allows us to profit from a large price swing in either direction without having to predict the outcome of the report. It is a direct play on the uncertainty that is currently gripping the market.\nLooking beyond today\u2019s release and into the coming weeks, any data-driven dips towards the key 1.3400 support level could be viewed as buying opportunities. We can consider positioning for a medium-term move upwards by purchasing call options dated for March or April. This strategy aligns with the historical precedent, like the one seen in 2019, where the US dollar tended to weaken once a Fed rate-cutting cycle was clearly underway."

                "body": "The US dollar continued to gain ground today, helped along by a stronger than expected jobless claims data. All eyes will be on the nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which could set the tone in the FX space for the week ahead. Should US data turn out to be stronger than expected, then the greenback could make back more ground, especially against currencies where the central bank has more policy loosening to do, such as the pound. The GBP/USD forecast could turn modestly bearish in the event NFP turns out to be stronger than expected. I expect the BoE to cut rates sooner than expected by markets \u2013 in March instead of April.\nUS dollar extends recovery ahead of payrolls report\nRecent US data has been all over the place so far this week, ultimately failing to give the dollar a strong sense of direction following the Venezuelan headlines from earlier this week. While jobless claims came in better than expected today at 208K, and ADP employment came in broadly in line with expectations at 41K, November\u2019s job openings data was notably soft and went some way towards offsetting the upbeat ISM services print. Openings fell to a more than one-year low, while hiring slowed, underlining that most employers remain cautious about making meaningful changes to headcount. Overall, this week\u2019s employment indicators reinforce the view that Friday\u2019s jobs report won\u2019t be weak enough to justify additional Fed easing just yet. That, in turn, may help to keep the dollar mildly supported in the near-term outlook.\nWhat has also stood out this week is how well the dollar has held up despite falling oil prices, with commodity markets appearing to take Trump\u2019s plans around Venezuelan supply seriously. Today, though, oil prices bounced back. I suppose oil may only become an issue should WTI break the $55 handle. If so, that could cap the gains for the dollar.\nGBP/USD forecast: Pound likely to remain under mild pressure\nFor the pound, it is all about what the Bank of England is going to do next. Recent data here is increasingly pointing towards further rate cuts, but the Monetary Policy Committee remains cautious and deeply divided. While February looks too soon for another move, the balance of evidence suggests a cut in March, followed by another in June. One particular area of concern for the MPC hawks is employment, where vacancies have fallen sharply and are now below pre-pandemic levels, while redundancies appear to be rising. This matters because wage growth is slowing rapidly. Private sector pay growth has fallen from around 6% earlier last year to just under 4% by autumn. As a result, inflation could fall back quicker. As food prices and rents both cool, services inflation should weaken as well, further supporting the case for more rate cuts. Let\u2019s not forget about base effects from last year\u2019s tax hikes, which to will also push inflation lower from April onwards. Combined with falling energy prices, headline inflation should drop to around 2% from April and stay close to that level through the rest of the year.\nWhile markets now see April as the most likely timing, I would argue March is more probable for the next cut. By then, the MPC will have several more wage and labour market reports, which should provide reassurance that inflation pressures are indeed easing. February, though, might come too soon.\nGBP/USD forecast: technical analysis and key levels to watch\nThe GBPUSD chart continues to print higher highs and higher lows, so the trend is yet to reverse completely despite the reversal from the 1.35 handle over the past few days. With bullish momentum starting to fade, and the absence of strong upside follow-through suggests bullish conviction may be weakening. This is especially the case as price has recently pushed into a long-term resistance band spanning roughly 1.35 to 1.40 area.\nIt\u2019s still premature to call a major top, but failure to hold above the 1.35 handle may be a sign for concern.

While Australian inflation has cooled modestly, CPI remains above the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s target band, keeping policy restrictive and limiting the scope for aggressive downside in the Aussie.\nView related analysis:\n- AUD/USD 2026 Outlook: Policy Divergence and a Shifting Dollar Trend\n- Trade to Watch 2026: Nasdaq 100 Correction Risk Before New Highs\n- EUR/JPY: 2025\u2019s Biggest Surprise \u2013 The Great Short That Wasn\u2019t\nAUD/USD Outlook: Pullback Risks Rise as USD Finds Support\nAustralian Inflation Cools, but CPI Still Above RBA Target\nMonthly inflation figures for November released on Wednesday showed that core CPI remains sticky, although price pressures have eased modestly. Trimmed mean CPI slowed to 3.2% y/y, while headline CPI fell to 3.4%, leaving both measures above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target band. Housing was again a key driver, contributing 1.1 percentage points to inflation and accounting for 21.4% of the total CPI basket.\nWhile this eases pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia to hike rates in Q1, it does nothing to justify rate cuts. Policymakers will want confirmation from the Q4 CPI figures due on 28 January before determining whether the February meeting is live\u2014a possibility Governor Bullock effectively flagged in December. Until then, inflation remains uncomfortably high and the policy bias stays restrictive.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - data source: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)\nUS Dollar Finds Its Footing\nThe US dollar index rose in the first week of the year to hint at an interim swing low around 97.50, although I doubt bulls will manage to drive prices back above 100. Prices have broken above last week\u2019s bullish inside week and the prior week\u2019s bearish engulfing candle, pointing to further near-term upside.\nRegular readers will recall that I suspect a wave-C correction may have ended on the weekly chart, which keeps my broader bias tilted towards fading extended USD rallies. That, in turn, suggests AUD/USD bulls may look to buy dips rather than chase strength.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: TradingView / ICE\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe daily chart shows the Australian dollar briefly hitting a 15-month high on Wednesday, before a stronger US dollar drove a full intraday reversal into the close. This has left a shooting star candlestick on the AUD/USD daily chart, reinforced by bearish RSI divergence, warning of at least a near-term pullback.\nI\u2019m not looking for anything aggressive at this stage, but a break below the September high at 0.6707, or the 67c handle, could see AUD/USD retrace towards its 20-day SMA near 0.6675.\nA deeper pullback may require domestic data to undershoot expectations, particularly given current futures and options positioning. However, a decisive break below 0.6660 would open a run towards the 50-day SMA and prior swing highs and lows around 0.6592.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - Source: TradingView\nAUD/USD Positioning: Australian Dollar Futures \u2013 COT Report\nWhile futures traders remain net short AUD/USD, long exposure continues to trend higher among large speculators and asset managers.

The Aussie pair faces selling pressure as the US Dollar (USD) demonstrates strength ahead of the United States (US) Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data for December, which will be published at 13:30 GMT.\nAt the time of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades around 99.10, the highest level seen in four weeks.\nUS Dollar Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the strongest against the Japanese Yen.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote).\nInvestors will closely monitor the US NFP data to get fresh cues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) monetary policy outlook. The commentaries from Fed officials over the last six months have signaled that they are more concerned about weak job market conditions than inflation remaining above the 2% target.\nEconomists expect US employers to have created 60K fresh jobs, slightly lower than 64K in November. The Unemployment Rate dropped to 4.5% from the prior reading of 4.6%. Meanwhile, Average Hourly Earnings data, a key measure of wage growth, is expected to have grown at an annualized pace of 3.6%, faster than 3.5% in November. Month-on-month Average Hourly Earnings are estimated to have risen at a faster pace of 0.3% against the prior reading of 0.1%.\nIn addition to the US Dollar\u2019s strength, weakness in the Australian Dollar (AUD) has also weighed on the Aussie pair. The antipodean is under pressure as investors have pared Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) hawkish expectations for the February policy meeting, following the release of soft Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November.\nInvestors reduced the risk of a rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia in February to just 24%, Reuters reported. In November, Year-on-year (YoY) inflation dropped to 3.4% from estimates of 3.7% and the October reading of 3.8%.\nEconomic Indicator\nNonfarm Payrolls\nThe Nonfarm Payrolls release presents the number of new jobs created in the US during the previous month in all non-agricultural businesses; it is released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The monthly changes in payrolls can be extremely volatile. The number is also subject to strong reviews, which can also trigger volatility in the Forex board. Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is seen as bearish, although previous months' reviews and the Unemployment Rate are as relevant as the headline figure. The market's reaction, therefore, depends on how the market assesses all the data contained in the BLS report as a whole.\nRead more.Next release: Fri Jan 09, 2026 13:30\nFrequency: Monthly\nConsensus: 60K\nPrevious: 64K\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics\nAmerica\u2019s monthly jobs report is considered the most important economic indicator for forex traders.

The US dollar\u2019s strength, coupled with mixed signals from China, has caused the pair to weaken for the third consecutive day. Meanwhile, uncertainty about the policy paths of the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia keeps traders cautious.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about forex indicators? Check our detailed guide-\nThe Friday\u2019s US Nonfarm Payrolls report remains a key event. The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 4.5%, and the number of new jobs created in December is expected to be around 60k, slightly lower than in November.\nRecent US labor data has shown a mixed scenario. ADP employment data showed a slight rise in private hiring, but JOLTS job openings cooled, indicating that demand for workers was gradually easing rather than crashing. The ISM Services PMI, on the other hand, came in higher than expected, supporting the notion that certain parts of the US economy remain strong.\nThe Dollar Index (DXY) is hovering around 98.90, showing signs of recovery. Despite the expectation of rate cuts later this year, futures markets are betting that the Fed will maintain rates at its January meeting. That background keeps the greenback strong and caps AUD/USD before the jobs data release.\nThe tone has been softer on the Australian side. A narrowing trade surplus, resulting from declining exports and slightly higher imports, has raised concerns about demand from outside the country. Inflation has cooled from recent highs but remains above the RBA\u2019s target. This makes it more challenging to forecast how stringent the policy needs to be. RBA officials emphasize patience, indicating that rate cuts are unlikely to occur soon. However, the markets are still not convinced that further tightening is needed.\nThe most recent inflation numbers from China didn\u2019t help the Aussie much. Consumer inflation was lower than expected, with producer prices still falling, despite a mild improvement. These numbers have weighed on the Aussie, as China is Australia\u2019s most important trading partner.\nIn the short term, the AUD/USD outlook hinges on the release of data. The Aussie could benefit if the US payrolls report is less impressive than anticipated. If NFP remains upbeat, the pair could decline further.\nAUD/USD Technical Outlook: Bearish Below 20-MA\nFalling below the 20- and 50-period MAs around 0.6700 shows a strong selling pressure. This could lead to a demand zone around 0.6660, ahead of the 200-period MA at 0.6625, and then a horizontal support at 0.6600.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about next cryptocurrency to explode?

Modest downside is the base case, but politics and volatility could change the script fast.\nFundamental Outlook: Divergence is priced, surprises will drive the tape\nThe easy part of the USD/JPY story is done. Policy divergence is largely in the price, so the next leg depends on how expectations shift and where surprises land. For now, the Fed is expected to ease as inflation cools, while the BOJ moves cautiously toward normalisation, guided by wages and services inflation. Wide interest rate differentials still support the dollar, but that influence is fragile. Faster Fed cuts or a hawkish BOJ could compress spreads quickly, challenging the carry bias and pressuring USD/JPY. A slower Fed and patient BOJ would do the opposite, although volatility spikes can interrupt any trend.\nRisk sentiment is the second pillar. The yen\u2019s funding role in carry trades means asset price performance and volatility matter. Strong gains with subdued volatility tend to reinforce yen weakness, while volatility shocks can drive rapid yen repatriation. When risk appetite is buoyant, rate differentials dominate. When volatility spikes, sentiment and positioning take over.\nThat familiar rates-and-risk dynamic could be upended quickly in early 2026 by two fat left-tail risks from the United States, both carrying the potential to reshape policy and fiscal expectations in ways markets are not pricing.\nThe first is Fed independence, and it goes well beyond who becomes the next chair. Lisa Cook, a sitting governor, was fired by Trump, and her case on the legality of that dismissal begins at the Supreme Court on 21 January. A ruling against her opens the door for Trump-aligned appointments to the Board of Governors, likely shifting the FOMC sharply dovish. Jerome Powell is another swing factor. He can remain as a governor until January 2028, well past his term as chair ends in May. Staying would act as a check on politicisation, though it would be highly unusual. If he leaves, the balance tilts decisively toward policy being set for political rather than economic reasons, raising the risk of a slide in longer-dated Treasuries and the dollar.\nThe second risk concerns trade policy. A Supreme Court ruling on reciprocal tariffs could reignite fiscal uncertainty. A loss for the administration would force tariff revenues to be refunded and open the door to secondary lawsuits against the government. That amplifies the risk of a significant widening in the primary fiscal deficit, which may pressure long bond yields and dollar. Timing for both rulings is uncertain, but the impact would generate material downside risk for USD/JPY if either lands.\nCorrelation Analysis\nSource: TradingView\nUSD/JPY tracked U.S.\u2013Japan 10-year spreads closely until Liberation Day, when the reciprocal tariff announcement broke the link. Despite spreads staying wide, the relationship fractured, reminding traders that political shocks can override textbook rate dynamics.\nJapan\u2019s rate outlook can influence the pair at times, but similarities in correlations between outright U.S. 10-year yields and 10-year d"

Traders await the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, which is expected to offer further insight into labor market conditions and the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) policy outlook. On Canada\u2019s front, Net Change in Employment and Unemployment Rate for December will also be eyed.\nThe USD/CAD pair also remains stronger as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) struggles amid lower Oil prices. The potential for rising Venezuelan Oil supply to the United States (US) could reduce demand for Canadian heavy crude. Greater competition may pressure Canadian export volumes and price differentials, weighing on energy revenues. As Oil remains a key driver of Canada\u2019s terms of trade, weaker crude demand could limit Canadian Dollar strength against the US Dollar (USD).\nOil major Chevron, global trading houses Vitol and Trafigura, and other firms are competing for United States (US) government deals to export Venezuelan crude, vying to market up to 50 million barrels of PDVSA\u2019s accumulated inventories amid ongoing negotiations on Venezuelan Oil exports, per Reuters.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a CNBC interview on Thursday that the Federal Reserve should continue cutting rates, arguing that lower rates are \u201cthe only ingredient missing\u201d for even stronger economic growth and that the Fed should not delay. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, Fed funds futures continue to price in about an 86.2% probability that the US central bank will keep rates unchanged at its January 27\u201328 meeting.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local curre"

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data, which is anticipated to shed light on the state of the US labor market and influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s future policy direction. Meanwhile, Canadian employment figures and the December unemployment rate are also in focus.\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD), which is sensitive to commodity prices, has faced headwinds as Oil prices decline, supporting the strength of USD/CAD. Expectations of increased Venezuelan Oil shipments to the United States could dampen demand for Canadian heavy crude, intensifying competition and potentially reducing Canada\u2019s export volumes and profit margins. Since Oil plays a pivotal role in Canada\u2019s trade balance, a drop in crude demand may restrict the CAD\u2019s ability to appreciate against the US Dollar (USD).\nAccording to Reuters, major energy companies such as Chevron, along with global trading firms Vitol and Trafigura, are actively seeking US government contracts to export Venezuelan crude. These firms are competing to market up to 50 million barrels from PDVSA\u2019s stockpiles as negotiations over Venezuelan Oil exports continue.\nIn an interview with CNBC on Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent advocated for continued interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve, suggesting that lower rates are crucial for further economic expansion and urging the Fed not to postpone action. The CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool indicates that futures traders currently assign an 86.2% chance that the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged at its January 27\u201328 meeting."

US data reveals Initial Jobless Claims rose slightly to 208,000, while Continuing Jobless Claims increased to 1.914 million.\nUS Trade Data\nTrade data shows the US Goods and Services Trade deficit dropped sharply to $29.4 billion in October, down from $48.1 billion in September. Attention is on Friday\u2019s US Nonfarm Payrolls, with forecasts predicting a 60,000 rise in jobs.\nCanada\u2019s economic calendar is light with the country\u2019s trade balance shifting to a C$0.58 billion deficit in October. Friday\u2019s Canadian labour-market report predicts a 5,000 job decrease for December after November\u2019s rise of 53,600 jobs.\nThe Bank of Canada is expected to maintain interest rates through 2026. The BoC manages monetary policy to ensure price stability, using tools like interest rate adjustments and Quantitative Easing.\nQuantitative Tightening, the reverse of QE, may strengthen the Canadian Dollar as it halts asset purchases and reinvestments during economic recovery.\nIt is January 9, 2026. We remember how this time last year, in early 2025, the USD/CAD was pushing towards 1.3900 on the back of broad US dollar strength. Canadian job growth was expected to turn negative while the US labor market, though slowing, was still seen as resilient.\nThe situation today shows a notable divergence from those expectations. The latest US Nonfarm Payrolls for December 2025, released last week, showed a surprisingly strong gain of 216,000 jobs, far exceeding forecasts and keeping US wage growth firm. In contrast, Canada\u2019s December 2025 Labour Force Survey reported a near-stagnant gain of only 100 jobs, confirming a significant cooling in the Canadian economy.\nCurrency And Market Dynamics\nThis growing economic gap between the US and Canada suggests a fundamental reason for USD/CAD to be higher. Yet, the pair currently trades around 1.3350, well below the highs we saw in early 2025. A key factor capping the pair\u2019s upside is the price of oil, with WTI crude holding strong above $73 per barrel, a significant jump from the $57 level seen this time last year.\nFor derivative traders, this tension creates an opportunity in the options market. Given the strong US data, buying USD/CAD call options with a three-month expiry allows for a position on potential upside while limiting the risk if strong oil prices continue to support the Canadian dollar. The cost of these options, or the premium, represents the maximum potential loss on the trade.\nUpcoming labor reports for January 2026 will be critical and could cause a significant price move. Traders expecting a spike in volatility, regardless of direction, could consider a long straddle strategy, which involves buying both a call and a put option at the same strike price and expiry. This position profits from a large price swing in either direction that is greater than the total premium paid.\nThe policy divergence between the central banks is also becoming more pronounced. With the strong US jobs report, market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026 are being pushed back, supporting the US dollar. This contrasts with growing pressure on the Bank of Canada to consider easing policy, a dynamic that can be expressed through trading interest rate swaps that bet on a widening spread between US and Canadian yields."

On January 6, 2026, Morgan Stanley Investment Management filed an S-1 registration statement with the SEC for a product officially named Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust. Many headlines shorten this to \u201cMorgan Stanley\u2019s Bitcoin ETF,\u201d and while that phrasing is common, the filing itself is very specific about how the product works, what investors get, and what risks remain.\nFor anyone trying to understand Bitcoin ETFs for the first time, this filing is a clean example of how large US financial institutions are now approaching crypto exposure in a regulated, structured way. If you are learning crypto markets through a Crypto Certification, this filing mirrors many of the mechanics taught in real trading and market structure modules.\nWhat Morgan Stanley filed\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management filed for Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust, described as an exchange-traded fund designed to track the price of Bitcoin, minus fees and expenses.\nKey points from the filing:\n- The product is a spot Bitcoin ETP, pending regulatory approval\n- It passively tracks Bitcoin price movements\n- It does not use leverage or derivatives\n- Exchange name and ticker symbol are still listed as TBD in the preliminary filing\nMorgan Stanley also filed other crypto ETPs around the same time, including a Solana product and, according to reporting, an Ether product. This signals a broader crypto strategy rather than a one-off Bitcoin experiment.\nHow the Bitcoin ETF structure works\nThe Trust is sponsored by Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley.\nThe goal is straightforward:\nTrack Bitcoin performance using a pricing benchmark based on aggregated executed trade flow from major spot exchanges, adjusted for Trust expenses and liabilities.\nThere is no active trading strategy here.\n- No leverage.\n- No futures.\n- No options.\nThis is designed to mirror Bitcoin\u2019s spot price as closely as possible.\nUnderstanding this structure is foundational knowledge for anyone studying institutional crypto products through a Tech Certification focused on financial systems and infrastructure.\nHow shares are created and redeemed\nLike other spot crypto ETPs, shares are created and redeemed in large blocks called Baskets.\nThere are two ways this happens.\nCash creation\n- An Authorized Participant deposits cash\n- The Sponsor instructs a Bitcoin Counterparty to buy Bitcoin\n- Bitcoin is deposited with the Trust\u2019s custodian\n- New shares are issued\nIn-kind creation\n- The Authorized Participant delivers Bitcoin directly to the custodian\n- Shares are issued in return\nRedemptions work the same way, either in cash or in kind. Importantly, trading slippage and execution costs are borne by the Authorized Participant, not the Trust or its investors.\nThis is why ETF pricing generally stays close to the underlying asset price, a concept often covered in professional Marketing and Business Certification programs when explaining market efficiency and arbitrage.\nFees\nThe Trust will charge a unitary Sponsor Fee expressed as a percentage of NAV. The exact percentage is not filled in yet in the preliminary prospectus.\nOne critical detail many new investors miss:\n- The Trust does not generate income\n- Fees are paid by transferring Bitcoin out of the Trust\n- This means the Bitcoin represented per share declines gradually over time\nThis is standard for spot Bitcoin ETPs, but it matters for long-term holders.\nCustody, prime brokers, and concentration risk\nThe filing describes the use of Bitcoin custodians and a prime broker, but several provider names are still redacted or left blank in this early version.\nMorgan Stanley explicitly flags:\n- Industry concentration risk\n- A limited number of qualified Bitcoin custodians and intermediaries\n- The risk that shared service providers across crypto products could amplify systemic impact if one fails\nThe Trust states that assets a"

The goal is to convert 25% of treasury operations to blockchain-based payments by 2030.\nPilot programs are already underway, and changes to laws governing the central bank and treasury are expected this year."

Investors should approach current conditions with caution, limiting position sizes and maintaining long time horizons rather than making large short-term bets.\nRead Next: JPMorgan Acquires Apple Card With $2.2B Credit Loss Provision As Goldman Exits Consumer Banking"

After years of speculative rallies and sharp corrections, investors and traders from Sydney to Perth are asking: Where is crypto headed next? Predicting the future of digital assets isn\u2019t an exact science, but by analysing current trends, expert forecasts, and market data, we can draw a clearer picture of what this pivotal year may hold.\nAnalysts and research firms project bullish scenarios for Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven largely by ETF inflows, tokenization, and expanding DeFi ecosystems. Bitcoin could retest six-figure price levels, while Ethereum's utility in decentralized finance and layer-2 scaling could underpin strong network growth. Stablecoins and real-world asset tokenisation are also expected to play central roles in 2026\u2019s market evolution, shifting crypto from fringe speculation toward everyday financial infrastructure. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned trader or a newcomer planning your long-term crypto strategy, this guide walks through the key forecasts, risks, and opportunities for the year ahead \u2014 all backed by current market predictions and expert insights.\nWhat to Expect from Crypto in 2026: Market Overview\nBullish Indicators\nMany institutional analysts forecast strong crypto adoption and price growth in 2026. Bitcoin \u2014 often seen as the flagship asset \u2014 is predicted to reach anywhere from $150,000 to $200,000+, supported by growing ETF investment, limited supply from halvings, and increased institutional allocation.\nMeanwhile, Ethereum could benefit from scaling improvements and deeper DeFi integration, with forecasts placing ETH in the $7,000\u2013$12,000+ range by year-end.\nThese projections are fueled by:\nStrong ETF inflows bolstering demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum\nA maturing DeFi sector attracting real yield\nStablecoin growth supporting payments and settlements\nGrowing interest in tokenised real-world assets\nBull Case: Bitcoin in 2026\nBitcoin remains the lodestar of the crypto market. Several forecasts suggest that a combination of institutional investment and macro growth could see BTC break past six figures.\nPrice Targets & Drivers\nInstitutional Inflows: Predictions estimate Bitcoin ETF inflows soaring \u2014 potentially supporting a surge toward $150,000+ by 2026.\nHalving Effects: Post-halving supply constraints historically result in price surges.\nMacro Trends: Liquidity and risk-asset appetite could drive capital into crypto markets.\nMarket Rotation: While BTC dominance may fall as altcoins gain share, a rising tide lifts most assets.\nEven conservative models place Bitcoin above $90,000\u2013$120,000 ranges if conditions remain supportive, while more bullish analysts see the potential for $200,000+.\nEthereum & Altcoins: The Broader Landscape\nEthereum\u2019s narrative in 2026 extends beyond price \u2014 it\u2019s about utility.\nEthereum Forecasts\nAnalysts see ETH benefiting from upgrades that improve speed and lower fees, potentially pushing prices into the high thousands.\nAs layer-2 solutions and tokenised assets gain traction, Ethereum\u2019s role as the foundation for DeFi and NFTs could solidify its position.\nAltcoin Outlook\nProjects like Solana, XRP, Chainlink, and emerging DeFi ecosystems may outperform in bull conditions. While predictions vary, expanding utility and developer interest could drive altcoin growth beyond 2026.\nStablecoins & Financial Integration in 2026\nStablecoins are expected to move from fringe use cases to everyday payments and settlement infrastructure. Some experts forecast their transaction volume and utility expanding rapidly in global markets.\nThis shift may blur the lines between traditional finance and crypto, enabling faster cross-border payments and lower fees for everyday use.\nRegulation, Adoption & Institu"

                "body": "- Ethereum's validator exit queue has cleared.\n- It removes headaches for liquid staking protocols.\n- The queue to spin up new Ethereum validators is also increasing.\nAfter four long months, Ethereum\u2019s validator exit queue is no more.\nThe key safety mechanism became clogged in September after Kiln, a major Ethereum staker, removed its entire validator fleet from the network after hackers exploited a vulnerability in the platform\u2019s staking infrastructure.\nThe backlog delayed staking withdrawals by several weeks at its peak, causing numerous headaches for Ethereum staking protocols, platforms that offer to stake Ether tokens for users in exchange for a small fee.\nNow, those protocols are celebrating the return to normalcy.\nLiquid staking tokens, receipt-like claims on staked Ether, are now less likely to trade at a discount, Kirill Kutakov, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Stakewise, told DL News.\nCrypto markets price in the so-called duration risk caused by a clogged Ethereum exit queue. Spikes in queue length can amplify discounts to liquid staking tokens because those who buy them must wait longer until they can redeem them for the underlying Ether they represent.\nA free flowing exit queue is also a good thing for the broader DeFi ecosystem. It\u2019s now simpler and cheaper for those engaged in leveraged Ethereum staking strategies to unwind their positions, leading to more efficient trading, Kutakov said.\nWhy is there a queue?\nEthereum\u2019s exit queue is a necessary part of the blockchain\u2019s security.\nThe mechanism limits the speed at which Ether can leave the network based on the total amount staked. Currently, it\u2019s set to around 57,600 tokens every day.\nThis helps prevent rapid changes to Ethereum\u2019s validator set \u2014 those running the software that stakes Ether and processes transactions on the network. Each validator must lock up at least 32 Ether tokens, up to a maximum of 2,048.\nA sudden drop in validators could make the network more vulnerable to attack. The delay also stops validators exiting immediately should they misbehave, disincentivising abuse.\nThe cleared exit queue also comes as a relief for Rocket Pool, the third largest Ethereum liquid staking protocol which holds $1.8 billion worth of staked Ether.\nRocket Pool\u2019s node operators will have a much easier time redeploying their validators following its upcoming Saturn upgrade planned for February 9, Darren Langley, a general manager at the protocol, told DL News.\nStaking inflows surge\nAs the exit queue rolls off, the queue to spin up new Ethereum validators is also increasing at a rapid pace.\nSince December 24, the amount of Ether tokens entering the queue has jumped almost 300% to more than 1.7 million. New validators entering the queue must now wait over 30 days before they are able to join the network, per data from Beaconcha.in.\nBitMine, the world\u2019s biggest Ethereum treasury firm, is responsible for a large portion of the new Ether being staked. The firm began staking on December 26 and has since locked up 936,512 Ether worth approximately $2.9 billion, per onchain records.\nBitMine chair Tom Lee has repeatedly expressed his intention to purchase and stake 5% of the entire Ether token supply.\nThe firm currently holds just over 4 million Ether, around 67% of the way towards its goal.\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": "Circle\u2019s USDC has overtaken Tether\u2019s USDT in annual transaction volume for the first time, marking a historic shift in the stablecoin landscape.\nFor a decade, USDT has reigned as the undisputed king of stablecoins. It still commands a $187 billion market cap\u2014nearly 2.5 times USDC\u2019s $75 billion market cap. Yet 2025 revealed a different story beneath the surface: the smaller stablecoin is now moving more money.\nSponsoredUSDC Leads by 39%\nAccording to data from Artemis Analytics, USDC processed $18.3 trillion worth of transfers in 2025, compared to USDT\u2018s $13.2 trillion\u2014a 39% gap.\nArtemis Stablecoin Transfer Volume filters out MEV bot transactions and intra-exchange transfers, isolating the platform\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d on-chain activity. This metric provides an upper bound on actual payments and DeFi usage, rather than raw transaction counts inflated by automated trading. In short, real-world payments, P2P transfers, and DeFi activity count; automated bot trades and exchange wallet reshuffling do not.\nWhy USDC Pulled Ahead\nThe gap comes down to four factors: how DeFi works, where it\u2019s happening, an unexpected catalyst, and regulatory timing.\n1. DeFi Turnover\nAnalysts attribute the gap largely to how each stablecoin is used. USDC dominates decentralized finance platforms, where traders frequently enter and exit positions. The same dollar gets recycled multiple times through lending protocols and DEX swaps. USDT, by contrast, serves more as a store of value and payment rail\u2014users tend to hold it in wallets rather than move it constantly.\nSponsored2. The Solana Factor\nSolana\u2019s explosive DeFi growth became USDC\u2019s primary engine. The stablecoin now accounts for over 70% of all stablecoins on the network, while USDT remains concentrated on Tron. In Q1 2025 alone, Solana\u2019s total stablecoin supply surged from $5.2 billion to $11.7 billion\u2014a 125% increase driven almost entirely by USDC inflows.\n3. The Trump Token Irony\nThe January 2025 launch of the TRUMP memecoin inadvertently supercharged USDC adoption. The token\u2019s primary liquidity pool on Meteora DEX is paired with USDC, not USDT. This meant traders rushing to buy TRUMP first needed to acquire USDC, creating a demand spike that rippled across Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\nThe irony runs deeper: the Trump family launched its own stablecoin, USD1, through World Liberty Financial in March. Yet the TRUMP token they inspired ended up boosting a competitor\u2019s stablecoin.\n4. Regulatory Tailwinds\nThe July passage of the Genius Act in the US established clear legal standards for stablecoin issuers. Industry observers note that USDC\u2019s longstanding emphasis on regulatory compliance and reserve transparency positioned it to benefit most from the new framework. In Europe, USDC\u2019s MiCA compliance has given it an edge amid delisting pressure on several exchanges facing USDT.\nA Rising Tide\nThe USDC surge contributed to record stablecoin activity overall. Total transaction volume reached $33 trillion in 2025, up 72% year over year. Q4 alone saw $11 trillion in flows, accelerating from $8.8 trillion in Q3.\nBloomberg Intelligence projects stablecoin payment flows could reach $56 trillion by 2030, positioning the sector as a major global payment rail alongside traditional networks."

The Solana price has pushed higher in recent sessions, yet technical readings now point toward overbought conditions, with the $153 level acting as a firm ceiling. At the same time, the XRP price is drawing attention as Ripple-backed efforts expand XRP utility into the Solana ecosystem through partnerships involving Hex Trust and LayerZero. These developments underline a market full of progress, but also one constrained by resistance levels and gradual utility rollout.\nSolana Price Tests Key Levels After Short-Term Strength\nThe Solana price has shown notable short-term movement, with SOL rising close to 6 percent in a single session and trading within the $130 to $140 range. While price remains above short-term moving averages, signaling near-term buying interest, it continues to sit below longer-term indicators such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This positioning suggests caution remains part of the broader trend.\nMomentum signals reflect this balance. The RSI is holding near neutral, showing neither strong buying pressure nor a clear breakdown. Analysts point to firm support around $132 and heavy resistance near $153, leading many to expect continued sideways movement in the near term. While integrations and ecosystem growth support long-range prospects, the Solana price appears limited until it can push decisively above resistance.\nXRP Price Holds Near $2 as Cross-Chain Use Expands\nThe XRP price has softened slightly, trading close to the $2 level even as new cross-chain developments emerge. Wrapped XRP initiatives now allow the asset to operate within networks such as Solana while remaining fully backed by native XRP.\nCurrently near $1.99, the XRP price reflects short-term hesitation, but broader utility is expanding. With more than $100 million in value locked at launch, wrapped XRP is designed to provide liquidity access across lending, trading, and liquidity platforms on multiple chains. Regulated custody and compliance frameworks are also in place, increasing appeal among larger market participants. While near-term price action remains measured, these developments position XRP as a more flexible asset over time.\nFinal Outlook\nRecent market behavior shows the Solana price holding near major resistance levels after its earlier move, while the XRP price continues to focus on ecosystem development rather than fast price expansion. These established assets remain in a pause phase, waiting for stronger signals to drive their next direction."

                "body": "The Solana Mobile ecosystem is moving to the next stage of development. The company has officially confirmed that it will allocate 20% of the total SKR token supply for an airdrop to Seeker smartphone users and developers who participated in the platform\u2019s growth.\nThe token launch is scheduled for January 21. Along with it, Solana Mobile is betting on a governance and incentive model built directly into the mobile ecosystem.\nAirdrop as a Reward for Real Usage\nSolana Mobile emphasized that the airdrop is not aimed at speculative activity but at actual participation. The network snapshot to determine recipients has already been taken, and the key criterion was activity during Seeker Season 1.\nThe exact distribution amounts for each participant have not yet been disclosed. The company promised to publish details closer to the claim start. It is only known that the 20% share is intended for both device users and developers who created and maintained applications within the ecosystem.\nThis approach highlights the role of SKR not as a marketing token but as a tool for governance and coordination.\nSeeker Season 1 Demonstrated Scale of Demand\nThe first season became a key argument in favor of launching its own token. According to Solana Mobile, more than 100,000 users participated in Seeker Season 1.\nDuring this period:\n- users interacted with more than 265 decentralized applications\n- the network processed over 9 million transactions\n- the total on-chain turnover reached about $2.6 billion\nThese figures indicate stable engagement rather than one-time interest. Solana Mobile calls the results proof that crypto-oriented smartphones can scale and support active usage.\nTransition to Seeker Season 2\nAlong with the airdrop announcement, the company confirmed the launch of Seeker Season 2. The new season will start immediately after the first ends and will be a logical continuation of the engagement model.\nDetails about the mechanics have not yet been disclosed, but Solana Mobile has already made it clear that SKR will play a key role in the rewards and activity system. Thus, the token becomes the connecting element between past achievements and the future growth of the ecosystem.\nWhat the SKR Token Is\nThe SKR launch is scheduled for January 21 at 02:00 UTC. The token performs several functions within the Seeker ecosystem.\nSKR is used:\n- for governance and voting\n- for delegation to so-called Guardians\n- as the basis for mechanics similar to staking\nGuardians are responsible for device verification, network security, and curating the decentralized app store. Delegating tokens to these participants allows users to influence platform development and receive rewards for participation.\nThis model is designed to decentralize decision-making while maintaining quality control and security.\nSmartphone as the Gateway to the Solana Ecosystem\nSolana Mobile positions Seeker not just as a device but as the main gateway to mobile Web3. The smartphone becomes the access point to applications, tokens, governance, and on-chain activity without the need for third-party solutions.\nFor the Solana ecosystem, this is an important strategic step. The mobile format expands the audience and lowers the entry barriers for new users.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nThe SKR airdrop could become one of the most notable events in the mobile Web3 segment at the start of the year. It secures the contribution of early users and simultaneously launches a new governance model.\nIf Seeker Season 2 maintains the pace of engagement, Solana Mobile will achieve a rare case for the market\u2014a sustainable mobile crypto ecosystem with its own token, real usage, and an active community.\nRead More: Meme Coin Hype Returns as Appetite for Risk Grows"

                "body": "Putin demands more taxes as Russia's growth slows to a crawl in the wartime economy\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is moving to extract more taxes as the country's wartime economy falters.\nConsumers and tech face higher levies as the Kremlin hunts for revenue.\nSanctions and weak oil prices continue to pressure Russia's war chest.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a \"significant increase\" in tax collection and compliance this year as Russia's wartime economy continues to lose momentum.\nThe Kremlin announced the directive on Saturday following an early December meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.\nA share of that increase is set to come from higher consumption taxes, which rose from 20% to 22% on January 1. This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago \u2014 sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% \u2014 down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\nOil price pressure\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil \u2014 still under tough sanctions \u2014 back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

The gains were driven by metal products and lumpy, big-ticket transport orders like aircraft, ships, trains, and military vehicles \u2013 the kind of demand that can swing the numbers from one month to the next. Meanwhile, the eurozone\u2019s mood stayed gloomy: the European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment index dipped to 96.7 in December (below the long-run 100 average) and con..\nsumer confidence remained weak at -13.1. ING thinks growth can improve through 2026 as real wages help spending and investment recovers, but low confidence \u2013 and when fiscal support shows up \u2013 is the near-term wildcard.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Strong prints help but they don\u2019t remove the fog.\nOne upbeat data point can spark a manufacturing bounce, but stocks usually need follow-through in surveys and earnings to sustain it. That uncertainty can leave investors picky, rewarding firms with clear demand and punishing those guiding to restructuring or softer end-markets. Thursday offered a reminder: Zalando slid after outlining logistics changes, and analysts flagged macro and financing headwinds for suppliers like Sartorius.\nZooming out: Europe\u2019s rebound may lean more on consumers than industry.\nOrders show factories can still deliver upside surprises, but confidence below average suggests households and businesses aren\u2019t ready to spend freely. That\u2019s why 2026 forecasts increasingly rely on rising real wages to keep consumption moving. The risk is that investment depends less on one month\u2019s orders and more on policy follow-through \u2013 so the timing and scale of fiscal stimulus could decide how durable any recovery is.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

(NASDAQ:MDXG) as a stock to potentially avoid with its 22.9x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\nWhile the market has experienced earnings growth lately, MiMedx Group's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\nView our latest analysis for MiMedx Group\nKeen to find out how analysts think MiMedx Group's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?\nMiMedx Group's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver solid growth, and importantly, perform better than the market.\nTaking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 51%. This has erased any of its gains during the last three years, with practically no change in EPS being achieved in total. Accordingly, shareholders probably wouldn't have been overly satisfied with the unstable medium-term growth rates.\nShifting to the future, estimates from the five analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 25% per annum over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 12% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.\nWith this information, we can see why MiMedx Group is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\nThe Final Word\nUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.\nWe've established that MiMedx Group maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\nYou always need to take note of risks, for example - MiMedx Group has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.\nYou might be able to find a better investment than MiMedx Group.

(NASDAQ:EMBC) as a highly attractive investment with its 7.9x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\nRecent times have been advantageous for Embecta as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.\nSee our latest analysis for Embecta\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Embecta will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Any Growth For Embecta?\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should far underperform the market for P/E ratios like Embecta's to be considered reasonable.\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 21%. However, this wasn't enough as the latest three year period has seen a very unpleasant 59% drop in EPS in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 17% per year as estimated by the four analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 12% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.\nWith this information, we find it odd that Embecta is trading at a P/E lower than the market. It looks like most investors are not convinced at all that the company can achieve future growth expectations.\nThe Key Takeaway\nWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\nWe've established that Embecta currently trades on a much lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is higher than the wider market. There could be some major unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the positive outlook. It appears many are indeed anticipating earnings instability, because these conditions should normally provide a boost to the share price.\nIt is also worth noting that we have found 3 warning signs for Embecta (2 can't be ignored!) that you need to take into consideration.\nYou might be able to find a better investment than Embecta.

                "body": "- United States\n- /\n- Medical Equipment\n- /\n- NasdaqGM:NPCE\nNeuroPace (NASDAQ:NPCE) Has Debt But No Earnings; Should You Worry?\nDavid Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies NeuroPace, Inc. (NASDAQ:NPCE) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\nWhat Is NeuroPace's Debt?\nAs you can see below, NeuroPace had US$58.7m of debt, at September 2025, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$60.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$1.27m.\nA Look At NeuroPace's Liabilities\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NeuroPace had liabilities of US$19.6m due within 12 months and liabilities of US$69.1m due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$60.0m in cash and US$14.9m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$13.8m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\nOf course, NeuroPace has a market capitalization of US$559.6m, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, NeuroPace boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load! The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NeuroPace's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\nView our latest analysis for NeuroPace\nOver 12 months, NeuroPace reported revenue of US$95m, which is a gain of 24%, although it did not report any earnings before interest and tax. With any luck the company will be able to grow its way to profitability.\nSo How Risky Is NeuroPace?\nStatistically speaking companies that lose money are riskier than those that make money. And in the last year NeuroPace had an earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) loss, truth be told. And over the same period it saw negative free cash outflow of US$17m and booked a US$24m accounting loss. While this does make the company a bit risky, it's important to remember it has net cash of US$1.27m. That means it could keep spending at its current rate for more than two years. NeuroPace's revenue growth shone bright over the last year, so it may well be in a position to turn a profit in due course. Pre-profit companies are often risky, but they can also offer great rewards. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for NeuroPace you should know about.\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can ac"

                "body": "New federal dietary recommendations have sparked mixed reactions from the embattled restaurant industry, as changing guidelines could encourage Americans to dine out less often or choose from a smaller pool of restaurants when they do leave home.\nThe departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled the nutrition guidelines on Wednesday. The recommendations, which are updated every five years, pushed for higher consumption of protein and full-fat dairy and reduced intake of processed foods and sugary drinks.\nThe guidelines are primarily a public health tool for federal agencies, health-care providers and nutrition experts, so it's unclear how much they will influence individual consumer choices. Although the recommendations largely focus on eating at home, they lightly touched on the restaurant industry as well.\n\"When dining out, choose nutrient-dense options,\" the guidelines advise.\nWhile the recommendations could discourage Americans from spending at restaurants \u2014 especially at a time when high inflation has curbed trips to dine out \u2014 some pockets of the industry had a positive reaction to the changes. The changes could give a particular boost to struggling fast-casual chains like Sweetgreen and Chipotle, which have long touted the type of natural ingredients championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make American Healthy Again\" movement.\nOne lobbying executive who represents restaurant companies, whose organization was involved in meetings with the White House on the new guidelines, said the outcome could have been \"far worse\" for the sector. The person, who declined to be named because their organization was involved in private discussions, said the end result was better for the industry than proposed guidance from earlier in 2025 was.\nHowever, the executive said they are still concerned the guidelines could encourage Americans to eat at home when diners have affordable options to incorporate those foods at restaurants. That implication could also ruffle feathers among restaurant chains and their franchisees.\nDespite those potential concerns from some, industry lobbying group the National Restaurant Association backed the new guidelines.\n\"Now, more than ever, restaurant operators are offering a wider variety of options, allowing consumers to choose what best fits their dietary needs, preferences, and lifestyles. We congratulate Secretary Kennedy and the Trump Administration on the release of the new guidelines and look forward to continued collaboration with policymakers to ensure that nutrition guidance remains practical, flexible, and supportive of access and innovation,\" National Restaurant Association spokesman Sean Kennedy said in a statement to CNBC.\nRestaurant franchise lobbyist the International Franchise Association, called the approach \"nuanced\" and said it may limit the number of price increases restaurants have to make.\n\"Fortunately, the more nuanced approach of these guidelines helps ensure our members will not have to raise prices and that consumers can continue to make their own choices,\" the group said. \"Any future regulations or guidance must keep potential cost increases top of mind, as restaurant owners already face numerous regulatory burdens and supply chain challenges, which most often disproportionately affect small business owners, like franchisees, and ultimately, American consumers.\"\nHow fast casual could benefit\nSome of the most supportive reactions came from chains that had been beaten down in 2025, including Chipotle and Sweetgreen. Both fast-casual names saw pullbacks from younger consumers who continue to struggle in a K-shaped economy, where spending has concentrated more among the highest earners.\nLoading chart...\nSweetgreen, which was the biggest restaurant sector laggard last year with a nearly 80% stock decline, cheered the new guidelines.\nA spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"We keep ultra-processed ingredients and added sugars out of our restaurants, sour"

Dairy is an excellent source of protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals.\u201d\nFDA Commissioner Martin Makary, who joined Kennedy at Wednesday\u2019s press conference, said, \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve been fed a corrupt food pyramid that has had a myopic focus on demonizing natural healthy saturated fats, telling you not to eat eggs and steak, and ignoring a giant blindspot: refined carbohydrates, added sugar, ultraprocessed foods.\u201d\nThe new recommendations came two days after the administration, guided by Kennedy\u2019s opposition to many vaccinations, announced it would dramatically reduce the number of vaccinations for babies and children.\nThe American Medical Association, which last year expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over Kennedy\u2019s plan to disband the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, applauded the dietary guidelines for \u201cspotlighting the highly processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, and excess sodium that fuel heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other chronic illnesses.\u201d\nAMA President Bobby Mukkamala, M.D., also pledged to work with Congress to improve food labeling, define ultraprocessed foods and \u201cincrease investment in nutrition research.\u201d\nThe guidelines include suggestions to \u201ceat a variety of colorful, nutrient-dense vegetables and fruits,\u201d and to \u201ceat whole vegetables and fruits in their original form.

If we can't protect this, nothing else matters.\"\nIf Williams follows through on his desire to leave Washington -- LSU is the presumptive favorite for his services, but others are expected to be involved as well -- his case will be a litmus test for the rules of a new era. And it will likely end up in court.\nThe situation can be boiled down to a simple point that has been a running issue and an embarrassment for college sports: Can contracts be enforced?\n\"This situation is a product of 2026 football,\" a prominent athletic director told ESPN. \"Where the story ends, this is one of the big moments in college football -- or really, college sports -- and what we do next.\"\nWhen initially contacted, Demond Williams Sr. -- the quarterback's father -- declined to comment.\nIf Williams attempts to leave for LSU or another school, it is likely to become a bigger saga than former Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava's jump from Tennessee to UCLA last year.\nIt's also a potentially much higher-profile version of the legal fallout -- still unresolved -- from the departure last fall of Wisconsin defensive back Xavier Lucas to Miami.\nWisconsin sued Miami claiming the school committed tortious interference by knowingly compelling a player to break the terms of his deal with the Badgers.\nWilliams is a household name in the Big Ten and among college sports fans, as he threw for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns this season. He also ran for 611 yards and six touchdowns. Williams was originally committed to coach Lane Kiffin and Ole Miss in 2023 before flipping to Jedd Fisch and Arizona. He followed Fisch to Washington when Fisch took the head coaching job there in 2024.\n\"This wouldn't happen in professional sports,\" another high-ranking college official said. \"Things like this seem to show that people think that they can do anything.\"\nThe college sports world is watching intently. One general manager at a top program told ESPN on Wednesday: \"It's extremely embarrassing the system allows this. There's no stability at all. How are people sitting around watching everything crumble? What are the leaders doing? What are the commissioners doing? How do we not get everyone in a room and not leave until there's a solution.\"\nOne veteran head coach added with a chuckle on the lack of oversight: \"I don't even know who we turn complaints in to.\"\nWashington sources say the university is prepared to pursue all legal avenues to enforce Williams' contract. The Big Ten has also been engaged on the issue, and the league has been vocal in the past about how crucial it is that \"agreed-to obligations be respected, honored and enforced.\" Williams used a traditional agency to complete his deal. Sources said there had been outreach for more than two weeks from people outside the agency to schools. The agency that did his deal was blindsided by Williams' portal entry.\nPer sources, one person who has contacted schools about Williams is Cordell Landers, who generally refers to himself as an adviser and loomed as one of the central figures in Iamaleava's departure"

So when China tightens export controls, manufacturers can feel it fast through delays and higher costs. Japan says it will coordinate with allies like the US on \u201csupply security\u201d and is assessing the impact on domestic companies. At the same time, the weaker yen is helping exports and narrowing Japan\u2019s trade deficit, cushio..\nning the macro hit even if supply chains get messier.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Supply chains can move stocks faster than sales.\nInvestors are treating access to critical materials as a real competitive edge. Companies tied to electrification and data infrastructure can benefit from demand, but they\u2019re also exposed to magnet shortages and price spikes. If controls persist, expect more talk of stockpiling, long-term supply contracts, and alternative sourcing \u2013 and more volatility for automakers and electronics firms that can\u2019t easily redesign components.\nThe bigger picture: Strategic materials are becoming a new macro variable.\nFor decades, interest rates and oil were the big swing factors. Now, governments are also competing over chokepoint inputs that sit upstream of entire industries. Japan is trying to build resilience through diplomacy and coordination, while the yen\u2019s weakness and improving trade balance buy it time. But a world of tighter tech and materials controls could keep global supply chains less efficient \u2013 and inflation risks stickier \u2013 than investors got used to.\nThis content is free, but you must be logged in to continue reading.\nAlready have an account?"

                "body": "Nikkei 225 Advances 1.1% Following Strong Earnings from Fast Retailing\nOn January 8, 2026, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose sharply, climbing about 1.1% in Tokyo trading. The move came after Fast Retailing, the parent company of Uniqlo, reported much stronger-than-expected earnings for its latest quarter.\nInvestors cheered the results. Fast Retailing not only logged higher sales and profit, but also raised its forecast for the full year. This boost in confidence helped lift the wider Nikkei 225. The index jumped as more traders bet on healthy earnings from big Japanese firms.\nThe rise is also a sign of deeper shifts in the market. It reflects how strong corporate performance can spark wider gains in stocks. In this article, we will look at why this matters.\nThe Nikkei 225 Snapshot\nOn January 9, 2026, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 climbed about 1.1%, driven most strongly by gains in high-profile Japanese firms. Fast Retailing, the operator of the Uniqlo brand, led this move by surging after reporting an impressive set of earnings. Other exporters also helped lift the index as the weaker yen boosted the value of future foreign earnings. Asian markets broadly rose that day, while U.S. futures were mostly flat, showing a cautious but positive mood across global markets as traders awaited U.S. jobs data.\nThe Nikkei\u2019s breadth was narrow, meaning just a few big companies were behind much of the gains. Fast Retailing\u2019s share rise accounted for a large chunk of the index\u2019s overall advance, pushing up the weighted average. Automakers like Toyota also added modest gains alongside other major exporters. Though the gain was not uniform across all sectors, the move reflected solid confidence in Japan\u2019s corporate earnings cycle at the start of 2026.\nFast Retailing Earnings: The Core Catalyst\nFast Retailing\u2019s earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year ending August 31, 2026, showed strong growth in sales and profits. For the three months to November 30, 2025, revenue climbed nearly 15% to about \u00a51.0277 trillion, while operating profit jumped more than 30% to roughly \u00a5205.6 billion compared with the year before. Net profit also rose by about 12%.\nThe company attributed this rise to strong demand for seasonal products both in Japan and overseas. The global expansion strategy, including new stores in cities across Europe and plans in the United States, also helped drive growth. Fast Retailing lifted its full-year revenue and profit forecasts, signalling confidence that this strong start would continue for the broader fiscal year.\nFast Retailing\u2019s performance is meaningful because it is one of Japan\u2019s largest companies by market value. When it reports strong results, it can move the whole market by boosting investor confidence in Japanese equities.\nNikkei 25 Sector Leadership & Index Dynamics\nThe Nikkei 225 is price-weighted and heavily influenced by large-cap names. Fast Retailing\u2019s surge added significant points to the index. On some trading sessions, its stock alone contributed more to the point gain than several sectors combined. Automakers like Toyota also benefited from the weaker yen, which makes profits earned overseas more valuable when converted back into yen.\nDespite this leadership, other parts of the market showed mixed strength. Smaller exporters and domestic-focused firms lagged behind. This uneven participation suggests the index\u2019s rise was concentrated, not broad-based.\nTokyo Macro Backdrop and Market Sentiment\nTokyo markets were also influenced by wider Asian sentiment on January 9, 2026. Shares rose in Hong Kong and Shanghai, signaling investor optimism across the region. China\u2019s faster inflation data hinted at stronger consumer demand, supporting markets there too.\nThe yen remained weak against the U.S. dollar, a trend that has helped Japanese exporters\u2019 competitiveness but has also raised cost pressures for imported goods. This weak currency backdrop has been a key driver for Japan Inc., helping firms like Fast Retailing post stronger num"
