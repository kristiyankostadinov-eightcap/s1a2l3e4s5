                "body": "Here's what gold crossing $4,000 is telling us about the U.S. economy\nGold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.\nThe price of gold has leaped 53% this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.\nInvestors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.\nOf late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.\n\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.\nThe reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.\nEconomic uncertainty\nGold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.\n\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.\nAlthough the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.\nFederal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.\n\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"\nFed rate cuts\nIn September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.\nGold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.\nWith interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.\nGold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"\nGlobal gold demand\nInvestments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global"

A correction would be defined as a fall in these indexes of more than 10%.\nThe price of spot gold - the real-time market value of the precious metal for immediate delivery - rose to more than $4,036 an ounce on Wednesday afternoon in Asia.\nGold futures - which serve as a gauge of market sentiment - reached the same level on 7 October. Futures are agreements to buy or sell the asset at a pre-determined date in the future.\nThe US government shutdown, which was triggered by repeated impasses over public spending, is a \"tailwind for gold prices\", said OCBC's Christopher Wong, who is the Singapore-based bank's rates strategist.\nInvestors have turned to safe haven assets like gold during previous US government shutdowns.\nIt rose by nearly 4% during the month-long shutdown in Trump's first term in the White House.\nBut gold prices could fall if the shutdown ends more quickly than some investors are expecting, said Mr Wong.\nGold's \"unprecedented rally\" in the past month has surpassed analysts' expectations, said UOB bank's head of markets strategy Heng Koon How.\nHe added that the rise is also tied to the weakening US dollar and more non-professional buyers, known as retail investors, purchasing gold.\nAlthough the current surge in gold prices has been triggered by short-term uncertainty, the overall strength of gold is largely the result of central banks buying it as a strategic move away from US treasuries and over-reliance on the strength of the dollar.\nCentral banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.\nNot everyone investing in gold buys the physical precious metal.\nSome investors put their money into financial products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are backed by gold.\nA record $64bn has been invested in gold ETFs so far this year, according to the World Gold Council trade association.\nGregor Gregersen, the founder of precious metals dealer and storage provider Silver Bullion, said he has seen customers numbers more than double in the last year.\nRetail investors, banks and wealthy families have increasingly turned to gold, viewing it as a safeguard against global economic uncertainty, he said.\n\"Gold will fall at some point, but I believe given the economic environment, it's on an upward trend for at least five years,\" Mr Gregersen said.\nGold may fall in value if there is a hike in interest rates or geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties ease, said OCBC's Mr Wong.\nIn April, for instance, the price of gold fell by around 6% after Trump backed off from firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said.\n\"Gold is often seen as a hedge against uncertainty, but the hedge can be unwound.\"\nAnd in 2022, gold's value plunged from $2,000 to $1,600 an ounce, after the US central bank raised interest rates to curb the inflation trig"

                "body": "EUR/USD remains pinned near one-month lows with the FOMC minutes on tap\n- The Euro depreciates for the third consecutive day, reaching levels near 1.1600.\n- The political impasse in France keeps the Euro under pressure.\n- The lack of progress to restore US government funding is starting to boost the Dollar on risk-averse flows.\nEUR/USD keeps hovering right above one-month lows at 1.1605, weighed by investors' concerns about the fragile political and fiscal situation in France. The pair trades at 1.1635 at the time of writing, with investors awaiting the release of the minutes of the last Fed meeting along with a string of Federal Reserve (Fed) and European Central Bank (ECB) speakers, including President Christine Lagarde.\nThe Common currency had come under increasing pressure earlier on the day as pressure on French President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap election mounted amid growing criticism from his own ranks. Former allies have joined the demands of opposition parties to call elections or resign, and rating agencies have warned of a further downgrade of France's sovereign credit status if the political impasse drags on.\nAcross the Atlantic, the political scenario is not much better. US Senate Democratic and Republican leaders remain unable to find a way to restart funding as the shutdown enters its second week, and hopes of a breakthrough this week have fallen to 23% according to a poll by Polymarket. The lack of progress has started to erode market sentiment, boosting demand for the US Dollar and other traditional safe havens.\nEuro Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\nDaily digest market movers: Political uncertainty hurts the Euro\n- The growing political uncertainty in France keeps bleeding the Euro this week, while investors' concerns about a prolonged shutdown of the US federal government have started to hurt market sentiment and boost demand for the safe-haven USD. In the absence of key macroeconomic data to alter this view, the bearish EUR/USD trend has further room to go.\n- On Wednesday, France's recently resigned Prime Minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, assured that he is going to present a solution to President Macron later today and affirmed that \"the dissolution of the parliament is becoming more remote\". These comments have given some air to an ailing Euro, but the broader trend remains strongly bearish.\n- On Tuesday, ECB President Christine Lagarde reiterated that the disinflationary process in the Eurozone has been completed and that she is hopeful that France will meet its international commitments and produce a budget in time.\n- Eurozone data has failed to improve investors' sentiment. German Factory Orders figures showed a 0.8% decline in August, against market expectations of a 1.4% growth, following a 2.7% contraction in July. Year-on-year, orders have increased at a 1.5% rate, after a 3.3% fall in July.\n- Fed policymakers continue showing their divergences. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari has warned about a burst of inflation if the bank lowers rates too fast, while US President Donald Trump's latest appointment, Fed Governor Stephen Miran, stated that inflation is due to population increases and reiterated that monetary policy needs to ease.\nTechnical Analysis: EUR/USD remains dangerously close to 1.1610 support\nThe EUR/USD technical picture reflects strong bearish pressure. The 4-hour chart Relative Strength Index (RSI) is low but not yet at oversold levels, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MAC"

                "body": "Political Risk in Japan and the Euro\u2019s Cross-Currency Headwinds\nThe euro\u2019s troubles are compounded by external cross-flows. The victory of Sanae Takaichi in Japan\u2019s leadership race triggered a collapse in the JPY, with USD/JPY climbing above 150, its highest in 18 months. The yen\u2019s weakness redirected capital into the dollar, strengthening U.S. indices and weighing indirectly on the euro. The spillover from Asian markets amplified the safe-haven rotation, where investors favored the greenback over the single currency due to Europe\u2019s internal divisions. Analysts note that the euro\u2019s underperformance is not isolated to the dollar\u2014EUR/GBP fell to 0.8512, while EUR/JPY plunged below 174.00, its sharpest two-day drop since May. The widening interest rate differentials between the ECB and other central banks further undermine carry appeal for the euro.\nMacro Catalysts Ahead: FOMC Minutes and ECB Speeches in Focus\nTraders are now awaiting the FOMC meeting minutes, due later today, as a potential catalyst for EUR/USD volatility. The minutes from the September 16\u201317 meeting, where the Fed voted to cut rates by 25 basis points, will shed light on policymakers\u2019 internal debate over growth risks amid the data blackout caused by the shutdown. Fed members including Governor Bowman and President Goolsbee are scheduled to speak later in the day, offering clues about how deeply divided the Committee remains. Simultaneously, the ECB\u2019s Lagarde is expected to address fiscal risks and market fragmentation in a high-profile speech in Frankfurt. A dovish tone from either side could trigger a corrective bounce toward 1.1690, while any sign of Fed caution on further cuts would reinforce dollar strength and drive EUR/USD toward 1.1500.\nMarket Sentiment: Traders Stay Bearish but Volatility Remains Contained\nDespite persistent bearish momentum, implied volatility in EUR/USD options remains muted at 6.2%, indicating traders expect controlled downside rather than disorderly selling. However, sentiment surveys reveal caution: over 64% of leveraged funds tracked by the CFTC hold net-short euro positions, the highest ratio since April. Retail traders, on the other hand, appear increasingly contrarian, with positioning data showing 58% long exposure, a setup that typically precedes further downside before a potential reversal. As liquidity remains thin amid the government shutdown and Chinese holidays, intraday ranges are expected to remain tight, with volume clusters forming between 1.1590\u20131.1650.\nTradingNews Verdict: EUR/USD \u2013 SELL (Short-Term), Neutral Medium-Term\nBased on combined macro, technical, and positioning signals, the balance of risk favors continued euro weakness. The mix of French political paralysis, lack of Eurozone growth momentum, and a defensive dollar points to further downside. As long as EUR/USD stays below 1.1650, bears maintain control with targets at 1.1575 and 1.1490. A sustained rebound above 1.1720 would be required to shift bias toward neutral. For now, the outlook remains bearish short-term, neutral mid-term, as traders brace for the FOMC minutes and ECB rhetoric to determine whether the next 200-pip move unfolds before the week\u2019s end."

Spot prices climb further beyond the 1.3400 mark in the last hour and, for now, seem to have snapped a two-day losing streak amid a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD).\nFrom a technical perspective, the recent repeated failures near the 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the downfall along a descending channel since the beginning of this month favor the GBP/USD bears.

The Aussie Dollar may be poised for a rally.\nSince the interest rate decision by the RBA the Aussie Dollar has flattered to deceive. AUD/USD has faced a challenge given the US Dollars recent renaissance but that rally is likely to run out of steam soon in my opinion.\nThe fact that the RBA are holding rates and the Fed expected to cut bodes well for the AUD/USD pair to rise higher.\nThe US government shutdown appears to be benefitting the US Dollar at the moment and there is a possibility that this persists for a little while longer.\nWhat this could mean for AUD/USD is that we could see a continued grind over the coming days and weeks until the US government shutdown ends and US data releases begin filtering through.\nCommodity Rally to Benefit the Australian Dollar?\nThere is another factor to consider and that is the continued rally of commodity markets such as Gold, Silver and Copper. The Australian Dollar is considered a commodity currency and usually gains when the precious metal markets are on the rise.\nThis definitely adds weight to the theory that a rally for the Aussie Dollar may be in the offing. The technicals further support the idea for the AUD/USD to rally higher. Let us take a look at why.\nTechnical Analysis - AUD/USD\nFrom a technical point of view, AUD/USD has been consolidating and edging lower over the last 6 or so trading days,\nHaving broken the bull flag pattern which was in play the pair looked poised for a rally but has since had a pullback to a key level of confluence.\nThe level/area in question around 0.6550-0.6500 houses the 50 and 10-day MAs. The daily candle also looks poised to close with a downside wick highlighting the potential buying pressure in this price zone.\nIf an upside rally does materialize, the measured move potential from the flag breakout is around 70 pips.\nThis would mean a potential retest for AUD/USD of the recent highs at around the 6685 handle.\nA move beyond that level would bring the 0.6750 and 0.7000 psychological level into focus.\nIf AUD/USD pushes lower from here, immediate support rests at 0.6542, 0.6530 and 0.6500. A break below 0.6500 could open up a retest of the 200-day MA, which rests at the 0.6418 handle.\nAUD/USD Daily Chart, October 8, 2025\nSource:TradingView.com\nClient Sentiment Data - AUD/USD\nLooking at OANDA client sentiment data and market participants are Long on the AUD/USD with 60% of traders Net-Long. I prefer to take a contrarian view toward crowd sentiment and thus the fact that so many traders are Long means AUD/USD could fall in the near-term.\nFollow Zain on Twitter/X for Additional Market News and Insights @zvawda\nOpinions are the authors'; not necessarily that of OANDA Business Information & Services, Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers or directors.

                "body": "US approves several billion dollars of Nvidia chip sales to UAE- Bloomberg\nInvesting.com - UBS has upgraded its September 2026 AUD/USD forecast to 0.72 from 0.70, citing the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s hawkish tone and upside inflation risks that emerged from last week\u2019s policy meeting.\nThe RBA maintained its current interest rate levels during its meeting last week, prompting UBS to push back its projection for the first rate cut from November 2025 to February 2026. The investment bank also noted there is an increasing possibility that the central bank might remain on hold for an extended period.\nDespite recent softening in consumer sentiment and labor market indicators, UBS expects Australia\u2019s unemployment rate to have remained largely stable in September. The third-quarter Consumer Price Index data, scheduled for release on October 29, will be crucial for the RBA\u2019s next policy decision at its November 4 meeting.\nUBS now recommends long positions on the Australian dollar at current levels and suggests selling downside at 0.65 or below. The bank also identified several other currency pairs for potential long-Aussie positions, including AUD/CHF, AUD/CNY, and AUD/NZD.\nThe revised forecast reflects UBS\u2019s assessment that Australia\u2019s monetary policy will remain tighter for longer than previously anticipated, supporting the Australian dollar\u2019s strength against the U.S. dollar through September 2026.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

                "body": "Japanese Yen remains on the front foot; USD/JPY struggles near mid-152.00 on weaker USD\n- The Japanese Yen recovers from an over seven-month low against its American counterpart.\n- Expectations that Takaichi's policies could delay BoJ rate hikes might cap gains for the JPY.\n- The Israel-Hamas peace deal boosts investors\u2019 appetite and acts as a headwind for the JPY.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) remains firm against a weaker US Dollar (USD), pushing the USD/JPY pair below the mid-152.00s in Thursday's Asian session. Earlier this week, Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato warned against forex volatility after the recent slump in the domestic currency. Expectations for another Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike also offer some support to the JPY.\nAny meaningful JPY appreciation, however, seems elusive amid concerns about the fiscal outlook in Japan. In fact, Sanae Takaichi, who is expected to become Japan's first female Prime Minister, is a big supporter of aggressive government spending and is expected to oppose further policy tightening by the BoJ. Moreover, the Israel-Hamas agreement to the first phase of the peace deal boosts the global risk sentiment and might contribute to capping the upside for the safe-haven JPY.\nJapanese Yen lacks bullish conviction amid BoJ uncertainty, receding safe-haven demand\n- Japan's Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said earlier this week that the government will be vigilant for volatile movements on the currency market, and it's important for currencies to move in a stable manner reflecting fundamentals.\n- Sanae Takaichi's surprise win in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership race last Saturday puts her on course to become the first female Prime Minister and fueled speculations about more expansionary fiscal policy.\n- Traders are now pricing in a 26% chance that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates at its next meeting on October 30, down from around 60% last Friday. This has been weighing on the Japanese Yen since the beginning of this week.\n- Takaichi's economic advisors \u2013 Etsuro Honda and Takuji Aida \u2013 were quoted as saying that the new PM would probably tolerate another interest rate hike either in December or in January, though the path beyond that remains unclear.\n- Moreover, inflation in Japan has stayed at or above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for more than three years, and the economy expanded for a fifth straight quarter in the three months through June, keeping hopes alive for another BoJ hike this year.\n- Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s September meeting released on Wednesday indicated near unanimity among participants to lower interest rates amid concern about labour market risks and a more balanced inflation outlook.\n- Policymakers, however, remained split on whether there should be one or two more rate reductions before the end of this year. Nevertheless, the overall tone was cautious and pointed to a continued easing bias.\n- In fact, the CME Group's FedWatch Tool indicates that traders are still pricing in a greater possibility of 25-basis-point rate cut at each of the two remaining policy meetings this year, in October and in December.\n- US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of his 20-point peace plan to pause fighting and release at least some hostages and prisoners, undermining safe-haven assets.\n- Traders now look forward to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech for more cues about the future rate-cut path. This, in turn, will influence the US Dollar price dynamics and provide some meaningful impetus to the USD/JPY pair.\nUSD/JPY technical setup backs the case for the emergence of dip-buying at lower levels\nThe daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains close to the overbought zone and holds back traders from placing fresh bullish bets around the USD/JPY pair. Any subsequent pullback, however, is likely to attract fresh buyers and remain cushioned near the 152.00 round figure. This is followed by the overnight swing "

                "body": "France\u2019s Political Crisis Adds to Global Dollar Bid\nCompounding the yen\u2019s weakness is Europe\u2019s instability. The resignation of French Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu and the resulting political vacuum have intensified volatility in European markets. The EUR/USD pair has fallen toward 1.1600, adding further tailwinds to the dollar. The twin crises \u2014 in Paris and Tokyo \u2014 have amplified global demand for dollar liquidity, particularly as the U.S. government shutdown drags into its second week, freezing parts of financial regulation but not affecting Treasury operations.\nThe combination of risk aversion, policy divergence, and yield differentials has created the perfect setup for extended dollar strength. Market data shows leveraged funds increasing net long USD/JPY positions by 21,000 contracts last week, the highest build-up since March.\nEconomic Divergence: Japan\u2019s Fragile Inflation and U.S. Resilience\nJapan\u2019s inflation remains far below target, with core CPI growth slowing to 1.8% YoY, down from 2.3% earlier in the summer. Wage pressures have stalled, reducing the BoJ\u2019s confidence in achieving sustainable price growth. Conversely, U.S. core PCE inflation remains above 2.6%, and GDP projections for 2025\u20132028 were revised higher by the Fed, reflecting robust consumption and business investment. This divergence keeps the real yield gap firmly in the dollar\u2019s favor.\nEven with the Fed signaling potential cuts later in 2025, the U.S. Treasury yield curve remains supportive of dollar carry trades. As of this week, the 10-year yield sits at 4.29%, while Japan\u2019s 10-year government bond yields just 0.95%, a spread exceeding 330 bps \u2014 ensuring continued yen outflows unless Tokyo intervenes.\nJapan\u2019s Policy Dilemma: Intervention Risks and Timing\nThe BoJ now faces a policy dilemma. Any attempt to tighten monetary conditions risks derailing the fragile recovery, while further inaction may accelerate capital flight and destabilize the yen. Market chatter suggests that Japanese authorities could intervene verbally or directly if USD/JPY breaches 155.00, a level previously described by the Finance Ministry as \u201cexcessive.\u201d However, with the U.S. economy still outperforming, direct intervention might only offer temporary relief.\nTraders recall that last year\u2019s coordinated interventions around 152.00 temporarily pushed the pair lower by 400 pips \u2014 but gains were quickly erased within weeks. For now, Tokyo appears more focused on stabilizing internal fiscal plans than defending the currency, especially amid leadership change.\nTradingNews Verdict: USD/JPY \u2013 STRONG BUY (Target 155.00, Support 150.50)\nThe balance of data \u2014 political divergence, yield spreads, Fed flexibility, and Japanese policy paralysis \u2014 points to continued upside in USD/JPY. The pair\u2019s technical breakout above 150.00 signals the resumption of a long-term bull trend, supported by strong U.S. macro resilience and yen underperformance.\nTradingNews assigns USD/JPY: STRONG BUY, with target 155.00 short-term and support at 150.50. Momentum remains decisively in favor of the dollar as investors recalibrate around Japan\u2019s political uncertainty and the Fed\u2019s cautious easing cycle. While overbought signals may trigger intraday pullbacks, the fundamental setup continues to justify a bullish stance through Q4 2025."

That weakness lines up with doubts about Canada\u2019s growth outlook \u2013 trade scuffles with the US sparked more than 106,000 job losses in July and August, lifting unemployment to 7.1%, up 2.3 percentage points from mid-2022 lows. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada\u2019s September rate cut to 2.50% was the G10\u2019s most aggressive move this year. Markets are eyeing more easing ahead, and the new government\u2019s wider budget deficit ($62.3 billion versus $42.2 billion last year) isn\u2019t calming nerves.

The currency has been in a holding pattern since last Thursday when it hit a 4-1/2-month low at 1.3986.\n\"The pair continues to trade sideways as opposing fundamental forces keep it in balance,\" said Tony Valente, a senior FX dealer at AscendantFX.\n\"The Fed\u2019s (U.S. Federal Reserve) recent rate cut is exerting downward pressure on the USD, while Canada\u2019s weaker trade data and growing expectations that the Bank of Canada could follow with additional easing are limiting upside for the loonie.\"\nThe Canadian central bank cut interest rates last month for the first time since March, lowering the benchmark rate to 2.50%.\nCanada's trade deficit widened in August to its second-highest level on record as exports declined in the face of U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods, data on Tuesday showed. Also on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump promised to treat Canada fairly in talks over tariffs but was less committed about a continental trade deal that also includes Mexico. Canada sends about 75% of its exports to the United States, including oil. U.S. crude futures rose 1.5% to $62.57 a barrel on worries the U.S. and Europe would keep sanctions on Russia for longer.\nCanada's employment report for September, due on Friday, is expected to show the economy adding 5,000 jobs and the unemployment rate edging up to 7.2% from 7.1% in August.\n\"A weak print would likely cement expectations for a December BoC cut and push USD-CAD towards the 1.40 level, where we see a ceiling for the pair,\" strategists at Monex Europe said in a note.\nCanadian bond yields were little changed across the curve, with the 10-year trading at 3.185%.

The US Federal Reserve\u2019s recent rate cut has taken some shine off the dollar, but the loonie hasn\u2019t been able to capitalize thanks to lackluster Canadian trade data and talk of more rate cuts from the Bank of Canada. Last month\u2019s move by Canada\u2019s central bank \u2013 lowering its policy rate to 2.50%, the first cut since March \u2013 set the tone, while Canada\u2019s trade deficit in August swelled to its second-highest level ever, in part because of fresh US tariffs that hit exports. With oil prices ticking up 1.5% as global tensions rise, the loonie\u2019s getting mixed signals. All eyes are now on Canada\u2019s labor report: economists expect a 5,000-job gain and joblessness nudging up to 7.2%. If hiring comes up short, bets will likely rise on another rate cut in December, adding more downward pressure on the loonie.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Rate suspense keeps currencies in check.\nCurrency traders are jittery, watching for signs of where rates, jobs, and trade talks might go next. Monex Europe analysts warn that if Friday\u2019s jobs numbers disappoint, the USD-CAD exchange rate could jump toward 1.40\u2014a level last seen in 2020. With Canadian bond yields steady around 3.2%, investors seem to be holding back, waiting for a clearer signal before shifting their positions.\nThe bigger picture: Trade ties make or break Canada\u2019s outlook.\nAbout three-quarters of Canada\u2019s exports\u2014from energy to autos\u2014head straight to the US, leaving the Canadian economy super-sensitive to US policy shifts and global trade riffs.

Government figures released earlier on Wednesday showed Japan\u2019s nominal Labor Cash Earnings rose just 1.5% YoY in August, well below expectations of 4.1% and down sharply from 2.6% in July. Meanwhile, inflation-adjusted real wages fell 1.4% YoY, marking the eighth straight month of decline as rising prices continue to erode household purchasing power. The weak wage backdrop complicates the BoJ\u2019s efforts to normalize policy, even as a weaker Yen threatens to fuel further imported inflation.\nFormer BoJ officials have cautioned that if the Yen\u2019s slide accelerates toward the 152.00 mark against the US Dollar (USD), policymakers could be forced to act sooner to curb imported inflation. Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato has also reiterated that authorities are prepared to address \u201cexcessive volatility\u201d in the currency market, though traders remain skeptical about the likelihood of intervention unless the Yen\u2019s slide accelerates further.\nOn the UK side, attention remains on the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) monetary policy path as it seeks to balance persistent inflation with slowing growth. While the BoE maintains a cautious stance, it keeps the door open to further tightening if price pressures remain sticky, whereas the BoJ is expected to delay additional moves amid weak wage growth and political pressure for fiscal support.\nJapanese Yen Price Today\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

                "body": "GBP/JPY trades firmly near yearly high above 204.00 on fading BoJ hawkish bets\n- GBP/JPY refreshes yearly high near 204.50 on Wednesday amid continued weakness in the Japanese Yen.\n- Traders pare bets supporting interest rate hikes by the BoJ in the policy meetings remaining this year.\n- Investors await BoE Pill\u2019s speech for fresh cues on the monetary policy outlook.\nThe GBP/JPY pair exhibits strength near a fresh yearly high around 204.50 during Wednesday\u2019s European trading session, posted earlier in the day. The pair strengthens as underperformance from the Japanese Yen (JPY), with investors anticipating that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will not tighten its monetary policy further in the near term.\nJapanese Yen Price This week\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies this week. Japanese Yen was the weakest against the US Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other.

For example, if you pick the Japanese Yen from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent JPY (base)/USD (quote).\nBoJ hawkish bets have disappeared since the election of Sanae Takaichi as Japan\u2019s Prime Minister who has favoured higher fiscal spending and tax cuts, and argued against tight monetary policy conditions.\nAnalysts at MUFG have stated that Japan's rates markets have priced out a central bank rate hikes for this calendar year, following Takaichi's win, and now see the next hike possibly coming only in March 2026.\nFading BoJ hawkish bets have resulted in weakness in the Japanese Yen, which was outperforming in past few months as Japan\u2019s central bank was keeping the door open for further interest rate hikes.\nThough investors have underpinned the Pound Sterling (GBP) against the Japanese Yen, the former is exhibiting a mixed performance against its other peers. Meanwhile, investors seek fresh cues about whether the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates in the remainder of the year.\nMarket experts are mixed about whether the BoE will loosen monetary policy conditions further this year as inflationary pressures remain almost double the central bank\u2019s target of 2%, and the job market continues to deteriorate. In Wednesday\u2019s session, investors will focus on the speech from BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill, which is scheduled at 15:00 GMT.\nEconomic Indicator\nBoE's Pill speech\nHuw Pill is the Chief Economist and Executive Director for Monetary Analysis and Research of the Bank of England.

Here's the latest violation.\nWhat Happened: Stocks and options bought by members of Congress continue to gain attention from retail traders, as trades can sometimes be based on inside information or committee assignments.\nOther times, the transactions end up showing losses or are done by spouses or portfolio managers, with Congress members having less insight into why trades were made.\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nFor Congresswoman Sheri Biggs (R-S.C.), she may not have been aware of all of the trades made in 2025 by her husband and portfolio managers, but her recent disclosure violated the STOCK Act.\nBenzinga reached out to Biggs for comment and did not hear back.\nThe STOCK Act makes it mandatory for members of Congress to disclose their transactions within 45 days. Violations lead to a $200 late fee for the first offense.\nA look at the Benzinga Government Trades page shows Biggs recently disclosing multiple transactions dating back to March 2025.\nAmong the transactions were selling stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) in March, along with buying U.S. Treasury notes in March and May.\nAlso included in the disclosure was a transaction from Biggs for buying $100,000 to $250,000 worth of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT) on July 9, 2025. The transaction and many others list the spouse, which could mean it was the congresswoman's husband who made the trade.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace\u2014Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nWhy It's Important: Waiting months to disclose buying and selling stocks leads to more distrust from the public in members of Congress when it comes to their trading activity.\n\"We just came across new STOCK Act violations. Representative Sheri Biggs filed dozens of trades made past the reporting deadline. Her husband bought up to $250K of Bitcoin, $IBIT, on July 9th. Pro-crypto legislation was passed a week later,\" Quiver Quantitative tweeted.\nBenzinga previously shared transactions made by Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) that were disclosed two or more years after they were made.\nRep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) also disclosed stock transactions late, including a trade of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR), which is up over 600% since the transaction.\nBenzinga will continue monitoring the trading activity of members of Congress.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nTrending Now:\nBuilding a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\nBacked by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\nFor those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bear"

He stated that Bitcoin is seeing more institutional recognition, with Morgan Stanley advising up to 4% BTC allocation for risk-tolerant clients.\nAnother catalyst is that gold and Bitcoin are the best-performing major assets this year, fueling what Wall Street has dubbed the \"debasement trade.\" The term implies betting on assets that thrive when fiat currencies lose value.\nWith the US money supply expanding by 44% since 2020 and JPMorgan's acknowledgement of the debasement trade trend, Hougan suggests that the narrative is going mainstream, which is profitable for Bitcoin.\nHe highlighted that the bullish potential could fuel spot BTC ETF inflows, citing Bitcoin's surge to a new all-time high of $126,199 on Monday, fueled by over $3.5 billion ETF inflows last week.\nThe wave of inflows constitutes one of the strongest buying momentum since April, indicating renewed institutional appetite, according to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a report on Wednesday.\nGlassnode stated that a sustained trend of inflows between October and November could spur a further rally for BTC, with Q4 historically being Bitcoin's strongest quarter.\nThe recent resurgence in inflows pushed Bitcoin's spot volume to its highest level since April, suggesting increased liquidity and strength backing the top crypto's momentum.\nThe rebound in spot volume was accompanied by a surge in futures open interest, which reached a new all-time high of nearly $50 billion as Bitcoin climbed above $120,000, according to Glassnode. Annualized funding rates also rose above 8%, reflecting strong demand for leveraged longs and growing speculative momentum.\nGlassnode stated that although the rise does not yet signal overheating, rising funding costs have historically preceded brief market pullbacks as excess leverage unwinds.\nBitcoin trades near $123,000 on Wednesday, with US spot BTC ETFs attracting over $2 billion in the past two days, setting the stage for potential record inflows by the end of the week.\nAuthor\nMichael Ebiekutan\nFXStreet\nWith a deep passion for web3 technology, he's collaborated with industry-leading brands like Mara, ITAK, and FXStreet in delivering groundbreaking reports on web3's transformative potential across diverse sectors.

While last week saw US$3.23 billion (AU$4.89 billion) added to the ETFs, we reported that Monday brought another US$220.1 million (AU$332.2 million).\nHowever, those numbers were incomplete, as BlackRock\u2019s US$970 million (AU$1.47 billion) inflows hadn\u2019t yet been reported \u2014 bringing Monday\u2019s total net inflows to US$1.2 billion (AU$1.8 billion).\nTuesday was a similarly strong day for IBIT, with US$899.4 million (AU$1.36 billion) added, while most other ETFs remained flat, bringing the day\u2019s tally to US$875.6 million (AU$1.32 billion) in net inflows \u2014 as Grayscale\u2019s GBTC saw US$28.6 million (AU$43.3 million) in outflows.\nWednesday\u2019s numbers are not fully available at the time of writing, but the trend suggests buying is still strong, with Bitcoin hovering near record highs. Currently, BTC trades at US$121,841 (AU$184,582), just 3.6% below its all-time high of US$126,198 (AU$191,206) from 7 October 2025.\nRelated: Sen.

                "body": "Ethereum and XRP are once again at the heart of the crypto conversation. Ethereum\u2019s price surge past $4,600 has reinvigorated institutional optimism, while XRP battles a crucial support zone near $2.90, a make-or-break point that could define its next major rally. Amid these developments, a new Ethereum-based DeFi powerhouse, BullZilla, is rewriting the rules of presale economics with its Roarblood Vault and HODL Furnace staking system to become the hottest crypto coin to watch for 2025.\nSponsored\nTogether, these three cryptocurrencies illustrate the evolution of the digital asset landscape, Ethereum driving utility, XRP advancing scalability, and BullZilla redefining decentralized wealth creation. For analysts and investors searching for the hottest crypto coin to watch for 2025, these assets form the perfect trinity of innovation, opportunity, and exponential potential.\nBullZilla: The Roarblood Vault Ignites the Next DeFi Revolution\nBullZilla ($BZIL) crypto presale is quietly building a legacy of its own. Designed as a hybrid of meme culture and decentralized finance, BullZilla transforms traditional presales into living ecosystems of engagement, loyalty, and growth. Its centerpiece, the Roarblood Vault, fuels both the project\u2019s economy and community expansion, while the HODL Furnace delivers an unmatched 70% APY staking reward for long-term holders.\nBuilt on Ethereum and powered by BlockchainFX technology, BullZilla merges entertainment and economics.\nCurrent Presale Details\n- Presale Stage: Stage 5\n- Phase: 5D\n- Current Price: $0.0001324\n- Total Raised: $840,000+\n- Token Holders: 2,700+\nEach stage change reflects tangible growth, either every 48 hours or once $100,000 is raised, ensuring consistent upward momentum and rewarding early entry.\nHow to Acquire BullZilla Coins\n- Set Up a Wallet: Install a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\n- Buy Ethereum (ETH): Purchase ETH via exchanges like Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet.\n- Visit the Presale Site: Connect your wallet to the official BullZilla ($BZIL) presale portal.\n- Swap ETH for $BZIL: Select your desired amount, confirm the transaction, and secure your allocation. Tokens can be claimed once the presale concludes.\nEthereum Surges Above $4,600 as Institutional Demand Soars\nEthereum has stormed past $4,600, gaining nearly 12% in a single week, marking one of its strongest starts to October in recent memory. Fueled by over $307 million in ETH ETF inflows last Thursday, the rally underscores renewed institutional interest that had softened in September. According to data from CoinShares, these inflows represent the second-highest weekly total of 2025, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s dominance in smart contracts and decentralized finance infrastructure.\nBeyond ETFs, Ethereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary model post-merge continues to fuel scarcity. With each transaction burning ETH, supply pressure strengthens long-term valuation. As on-chain data from Glassnode indicates, active addresses are at a 14-month high, showing a growing user base even during market consolidation. These fundamentals reinforce why Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the best crypto coin to buy for 2025, balancing institutional strength with technological advancement.\nXRP Battles for Breakout Momentum\nXRP is currently fighting to maintain its crucial support near $2.90, contrasting sharply with the broader market strength seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The altcoin slipped about 4% over the past 24 hours after failing to break above the $3 resistance, now hovering just below its 20-day EMA at $2.94.\nMarket sentiment remains divided. Analyst Lark Davis warns that sustained weakness could trigger a correction toward $2.77 or even $2.22 if key supports fail. However, others, like Egrag Crypto, remain bullish, expecting a breakout if XRP maintains its consolidation between $2.6 and $3.6 within its ascending triangle pattern.\nDespite short-term turbulence, XRP\u2019s broader fundamentals, instit"

                "body": "Ethereum\u2019s $11B staking withdrawal delays ignite concerns over systemic vulnerabilities\nWith Ethereum validator exits delayed up to 42 days, ecosystem analysts warn of potential DeFi ripple effects.\nEthereum\u2019s staking network is under growing strain as validator withdrawals climb to record levels, testing the system\u2019s balance between liquidity and network security.\nRecent validator data shows that over 2.44 million ETH, valued at more than $10.5 billion, are now queued for withdrawal as of Oct. 8, the third-highest level in a month.\nThis backlog trails only the 2.6 million ETH peak recorded on Sept. 11 and 2.48 million ETH on Oct. 5.\nAccording to Dune Analytics data curated by Hildobby, withdrawals are concentrated among the leading liquid staking token (LST) platforms like Lido, EtherFi, Coinbase, and Kiln. These services allow users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity through derivative tokens such as stETH.\nAs a result, ETH stakers now face average withdrawal delays of 42 days and 9 hours, reflecting an imbalance that has persisted since CryptoSlate first identified the trend in July.\nNotably, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has defended the withdrawal design as an intentional safeguard.\nHe compared staking to a disciplined form of service to the network, arguing that delayed exits reinforce stability by discouraging short-term speculation and ensuring validators remain committed to the chain\u2019s long-term security.\nHow does this impact Ethereum and its ecosystem?\nThe prolonged withdrawal queue has sparked debate within the Ethereum community, fueling concerns that it could become a systemic vulnerability for the blockchain network.\nPseudonymous ecosystem analyst Robdog called the situation a potential \u201ctime bomb,\u201d noting that longer exit times amplify duration risk for participants in liquid staking markets.\nHe said:\n\u201cThe problem is that this could trigger a vicious unwinding loop which has massive systemic impacts on DeFi, lending markets and the use of LSTs as collateral.\u201d\nAccording to Robdog, queue length directly affects the liquidity and price stability of tokens like stETH and other liquid staking derivatives, which typically trade at a slight discount to ETH, reflecting redemption delays and protocol risks. However, as the validator queues lengthen, these discounts tend to deepen.\nFor instance, when stETH trades at 0.99 ETH, traders can earn roughly 8% annually by buying the token and waiting 45 days for redemption. However, if the delay period doubles to 90 days, their incentive to buy the asset falls to about 4%, which could further widen the peg gap.\nAdditionally, because stETH and other liquid staking tokens are collateral across DeFi protocols such as Aave, any significant deviation from ETH\u2019s price can ripple through the broader ecosystem. For context, Lido\u2019s stETH alone anchors around $13 billion in total value locked, much of it tied to leveraged looping positions.\nRobdog cautioned that a sudden liquidity shock, such as a large-scale deleveraging event, could force rapid unwinds, pushing borrowing rates higher and destabilizing DeFi markets.\nHe wrote:\n\u201cIf for example the market environment suddenly shifts, such that many ETH holders would like to rotate out of their positions (eg another Terra/Luna or FTX level event), there will be a significant withdrawal of ETH. However, only a limited amount of ETH can be withdrawn because the majority is lent out. This may cause a run on the bank.\u201d\nConsidering this, the analyst cautioned that vaults and lending markets need stronger risk management frameworks to account for growing duration exposure.\nAccording to him:\n\u201cIf an asset\u2019s exit duration stretches from 1 day to 45, it\u2019s no longer the same asset.\u201d\nHe further urged developers to factor in discount rates for the duration when pricing collateral.\nRondog wrote:\n\u201cSince LSTs are fundamentally a useful and systemic infrastructure to DeFi, we should consider making upgrades to the throughput of the exit queue.

The token launch is scheduled for the fourth quarter, and its integration will cover the entire Jupiter ecosystem stack, including trading interfaces, lending products, and decentralized futures.\n$750M in liquidity to move from USDC to JupUSD\nAs part of the agreement, Jupiter plans to gradually convert about $750 million in USDC from its liquidity pool into the new JupUSD stablecoin. Thus, the project will effectively create an internal dollar ecosystem fully based on Solana.\nEthena, known for its decentralized synthetic dollar USDe, is expanding its line of solutions in the stable token segment. Previously, the company released USDtb\u2014the first stablecoin created in collaboration with Anchorage Digital bank and compliant with GENIUS Act standards.\n\u201cJupUSD is another addition to our portfolio of White Label products, which are already used by partners such as SUI and MegaETH,\u201d noted Ethena founder Guy Young.\nIntegration of JupUSD into the Jupiter ecosystem\nJupUSD will become a central element of Jupiter\u2019s DeFi infrastructure. According to the project, the token will be used in five key areas:\n- as collateral on Jupiter\u2019s decentralized futures platform\n- as the main stablecoin in trading interfaces and the Jup Mobile app\n- as a base liquidity asset on the Jupiter Lend platform\n- as a liquid pair on the DEX platform Meteora, a key Jupiter partner\n- in all new products the company plans to launch in the coming months\nAccording to Jupiter co-founder Sion Ong, stablecoins have proven their viability in the on-chain environment:\n\u201cWe are confident that this segment will grow 10\u2013100 times. JupUSD will be a key step for Jupiter to create additional value for users and secure its role as the DeFi hub on Solana.\u201d\nFinancial backing and collateralization of the token\nAt launch, JupUSD will be 100% backed by the USDtb stablecoin, which invests funds in the tokenized BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). In the future, the project is considering switching to USDe as collateral.\nRecall, USDe is the largest decentralized stablecoin with a capitalization of about $14.8 billion, using delta-hedging with ETH collateral and derivatives. It has already surpassed DAI and USDS in supply volume.\nFor comparison, centralized giants USDT and USDC have market capitalizations of $177 billion and $74 billion, respectively, but JupUSD will be the first major native solution for Solana with institutional support.\nA new stage for Solana and DeFi\nSolana is actively increasing its share of the stablecoin market, which currently accounts for only 9.3% of Ethereum\u2019s volume, according to The Block. The emergence of JupUSD could be a growth catalyst\u2014especially considering that Jupiter has already become the largest DEX aggregator on Solana and is developing lending and AI integration directions.\nInvestors boost confidence in Ethena\nIn September, UAE-based M2 Capital fund invested $20 million in the ENA governance token, joining a list of investors that includes Binance Labs, Bybit, Dragonfly, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton.\nThis support underscores the desire of major institutional players to secure positions in the fast-growing decentralized stablecoin segment.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nThe launch of JupUSD could be a turning point for Solana, which until now has been dominated by USDC and USDT. The new token will unite liquidity, infrastructure, and decentralization, creating the foundation for the next stage of growth in the network\u2019s DeFi sector.\nRead more: Gold breaks $4,000, bitcoin declines amid dollar index growth"

                "body": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average has navigated a turbulent yet ultimately upward trajectory from late 2024 through October 2025, demonstrating remarkable resilience despite significant slips and periods of flat trading. This period has been characterized by a delicate balance of strong corporate earnings, particularly from the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector, and persistent macroeconomic headwinds, including evolving Federal Reserve policy and volatile geopolitical trade relations. The index's journey to multiple record highs, including surpassing 45,000 for the first time in December 2024 and reaching 45,631.74 by August 2025, underscores a market grappling with uncertainty while finding catalysts for growth.\nThese fluctuations indicate a market highly sensitive to shifts in monetary policy expectations and global trade dynamics. While robust corporate fundamentals and technological advancements have provided a strong underlying current, investor sentiment has been quick to react to signals from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rate paths and pronouncements on international trade. The immediate implication is a continued environment of heightened volatility, where investors must remain agile and informed, discerning between temporary corrections and more fundamental shifts in market direction. The Dow's performance offers a microcosm of the broader economy's struggle to maintain momentum amidst a complex global landscape.\nA Year of Peaks and Troughs: The Dow's Eventful Journey\nThe period spanning late 2024 to October 2025 has been nothing short of a dramatic narrative for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, marked by unprecedented highs, sharp corrections, and swift rebounds. The index first breached the 45,000 mark on December 4, 2024, propelled by a technology-led rally and optimistic signals from the Federal Reserve. This bullish momentum continued, culminating in a new all-time high closing value of 45,631.74 by August 22, 2025, with impressive gains of 4.98% in Q2 2025 and 5.2% in Q3 2025.\nHowever, this ascent was not without significant turbulence. December 2024 saw a notable slip when the Dow shed 1,000 points on December 18, closing at 42,326.87, after the Fed projected fewer rate cuts for 2025, sparking investor concern. Early 2025 continued this volatility, with a 0.62% dip on January 2 due to lingering trade war fears and a 1.6% drop on January 10 following a hotter-than-expected jobs report that further dampened rate cut expectations. The most severe downturn occurred in April 2025, dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" when President Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs caused the Dow to plummet by 1,679 points (4%) on April 3 and an additional 2,231 points (5.5%) on April 4, totaling over 4,000 points lost in two days. This panic selling was swiftly followed by a historic rebound of 7.9% on April 9, after a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs was announced.\nKey players influencing these movements included the Federal Reserve, whose evolving stance on interest rates\u2014from aggressive cuts in late 2024 to a more cautious outlook for 2025, then resuming cuts in July and September 2025\u2014directly impacted market sentiment. Geopolitical events, specifically the U.S.-China trade relations and the Trump administration's tariff policies, also proved to be powerful market movers, as evidenced by the dramatic April 2025 swings. Furthermore, robust corporate earnings, particularly from the technology sector, consistently provided a strong underlying support for the market, enabling rapid recoveries from downturns. As of October 7, 2025, the Dow closed slightly lower, with futures indicating flat trading, reflecting the ongoing equilibrium between growth drivers and cautionary factors.\nShifting Fortunes: Winners and Losers in a Volatile Market\nThe tumultuous period from late 2024 to October 2025 has reshaped the landscape for many companies, creating distinct winners and losers within and beyond the Dow Jones Industrial"

However, Democrats insist it will not sway them in the increasingly bitter shutdown standoff.\nDow Jones FAQs\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the oldest stock market indices in the world, is compiled of the 30 most traded stocks in the US. The index is price-weighted rather than weighted by capitalization. It is calculated by summing the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing them by a factor, currently 0.152. The index was founded by Charles Dow, who also founded the Wall Street Journal. In later years it has been criticized for not being broadly representative enough because it only tracks 30 conglomerates, unlike broader indices such as the S&P 500.\nMany different factors drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The aggregate performance of the component companies revealed in quarterly company earnings reports is the main one. US and global macroeconomic data also contributes as it impacts on investor sentiment. The level of interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve (Fed), also influences the DJIA as it affects the cost of credit, on which many corporations are heavily reliant. Therefore, inflation can be a major driver as well as other metrics which impact the Fed decisions.\nDow Theory is a method for identifying the primary trend of the stock market developed by Charles Dow. A key step is to compare the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) and only follow trends where both are moving in the same direction. Volume is a confirmatory criteria. The theory uses elements of peak and trough analysis. Dow\u2019s theory posits three trend phases: accumulation, when smart money starts buying or selling; public participation, when the wider public joins in; and distribution, when the smart money exits.\nThere are a number of ways to trade the DJIA. One is to use ETFs which allow investors to trade the DJIA as a single security, rather than having to buy shares in all 30 constituent companies. A leading example is the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA). DJIA futures contracts enable traders to speculate on the future value of the index and Options provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the index at a p"

                "body": "DAX outlook positive despite growth concerns\n- DAX outlook remains bullish as poor data boosts stimulus expectations\n- Traders eye new records as index attempts to end multi-month consolidation\n- A sustained break above 24,650 could open the path towards 25,000 and possibly beyond\nThe DAX outlook remains upbeat even as economic data from Germany continues to disappoint. Despite lingering growth concerns and a sluggish German industrial sector, the benchmark index has managed to hold its ground, hinting that traders are still comfortable betting on further gains. With the US government shutdown failing to dampen global sentiment, it\u2019s no surprise to see equities holding firm, and the DAX has done just that, building on last week\u2019s impressive rally with another push higher.\nEconomic fog thickens, but risk appetite holds even with gold above $4K\nThis morning\u2019s German Industrial Production data was grim \u2014 output slumped by 4.3% month-on-month, stoking renewed fears of recession in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Over in the US, things don\u2019t look much better, with patchy employment figures and the government shutdown halting the release of official data, leaving investors reliant on private estimates.\nAdd to that the political tension in France, and you\u2019d expect markets to be on the defensive. Yet, here we are: the DAX is climbing while gold breaks new records above $4,000. Some argue that gold\u2019s rise signals fear, but others see it as part of a wider speculative trend \u2014 traders chasing performance in every asset class, from equities to crypto. It\u2019s an odd mix of risk-taking and risk-hedging, but for now, the German index remains resilient.\nSo, why, then, is the DAX rising? Partly because of the global A.I.-hype, but more to the point for German stocks, it is Germany\u2019s anticipated fiscal stimulus, which is giving markets hope, even as macro data weakens. Broader equity sentiment in both Europe and the US remains constructive, and that tailwind continues to lift the DAX.\nTechnical DAX outlook: Traders eyes breakout to new ATHs\nLast week\u2019s surge broke the DAX cleanly out of a months-long consolidation phase \u2014 a breakout that carries weight after such a long coiling period. The index then paused early this week, giving overbought conditions a chance to cool before buyers stepped back in. That pause seems to have reset the market nicely, as today\u2019s climb brought the index close to July\u2019s peak around 24,650 at the time of writing.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the structure looks encouraging. The resistance near 24,650 has acted as a ceiling for months, and a decisive push above that zone could spark short-covering and fresh momentum towards the next logical target: 25,000. Above that level and we could potentially see the index extend towards 25,800\u201326,280 based on technical projections from its multi-month consolidation.\nOn the downside, 24,300 remains the key short-term support. It\u2019s the level that has already seen buyers step in, and holding above it keeps the trend intact. Should the market slip below, the 23,950\u201324,000 area becomes the next zone of interest, followed by the more critical 23,750 mark \u2014 the line in the sand for bulls.\nKey takeaway\nThe DAX outlook remains bullish. Recent consolidation appears to have recharged momentum, and as long as support at 24,300 holds, dips look defendable. A convincing move above July\u2019s high would likely ignite a fresh leg higher, putting 25,000 firmly in sight \u2014 and possibly more beyond that. For now, the bulls are still very much in control.\n-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst\nFollow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R\nThe information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1%. The S&P marked its 33rd record close of the year, while the Nasdaq hit its 32nd closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat.\nThe yield on the 2-year Treasury note was up to 3.58%. The 10-year yield was 4.13%.\nWall Street\u2019s appetite for risk resumed following a brief detour on Tuesday. The Invesco S&P 500 High Beta ETF, which features the S&P\u2019s riskier stocks, outperformed the broader market. Funds focused on growth, momentum, and small-caps were also in on the action.\nDividend stocks, value stocks, and low volatility stocks were among the laggards. At the sector level, the S&P\u2019s energy, real estate, and consumer staples struggled, which explains why the Dow was behind the major indexes.\nThe top sectors were tech, industrials, utilities, and consumer discretionary. Despite some market commentators calling out froth, the artificial intelligence trade was rallying.\nThe government shutdown also means Wall Street hasn\u2019t had to deal with government data releases that could conflict with the bullish view that lower interest rates and a somewhat resilient economy are in the cards. The dollar also continued to rise.\n\u201cThe dollar bounce is likely to persist as long as its main drivers remain in place: lack of information about the US economy due to the Federal shutdown; concerns about the attraction of the euro because of its trade-weighted appreciation, worries about French politics and recent mixed economic data; and last but by no means least, fears of yen-unfriendly policies in Japan,\u201d writes Kit Juckes, chief FX Strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nMinutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's September meeting did little to challenge the market's views. Traders see a 77.6% chance of a half-point in cuts through the end of the year and a 21.2% chance of just one more quarter-point cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Odds of no cuts ticked up to 1.2%, compared to 0.7% on Tuesday."

It\u2019s like, you can \u2014\u2014 I mean, I worked in the White House, and I could just imagine them dialing up an illegal immigration argument as they have to deal with a confrontation on health care, which, of course, they know that they have to deal with anyway. So it\u2019s just totally odd, but OK. The best case of their argument is that during the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Republicans limited Medicaid coverage to legal immigrants in the United States. It took \u2014 they made it more difficult for legal immigrants. No illegal aliens, no undocumented people. Nobody crossing the border. We\u2019re talking about people like Afghan refugees, Ukrainian refugees, people subject to domestic violence who get protected status. So these are all people who have legal status in the United States. Now, they are doing a card trick to call them illegal aliens. They have legal status in the United States. They are not illegally here. They\u2019ve like shown themselves to the government. We know who they are. And Democrats put forward and basically they said: We\u2019d like to undo everything you did in the Medicaid \u2014 on your attacks on Medicaid. And this was one part of it. But really, the substance of their argument was: Undo the massive cuts to the Medicaid program. So that is like just false that it is covering illegal aliens. They are not illegal aliens. It is currently illegal under federal law for federal dollars to go to health care subsidies for people here illegally. So that is like the No. 1 point to just say about this, which is the truth is that for those of us who are old enough to remember, and I have some battle scars over this issue, having worked on the legislation, was a big, robust debate about whether people were legally here, illegal aliens, undocumented people could get access to the A.C.A., and there is literally a provision that says, by statute, you cannot receive health care and the premium tax credit cannot go to any illegal aliens, undocumented people, whatever you want to call them, that is illegal. And that is why they\u2019ve had to do this mental gymnastics to get \u2014 to basically transform people who are legally here into illegal aliens, like that is just, this is like two different words. They have two different meanings, and they\u2019re just conglomerating them in order to have some shred of making a lie true, but it is still a lie.\nThe G.O.P.\u2019s \u2018Cynical, Ridiculous\u2019 Shutdown Attack\nHealth care premiums are expected to double for millions of Americans on Obamacare next year if the law doesn\u2019t change in time.

                "body": "The late Fr. Richard John Neuhaus had a love-hate relationship with the New York Times.\nRichard was a passionate partisan of New York City, which he sometimes described as a preview of the New Jerusalem, but the Gray Lady\u2019s parochialism nonetheless led him to occasionally dismiss New York\u2019s most prestigious daily as a \u201cparish newsletter.\u201d He regularly castigated the Times\u2019s editorials for their air of smug infallibility. And then there was RJN\u2019s annoyance (and more) with the Times\u2019s knee-jerk liberalism, which, by its embrace of every imaginable left-of-center cause, accelerated the decay of liberal politics into the promotion of lifestyle libertinism. Richard was thus years ahead of Joseph Ratzinger in issuing warnings about a dictatorship of relativism, the unavoidable political outcome of the Times\u2019s cultural lurch leftward.\nOn the other hand, Richard Neuhaus could no more imagine skipping the New York Times in the morning than he could imagine beginning the day without numerous cups of coffee, a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios, and a smoke.\nThat love-hate relationship was crystallized in an incident during Richard\u2019s days as a Lutheran pastor in the then-impoverished Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, when the Times declined to refer to a local black pastor (from Christendom\u2019s entrepreneurial Protestant subdivision) as \u201cBishop\u201d so-and-so. In high dudgeon, RJN wrote A. M. Rosenthal, then the Times\u2019s managing editor, and asked what was going on. The man referred to himself as \u201cBishop.\u201d His people called him \u201cBishop.\u201d The sign on the front of his ecclesiastical establishment identified him as \u201cBishop.\u201d Who did the Times think it was, and what did the Times think it was doing, denying this man the title he and his people used?\nAbe Rosenthal eventually wrote Richard a harrumphing letter, stating that, after the painstaking deliberation appropriate to the nation\u2019s newspaper of record, the Times would henceforth refer to the gentleman in question as \u201cBishop\u201d so-and-so. The letter then concluded with a sentence that would cause Richard Neuhaus to laugh uproariously for decades: \u201cAnd so, Pastor Neuhaus, you may take some satisfaction from knowing that, in drawing this matter to our attention, you have made a small contribution to the history of our times.\u201d\nOr words to that effect, if I may be pardoned for quoting the loathsome Richard Rich in A Man for All Seasons.\nOver thirty-plus years of friendship and collaboration, I must have heard Richard tell that story a dozen times, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d thought of it more than once or twice since his death in 2009. Then, recently, I read an article indicating that a churchman I admire, who indicated some sympathy with the charge that the Catholic Church in the West is \u201cobsessed\u201d with questions of sexual morality, nonetheless himself used the term \u201cLGBTQ Catholic.\u201d\nNow, as a matter of good manners, I agree with the substance of Richard\u2019s complaint to Abe Rosenthal: People should usually be identified the way they identify themselves, and in any event, it was not up to the New York Times to decide who is and who isn\u2019t a bishop. But a churchman using the term \u201cLGBTQ Catholic\u201d of any member of the Catholic Church seems to me a different matter.\nFirst, it strikes me as incoherent to give at least a nod of credibility to the charge that certain sectors of the world Church are obsessed with sexual morality and then use the hypersexualized term \u201cLGBTQ Catholic\u201d\u2014which, whatever its provenance, reduces an individual to their sexual desires, confusions, or both.\nSecond, as was pointed out at several synods beginning with Synod 2018, this usage has no warrant in Catholic history, for the Church has never identified its members by libido. Which means it\u2019s just as untoward to speak of \u201cheterosexual Catholics\u201d as it is of \u201cLGBTQ Catholics.\u201d Why? Because \u201cyou are all one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Gal. 3:28) and subdividing Catholics this way fractures the unity of the Church.\nFinally, in this political and "

Wind speeds in a tornado need to reach at least 200 mph for it to be classified as an EF-5, the highest rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.\nThe initial estimate in the days after it happened was an EF-3.\nAuthorities said two men and a woman died during the tornado, which caused extensive tree damage, tipped several train cars fully loaded with grain and lifted tanker cars. The NWS said one tanker car was thrown just over 475 feet.\nThe severe weather event also destroyed a farm in the area, with the foundation of at least one of its buildings \"considered to be swept clean,\" according to the NWS.\nAccording to officials, the tornado lasted just under 20 minutes, from 11:02 p.m. to 11:21 p.m., and created a 12-mile path of destruction from Enderlin to Alice, North Dakota.\nEnderlin is around 57 miles southwest of Fargo, North Dakota.\nThe last confirmed EF-5 tornado in the U.S. touched down in Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20, 2013, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe 2013 tornado had wind speeds of up to 200 mph.

It jumped to a high of \u00a548,465, up by over 57% from the lowest level this year.\nForeign investors are buying Japan stocks\nCopy link to sectionThe Nikkei Index and other Japanese indices, like the Topix have been in a strong uptrend this year. One reason for this is that foreign investors have continued buying these shares.\nData released on Thursday showed that these investors bought shares worth over \u00a52.46 trillion, which is equivalent to $16.3 billion. These purchases happened after the victory of Sanae Takaichi, who has favored Abenomics-like policies.\nMost notably, inflows into Japanese stocks happened after three weeks of intensive selling as investors anticipated that a more hawkish official would win the seat.\nThe ongoing Nikkei 225 Index jump is being led by companies in the defense and technology industries. Some of the most notable gainers are companies like Mitsubishi Heavy, Japan Steel Works, and IHI Corp. Technology companies like those in the semiconductor industry have also had substantial inflows.\nForeign investors have been buying Japanese stocks in the past few year after Warren Buffett moved into the market. He invested in five trading houses \u2013 Mitsui, Itochu, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Marubeni \u2013 during the pandemic and then added to their position.\nJapanese yen crash continues\nCopy link to sectionThe Nikkei 225 Index has also jumped as investors reacted to the relatively weak Japanese yen. Data shows that the USD/JPY exchange rate has soared from a low of 139.95 in May this year to the current 152.50, its highest point since February.\nThe Japanese yen has slumped partly because of the ongoing US dollar rebound. It also plunged as investors reacted to Takaichi\u2019s victory, which they believe will lead to more stimulus and an easy-money policy.\nThe yen slump coincided with the soaring Japanese bond yields. Data shows that the 30-year rose to 3.30%, while the ten-year jumped to 1.70%.\nLooking ahead, the next major catalyst for the Nikkei 225 Index will be the earnings season. Fast Retailing and Seven & I Holdings have already published their earnings.\nLater this month, companies like Hitachi, Chugai Pharma, Fujitsu, Canon, and Tokyo Gas will publish their financial results.\nNikkei 225 Index technical analysis\nCopy link to sectionThe daily timeline chart shows that the Nikkei Index has been in a strong bull run in the past few months. It has jumped from a low of \u00a530,690 on April 7 to the current \u00a548,403.\nThe index has jumped above the important resistance level at \u00a540,227, the highest point in October and November last year. It was also the highest level in January.\nThe Nikkei 225 Index has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Also, top oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have continued rising.\nThe RSI has formed a broadening wedge pattern. Therefore, the index will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance at \u00a550,000."
