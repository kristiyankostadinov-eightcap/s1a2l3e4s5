                "body": "Gold Price News Today, Nov 12: Impact of US Dollar Fluctuations on XAU\nGold prices have been on a rollercoaster, reflecting significant shifts driven by changes in the US dollar.

Understanding these dynamics is vital for anyone interested in how fluctuating gold prices might unfold.\nGold Prices and the US Dollar Influence\nThe correlation between gold prices and the US dollar is a well-studied phenomenon. As the dollar strengthens, gold prices often fall, due to the cost of gold increasing in foreign currencies. Currently, gold is trading around $1,850 per ounce, influenced by the dollar\u2019s volatility. This connection highlights the importance of monitoring the US dollar index when predicting gold trends. Investors are particularly attentive to the dollar\u2019s movements as sovereign debt discussions in the US continue to unfold, impacting market confidence.\nGold Market Analysis: Current Trends\nIn recent weeks, the gold market has seen a 2% drop, reflecting geopolitical tension and changing interest rate expectations. Analysts link these trends to global economic slowdowns, which weaken industrial demand. According to Trading Economics, the gold market remains sensitive to international events, such as the ongoing trade negotiations in Asia. Investor interest has been shifting towards more stable, income-generating assets, reducing gold\u2019s appeal temporarily, but the underlying demand remains strong due to economic uncertainties.\nFluctuating Gold Prices and Future Outlook\nFluctuating gold prices have kept traders on edge, with forecasts suggesting continued volatility. As central banks adjust their policies in response to inflation, gold\u2019s appeal as a hedge is likely to vary. On platforms like Reddit, some users discuss potential short-term rallies, although consensus suggests caution. Given the unpredictable nature of the global economy, analysts recommend keeping an eye on macroeconomic indicators. Additionally, with the holiday season approaching, traditional demand for gold might spur temporary price hikes.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn conclusion, today\u2019s gold prices are intricately connected to US dollar fluctuations. These dynamics can create opportunities for informed investors willing to navigate the complexities of the market.

Conversely, a weaker dollar boosts gold\u2019s attractiveness, driving prices up.\nThe gold market is experiencing volatility due to geopolitical uncertainties and shifting monetary policies. Currently, prices have declined by about 2% due to the stronger US dollar and changing investor priorities, though the demand for gold remains strong as a hedge against uncertainty.\nInvestors should watch global economic indicators and central bank policies, as these can influence gold prices.

The revision, detailed in the group\u2019s Monthly Oil Market Report, triggered a new round of selling, with Brent futures down 3.67% to $62.77 a barrel and WTI off 4.1% at $58.55 by 1:11 p.m. ET.\nOPEC\u2019s analysis points to faster supply growth from the United States, Brazil, and Guyana, projecting non-OPEC liquids output to increase by about 1.3 million barrels per day next year. Global oil demand is forecast to rise 1.6 million bpd to 106.2 million bpd, steady from last month but no longer enough to tighten balances. The change eliminates the shortfall OPEC had anticipated in October and implies comfortable supply coverage through mid-decade.\nThe report said OECD commercial inventories have moved back toward their five-year averages, while refining margins in Asia and Europe narrowed for a second consecutive month. OPEC attributed the softer tone to \u201cample spare capacity, healthy upstream investment, and stronger crude exports from the Americas,\u201d all of which signal a more stable supply picture after two years of constraint.\nMarket reaction was immediate. Traders said the latest revision confirms that supply is overtaking earlier demand assumptions, especially as the International Energy Agency\u2019s updated data also point to slower consumption growth. Crude futures are sliding as funds cut long positions, adding to downward pressure already visible earlier in the week when prices had begun to retreat amid weaker sentiment and softer refinery runs.\nOPEC+ production policy remains steady for now. Voluntary output cuts by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other members will extend into early 2026, though the report highlights \u201cample spare capacity\u201d if prices continue to decline.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost $2.55, or 4.18%, to settle at $58.49 a barrel.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries noted that world oil supply would match demand next year due to the wider OPEC+ group's production increases - a shift from its earlier projections of a supply deficit in 2026.\n\"The prospect that the market is in balance is definitely what drove down prices,\" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group. \"The market wants to believe it's balanced. I think the market took OPEC more seriously than IEA.\"\nThe International Energy Agency forecast in its annual World Energy Outlook on Wednesday that oil and gas demand could continue to grow until 2050.\nThe projection was a departure from the IEA's previous expectation that global oil demand would peak this decade, as the international body moved away from a forecasting method based on climate pledges back to one that takes into account only existing policies.\nJohn Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, said the OPEC outlook comes as some crude sellers cannot find buyers.\n\"There are cargoes going begging,\" Kilduff said. \"The very front of the market is forming a new price curve. There's just a general sense of weakness in the U.S. economy.\"\nAnalysts have previously highlighted that crude oversupply is curbing price gains. OPEC+ agreed this month to a pause in increasing its output in the first quarter of next year, after having unwound its cuts to production since August this year.\nThe reopening of the U.S. government, however, could boost consumer confidence and economic activity, spurring demand for crude oil, IG Market analyst Tony Sycamore wrote in a note.\nThe U.S. Republican-controlled House of Representatives is set to vote later on Wednesday on a bill, already signed off by the Senate, that would restore funding to government agencies through January 30.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its outlook on Thursday."

The pair remains steady as the US Dollar (USD) holds ground after US President Donald Trump signed the government funding bill on Thursday, marking the official end of the record 43-day government shutdown in the United States (US) history.\nThe US Dollar remains silent amid an uncertain US economic outlook and Federal Reserve (Fed) policy outlook.

Schnabel added that interest rates are \u201cabsolutely\u201d at an appropriate level, while noting that food-price inflation remains relatively strong.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rat"

                "body": "EUR/USD Price Forecast: Euro Holds 1.1574 as Fed Easing Bets Build and Traders Eye Break Above 1.1600\nThe Euro steadies near 1.1574 against the US Dollar after soft labor data fuels December Fed cut expectations while traders await the US House shutdown vote | That's TradingNEWS\nEUR/USD Price Forecast: Euro Holds 1.1574 as Fed Easing Bets Clash With Labor Market Weakness\nThe Euro to U.S. Dollar (EUR/USD) pair traded around 1.1574 on Wednesday, slipping 0.11% intraday as traders weighed weak U.S. employment figures against growing expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. Despite intraday losses, EUR/USD remains up 0.63% week-on-week, showing resilience near the upper bound of its recent 1.1500\u20131.1600 trading corridor.\nThis equilibrium reflects a battle between diverging fundamentals \u2014 a weakening U.S. economy driving dollar softness, and a Eurozone still struggling with stagnation and muted inflation.\nLabor Market Deceleration Strengthens the Case for Fed Easing\nDollar volatility intensified after the ADP private payroll report revealed consistent job losses averaging 11,000 per week in October, raising alarms about employment durability. Investors now assign a 63% probability to a 25-basis-point Fed cut at the December meeting, according to futures data.\nHowever, the lack of official Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) figures, frozen by the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, has left markets navigating blind. The missing data has elevated sensitivity to second-tier releases, amplifying USD fluctuations around 1.1550\u20131.1610.\nWith New York Fed President John Williams hinting at potential balance-sheet expansion and the Federal Reserve\u2019s confirmation that quantitative tightening is near its end, traders are repricing dollar risk. Treasury yields retreated, pushing the 2-year note to 3.92%, its lowest in 18 months \u2014 a structural headwind for the greenback.\nEurozone Data Fails to Inspire: German ZEW and CPI Flatline\nThe Eurozone\u2019s largest economy continues to lag. Germany\u2019s harmonized CPI rose only 0.3% month-on-month in October, bringing annual inflation down to 2.3%, its lowest since early 2022. While stable prices remove pressure from the European Central Bank (ECB) to tighten further, they also signal waning consumer demand.\nAt the same time, the German ZEW investor confidence index dipped from 39.3 to 38.5, signaling fading optimism about near-term recovery. Danske Bank analysts described the report as \u201ca reminder that Europe\u2019s growth engine remains in neutral,\u201d noting that energy-sensitive industries continue to drag manufacturing sentiment.\nThese readings weakened euro buying momentum even as global equities rallied on U.S. fiscal optimism. The market reaction underscores how EUR/USD strength is driven more by dollar weakness than by renewed faith in European fundamentals.\nTechnical Picture: EUR/USD Faces Stiff Resistance Near 1.1600\u20131.1680\nTechnically, EUR/USD remains pinned between two decisive boundaries. Immediate support lies at 1.1520\u20131.1530, the level that twice halted declines in late October, while resistance forms at 1.1600\u20131.1686, where sellers have repeatedly re-emerged since mid-September.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands near 48, indicating neutral momentum. The MACD lines have flattened, awaiting a breakout trigger. On the 4-hour chart, a potential falling wedge formation hints at an impending expansion in volatility.\nIf bulls manage a close above 1.1668, the door opens for a retest of 1.1748, which aligns with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of the 2021\u20132022 decline. Conversely, failure to defend 1.1500 risks a downward acceleration toward 1.1460, and potentially 1.1400, marking the next psychological floor.\nMarket Structure and Cross-Asset Context\nRisk sentiment has oscillated with the shutdown vote, which investors expect will pass this week and reopen key government agencies. The resulting data backlog, including the delayed September jobs report, could drive violent repricing across the dollar "

However, the US government shutdown is expected to end in the coming days, which would see data released again soon. The House will vote today on the spending bill to fund the government until the end of January.\nData from yesterday showed that private employers shed an average of 11,250 jobs per week over the four weeks ending October 25. The data revived concerns over the health of the US labour market, driving the US dollar lower.\nThe data comes after Challenger job cuts last week showed that US firms cut 153,000 jobs in October, the highest level for that month in two decades.\nFed policymakers acknowledged worsening conditions in the labour market as a reason for cutting interest rates, saying a worsening in the outlook could lift rate cut expectations.\nThe economic calendar shows no high-impact data scheduled for Wednesday. However, US stock futures are rising with risk flows dominating the markets, which could offer some support to EUR/USD.\nIn the eurozone, German inflation figures confirmed that CPI rose 2.3% year on year in October, in line with the preliminary figure. Wholesale inflation rose 0.3% month on month in October, up from 0.2% in September, beating forecasts of 0.1%. This could be considered supportive for the euro.\nThe ECB left interest rate unchanged for 3rd straight month as inflation remains close to the 2% target. The central bank is not expected to cut rates again this cycle.\nEUR/USD forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nEUR/USD trades within a falling channel dating back to mid-September\u2019s 1.920 high. The price found support at 1.1470, recovering to its current level of 1.1580, testing the upper band of the falling channel.\nA rise above here exposes the 50 SMA at 1.1670 and then brings 1.17 into focus ahead of 1.1780.\nFailure to break out keeps the downtrend intact. Support is seen at 1.1540, and a break below 1.1470 creates a lower low. From here, attention will turn to 1.14.\nOil prices fall ahead of OPEC\u2019s monthly report.\nOil prices have slipped below $61.00 a barrel, halting a three-day rally, as investors await a report on the global crude outlook. OPEC is due to release its monthly market report later today, followed by the International Energy Agency's annual energy assessment, which will shed light on projections across next year amid oversupply concerns.\nWorries over oversupply have weighed on oil markets in recent months as OPEC+ increased output to raise its market share. This comes at a time when the US is seeing record production. China's filling up of strategic reserves has countered some of this excess supply; however, concerns of a supply glut have lingered.\nStill, oil prices had risen in recent sessions as US sanctions on Russia began to disrupt crude markets. Lukoil declared a force majeure at an Iraqi oil field, marking the most significant fallout from the sanctions imposed by the White House last month.\nFurthermore, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait plan to increase shipments to India in December as refiners look for alternatives to Russian supply.\nMeanwhile, optimism that the US government shutdown will soon end is considered a positive for oil prices, potentially lifting the demand outlook.\nOil forecast \u2013 technical analysis\nAfter reaching 70.00 in July, oil has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows, before running into support at 56.00 last month. The price has attempted a recovery from this low and could be trading in a bull flag pattern. Buyers are attempting to break out of the falling channel, testing resistance around 61,50.\nBuyers will need a close above 61.50 and extend gains towards 62.50; a rise above here would create a higher high and expose the 200 SMA at 64.75.\nFailure to r"

                "body": "Appetite for risk remained firm on Wednesday as the US House prepared to vote on ending the longest government shutdown in American history. Now in its 43rd day, a successful vote would allow government agencies to begin releasing a large backlog of economic data in the coming weeks \u2014 information that\u2019s vital for both Fed policymakers and traders trying to gauge the central bank\u2019s next move.\nView related analysis:\n- Australian Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD\n- Yen Crosses in Focus as USD/JPY Stalls and CHF/JPY Nears Record Highs\n- Nasdaq 100 Lags Dow Jones: Divergent Signals Among Nvidia, Apple, Meta\n- ASX 200 Evening Wrap: CBA Drags Index Lower as Financials Buckle\nRaphael Bostic became the latest Fed official to announce his retirement when his term ends, following Adriana Kugler\u2019s August departure, which cleared the path for pro-Trump economist Stephen Miran \u2014 a vocal advocate for much lower rates and greater presidential influence over Fed decisions. While it is too early to say who could replace Bostic, I very much doubt they\u2019ll be a Democrat.\nThe Swiss franc was the strongest major currency for a second session following Trump\u2019s comments about a trade deal with Switzerland. The Australian dollar held steady during a mild risk-on session ahead of today\u2019s employment data and could extend its gains if the report shows solid job growth without a rise in unemployment. Traders will also be watching a key batch of UK data and US inflation figures to gauge expectations for the BOE and Fed.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson - source: LSEG\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis: British Pound vs US Dollar\nThe British pound has fallen 5.2% against the US dollar over the past seven weeks from its September high, with little sign of a meaningful retracement. A bullish pinbar formed last week and perfectly respected the 100-week SMA, with subsequent price action remaining within the upper half of that candle \u2014 suggesting demand is building.\nOn the daily chart, GBP/USD formed a bullish hammer on Wednesday, with its tail marking a false intraday break below 1.31. This could signal the completion of a wave B within a simple ABC correction, shifting bias toward a retracement higher toward the 200-day moving averages near 1.3265 \u2014 which also aligns with the 100% projection level.\nhart analysis by Matt Simpson - data source: TradingView GBP/USD\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis: Australian Dollar vs US Dollar\nThe Australian dollar closed at a seven-day high after establishing support around its 100-day EMA and September close. My bias remains for AUD/USD to rise towards 0.6600, though the 0.6562 swing high and October VPOC at 0.6593 also serve as viable interim targets for bulls.\nThe one-hour chart shows a choppy yet constructive uptrend emerging from recent consolidation. The bias stays bullish above Tuesday\u2019s low at 0.6515, while the nearby high-volume node (HVN) could offer support should prices pull back before the next leg higher towards 0.66.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson - source: TradingView AUD/USD\nKey Economic Events for Traders (AEDT / GMT+11)\nAustralia\u2019s employment report is the main event for AUD/USD traders. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has quashed all hopes of a rate cut this year and now expects just one cut in 2026, citing persistent inflation despite rising unemployment. However, policymakers may be forced to reconsider if unemployment climbs another 0.2 percentage points \u2014 as it did in August.\nBank of England (BoE) watchers will be closely monitoring today\u2019s UK data dump, which includes Q3 GDP, industrial production, manufacturing output, construction, and trade data. The BoE kept rates steady at 4% at its last meeting, with a narrow 5\u20134 vote in favour of no change. Unless the data signals an imminent need for easing, it could bolster the British pound and support a further move higher in GBP/USD over the near term.\nAttention now turns to US events, including a speech by FOMC member Bostic, as well as CPI and jobl"

Traders await the United Kingdom (UK) flash Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the third quarter due later in the day.\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) faced challenges against its peers amid growing expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates in December. BoE policymaker Megan Greene stated on Tuesday that wage settlement data for next year is higher than desired and expressed concern about persistent inflation in the UK, suggesting that monetary policy may need to be more restrictive.\nThe GBP/USD pair also struggles as the US Dollar (USD) advances amid optimism that the prolonged US government shutdown could be resolved this week. The House of Representatives voted 222 to 209 to approve a funding package and end the longest government shutdown in US history on Wednesday. The Bill is now clear to be signed by US President Donald Trump. Earlier this week, Trump already backed the bipartisan deal to end the impasse.\nThe bill\u2019s approval will release a tranche of economic data pending release, except for October\u2019s inflation and jobs data. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday that the October jobs and inflation data reports are unlikely to be released.\nThe US Dollar also gained support from hawkish Fedspeak, which decreased the odds of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in December. The CME FedWatch Tool shows markets pricing in nearly a 60% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in December, down from 67% a day ago.\nFederal Reserve (Fed) Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic addressed economic trends at the Atlanta Economic Club on Wednesday. Bostic cautioned that easing policy too soon could \u201cfeed the inflation beast,\u201d while noting that a sharp downturn in the labor market is unlikely in the near term.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put "

                "body": "GBP/USD Price Forecast - Pound Slides to 1.3105 as BoE Rate-Cut Odds Surge and UK Political Turmoil Pressures the Pound\nSterling weakens amid 5% UK unemployment, 3.1% inflation, and 90% market odds of a December BoE cut, while the U.S. Dollar gains on shutdown deal optimism | That's TradingNEWS\nGBP/USD Falls Toward 1.3100 as UK Political Uncertainty and Rate-Cut Bets Pressure the Pound\nThe British Pound (GBP) is losing ground against the U.S. Dollar (USD), with GBP/USD sliding to 1.3105, down 0.34% during Wednesday\u2019s North American session. The pair\u2019s weakness reflects a sharp combination of UK political instability, softening labor data, and shifting expectations around Bank of England (BoE) policy, all while the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) holds firm near 99.58 as Washington edges closer to ending its government shutdown.\nSterling Hit by Political Jitters as Leadership Concerns Surface\nThe decline in the Pound comes amid speculation over Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership ahead of the upcoming UK fiscal budget. Reports from London suggest unease within the ruling party, with unnamed allies hinting at internal tensions. Although Health Minister Wes Streeting publicly denied any leadership challenge, markets remain wary that political noise could delay fiscal clarity at a critical economic juncture.\nInvestors often react sharply to political instability in the UK, given its direct impact on gilts, fiscal spending, and confidence in the Pound. With the fiscal announcement due in the coming days, the uncertainty around Starmer\u2019s leadership has introduced additional volatility across GBP pairs.\nUK Labor Market Weakness Reinforces December BoE Rate-Cut Expectations\nThe Office for National Statistics confirmed that the UK unemployment rate has climbed to 5.0%, the highest in nearly two years, while wage growth excluding bonuses rose 3.1%, easing from prior months. The data confirms a cooling labor market, heightening expectations that the BoE will cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.75% in its December 18 meeting.\nTraders are now pricing a 90% probability of a cut according to Prime Market Terminal, with several major banks \u2014 Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and UBS \u2014 aligning their forecasts to reflect the dovish pivot.\nThe GBP/USD pair has been particularly sensitive to these policy expectations. Each new sign of labor weakness has pulled the Pound lower as rate differentials widen in favor of the Dollar. The BoE\u2019s last vote was 5\u20134, with Governor Andrew Bailey siding with hawks; however, the combination of slowing growth and subdued wage inflation leaves little justification to hold rates at restrictive levels.\nInflation Stubbornness Creates Policy Friction Within the BoE\nDespite dovish market bets, some policymakers remain concerned about lingering inflation. CPI inflation in the UK remains elevated at 3.1%, well above the BoE\u2019s 2% target, with core inflation proving sticky in services. Megan Greene, one of the more hawkish committee members, argued that cutting too soon could reignite inflation pressures \u2014 an opinion that\u2019s keeping markets cautious.\nThis split between hawkish and dovish factions inside the BoE has left traders divided. The market now faces a policy tug-of-war: weak labor data pulling expectations toward cuts, while persistent inflation caps how far the BoE can go. This divergence ensures volatility around the December decision, with the GBP/USD pair likely to see intraday swings of 70\u2013100 pips around key releases.\nU.S. Dollar Finds Support as Shutdown Deal Boosts Confidence\nAcross the Atlantic, the U.S. Senate passed a stopgap funding bill with a 60\u201340 vote, setting the stage for the House of Representatives to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. The news lifted risk sentiment but also bolstered the U.S. Dollar, as the DXY Index climbed to 99.55, supported by expectations that federal operations and data reporting will soon resume.\nHowever, beneath the surface, the U.S. economy is showing "

The employment-to-population ratio held steady at a healthy 64%, while participation remained at 67%.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson \u2013 Source: ABS, LSEG\nView related analysis:\n- AUD/USD, GBP/USD Outlook: AU Jobs, UK Data Dump, US Inflation In Focus\n- Australian Dollar Price Action Setups: AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD\n- ASX 200 Evening Wrap: Tech and Banks Extend Losses, WOW Perks Up\n- Yen Crosses in Focus as USD/JPY Stalls and CHF/JPY Nears Record Highs\nRBA Hawkish Bias Vindicated\nThe RBA delivered a relatively hawkish hold this month after stronger-than-expected Q3 inflation data.\nGovernor Bullock had previously warned the Bank would look past rising unemployment if trimmed mean CPI came in at 0.9% or higher \u2014 and the 1.0% q/q, 3.0% y/y print effectively buried hopes of a November cut.\nSince then, we\u2019ve learned that home loans have surged to a record high, with 40% coming from investors. That\u2019s hardly what you\u2019d expect in a struggling economy and adds weight to speculation that the RBA\u2019s next move could, in fact, be a hike.\nMarket Reaction: Yields Jump, ASX Slips, Aussie Dollar Surges\nMarkets were quick to react to the revelation that not only may the RBA have reached their terminal rate at 3.6%, but their next move could be a hike.\n- The 3-year yield surged 10bp to 3.8% within minutes of the release.\n- SPI 200 futures (ASX 200) fell 0.8%, testing cycle lows \u2014 where good news is clearly bad news for Aussie equities these days.\n- The Australian dollar rose across the board, sending AUD/USD to an eight-day high, AUD/JPY to a one-year high, and AUD/NZD to a ten-year high.\nChart analysis by Matt Simpson \u2013 Source: TradingView, ASX\nWhen Could the RBA Hike?\nI doubt the RBA will feel compelled to change policy this year \u2014 partly to save face and avoid appearing reactionary, but also because they\u2019ll likely want to see the next set of quarterly CPI figures in January. Still, with stronger Q3 inflation, firm employment, and surging home loans, they already have more than enough ammunition to begin laying the groundwork for a potential hike next year.\nRemember, the modern RBA moves very cautiously, maintaining \u201ccaution on the outlook\u201d in both directions. Since they haven\u2019t publicly acknowledged the prospect of a rate cut, they\u2019ll need to gradually steer expectations over the coming meetings. Their latest forecasts pencilled in a single cut in 2026 \u2014 a position that will have to be walked back before they can turn fully hawkish and openly discuss hikes.\nFor now, a move could come as early as Q2 or Q3 next year, unless the Q4 CPI figures due in January deliver another hawkish surprise \u2014 in which case, markets may start pricing in an earlier hike.\nChart prepared by Matt Simpson \u2013 Source: RBA, LSEG\nView the full economic calendar\n-- Written by Matt Simpson\nFollow Matt on Twitter @cLeverEdge"

The Japanese Yen (JPY) weakens against the US Dollar (USD) amid a risk-on mood ahead of an expected vote to refund the US government on a short-term basis and diminishing odds for December Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike. Traders will take more cues from the Fedspeak later on Thursday.\nReuters reported that the US House of Representatives will try to end a record US government shutdown on Wednesday, with a vote on a stopgap funding package to restart disrupted food assistance, pay hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and revive a hobbled air-traffic control system. The bill will restore funding to government agencies through January 30. Hopes for the end of the US government shutdown could provide some support to the Greenback against the JPY in the near term.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday that October jobs and inflation data reports are unlikely to be released as a consequence of the government shutdown. This leaves policymakers without key data to assess the health of the US economy.\nConcerns that the new Japanese government will seek to influence the country's central bank into delaying rate hikes could weigh on the JPY and create a tailwind for the pair. Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Wednesday underscored her preference for keeping interest rates low to support a fragile recovery. Takaichi noted that inflation driven by food prices could hurt the economy, and the government will work closely with the BoJ to ensure Japan sees inflation driven by wages.\nOn the other hand, expectations that Japanese authorities might intervene to stem further weakness in the domestic currency could underpin the JPY. Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said on Wednesday that she recently saw one-sided and rapid moves in the currency, adding that she will closely watch FX moves with a high sense of urgency.\nJapanese Yen FAQs\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) is one of the world\u2019s most traded currencies. Its value is broadly determined by the performance of the Japanese economy, but more specifically by the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy, the differential between Japanese and US bond yields, or risk sentiment among traders, among other factors.\nOne of the Bank of Japan\u2019s mandates is currency control, so its moves are key for the Yen. The BoJ has directly intervened in currency markets sometimes, generally to lower the value of the Yen, although it refrains from doing it often due to political concerns of its main trading partners. The BoJ ultra-loose monetary policy between 2013 and 2024 caused the Yen to depreciate against its main currency peers due to an increasing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other main central banks. More recently, the gradually unwinding of this ultra-loose policy has given some support to the Yen.\nOver the last decade, the BoJ\u2019s stance of sticking to ultra-loose monetary policy has led to a widening policy divergence with other central banks, particularly with the US Federal Reserve. This supported a widening of the differential between the 10-year US and Japanese bonds, which favored the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. The BoJ decision in 2024 to gradually abandon the ultra-loose policy, coupled with interest-rate cuts in other major central banks, is narrowing this differential.\nThe Japanese Yen is often seen as a safe-haven investment. This means that in times of market stress, investors are more likely to put their money in the Japanese currency due to its supposed reliability and stability. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen the Yen\u2019s value against other curr"

The U.S. Senate\u2019s approval to reopen the government triggered renewed dollar demand and lifted risk appetite, while Japan\u2019s repeated intervention threats capped the pair\u2019s advance near \u00a5154.80 \u2014 a critical ceiling that the Ministry of Finance has defended verbally for weeks. Volatility remains elevated as investors position for potential policy adjustments on both sides of the Pacific, with intervention warnings now functioning as the market\u2019s psychological barrier.\nFederal Reserve Cut Expectations Pressure The Dollar While Bank Of Japan Indecision Weakens The Yen\nThe CME FedWatch Tool shows 67.9% probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December following soft labor data that revealed roughly 11,000 U.S. job losses per week in October. This dovish shift in Fed expectations has limited dollar momentum even as risk sentiment strengthens. The Bank of Japan\u2019s internal minutes highlight ongoing division among policymakers on whether inflation progress is sustainable enough to justify further tightening. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s commitment to maintaining ultra-loose monetary conditions reinforces yield differentials that keep the yen under pressure. The resulting tug-of-war between Fed easing bets and BoJ policy paralysis defines the pair\u2019s direction, leaving traders oscillating between bullish spikes and fear of intervention near \u00a5155.00.\nJapanese Economic Indicators Point To Recovery In Corporate Sentiment And Export Strength\nJapan\u2019s latest Reuters Tankan Index surprised to the upside, jumping to 17 in November from 8 in October, its strongest reading since early 2022. Manufacturers and service firms reported robust business conditions, led by a rebound in autos and electronics. The auto and transport machinery index surged from 9 to 27, while the electronics sector advanced from 5 to 25, confirming export resilience supported by a cheaper yen. The survey indicates improving confidence across private enterprises, suggesting Japan\u2019s corporate sector is adapting to cost pressures and maintaining profitability despite softer domestic consumption.\nU.S. Government Shutdown Resolution Boosts Risk Appetite And Strengthens USD/JPY Momentum\nThe U.S. Senate\u2019s approval of a funding package to reopen the government injected optimism into global markets and helped the USD/JPY pair sustain bids above \u00a5154.00. Expectations that the House of Representatives will pass the measure are fueling demand for the dollar, although political uncertainty still lingers. Should delays occur, the pair risks a retracement toward \u00a5153.00, while full approval could trigger another test of \u00a5155.00. The shutdown resolution also reinforced hopes for fiscal stability, adding confidence to U.S. Treasuries as the 10-year yield stabilizes near 4.60%, maintaining wide differentials against Japan\u2019s sub-1% bond rates.\nTechnical Outlook Shows Waning Momentum And Growing Reversal Risks Near Resistance\nDespite the broader uptrend, daily candlestick charts show hesitation under \u00a5155.00, with repeated doji formations indicating market fatigue. A bearish RSI divergence on the daily timeframe points to fading momentum even as prices hold firm. Risk-reversal data reveals that 1- and 3-month 25-delta options are trending lower, reflecting greater demand for downside protection in USD/JPY. Key resistance stands between \u00a5154.80 and \u00a5155.00, while initial support lies near \u00a5153.00. A"

The pair may gain ground as the US Dollar (USD) could further appreciate amid improving sentiment, driven by the end of the United States (US) government shutdown.\nReuters reported that US President Donald Trump signed the government funding bill on Thursday, marking the official end of the longest government shutdown in US history. The bill requires the Government to resume normal operations and calls for direct payment for individuals to purchase healthcare.\nAdditionally, the US Dollar may also gain support from hawkish Fedspeak, which decreased the odds of the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in December. The CME FedWatch Tool shows markets pricing in nearly a 60% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in December, down from 67% a day ago.\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic addressed economic trends at the Atlanta Economic Club on Wednesday. Bostic cautioned that easing policy too soon could \u201cfeed the inflation beast,\u201d while noting that a sharp downturn in the labor market is unlikely in the near term.\nThe downside of the USD/CAD pair could be restrained as the Canadian Dollar (CAD) may gain on a cautious tone surrounding the Bank of Canada (BoC) policy outlook. Rate markets expect the BoC to keep interest rates unchanged at least through the end of 2026, though that could change if economic conditions worsen.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada\u2019s case is the Canadian Dollar.\nMacroeconomic data releases gauge the healt"

Progress from US lawmakers toward ending the country\u2019s historic government shutdown has eased some market jitters, while Bank of Canada meeting minutes showed policymakers hitting pause on further interest rate cuts, holding the line as inflation cools to a three-year low. Analysts like Marc Chandler at Bannockburn now see the Canadian central bank holding steady on rates unless the economic outlook darkens unexpectedly. On the flip side, Wall Street stayed mostly flat, and the US dollar index barely moved. There are some watchpoints for Canada, though: oil prices slipped 4.2% after OPEC updated its supply outlook, which could dent the country\u2019s resource-driven economy. Still, falling bond yields point to less pressure for more monetary moves right now.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency traders keep their eyes on the prize.\nThe loonie\u2019s jump shows just how quickly currency markets react to political breakthroughs, especially with the US shutdown drama seemingly winding down. Even as US stocks tread water, both the loonie and greenback reflect growing confidence that North American economies can ride out a bout of political turbulence.\nThe bigger picture: Oil and central banks set the course.\nWith the Bank of Canada taking a wait-and-see approach and OPEC hinting at a stable oil market by 2026, Canada faces a cautiously steady outlook.

Spot prices, however, lack follow-through selling and recover a few pips from sub-203.00 levels, or the daily low.\nThe Japanese Yen (JPY) attracts some buyers following Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments, saying that the underlying inflation is gradually accelerating toward the 2% goal. Adding to this, Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama's warning on currency movements fuels speculation fears and turns out to be another factor undermining the JPY, which, in turn, is seen exerting some pressure on the GBP/JPY cross.\nTraders, however, remain uncertain about the BoJ's policy tightening plan amid Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's pro-stimulus stance and her preference for interest rates to stay low. This, along with the underlying bullish sentiment across the global financial markets, keeps a lid on any meaningful appreciating move for the safe-haven JPY and offers some support to the GBP/JPY cross, warranting caution for bearish traders.\nMeanwhile, the British Pound (GBP) continues with its relative underperformance on the back of bets for a Bank of England (BoE) interest rate cut next month. Apart from this, concerns about the UK's fiscal situation favor the GBP bears, which, in turn, should cap the upside for the GBP/JPY cross.

                "body": "The Pound has surged to new two-week highs beyond 203.30, aided by a general weakness in the Japanese Yen. This currency movement follows Japan\u2019s announcement of a looser fiscal budget, which has driven the Yen downwards on Wednesday.\nDespite weak UK employment data, the Pound has recovered from below 202.5 to surpass the 203.30 resistance, achieving session peaks above 203.50 for the first time since late October. The Pound is buoyed by Yen softness, after Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Takaichi announced a fiscal consolidation target to increase government spending.\nTechnical Analysis\nThe technical situation for GBP/JPY remains mixed. The RSI in 4-hour charts is at high levels but not in overbought territory, while MACD signals a potential downward trend. Price consolidation could motivate bulls to aim for past highs of 204.25 and potentially 205.33.\nShould prices fall below 203.30, support could be found at 202.35, with further declines potentially testing 201.80 and lows between 200.30 and 200.60. The currency table displays JPY\u2019s depreciation against major currencies, including a -0.28% change against the British Pound.\nGuillermo Alcala, a communications sciences graduate, authored this analysis.\nGiven that GBP/JPY has broken through the 203.30 resistance, the immediate momentum appears to be upward. The driving force is clear weakness in the Japanese Yen, stemming from expectations of a looser fiscal policy and the Bank of Japan holding interest rates low. This fundamental backdrop supports the bullish technical picture for the pair in the near term.\nMarket Forces\nThe Yen\u2019s slide is the primary factor here, and we need to watch it closely. With the Prime Minister discouraging a near-term rate hike, overnight index swaps now show the market is pricing in less than a 15% chance of a Bank of Japan rate hike in December 2025. This is a significant drop from the 40% probability we saw just last month, fuelling JPY sellers.\nOn the other side of the pair, we should not get too distracted by yesterday\u2019s weak UK employment figures from November 11, 2025. The market\u2019s focus is likely shifting to next week\u2019s inflation report, especially since the last UK CPI reading in October 2025 came in at 2.4%, remaining stubbornly above the Bank of England\u2019s target. This keeps the BoE on hold and supports the Pound Sterling.\nFor those looking to capture further upside, buying call options with a strike price near 204.50 could be a viable strategy to target the late October highs. The policy rate differential between the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan now exceeds 500 basis points, making the carry trade very appealing and likely to attract more buying pressure. We have not seen these exchange rate levels sustained since mid-2008, suggesting strong underlying momentum.\nHowever, we must be cautious, as some technical indicators suggest this upward move could be losing steam. To manage risk against a pullback, traders could consider buying put options with a strike price just below 203.00 to protect long positions. This provides a hedge if the price fails to hold above the old resistance and reverses back towards the 202.35 support level."

                "url": "https://iol.co.za/capetimes/partnered/tracking-forex-pairs-what-gbpjpy-can-tell-us-about-the-global-economy/",
                "body": "Tracking Forex pairs: what GBP/JPY can tell us about the global economy\nImage: Supplied\nEven in South Africa, GBP/JPY is a common choice among active traders, largely because of its strong price movements and liquidity. Yes, there are other, perhaps safer options like gold and USD/ZAR, but GBP/JPY stands out for those looking for faster-paced opportunities.\nNot only this, but GBP/JPY can actually inform trading strategies across multiple markets, mainly because of what it tells us about the global economy. So what does it tell us, and how can you use that information to your advantage?\nWhat GBP/JPY Can Tell Us About the Global Economy\nPut simply, GBP/JPY tells us exactly how global investors are feeling about risk at any given moment. Looking at the GBPJPY live price on Exness right now, for instance, you can see whether traders are leaning towards risk-on or risk-off sentiment.\nIf the pair is climbing steadily, it indicates growing confidence in riskier assets \u2013 often reflecting optimism about the UK economy or broader global growth \u2013 and if there\u2019s a sharp decline, that indicates investors are moving into safer havens like the Japanese yen \u2013 often reflecting uncertainty or caution in global markets.\nThe reason this is the case is because of the unique economic roles and investors\u2019 perceptions attached to both currencies in the pair. The British pound is widely considered a risk-sensitive currency: it tends to appreciate when investors feel confident about economic growth or higher interest rates.\nThe Japanese yen, on the other hand, has earned a reputation as a safe-haven currency: it tends to remain stable or even strengthen during periods of global uncertainty or market stress.\nEssentially, when investors are optimistic, they move capital into riskier assets, including the pound, seeking higher returns, which ultimately push GBP/JPY higher. On the other hand, during periods of global uncertainty, investors flock to safety, buying yen and selling pounds, which drives the pair down.\nIn this way, upward movements reflect risk-on sentiment and global confidence, while downward movements signal risk-off and a flight to safety.\nHow to Use This Information Across Markets\nAs we mentioned before, tracking GBP/JPY isn\u2019t just useful for forex traders \u2013 it can provide meaningful insight for your entire portfolio across multiple asset classes.\nThe reason for this is simple: the currency pair acts as a real-time benchmark of global investor sentiment and economic health, and sentiment is a primary driver of asset prices worldwide. By knowing whether investors are risk-on or risk-off, then, you can make your decisions far more informed across equities, commodities, bonds, or any other currencies.\nLet\u2019s say, for instance, you\u2019re applying a 5 minute scalping strategy in crude oil on a platform such as Exness. Even though oil isn\u2019t a currency, its price is going to react strongly to shifts in global risk sentiment. If GBP/JPY is climbing steadily \u2013 signalling a risk-on environment \u2013 it\u2019s going to be easier to anticipate short-term bullish momentum in crude oil as traders move into riskier assets.\nConversely, if GBP/JPY suddenly drops sharply, it could indicate an imminent risk-off move, meaning crude oil prices might experience a rapid decline. By monitoring the forex pair alongside your scalping charts, you effectively gain an early warning system.\nBecause the pair reacts almost instantly to changes in global sentiment \u2013 often before other markets fully price in these shifts \u2013 you can adjust your entries and exits quickly, confirming the strength of trends and avoiding false signals without having to rely solely on price action in the commodity itself.\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s the only indicator. On the contrary, if you\u2019re only relying on GBP/JPY sentiment to make your scalping decisions, you risk being caught off guard by short-term noise or reversals. But if you use it alongside solid technical analysis and the best indicators \u2013 such as mo"

Learn more about how crypto prices are calculated on CoinGecko.\nBitcoin Price Chart (BTC)\nBTC Converter\nBTC Historical Price\nHow do you feel about BTC today?\nRecently Happened to Bitcoin\nAbout Bitcoin (BTC)\nBitcoin is the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency that enables peer-to-peer electronic cash transactions without intermediaries like banks or governments.\n-\nBitcoin operates on a blockchain secured by proof-of-work mining and the SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm, making it virtually impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.\n-\nWith a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins and programmatic halvings every four years, Bitcoin is designed as a deflationary digital asset often called \"digital gold.\"\n-\nBitcoin has achieved mainstream adoption through spot ETF approvals, corporate treasury holdings, and acceptance by governments and institutions worldwide.\nWho Created Bitcoin?\nBitcoin was created by an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity remains unknown to this day. In October 2008, Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" laying out the technical foundation for a revolutionary digital currency. The first Bitcoin block, known as the genesis block, was mined on January 9, 2009, marking the official launch of the Bitcoin network.\nNakamoto actively developed Bitcoin and communicated with the early community until mid-2010, when they handed over control of the network and disappeared from public view. Despite extensive investigation and speculation over the years, no conclusive evidence has emerged regarding Nakamoto's true identity. Nakamoto is estimated to hold approximately 1.1 million BTC mined during Bitcoin's early days, spread across roughly 22,000 wallet addresses. These coins have remained untouched since they were mined, and any movement would likely cause significant market impact.\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\nBitcoin operates as a decentralized peer-to-peer network where users exchange value directly without intermediaries. The network maintains a public ledger called the blockchain, which records all transactions chronologically. This ledger is distributed across thousands of computers globally, with each node maintaining an identical copy.\nTransactions are grouped into blocks, with each block containing a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating an immutable chain. New blocks are added approximately every 10 minutes through mining, where specialized computers compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle adds the next block and receives newly minted bitcoins plus transaction fees.\nNo single entity controls the network. Changes require widespread consensus among users, miners, and developers. Users control their Bitcoin through private keys \u2014 cryptographic codes that authorize transactions and prove ownership. The smallest unit is a satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), allowing Bitcoin to function as both a store of value and medium of exchange.\nBitcoin Security: SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm\nBitcoin's security is fundamentally rooted in the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function, a proven algorithm also used to secure critical government and internet infrastructure. This function is essential to the network's operation: miners must use it to find valid hashes to add new blocks, and it is also used to create the digital signatures that verify transaction ownership and authorize payments.\nThe algorithm is designed to be collision-resistant and preimage-resistant, meaning it is computationally impossible to reverse-engineer an input from its output or find two inputs that produce the same output, making the network virtually impossible to counterfeit or brute-force.\n"

                "body": "If you want to invest in Bitcoin (BTC 0.69%) without buying the actual cryptocurrency, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been an option since January 2024. But which one should you choose?\nNine of the 11 Bitcoin ETFs that were approved on Jan. 11, 2024, have amassed at least $600 million of assets under management (AUM) by now. And even if you have an investing budget of $500 or less, it won't be hard to fit any of these ETFs under that limit. The highest-priced option as of this writing on Nov. 10, 2025, is the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF at $120 per share.\nInvestors are voting with their wallets in this fund group. According to Finviz, eight of the 11 classic Bitcoin ETFs have seen asset outflows over the last month -- investors are taking out more money than they're putting in. Two more are simply holding steady. The outlier with a very small but definitely positive net inflow was the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL 1.17%), showing a 0.2% inflow in 30 days.\nThis fund has also been one of the most popular Bitcoin ETFs year to date. Its 2025 inflows have boosted the VanEck fund's AUM by 37%, nearly keeping up with sector leader iShares Bitcoin Trust's (IBIT 1.30%) 49% increase. No other spot Bitcoin ETF saw inflows of 5% or more in the same period.\nWhy are investors flocking to this specific fund while backing away from several larger ones -- and is the VanEck fund still a good choice for ETF-based Bitcoin investments?\nNYSEMKT: HODL\nKey Data Points\nSplitting hairs in the Bitcoin ETF world\nLet's get real. For most people, it doesn't really matter which Bitcoin ETF you pick. They all offer performance very close to the underlying Bitcoin chart, wrapped in the convenience and regulatory safety of an ETF structure. But you have to pick something, and there are some clear differences between the leading names.\nThe VanEck fund checks all the required boxes to earn consideration for any Bitcoin ETF investor. With $1.9 billion of AUM, it's large enough to offer an effective ETF with significant funding. Its 1.4 million of daily shares traded also suggests strong market liquidity. The market-price orders you place on this fund should settle quickly and without the pricing shocks you might see in a low-volume fund.\nIts Bitcoin trades are also managed by the same Coinbase (COIN +0.00%) Bitcoin account service as nearly all of its ETF peers. It's a tried and true custody solution managed by one of the oldest and most popular names in the crypto-trading industry. There's a small bonus to the Coinbase connection, though. Hold that thought.\nThe minuscule HODL difference\nSo far, so good -- but most spot Bitcoin ETFs can make similar claims. So how did HODL earn investor trust amid the sweeping ETF drawdowns of October? Here are the top five reasons:\n-\nVanEck has a long experience with crypto-related fund management. It applied for a futures-based Bitcoin ETF in 2017, swiftly followed by an in-house market index tracking Bitcoin prices under the MarketVector index brand. The fund manager's crypto connection is so tight, it picked a slang term for long-term Bitcoin holders as the ticker symbol for its flagship spot Bitcoin ETF.\n-\nMost of the Bitcoin ETFs get their market prices from the one index called the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate -- New York Variant. This index reflects current Bitcoin prices across 8 leading crypto exchanges. VanEck prefers its own MarketVector Bitcoin Benchmark Rate, culled from a shorter list of 5 leading exchanges. It's a pretty academic difference since both indexes show up-to-the-minute prices for the same Bitcoin asset, but it's a different method.\n-\nAbout that Coinbase bonus, VanEck actually uses two custodian services. The fund was launched with the Winklevoss twins' Gemini firm providing Bitcoin custody, and Coinbase was added just weeks later, on March 1, 2024.\n-\nThe fund also offers one of the lowest expense ratios in this category, matching the 0.20% seen in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB 1.22%) but with a n"

                "body": "\u2018Defi as a form of savings is finally viable\u2019: Vitalik Buterin talks Ethereum scaling, financial freedom and protocol security\nQuick Take\n- Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said there is a \u201cnight and day difference\u201d in the level of security DeFi users can expect compared to DeFi Summer.\n- \u201cIt\u2019s really important for Ethereum and DeFi to really maintain and build and improve upon the core properties that have made Ethereum the Ethereum from the beginning,\u201d Buterin said at a Dromos Labs event on Wednesday.\nVitalik Buterin said he's encouraged by recent advancements in decentralized finance on Ethereum, most notably the sector\u2019s improving security, maturity, and optionality.\n\"We'll be seeing, I think, a growth in more and more cases of people, institutions, all kinds of users around the world actually using this as their primary bank account,\" Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, said in a pre-recorded closing statement at a Dromos Labs event on Wednesday. \"Defi as a form of savings is finally viable.\"\nEchoing a recent blog post where he argued for lower-risk decentralized finance, Buterin noted that, as the sector has matured, there has been a shift away from high-risk speculation. DeFi, he argued, could become an outlet for users worldwide trying to escape the fiat money system \"where your money can be taken away from you\" through political shifts and other risks.\nDespite Buterin's optimistic outlook, he is aware of the history of protocol failures and smart contract risks that have long plagued DeFi, including, most recently, the multi-million dollar hack of Balancer, a thoroughly vetted and highly-trusted protocol.\n\"It's a night and day difference in the kind of security that you can expect in 2025 versus if you compare it to something like 2020 or 2019,\" Buterin said. While the total amount lost in crypto exploits in 2025 \u201cdwarfs\u201d last year's total, Elliptic notes this was primarily driven by the historic Bybit hack in February.\nOne element of security Buterin advocated for is the so-called \"walkaway test,\" which ensures that users are always able to recover their funds.\n\u201cIt's really important for Ethereum and DeFi to really maintain and build and improve upon the core properties that have made Ethereum the Ethereum from the beginning,\" Buterin said. \"This includes things like open source, following open standards, building for interoperability \u2014 rather than a walled garden \u2014 and censorship resistance.\"\nButerin also encouraged developers to \u201cexperiment with building\u201d for the Ethereum mainnet and wider Layer 2 \"in mind,\" using the L1 base layer as a hub for liquidity and L2s for scalability. He added that scalability is \"happening on both the L1 and L2s as the gas limit is going up\" and as products like Lighter \u2014 which has hit over 10,000 transactions per second \u2014 go live.\n\"With the right kind of engineering, that level of scaling is open to anyone to build today,\" Buterin said. There's \"a lot of really valuable things to work on \u2026 that bring real financial freedom.\"\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

                "source": "BeInCrypto",
                "url": "https://beincrypto.com/sharplink-q3-2025-revenue-eth-treasury/",
                "body": "SharpLink Gaming posted Q3 2025 revenue of $10.8 million, a 1,100% year-over-year increase, as its Ethereum-focused treasury strategy propelled net income to $104.3 million.\nThe company\u2019s crypto assets totaled nearly $3 billion, with ETH holdings rising from 817,747 tokens on September 30 to 861,251 ETH by November 9, 2025.\nFinancial Performance Driven by ETH Strategy\nSharpLink\u2019s ambitious treasury strategy has reshaped its financial outlook. The company reported net income of $104.3 million, or $0.62 per fully diluted share, for the third quarter ending September 30, 2025. This result sharply contrasts with the net loss of about $885,000 recorded in the same quarter last year.\nSponsoredThe revenue surge reflects both ETH price gains and the company\u2019s pivot to serving institutional Ethereum investors. As of September 30, 2025, SharpLink held $11.1 million in cash and $26.7 million in USDC stablecoins. The company also maintained its substantial ETH position. The firm deployed most of its ETH holdings into yield-generating staking mechanisms to optimize returns.\nSharpLink initiated a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, spending $31.6 million to buy back 1,938,450 shares during the quarter. In October 2025, it completed a $76.5 million direct stock offering at a 12% premium to market price, underscoring investor demand for ETH-linked equity exposure. These moves reflect the company\u2019s confidence in its treasury model and its ability to attract institutional capital.\nETH Deployment into DeFi Yield Strategies\nA central part of SharpLink\u2019s strategy is a $200 million commitment to deploy Ethereum onto Consensys\u2019 Linea platform. This zkEVM Layer 2 solution delivers full Ethereum compatibility with low fees and fast settlement. Research from Linea\u2019s official website claims the network achieves up to 10 times faster zero-knowledge proving than general zkVMs, providing advantages for DeFi applications.\nSharpLink leverages ether.fi and EigenCloud for institutional-grade staking and restaking services on Linea. The EigenCloud blog explains how the $200 million deployment blends liquid staking with restaking via EigenLayer\u2019s Actively Validated Services (AVS), allowing SharpLink to earn additional yield streams on top of standard staking rewards. Anchorage Digital provides custody, ensuring compliance and security.\nThis approach reflects a 2025 trend of public companies using DeFi protocols to enhance treasury returns. By participating in Layer 2 infrastructure and restaking, SharpLink aims to generate yield while retaining long-term exposure to Ethereum. The company\u2019s early adoption of zkEVM technology also aligns its treasury strategy with Ethereum\u2019s scaling developments.\nAdditionally, SharpLink launched tokenized SBET on Ethereum through a partnership with Superstate, expanding its on-chain activity and creating new ways for shareholders to engage within the Ethereum ecosystem.\nExecutive Appointments and Strategic Outlook\nSharpLink has expanded its leadership team by appointing senior professionals from leading financial and crypto firms. Matthew Sheffield joins as Chief Investment Officer, Mandy Campbell as Chief Marketing Officer, and Michael Camarda as Chief Data Officer. These hires bring experience from FalconX, Bain Capital Crypto, Consensys, and JPMorgan, highlighting the company\u2019s focus on asset management, institutional partnerships, and blockchain infrastructure.\nSharpLink has scheduled a conference call for November 13, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss its Q3 results and outlook. Investors and analysts are expected to examine the sustainability of the company\u2019s yield-generation model, the regulatory landscape for public crypto holdings, and the potential for further capital deployment into DeFi protocols."

He posited that DeFi may serve as a refuge for people around the world who want to move away from fiat systems and are vulnerable to political interference and financial seizure.\nHowever, he tempered his optimism with realism, cautioning that DeFi is still working through numerous technical and security issues \u2013 most recently, the costly Balancer breach.\nNevertheless, he noted that current security in 2025 is on a completely different level compared to what the industry had back in 2019 or 2020. However, he did advocate for protocols to implement the \u201cwalkaway test,\u201d a standard that would allow users\u2019 funds to be retrievable at all times.\nHe further argued, \u201cIt\u2019s really important for Ethereum and DeFi to really maintain and build and improve upon the core properties that have made Ethereum the Ethereum from the beginning.\u201d In practice, that means building transparently, following common standards, promoting interoperability, and avoiding restrictive or censorable systems.\nAdditionally, he\u2019s advised developers to experiment with projects that bridge Ethereum\u2019s mainnet and Layer 2 networks, using L1 as the anchor and L2 as the scaling engine. He also stated that Ethereum is scaling on both the base layer and Layer 2s, with projects like Lighter now handling more than 10,000 transactions per second.\nHe pointed out that scalability is accessible to anyone today with the right engineering, and numerous valuable projects exist to promote financial freedom.\nButerin suggested combining the ZK proof to address blockchain security\nButerin has also recently admitted to a design flaw in one of Ethereum\u2019s features, which is causing verification to slow down by 50 times, hampering the Layer-2 ecosystem worth $50 billion.\nNonetheless, he has advocated for a hybrid approach, utilizing Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs alongside multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, and trusted execution environments to create more resilient privacy solutions.\nWhile Ethereum is contending with internal design flaws, ZK proof has engineered its system specifically for high-speed zero-knowledge computation, backing it with $100 million in self-funded development. It has already invested $20 million in infrastructure, with $17 million in custom Proof Pod hardware.\nButerin emphasized voting as a key area where zero-knowledge proofs can help prevent coercion, while blockchain projects explore these systems to protect decision-makers.\nSeparately, Buterin recently weighed in on mounting criticism, defending the 43-day Ethereum unstaking delays amid growing industry criticism over trapped validator funds.\nButerin\u2019s comments followed developer Robert Sags\u2019 recent criticism of withdrawal delays that surpass traditional banking timescales and tarnish the user experience for retail investors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like a soldier deciding to quit the army. Staking is about taking on a solemn duty to defend the chain,\u201d Buterin wrote on X, emphasizing that \u201cfriction in quitting is part of the deal.\u201d\nGet $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now"

(Nasdaq: FIGR) today announced that its subsidiary, Figure Certificate Company (FCC), intends to begin minting $YLDS, a registered public debt security, natively on Solana. $YLDS is a security-version of stablecoin, designed to maintain a fixed dollar price and provide a continuous yield backed by U.S. Treasuries and Treasury repo agreements. Exponent Finance, a decentralized finance yield exchange platform on Solana, intends to be the first user of $YLDS.\nThe move marks the beginning of a broader, long-term ambition between Figure and Provenance Blockchain to build on Solana. As part of its efforts to promote real-world asset applications in DeFi, Figure intends to work with Provenance Blockchain to allow Solana users to access yield from a variety of Figure assets, including loans. Over the coming weeks, Figure expects to expand this collaboration with additional Solana-native integrations and initiatives that further demonstrate its leadership in bringing compliant, decentralized finance to scale.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to partner with Exponent Finance as a first mover in bringing $YLDS to the Solana ecosystem,\u201d said Mike Cagney, Figure\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman. \u201cWe see this as a way to future-proof fiat rails onto Solana while bringing an SEC-registered yielding stablecoin to the ecosystem.\u201d\nBuilders on Solana will be able to access $YLDS for payment, cross border remit, yield and settlement applications, including directly settling SOL trades with $YLDS. In the spirit of the partnership, Figure has begun accepting SOL as collateral for crypto backed loans with the intent to expand this to locked SOL and adopt Figure\u2019s liquidation protection option for SOL-backed loans.\n\u201cReal-world assets (RWAs) on Solana are quickly approaching $1B, as everything from traditional assets to real estate and more are tokenized on onchain,\" said Lily Liu, President, Solana Foundation. \"Figure\u2019s integration builds on that momentum and demonstrates how regulated, yield-generating assets can enhance utility across the Solana ecosystem.\u201d\n$YLDS Delivers Three Key Advantages to the Solana Ecosystem:\n- Real-world utility: Unlike theoretical RWA concepts, $YLDS offers immediate, practical applications. The yield-bearing stablecoin, backed primarily by U.S. Treasuries, is already powering Figure's live Democratized Prime product on the Provenance Blockchain and will soon integrate with Exponent Finance's yield exchange protocol on Solana, demonstrating tangible DeFi utility from day one.\n- Developer-ready composability: Built as a foundational primitive for Solana's DeFi ecosystem, $YLDS serves as a dependable base asset that developers can seamlessly integrate into their protocols, centered around a stable, yield-generating core.\n- Institutional-grade credibility: Figure's track record speaks for itself, having originated over $19 billion in loans on public blockchain with a compliance-first approach. This proven operational history, combined with $YLDS's registration as a security, provides the institutional credibility and regulatory clarity that sets it apart from speculative RWA projects. With Figure's recent IPO, $YLDS brings battle-tested infrastructure to Solana's expanding DeFi landscape.\nExplore how Figure is building compliant DeFi infrastructure by visiting ylds.com and explore Democratized Prime lending pools on figuremarkets.com.\nAbout Figure Technology Solutions, Inc.\nFigure Technology Solutions, Inc.

In this article, we\u2019ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question \u201cHow high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?\u201d and we\u2019ll try to answer that.\nOverview\nSolana price prediction: Technical analysis\nSolana price analysis: SOL falls to $156\nTL;DR Breakdown:\n- Solana price analysis shows decline back to $153\n- Resistance for SOL is at $170\n- Support for SOL/USD is at $150\nThe price analysis of Solana for November 12 shows that SOL has declined back to $153 as bears continue to dominate the crypto markets.\nSolana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls back to $153\nSolana observed bearish pressure as SOL fell to the $180 mark before recovering back to the $200 level. However, the price faced resistance at the level and fell back to the $180 mark where it found short-term support. Now, the price has fallen to the $153 mark as higher supports crumble to the rising bearish pressure.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 35.66, which reflects the recent trend, showing bearish pressure across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line falls steadily, suggesting mounting selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show bearish momentum as the indicator trades at -1.09 showing increasing bearish momentum.\nSOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face resistance above $170\nThe 4-hour chart for Solana shows that the price oscillated between the $155 and the $165 levels as either side struggled to gain momentum. However, the recent rise to the $170 mark and the subsequent rejection has caused a decline sending the price to the $153 price level where SOL finds short-term support.\nFrom a technical perspective, the MACD shows falling bearish momentum at -1.08, with the indicator showing falling selling pressure as SOL falls below $155. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) falls to around 38.15, indicating that Solana observes rising bearish momentum at the price level. The current Index level shows room for further downwards movement across the short-term.\nSolana technical indicators: Levels and action\nDaily simple moving average (SMA)\nDaily exponential moving average (EMA)\nWhat to expect from Solana price analysis?\nThe Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates support around $155 with next support at $146. The chart suggests that further downwards movement is unlikely across the short-term.\nAs the price struggles below $160, SOL can be expected to hold above the $150 level and consolidate before moving significantly. However, if the price fails to hold at the level and establish foothold above $170, SOL may fall below the $145 support continuing the bearish trend.\nIs SOL a good investment?\nSolana i"

                "body": "FTSE 100 trading at record highs despite mounting fiscal headwinds\nThe UK benchmark defies Budget uncertainty with sector composition, attractive valuations, and currency dynamics driving an unlikely outperformance versus technology-heavy global peers.\nUnexpected strength amid fiscal uncertainty\nThe FTSE 100 has been trading at record highs, defying expectations that mounting fiscal headwinds and a cautious November Budget would dampen investor enthusiasm.\nThis surprising strength comes despite widespread unease over the UK government's next round of fiscal tightening, including potential tax rises designed to close the budget gap.\nRather than faltering under these pressures, the index has surged, supported by a confluence of global and domestic forces and Bank of England (BoE) rate cut expectations following this week's dismal employment data.\nUnemployment rising to a 4-year high of 5% has reinforced expectations for monetary policy easing, making the UK's blue-chip benchmark an unlikely outperformer.\nSector composition provides defensive advantages\nOne of the key drivers behind the FTSE 100's record performance lies in its sector composition. Unlike the S&P 500, where artificial intelligence (AI) and technology giants dictate market direction, the FTSE is heavily weighted towards energy, mining, banking, and defensive consumer goods.\nThese sectors thrive in periods of inflation and commodity strength, providing resilience during economic uncertainty.\nOil prices have remained resilient, bolstering earnings for heavyweights such as BP and Shell, while gold, spot silver and base metals have rallied significantly.\nUK-listed global consumer staples firms like Unilever, Diageo, and British American Tobacco continue to deliver stable cash flows and dividends that appeal to yield-hungry investors.\nValuation discount becomes competitive advantage\nAnother major factor is valuation. For years, the FTSE 100 traded at a steep discount to global peers, reflecting both Brexit uncertainty and the UK's slower growth profile. That discount has now turned into a virtue.\nWith US equities looking stretched and bond yields volatile, international investors have been drawn back to the London market in search of stability, diversification, and income.\nThe FTSE's average dividend yield - hovering near 4% - remains one of the most attractive among developed markets, providing compelling income opportunities.\nIn contrast, many US growth stocks offer little or no yield, leaving investors vulnerable to valuation compression if interest rates stay higher for longer.\nCurrency dynamics support overseas earnings\nThe British pound's relative weakness has also played a pivotal role. A softer sterling inflates the overseas earnings of the FTSE's globally diversified constituents, which generate more than two-thirds of their revenue abroad.\nThis currency dynamic provides a natural hedge against domestic economic malaise, insulating the index from purely UK-focused challenges.\nEven as the UK government tightens fiscal policy and households brace for higher taxes, large-cap multinationals listed in London continue to benefit from dollar-denominated income streams.\nIn this sense, the FTSE's rally reflects not confidence in the British economy per se, but in the global reach of its corporate members.\nDefensive positioning attracts uncertain markets\nAdditionally, there is growing recognition that the FTSE 100 offers defensive growth in an uncertain world. With geopolitical tensions high, inflation proving sticky, and global supply chains adjusting, investors have pivoted toward companies with tangible assets.\nThe London market, long dismissed as \"old economy,\" suddenly looks well positioned for current market conditions favouring real assets over speculative growth.\nEnergy companies are capitalising on energy security concerns, miners on the green transition's demand for critical materials, and banks on higher net interest margins.\nThis defensive positioning provide"

                "body": "DAX nears record highs despite weak German economy\nThe DAX has been one of the strongest global indices in 2025, rising roughly 23 per cent year-to-date even as Germany\u2019s macroeconomic backdrop remains subdued. Q3 GDP was flat on the quarter and close to stagnation year-on-year, while headline inflation has moderated only marginally.\nThe DAX has gained about 23 per cent year-to-date, driven by sectoral strength, favourable valuation comparisons and a global appetite for risk assets.\nGermany\u2019s macro indicators remain weak: Q3 GDP was 0.0 per cent quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year growth has hovered around 0.3 per cent for three consecutive quarters.\nValuation metrics for the DAX are elevated but not extreme: average P/E \u2248 29, PEG \u2248 1.3 and EV/EBITDA \u2248 13x for the index constituents as at 12 November 2025.\nDAX index: current context\nThe DAX\u2019s performance in 2025 has been striking: a year-to-date rise of roughly 23 per cent places it among the best-performing major equity indices worldwide. This advance has occurred even as core domestic indicators point to a weak economy. Third-quarter GDP for Germany was reported as unchanged on the quarter (0.0 per cent), and year-on-year growth has lingered at c. 0.3 per cent for the past three quarters, consistent with a stagnating output profile.\nHeadline consumer-price inflation has edged down slightly to 2.3 per cent year-on-year, signalling only limited disinflation. The persistence of weak aggregate demand \u2014 reflected in the flat GDP profile and subdued price dynamics \u2014 would normally militate against strong equity returns. Nevertheless, several factors help reconcile the dissonance between macro weakness and equity strength:\n- Relative valuation: while the DAX trades at elevated multiples by some measures, these valuations remain comparatively benign relative to stretched metrics observed in other markets;\n- Global market correlations: synchronised risk appetite and equity inflows have lifted European indices alongside US and Asian markets.\nAn indicative snapshot of valuation as at 12 November 2025 shows an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 29 for the DAX-40 constituents, a PEG ratio near 1.3 and an enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiple of about 13x. These levels imply that although the index is approaching record territory, market valuations are not universally extreme and are supported by earnings expectations and cross-market flows.\nTechnical analysis on DAX index\nFrom a technical standpoint, the DAX retains a constructive medium-term profile but has spent recent months in a consolidation band:\nTrend context. The index trades above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages, indicating that the medium- to long-term trend is intact. Since May 2025 a horizontal consolidation range between about 23,000 and 24,600 has been evident; the volume profile suggests a degree of distribution near the upper bound of that range, reinforcing the 24,600 level as a significant resistance.\nResistance levels. Key upside barriers to monitor are 24,600 (the consolidation high and recent record area) and the psychological 25,000 mark. A decisive, high-volume break above 24,600 would increase the likelihood of extension toward 25,000 and beyond.\nSupport levels. On the downside, notable supports include 23,500 (proximate to the 200-day moving average) and 23,000 (the lower edge of the current consolidation). A sustained loss of the 23,000 area would raise the probability of a deeper correction.\nMomentum indicators. Short-term oscillators (MACD and RSI) are close to neutral, which aligns with the observed range-bound behaviour since May. At present these indicators do not signal a strong directional bias, implying that price action is likely to be governed by breakouts until a clear macro or earnings catalyst emerges.\nFigure 1.

Easing fears around the U.S. government shutdown and a clutch of upbeat corporate updates underpinned sentiment despite a softer ZEW reading. [1]\nMarket snapshot (as of close):\n- DAX: 24,366.73, +1.16% vs. Tuesday\u2019s 24,088.06 (\u2248+279 pts). Day range 24,234.94 \u2013 24,395.63; open 24,245.89. [2]\n- Europe: STOXX 600 set an intraday record (583.56) as financials outperformed; FTSE 100 also hit a record. [3]\n- FX:EUR/USD ~1.157 late in the European session. [4]\n- Rates:10\u2011yr Bund ~2.67%. [5]\nWhat moved the market\nEuropean equities extended gains after signs Congress could end the historic U.S. government shutdown, a development that would restore the flow of key U.S. data and keep bets alive on a more dovish Federal Reserve path. Financials paced the European advance, while Germany\u2019s large\u2011cap benchmark outperformed on earnings\u2011led moves. [6]\nThe DAX traded between 24,235 and 24,396 and closed near the upper end of the session\u2019s range. The finish leaves the index within about two percent of its October peak, underscoring how quickly German equities have shaken off last week\u2019s wobble. [7]\nWinners and laggards\nInfineon gained after the chipmaker sharply lifted its 2026 sales target for AI power\u2011supply components, citing booming demand tied to data\u2011center build\u2011outs. The company said revenue in that segment nearly tripled year\u2011on\u2011year and sees the addressable market reaching \u20ac8\u201312 billion by decade\u2019s end. [8]\nRWE advanced as the utility\u2019s nine\u2011month results beat expectations, helped by a UK data\u2011centre project sale; shares pushed toward their highest levels since 2011. [9]\nBrenntag also traded higher after quarterly figures came in better than feared, even as brokers struck a cautious tone on the chemicals cycle. [10]\nBy contrast, E.ON underperformed despite reaffirming full\u2011year guidance and flagging higher grid investments, a reminder that capital\u2011intensive utilities remain sensitive to rate and regulatory headlines. [11]\nMacro backdrop: optimism tempered by softer sentiment\nGermany\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment index in November slipped to 38.5 (from 39.3), modestly below expectations, while the current\u2011conditions gauge improved slightly to \u201178.7. The survey points to cautious optimism but lingering doubts over policy effectiveness and the pace of recovery. [12]\nMonetary policy remains a stabiliser: the ECB deposit rate is 2.00%, unchanged since June, and officials have signalled a data\u2011dependent stance after three consecutive holds. That backdrop has helped compress volatility across euro\u2011area rates even as growth normalises. [13]\nExchange & listings: Frankfurt in focus\nIn a boost to Germany\u2019s listings pipeline, BASF confirmed it is targeting the Frankfurt Stock Exchange for a minority IPO of its Agricultural Solutions unit, aiming for IPO readiness by 2027 and unveiling a new management board to steer the carve\u2011out. [14]\nMeanwhile, Deutsche B\u00f6rse rolled out T7 Release 14.0 this week for Xetra and Frankfurt, with Self\u2011Match Prevention enhancements and a new trading model that will extend trading hours for retail order execution from December 1\u2014a move designed to improve access and liquidity at the edges of the day. [15]\nWhy it matters\nWednesday\u2019s rebound puts the DAX back on an upward trajectory within striking distance of record territory, supported by global risk appetite, resilient earnings and a benign policy backdrop. While ZEW cooled, the survey stays in positive territory and the ECB remains on hold\u2014conditions that, for now, favour equities over bonds even as Bund yields hover near multi\u2011week highs. [16]\nWhat to watch next\n- Fresh U.S. data as the shutdown resolution restores releases critical to Fed policy. [17]\n- Corporate guidance from German exporters on AI\u2011related capex and power demand, a key theme behind Infineon and RWE moves. [18]\n- Any change in ECB communication ahead of Decembe"

FSU\u2019s new star is literally a goat named S'mores\n- A Nigerian Dwarf goat named S'mores has become a viral sensation on the Florida State University campus.\n- S'mores's owner Cole Verdonck created social media accounts to document the goat's life.\n- The goat is popular among students and faculty, making appearances across campus and with local community members.\nAmong furry pets that roam Florida State University\u2019s campus, the one many students have recently considered to be the \u201cGreatest of All Time\u201d just so happens to be a literal goat \u2013 and his name is S'mores.\nThe FSU community has fallen head over heels in love with S'mores, a social media-viral Nigerian Dwarf goat. And as for S'mores himself, he\u2019s head over hooves about the endless strokes and cuddles he gets from excited fans who spot him on campus.\n\u201cPeople are really happy and ecstatic to see him,\u201d 19-year-old Tallahassee State College freshman Cole Verdonck, S'mores\u2019s owner, told the Tallahassee Democrat on Nov. 5 as he and S'mores spent some time on FSU\u2019s Langford Green.\nAlthough he attends TSC, he spends a lot of time on the university campus and he will be transferring to FSU next year. \u201cI was never expecting the mini fame, but when I took him to campus, everyone was fascinated by him and people were coming up to me.\u201d\n\u201cI was like, I have to capitalize on this, because if people are coming up to me right now and like seeing him just roam around, I wonder how they would like to see his journey online,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone's on their phones, so if I post his journey, people are going to want to see his day-to-day life.\"\nVerdonck, a Jupiter native, bought S'mores in late September from a family friend in Rome, Georgia \u2013 which is about five hours north of Tallahassee \u2013 for $500 in efforts of connecting to ancestral health.\nIt's a holistic wellness approach that involves eating single-ingredient foods and being more in touch with nature. He says having a goat as a pet ties into the health journey since his ancestors grew up around cattle, and it also promotes physical activity.\nThe student also lives off campus in a studio apartment and wanted a companion. \u201cSo, I got a goat,\u201d he said, explaining how he stopped at a pet store during the drive back to Tallahassee with S'mores to buy him his first collar, harness, leash and chew toy.\nThe Nigerian Dwarf goat, which can grow up to weigh about 30 pounds, was 3 weeks old when Verdonck bought him but is currently 8 weeks old.\n\u201cI never intended to do social media,\u201d Verdonck said. \u201cI just got him as a pet, and people were like, \u2018you should start social media (and) just see where it goes,\u2019 so I posted a few videos and sure enough, it worked like magic.\u201d\nS'mores has his own Instagram and TikTok accounts \u2013 managed by Verdonck \u2013 with daily lifestyle videos, of which some have gotten as many as over 250,000 views.\nWhen it comes to FSU students\u2019 pets, the goat has become the next sensation on campus following Garnet the Goldfish\u2019s popular presence in 2023, where the fish was dubbed a good luck charm amid the FSU football team\u2019s long streak of being undefeated.\nAs the team endures a season with a majority of losses so far, it is unclear what happened to Garnet.\nS'mores the goat is \u2018loved by the community,\u2019 \u2018lives a great life\u2019\nAs for S'mores\u2019s name, Verdonck said naming him after the sweet campfire confection was inspired by his tri-colored fur \u2013 white for the marshmallow, black for the chocolate and brown for the graham cracker.\nWhile S'mores cost Verdonck $500, everyday expenses are not nearly as challenging. The grass he eats is free, and the main expense made every day is buying a quart of goat milk for $7 a day, he said.\nBesides munching on grass and drinking milk, S'mores enjoys goat playdates and jumping on couches and other furniture \u2013 which he has plenty of time to do when he chills in Verdonck\u2019s apartment while the political science major goes to class.\n\u201cSometimes if there's a small dog around like a poodle"

                "body": "Asia Market Wrap - Asian Stocks Advance, Nikkei Up 0.43%\nAsian stock markets and government bonds both moved higher after new employment data suggested the US job market is cooling down. This soft data increased expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon, causing the 10-year Treasury yield to drop and traders to now price in a roughly 70% chance of a rate cut next month.\nThe prolonged government shutdown forced investors to rely heavily on private reports, like the one from ADP, because official job and inflation data were unavailable. News that the shutdown could end as early as Wednesday boosted investor optimism, but traders are now preparing for a flood of delayed official economic data once federal agencies reopen.\nAccording to the private ADP report, while US companies cut an average of 11,250 jobs per week in the last four weeks of October, the full monthly report still showed that private-sector payrolls grew by 42,000 in October, following two months of job losses.\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4%, with technology stocks recovering from early losses. In Japan, the Nikkei index rose 0.43%, and the broader Topix index closed at a record high, boosted by Sony Group jumping 3.67% after raising its annual profit forecast by 8%.\nHowever, SoftBank Group ended 3.46% lower after revealing it sold a $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia, which also contributed to a decline in other chip-related shares. Conversely, bank stocks performed well, with financial groups like Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Mitsui seeing strong gains.\nEuropean Session - European Stocks Print Fresh Highs\nEuropean stock markets rose on Wednesday, continuing their gains from the previous two days and reaching new record highs, with both the STOXX 50 and STOXX 600 indexes up.\nInvestor optimism was boosted by the high likelihood of the US government reopening soon and increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again.\nSeveral companies provided good news: Infineon Technologies jumped 2.2% after predicting its revenue would start growing again next year; RWE added 3.5% after reporting better-than-expected profits; and Bayer rose 1.7% after its profit beat forecasts.\nLuxury giant LVMH and bank Intesa Sanpaolo also saw their stocks hit recent or all-time high prices. The only notable drop was E.ON, which lost 1.5% despite confirming its profit forecast for the year.\nOn the FX front, the Japanese yen fell to a nine-month low against the U.S. Dollar on Wednesday, hitting 154.82 per dollar, which prompted Japanese officials, including Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama, to try and stop the drop with verbal warnings.\nThe yen has fallen sharply since early October, largely because the market expects the new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, to increase government spending.\nThe US Dollar recovered slightly from its previous losses, rising 0.1% against other currencies.\nMeanwhile, the British pound and the euro both dropped slightly, while the Australian dollar rose 0.2% and the New Zealand dollar was mostly flat.\nCurrency Power Balance\nSource: OANDA Labs\nThe price of oil fell by nearly 1% on Wednesday due to too much oil being available in the market, though the anticipated end of the longest-ever US government shutdown helped curb losses by promising a future boost in oil demand. Both Brent crude and US West Texas Intermediate dropped about 1%.\nMeanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released a new major forecast predicting that global oil and gas demand could continue to grow until 2050. This is a significant shift from the IEA's previous prediction that demand would peak this decade, as the agency has changed its forecasting method to look only at current government policies instead of climate promises. Investors are now also waiting for similar outlook reports from OPEC and the US Energy Information Administration, which are due out today.\nGold prices were steady on Wednesday as investors waited for the US House of "
