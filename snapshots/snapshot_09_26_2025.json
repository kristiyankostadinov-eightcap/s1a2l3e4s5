This is far more than a routine portfolio rebalancing\u2014it is a potent signal of declining confidence in the US dollar and the sustainability of US debt.\nIn August, the US national debt surged past $37 trillion, a figure that translates to about $109,000 per US citizen. Even more alarming is its growth rate\u2014$5.7 billion per day. The debt ceiling was raised by an additional $5 trillion this July as the US enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, further enabling borrowing amid a cycle of relentless spending.\nThe consequences are already visible. Corporate investment is softening, hiring in the private sector has slowed dramatically, and households face stagnant wages alongside rising prices. Such trends often precede an economic downturn.\nAs US debt continues to mount, so do concerns over fiscal stability, currency credibility, and potential spillover effects worldwide. In response, central banks are turning to gold\u2014a timeless store of value\u2014to hedge against uncertainty and reduce dependence on the dollar.\nThis move reflects a sober reality: the world is preparing for a future less anchored by the US economy. The golden awakening of central banks may well mark the beginning of a new global financial order."

It has demonstrated extended periods of decline in the past. Extended periods of decline are not acceptable if your timeline is short. The risk is too great that gold's price will be down when you need to liquidate.\nAn extended holding period provides greater potential for reaching your investment goals. As an example, hedging against stock market declines or inflation is a long-term effort. These outcomes will continue to be risks as long as you own stocks or cash deposits. Holding gold as insurance against an economic calamity requires you to keep the asset until you need it.\nLearn more: How to invest in gold in 4 steps\nGold as a safety net\nA small gold position can act as a stabilizer for your stock portfolio and your purchasing power.

The precious metal was in a growth phase from 2009 to 2011. It then trended down, failing to set a new high for nine years.\nIn those lackluster years for gold, your position will negatively impact your overall investment returns. If that feels problematic, a lower allocation percentage is more appropriate. On the other hand, you may be willing to accept gold's underperforming years so you can benefit more in the good years."

                "body": "US distillate inventories to end 2025, 2026 at multi-year lows\nKey Highlights\n- US distillate inventories are expected to be lower in 2025 and 2026 due to a combination of reduced domestic production and increased exports.\n- Refinery closures, including one in Houston and two in California, will decrease US petroleum distillate output, impacting inventory levels.\n- A significant inventory draw in first-half 2025 was driven by lower renewable diesel and biodiesel supply, leading to increased reliance on petroleum-based distillates.\n- Strong international demand, especially from European hubs, has supported US distillate exports, further reducing domestic inventories.\n- increased renewable diesel production in 2026 will partially offset the decline in distillate fuel oil production.\nTotal US distillate inventories in 2025 and 2026 are predicted to be lower than in previous years due to a significant inventory draw in 2025, strong export demand, and reduced domestic production due to refinery closures. The forcast was presented by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) in its September Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).\nDistillates include motor diesel fuel and home heating oil. Drawdowns in distillate inventories increase the risk of price increases and price volatility from supply disruptions, particularly during periods of high demand, such as the fall harvest and winter heating season.\nEIA uses total distillates to examine the combination of distillates and biomass-based distillates, which are alternatives to distillates, including renewable diesel and biodiesel.\nA key factor in the low inventory forecast is the sharp inventory draw in first-half 2025. During this period, total US distillate inventories fell by 17%, or about 22 million bbl, exceeding the average decline of 10%, or 14 million bbl, over the same period in the previous 4 years.\nA primary factor contributing to the significant inventory draw in first-half 2025 is the reduced supply of renewable diesel and biodiesel, driven by lower production and lower net imports of these fuels. This reduced supply of renewable diesel and biodiesel leads to increased demand for petroleum-based distillates to fill the gap. While renewable diesel and biodiesel consumption in first-half 2025 decreases by 124,000 b/d, or 35%, compared with first-half 2024, petroleum distillate fuel oil consumption increases by around 170,000 b/d, or 5%.\n\u201cWe expect the first-half 2025 drop in biofuels consumption to be a short-term departure from the longer-term trend of biofuels increasing as a share of distillate consumption. We forecast renewable diesel and biodiesel consumption to partially recover in the second half of 2025 to meet existing and future production mandates under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). We expect an increase in renewable diesel and biodiesel production will partially offset the increase in total distillate fuel oil consumption that we forecast in 2026, resulting in essentially flat distillate fuel oil inventories between December 2025 and December 2026,\u201d EIA said.\nAnother factor contributing to the significant inventory draw in first-half 2025 is above-average distillate exports, supported by strong international demand. Since 2023, major European hubs such as the Netherlands and the UK have been importing more distillate from the US to replace Russian product.\nAccording to EIA data, during first-half 2025, US distillate exports averaged 1.2 million b/d, 7% above the previous 5-year average. Strong international distillate demand is expected to continue to exert downward pressure on US inventories through 2026.\nUS refinery closures also contribute to the low distillate inventory figures in 2026.\nLyondellBasell's Houston refinery closed in early 2025, and two other California refineries (with a combined refining capacity of 284,000 b/d) are scheduled to close over the next 2 years.\nThis loss of refining capacity is likely to lead to a decline in US production of pe"

The 139 companies that responded operate predominantly in Texas as well as northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\nTrump has championed fossil fuels while attacking the renewable energy industry since taking office in January. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, delivered virtually everything the oil lobby wanted.\nBut Trump's push for lower crude prices, higher tariffs, and the resulting uncertainty caused by his \"stroke of pen\" policies are hurting investment, executives at independent oil and gas producers told the Dallas Fed.\nNearly 80% of executives who participated in the survey said they have delayed investment decisions in response to heightened uncertainty about the future price of oil and the cost of producing crude.\n\"We have begun the twilight of shale,\" one executive said, pointing to layoffs by the thousands and industry consolidation under big companies like Exxon Mobil. \"The writing is on the wall,\" the unnamed manager said.\n'Drilling is going to disappear'\nAnother executive warned that \"drilling is going to disappear\" as Trump pushes for $40 per barrel crude oil at the same time his steel tariffs are raising costs. U.S. crude oil prices are currently trading around $65 per barrel, just above the level producers need to drill profitably.\nThe shale industry has been \"gutted\" over the course of the Biden and Trump administrations, another executive said. Political hostility from Biden chased away capital from the industry, the person said. Economic ignorance from Trump is \"finishing the job,\" they said.\n\"The U.S. shale business is broken,\" the executive said.\nThe Trump administration has effectively aligned itself with the decision by OPEC+ to increase oil supply, \"kneecapping U.S. producers in the process,\" the person said.\n\"Guided by a U.S. Department of Energy that tells them what they want to hear instead of hard facts, they operate with little understanding of shale economics,\" the same executive said.\nRegulatory costs\nA White House spokesperson said Trump is \"rolling back burdensome regulations that were killing the industry,\" crediting the president's policies with record production in June. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has repeatedly argued that the administration is making drilling cheaper by cuting red tape.\nBut 57% of executives surveyed by the Dallas Fed said regulatory changes since January have reduced their breakeven costs by less than $1 per barrel.\nAnother executive warned that Trump's attacks on the renewable energy industry will come back to haunt the oil and gas sector in a few years. Investors are avoiding energy due to volatility and the \"stroke of pen\" risk that the White House wields over energy projects, the person said.\n\"Life is long, and the sword being wielded against the renewables industry right now will likely boomerang back in 3.5 years against traditional energy,\" they said, warning the industry will face harsher methane penalties, permitting restrictions and environmental reviews when Democrats return to power."

The expected $15 per barrel surge in costs would be driven by a shift from economically proven inventory to more speculative locations as the core inventory is depleting, according to Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR).\nSoaring Cost, Waning Global Influence\nThe looming depletion of North America\u2019s core oil and gas inventory will have implications for global energy markets, especially the U.S. ability to meet global demand, Enverus\u2019 report says.\n\u201cNorth America\u2019s dominance in supplying global oil demand growth is waning,\u201d Alex Ljubojevic, director at EIR, said in a statement.\n\u201cOver the next decade, its contribution to consumption growth is expected to fall below 50% \u2014 a stark contrast to the previous 10 years when it supplied more than 100%,\u201d Ljubojevic added.\nRelated: Iraq Expects Kurdistan Oil Exports to Restart This Week\nStill, the Permian basin in West Texas and New Mexico and the Canadian oil sands are and will continue to be North America\u2019s lowest-cost sources of scalable oil supply, Enverus reckons.\nThe oil sands would benefit from strong Western Canadian Select (WCS) prices and sunk infrastructure costs, and additional takeaway infrastructure capacity could unlock significant upsides to the estimates of Canadian oil production growth. Currently, Enverus expects Canada\u2019s oil output to rise by 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, up from an expected record-high for 2025.\nThe U.S. shale patch, however, will have to contend with flatter growth curves going forward amid oil prices close to current breakevens and depleting core inventory, which will make companies change investment strategies.\n\u201cAs core shale oil inventory in the U.S. depletes, the industry is entering a new era of higher costs and more complex development. This shift will reshape the cost curve and redefine investment strategies across the continent,\u201d Enverus\u2019 Ljubojevic said.\nU.S. Shale Slows Drilling\nAmid lower oil prices this year, the U.S. shale patch is in a wait-and-see mode, expecting to ride the price decline with minimal tweaks to strategies. U.S. oil producers are trimming capital expenditure budgets, relying on efficiency gains from current drilling activity to keep output levels.\nAmerican oil production is rising, due to the lag between oil price slides and drilling, but large shale producers are already calling the peak of oil output, despite the Trump Administration\u2019s best efforts to support the fossil fuels industry.\nFor example, efficiency gains, as well as synergies from the Endeavor merger and lower service costs, allowed Diamondback Energy to reduce its 2025 capital budget by another $100 million, or about 3%, from the prior midpoint, to $3.4 - $3.6 billion.\n\u201cWith volatility and uncertainty persisting, we see no compelling reason to increase activity this year,\u201d CEO Kaes Van't Hof told shareholders in a letter in early August.\nSince the Q1 letter to shareholders, Diamondback \u201cContinue to believe that, at current oil prices, U.S. shale oil production has likely peaked and activity levels in the Lower 48 will remain depressed,\u201d Van't Hof said.\nHigher costs and continued uncertainty, including with U.S. trade policies, led to another decline in oil and gas activity in the Permian, executives from producers and services firms said in the latest Dallas Fed Energy Survey published this week.\nIn the survey, most executives, 57%, estimate that regulatory changes since the Trump Administration took over in January 2025 have reduced their firms\u2019 breakeven costs for new wells by less than"

Markets might turn cautious later in the day ahead of the key US August Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index report.\nTraders continue to assess mixed signals from Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid stated that the US central bank may not need to lower interest rates again soon, citing the need to keep bringing down inflation. Meanwhile, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee noted that he was not eager to do a lot more policy easing while inflation is above target and moving the wrong way.\nThe attention will shift to the US consumer spending data for signals of how urgently the economy needs an additional rate cut from the Fed. Markets are now pricing in nearly an 87.7% odds of a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in the October meeting, down from a 90%-92% possibility on Wednesday. Any signs of hotter inflation could dampen the case for Fed rate cuts and underpin the Greenback, which creates a headwind for the major pair.\nAcross the pond, a significant majority of economists surveyed expected the European Central Bank (ECB) to keep rates unchanged for the remainder of the year, according to a Reuters poll. Rising expectations that the ECB is done cutting rates could support the shared currency against the USD. However, some financial institutions anticipate further cuts later this year or in early 2026 if conditions warrant.\nEuro FAQs\nThe Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%).\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates \u2013 or the expectation of higher rates \u2013 will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\nEurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany"

Price failed to mark a close above resistance with an outside daily / weekly reversal off the highs now extending more than 2.8%.\nInitial weekly support rests with the 78.6% retracement of the August rally / the August low-week close at 1.3267/80- note that the median-line converges on this threshold over the next few weeks and a break / close below this threshold is needed to suggest a more significant high was registered last week and that a lager trend reversal is underway. Subsequent support objectives rests with the 38.2% retracement of the yearly range / May low / 2023 high at 1.3140/44 and 1.3056/80- a region defined by the 52-week moving average and the 100% extension of the June decline. Look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nInitial weekly resistance now eyed at the 2024 high / September high-week close (HWC) at 1.3434/69. The threat remains tilted to the downside while below this threshold with key resistance steady at the 2025 HWC / 78.6% retracement of the June decline at 1.3648/50- a breach / close above this threshold would threaten resumption of the broader uptrend with subsequent resistance objectives eyed at the 2022 high at 1.3749 and the 1.40-handle.\nBottom line: The Fed reversal in GBP/USD is now approaching support at the median-line with major event risk on tap tomorrow. While the near-term risk is weighted to the downside, the decline may be vulnerable into technical support just lower. From a trading standpoint, look to reduce short-exposure heading into slope support- rallies should be limited to 1.3469 IF price is heading lower on this stretch with a close 1.3267 needed to fuel the next major leg of the decline.\nKeep in mind we get the release of Core Personal Consumption Expenditures tomorrow morning with Non-Farm Payrolls on tap next week.

Governor Bailey acknowledged that inflation is likely to drop in 2025 with future rate cuts directly tied to the inflation data. His cautious tone contrasts with that of other policymakers, such as Megan Greene, who argued against further easing amid upside risks to inflation.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about MT5 brokers? Check our detailed guide-\nThe diverging views have left investors uncertain about the BOE\u2019s next move, especially when the UK economy is affected by political noise. Large-scale borrowing proposals to fund housing and calls for the re-nationalization of services have created chaos in gilt markets, when demand is already fragile. A softening labor market and hesitant consumers, holding unusually high savings levels, further weigh on the UK\u2019s domestic growth.\nAcross the Atlantic, the US dollar has gained strength after solid US data, with the second-quarter GDP revised up to 3.8% and jobless claims falling to the lowest level since July. These signals indicate US economic resilience, which dampens the odds of aggressive rate cuts by the Fed. While markets still expect further rate cuts this year, Fed Chair Powell has underscored that the decision will depend on the inflation and employment data. This backdrop favors the dollar against the pound.\nKey Events Ahead: US Core PCE\nThe Friday\u2019s US Core PCE Index data is key to watch, with forecasts pointing at a 0.2% monthly and 2.9% yearly rise. A hotter reading would further strengthen the dollar. Additionally, Fed speeches from Barkin and Bowman are due, along with UoM consumer sentiment data.\nGBP/USD Technical Outlook: Bulls Shaken Under 20-SMA\nThe GBP/USD price looks feeble, dropping well below the 20-period MA and breaking the key swing low of 1.3340. The price has slightly moved up from the fresh 4-week lows, with weaker price action indicating further losses towards the 1.3300 handle. On breaking the level, the price could test the 1.3260 area ahead of 1.3200 and 1.3150.\n\u2013Are you interested in learning more about forex signals telegram groups?

                "body": "The Australian Dollar drops versus the US Dollar on Wednesday amid the lack of catalyst, following remarks by the Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said that the Fed would continue to balance the dual mandate of the central bank. The AUD/USD trades at 0.6590, down 0.11%.\nOn Tuesday, Powell said that the policy path is difficult for the Fed, which must look at both goals of the dual mandate \u201cequally,\u201d pushing back against almost certain rate cuts coming in the subsequent meetings. Nevertheless, market participants seem confident that the US central bank will reduce rates twice towards the end of the year.\nPowell added that risks in the labor market had risen and that inflation remains somewhat elevated. He acknowledged that policy remains modestly restrictive, but \u201cwell positioned to respond to potential economic developments.\u201d\nData-wise, New Home Sales in August improved sharply, from 0.664 million to 0.8 million, a 20.5% increase exceeding forecasts of 0.65 million. Although the data was positive, the latest S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) prints in the services and manufacturing sector, indicating the economy is cooling.\nAhead, traders will eye the release of Jobless Claims, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures and the Fed\u2019s inflation gauge, the Core PCE Price Index for August.\nIn Australia inflation metrics witnessed the CPI climbing from 2.8% to 3.0% \u2014 the top end of the RBA's target range. Consequently, the chances for additional easing by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) remain slim, just at 8%. The RBA will meet next week on September 30, with markets participants expecting the bank to hold rates.\nThe technical picture suggests that the AUD/USD could test lower prices, despite hoovering around the 20-day SMA at 0.6593. Buyers need a daily close above 0.6600 so they could challenge daily highs of 0.6628 ahead of 0.6650. Conversely, a drop below the 20-day SMA clears the path to challenge weekly lows of 0.6574, before extending its losses to the 50-day SMA at 0.6538. the next support lies at the 100-day SMA a 0.6514.\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies this month. Australian Dollar was the strongest against the New Zealand Dollar.\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other.

                "body": "Traders face a pivotal session after Tokyo inflation cooled to 2.5% in September, dampening speculation the Bank of Japan could act as soon as October. The plunge in the \u201ccore-core\u201d rate from 3% to 2.5%\u2014falling toward BoJ\u2019s 2% target\u2014shifted focus squarely onto the BoJ\u2019s policy outlook, sending USD/JPY higher and raising the stakes ahead of US inflation data later today.\nWhile the national inflation figures are key for the BoJ, economists consider Tokyo inflation a leading indicator of Japan\u2019s inflation outlook. Economist expected the core-core inflation rate to jump to 3.3%.\nThe USD/JPY pair rose from 149.879 to 149.956 after the inflation report amid expectations of a near-term BoJ hold on monetary policy.\nLater in the morning session, Bank of Japan policymaker Asahi Noguchi is on the calendar to speak. Asahi Noguchi was one of seven board members who voted to keep interest rates at 0.5% on Friday, September 19. A more hawkish stance on monetary policy could support bets on an October policy adjustment, given that two board members dissented from the policy decision.\nLater Friday, the highly anticipated Personal Income and Outlays report could influence expectations of an October Fed rate cut. Economists forecast the Core PCE Price Index to rise 2.9% year-on-year in August, matching the previous month\u2019s increase.\nA higher-than-expected reading could dampen rate cut expectations, sending USD/JPY toward the the August 1 high of 150.917.\nConversely, a softer inflation print could fuel speculation about Fed rate cuts in October and December, pushing the pair toward the 149.358 support level. If breached, the 200-day EMA would be the next key technical support level.\nBeyond the data, traders should consider commentary from FOMC members.\nUSD/JPY Scenarios: Hawkish BoJ vs. Dovish Fed Risks\nRead the full USD/JPY forecast, including chart setups and trade ideas.\nAs traders weigh a potential BoJ and Fed divergence, attention is also turning to Australia, where inflation and labor data cloud the RBA\u2019s next move.\nTurning focus to the AUD/USD pair, recent labor market and inflation data have clouded the RBA\u2019s policy outlook.\nJob vacancies fell 2.7% in the three months to August 2025 as private sector job vacancies declined 3.4%. Furthermore, the number of unemployed persons per job vacancy rose from 1.9 to 2.0, the highest level since February 2021.\nThe numbers were in line with the recent labor market report. Employment fell 5.4k month-on-month in August, and the participation rate dropped from 67% to 66.8%.\nWhile labor market data is signaling a cooling, inflation could potentially be moving in the opposite direction. The Monthly CPI Indicator showed the annual inflation rate rose from 2.8% in July to 3% in August, the top end of the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target range.\nWhile rising inflation has reduced immediate market confidence in a November RBA rate cut, economists such as Dr. Shane Oliver still expect cuts due to broader economic headwinds. Dr. Shane Oliver recently commented on the potential influence of the Fed, stating:\n\u201cAnd if the Fed continues to cut because of a weakening US jobs market, it may also add to pressure for more rate cuts here, as weaker US growth will impact global and Australian growth. Our base case remains for 0.25% RBA rate cuts in November, February, and May.\u201d\nAUD/USD: Key Scenarios to Watch\nSee our full AUD/USD analysis for detailed trends and trade setups.\nMoney markets continue to price in a November RBA rate cut, with further policy adjustments possible in February and May. However, August\u2019s US inflation data could significantly influence the Fed rate path and US-Aussie interest rate differentials.\nSofter-than-expected US inflation would raise bets on multiple Fed rate cuts in the fourth quarter. A more dovish Fed rate path may narrow the rate differential, favoring the Aussie dollar. Under this scenario, the AUD/USD pair could move toward $0.66, bringing the $0.665 level into sight.\nConversely, hotter inflation c"

Market participants are also focusing on the upcoming Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest rate decision. It was trading at 0.6583, down from the monthly high of 0.6706.\nRBA to Maintain Caution As Australia Inflation Rises\nThe AUD/USD exchange rate wavered after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) published the latest inflation report. The data showed that the headline Consumer Price Index rose from 2.8% in July to 3% in August, higher than the median estimate of 2.8%.\nThis report means that Australia\u2019s inflation is still a major issue. As a result, analysts expect that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will be cautious when delivering its interest rate decision in its meeting next week.\nPrecisely, most analysts expect that the bank, which is headed by Michele Bullock, will maintain its cautious tone and decide to leave interest rates unchanged in this meeting.\nTop Forex Brokers\nThe AUD/USD pair also reacted to strong US housing data and a statement from several Federal Reserve officials who insisted that the bank should be cautious when cutting interest rates because of the stubbornly high inflation.\nRaphael Bostic, Beth Hammack, and Austan Goolsbee have all hinted that they will not support an interest rate cut in the next meeting. In another statement on Tuesday, Jerome Powell noted that another rate cut was not 100% assured because of inflation.\nGoolsbee and other Fed officials like Mary Daly, John Williams, and Michele Bowman will also talk. Like Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran, Michele Bowman will likely insist that the bank should cut interest rates because of the worsening interest rates.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nThe daily chart shows that the AUD/USD pair has pulled back in the past few days moving from a high of 0.6706 on September 17 to the current 0.6580.\nIt dropped below the important support level at 0.6620, the highest level on July 24, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator have all pointed downwards.\nTherefore, the pair will likely continue falling as sellers target the next key support level at 0.6422, its lowest level in July and August. A move above the resistance at 0.6700 will invalidate the bearish outlook.\nReady to trade our free Forex signals? Here are the best forex platforms in Australia to choose from."

While Japan\u2019s economy is recovering\u2014thanks to stronger corporate profits, rising employment, and steady income\u2014many members stressed the need to closely monitor how US tariffs could affect growth and prices.\nOne member suggested it may take another 2\u20133 months to fully gauge the fallout.

Upcoming PCE and Tokyo CPI releases will dictate if the pair breaks 150 or retreats toward 147 | That's TradingNEWS\nUSD/JPY Extends Rally Toward 149.75 on Surging U.S. Data and Weak Yen Backdrop\nThe USD/JPY pair has climbed to 149.75, its highest in seven weeks, up 0.55% on the session as traders respond to a string of stronger-than-expected U.S. economic releases. The move extends a two-day rally powered by upward GDP revisions, resilient labor market data, and surging durable goods orders, giving the U.S. Dollar another leg higher against the Japanese Yen. Q2 GDP was revised to 3.8% from 3.3%, well above expectations, underscoring consumer spending strength and a sharp drop in imports. Weekly jobless claims fell to 218,000, compared to forecasts of 235,000, while August durable goods orders jumped 2.9% after a July decline of 2.7%. These readings cut expectations for an October Fed rate cut to 85% from 94% just days earlier, reinforcing the Dollar\u2019s yield advantage over the Yen.\nTechnical Outlook: USD/JPY Eyes Breakout Above 149 Resistance\nThe pair\u2019s rally has brought it directly into the 148.84\u2013149.23 resistance corridor, a zone marked by the 61.8% retracement of the August decline and the yearly moving average. A sustained break above this level would confirm a larger structural shift and open the door toward 150.88\u2013151.63, where April extensions and 2023 highs converge. Short-term support lies at 147.05, with deeper defenses at 146.10\u2013146.70, a region aligned with the 38.2% retracement of the April rally and the multi-year slope line from 2021. A close below this pivot would invalidate the broader advance, exposing 143.67\u2013144.10. For now, bulls remain in control, and the weekly close relative to 149 will be decisive in determining whether momentum carries toward the 151 handle.\nJapanese Policy and Inflation Risk for the Yen\nOn the Japanese side, Bank of Japan minutes revealed policymakers reaffirming the 0.5% overnight call rate target while continuing gradual JGB tapering. Officials noted core CPI running 3.0\u20133.5%, with sticky services inflation driven by rising labor costs. A few members suggested readiness to discuss eventual rate hikes if inflation persists, though the overall stance remains ultra-accommodative. Tokyo CPI due Friday will be closely monitored for confirmation of entrenched price pressures. A hotter reading could revive chatter of earlier BoJ tightening, though for now the divergence with Fed policy remains stark, keeping pressure on the Yen.\nRead More\n-\nBITQ ETF Holds $23.91 After 91% Yearly Gain, Tracking Bitcoin\u2019s $124K High and Coinbase Strength\n25.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveStocks\n-\nBitcoin ETFs Secure $241M Inflows While BTC-USD Tests $109K; IBIT, FBTC, ARKB Lead Turnaround\n25.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCrypto\n-\nNatural Gas Price - NG=F Climbs to $2.94 on Short-Covering as +75 Bcf Storage Build Caps Rally\n25.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveCommodities\n-\nGBP/USD Price Forecast - Sterling to Pound Drops to 1.3343 as Strong US Data Boosts Dollar and BoE Warnings Cap Sterling\n25.09.2025 \u00b7 TradingNEWS ArchiveForex\nMacro Drivers: Fed Caution, Rate Differentials, and PCE on Deck\nThe divergence between a Fed still cautious on rate cuts and a BoJ reluctant to normalize is keeping the spread in favor of the Dollar.

The pair holds ground near the four-month high of 1.3949, which was recorded on Thursday, after the stronger-than-expected economic data from the United States (US). Focus shifts toward Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index data, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, due later on Friday.\nRobust economic data may prompt the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to adopt a more cautious approach to cutting interest rates. The US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Annualized grew 3.8% in the second quarter (Q2), coming in above the previous estimate and the estimation of 3.3%. Meanwhile, the GDP Price Index rose 2.1% in the same period, as compared to the expected and previous 2.0% growth. US Initial Jobless Claims declined to 218K last week, the lowest since July. The market expectations were an increase to 235K from 232K previously.\nFed Bank of Kansas City President Jeffrey Schmid said on Thursday that the Fed is currently close to meeting its mandates, but added that policy must be forward-looking. Schmid added that the rate cut was appropriate to offset risks to the labor market, though inflation is still too high and the current job market is largely in balance, per Reuters. However, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee noted that he was not eager to do a lot more policy easing while inflation is above target and moving the wrong way.\nCanadian Trade Minister Maninder Sidhu said on Thursday that Canada has signed its first Indo-Pacific trade deal under Prime Minister Mark Carney, as part of efforts to reduce reliance on the United States (US). \u201cI see a lot of opportunities in agriculture, in energy and telecom, in defense and aerospace,\u201d Sidhu added.\nCanadian Dollar FAQs\nThe key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada\u2019s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment \u2013 whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) \u2013 with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.\nThe Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.\nThe price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada\u2019s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.\nWhile inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates wh"

                "body": "During the European trading session on Thursday (September 25), the USD/CAD currency pair demonstrated a clear pattern of US dollar strength. The USD/CAD exchange rate was quoted at 1.3892/94 during the session, down slightly by 0.02% from the previous trading day but up 0.77% over the past week. This trend reflects multiple pressures facing the Canadian economy, including a weakening labor market and rising trade risks, while the US economy, although slowing, has shown greater resilience.\nDivergence in Central Bank Policies\nThe monetary policy paths of the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) have become central factors influencing the USD/CAD exchange rate. At its meeting on September 17, the Bank of Canada announced a 25-basis-point reduction in the overnight interest rate target to 2.5%, marking the first rate cut since March, while also lowering the deposit rate to 2.45%. The Bank of Canada emphasized further softness in the Canadian labor market, with job losses concentrated in trade-sensitive sectors, and business investment suspended due to uncertainties surrounding US trade policies.\nGovernor Tiff Macklem stated at a press conference that if economic risks escalate, the Bank of Canada is prepared to cut rates further to support economic growth and maintain inflation near the 2% target. Market expectations suggest that the Bank of Canada will implement two additional 25-basis-point rate cuts in October and December, potentially bringing the policy rate down to 2.0%.\nThis has further weakened the attractiveness of the Canadian dollar, driving the USD/CAD higher. By contrast, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate target range by only 25 basis points to 4%-4.25% at its September 17 FOMC meeting, while also reducing the interest rate on reserve balances to 4.15%.\nPowell warned at the subsequent press conference that further rate cuts should be approached cautiously to avoid prematurely loosening monetary policy.\nThe FOMC economic projections indicate an expected GDP growth rate of 2.1% for the US in 2025, with unemployment stabilizing at 4.2% and core PCE inflation at 2.3%.\nThe Federal Reserve emphasized that it will closely monitor labor market and inflation data and does not intend to accelerate easing in the short term. This contrasts sharply with the dovish stance of the Bank of Canada, reinforcing the relative strength of the US dollar.\nThe cautious tone from the Federal Reserve has triggered a rebound in the US Dollar Index, with USD/CAD touching around 1.3875. Analysts noted that this policy divergence could support USD/CAD moving towards the 1.40 level in the short term.\nLatest Economic Data: Weak Employment in Canada, Moderate Growth in the U.S.\nCanadian economic data indicates significant downward pressure. Over the past two months, there has been a net reduction in jobs, primarily concentrated in manufacturing and export sectors, impacted by U.S. trade tariffs. The Bank of Canada's latest monetary policy report forecasts that inflation will stabilize at the 2% target in the second half of 2025, but economic growth is expected to slow to 1.5%, with population growth deceleration and weak household spending being the main drags. Additionally, business investment contracted in the second quarter, as companies expressed heightened concerns about future demand prospects.\nIn the U.S., although the latest labor data shows a slowdown in job growth (with the private sector adding 52,000 jobs in July, half the level of the first quarter), overall economic activity experienced moderate growth in the first half of the year. The Federal Reserve predicts that the unemployment rate will rise slightly to 4.2%, but the labor market remains resilient.\nExternal Factors: Oil Prices and Trade Uncertainty\nAs a resource-dependent currency, the Canadian dollar is highly reliant on oil prices, but recent fluctuations have been limited (WTI crude around $65 per barrel), providing little support.\nMore concerning"

                "body": "- GBP/JPY struggles to gain any meaningful traction as modest JPY strength offsets GBP rebound.\n- The initial reaction to a weaker Tokyo CPI print turns out to be short-lived amid a softer risk tone.\n- Concerns about the UK\u2019s fiscal situation and the BoE\u2019s dovish tilt contribute to capping spot prices.\nThe GBP/JPY cross lacks any firm intraday directional bias on Friday and seesaws between tepid gains/minor losses, below the 200.00 psychological mark through the Asian session amid mixed cues. A modest US Dollar (USD) pullback from a three-week high benefits the British Pound (GBP) and supports spot prices, though the emergence of some buying around the Japanese Yen (JPY) caps the upside.\nMeanwhile, data released earlier today showed that consumer prices in Japan's capital city, Tokyo, rose less than expected in September. This comes on top of domestic political uncertainty and concerns about economic headwinds stemming from US tariffs, which could allow the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to delay raising interest rates. Nevertheless, investors are still pricing in the possibility of an imminent BoJ rate hike in October, which, along with a slight deterioration in the global risk sentiment, benefits the JPY's relative safe-haven assets.\nFurthermore, the GBP bulls might refrain from placing aggressive bets amid concerns over the UK\u2019s fiscal outlook ahead of the Autumn budget in November. Moreover, the Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey's dovish remarks on Wednesday, saying that there will be further reductions in the bank rate, might keep a lid on the GBP. This, in turn, makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before positioning for an extension of the GBP/JPY pair's bounce from the vicinity of the 199.00 mark, or a two-week low touched on Monday.\nPound Sterling FAQs\nThe Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE).\nThe single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.\nData releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.\nAnother significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to pur"

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate the portfolio with weightings of 72.5% and 14.8%, respectively, while Cardano (ADA) makes up 1.2%.\nThe addition of XRP and Solana is expected to draw greater institutional interest in both tokens. Besides, it will also open the gates for the approval of spot ETFs for both these digital assets.\nOctober to See a Flood of Crypto ETF Approvals?\nEarlier in September 2025, the US SEC announced its decision to apply the generic listing standards for crypto ETFs. Since then, asset managers have been making quick moves to take advantage of the change. Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital Group, said:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got about a dozen filings with the SEC now, and more coming. We\u2019re all getting ready for a wave of launches.\u201d\nThe new rules allow qualified crypto ETFs to bypass the lengthy case-by-case review process that previously delayed approvals for months. Under the old framework, approvals could take up to 270 days, whereas the revised system can clear products in as little as 75 days.\nDisclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

(Nasdaq: SBET) (\u201cSharpLink\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), one of the world\u2019s largest corporate holders of Ether (\u201cETH\u201d) and prominent industry advocate of Ethereum adoption, today announced its intention to tokenize its SEC-registered common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain, appointing financial technology firm Superstate as its Digital Transfer Agent.\nBy enabling its equity to be tokenized natively onchain, SharpLink aims to demonstrate how public companies can use blockchain infrastructure to create shareholder value, improve market efficiency and drive forward the next generation of capital markets. SharpLink intends to partner with Superstate to tokenize its equity on Ethereum through its Opening Bell platform, expanding Superstate\u2019s multichain capital markets infrastructure.\nSharpLink and Superstate also intend to closely collaborate on advancing how tokenized public equities can ultimately trade on Automated Market Makers (\u201cAMMs\u201d) and other decentralized finance (\u201cDeFi\u201d) protocols in a fully compliant manner. This initiative aligns with the SEC\u2019s broader Project Crypto innovation agenda aimed at modernizing U.S. securities regulation to better enable digital assets, blockchain and onchain markets.\nThis work has the potential to position SharpLink\u2019s tokenized equity, along with future Opening Bell tokenizations, for secondary market trading on AMMs. Doing so would demonstrate how compliant tokenized securities can deliver broader utility, enhance liquidity and modernize capital flows for a new era of investor and issuer engagement.\nCommenting on the new partnership with Superstate, SharpLink Co-CEO Joseph Chalom, stated, \u201cTokenizing SharpLink\u2019s equity directly on Ethereum is far more than a technological achievement \u2013 it is a statement about where we believe the future of the global capital markets is headed. At SharpLink, our core mission is two-fold: to build the world\u2019s most trusted digital asset treasury and to pursue initiatives that accelerate the global adoption of the Ethereum network. By working with Superstate, not only are we enabling our shareholders to hold SBET shares natively on Ethereum, but we are also embarking on entirely new frontiers for how compliant, tokenized public equities could one day trade seamlessly through AMMs \u2013 an evolution we believe could redefine market structure itself.\u201d\nJoseph Lubin, SharpLink\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Founder and CEO of Consensys and Co-Founder of Ethereum, added, \u201cWe\u2019re proud to have been the first public company to become a Digital Asset Treasury company on Ethereum, onboarding traditional finance to Ethereum. And now we are excited to raise the floodgates further by onboarding TradFi to composable DeFi on Ethereum. As one of the largest corporate holders of ETH, this major step forward reinforces SharpLink\u2019s conviction that Ethereum is the foundation upon which the next generation of financial infrastructure will be built.\u201d\nLaunched in 2025, Opening Bell is a regulated onchain issuance and tokenization platform that allows companies to tokenize SEC-registered equity via blockchain infrastructure. Shares tokenized with Opening Bell remain fully compliant and legally equivalent to traditional book-entry equity, but can also be held in self-custodied wallets, integrated with digital financial products and made available to global investor segments.\n\u201cSharpLink will be the first public company to tokenize their shares on Ethereum using Superstate\u2019s Opening Bell, a milestone worthy of such an important Ethereum-aligned company,\u201d said Superstate CEO Robert Leshner. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to be partnering with SharpLink as they build the ecosystem for tokenized equity on Ethereum and beyond.\u201d\nFollowing the appointment of Lubin as Chairman and t"

                "body": "ETHZilla has decided to deploy about $47 million worth of Ethereum into the Puffer protocol. This is quite significant for DeFi, isn't it?\nIt's a big deal, yes. It's not just a financial move; it's indicative of increasing interest in DeFi tools by institutional players, particularly regarding treasury management. They're putting around 10,600 ETH into Puffer to achieve better yields, which shows that institutions are now considering DeFi for capital efficiency.\nWhat effects will this investment have on the crypto market?\nHow will ETHZilla's partnership with Puffer alter the crypto landscape?\nThis partnership is expected to create more liquidity in the market and change the dynamics of restaking. When big players like ETHZilla invest in innovative protocols, they bolster market liquidity and trust. This could pave the way for broader adoption of decentralized finance.\nWhat are the implications for treasury management by ETHZilla?\nWhat does this mean for ETHZilla's treasury strategy, and does it set an example for other institutions?\nFor ETHZilla, this not only enhances their treasury strategy but also sets a standard for other institutions to consider similar moves in the DeFi space. It\u2019s an interesting time for treasury management in crypto.\nWhat risks does this present to SMEs?\nWhat are the potential downsides for small to medium enterprises (SMEs)?\nThere are significant risks for SMEs, particularly regarding market concentration, counterparty risks, regulatory hurdles, operational vulnerabilities, financial stability risks, and privacy issues.\nHow can SMEs manage volatility from institutional investments?\nHow should SMEs handle the volatility created by institutional investments in DeFi?\nThey have a few strategies at their disposal. One is instant conversion to fiat currency when they receive crypto, which protects against price drops. Other strategies include accepting stablecoins, diversifying their crypto portfolios, and employing dollar-cost averaging. Regulatory compliance and decentralized custody solutions are also advisable.\nWhat should regulatory frameworks consider for corporate treasury management?\nWhat kind of regulatory adaptations will be necessary for corporate treasury management in DeFi?\nRegulatory frameworks need to be flexible and adaptable, based on ongoing feedback from the industry. A risk-based approach is essential, focusing on potential impacts on consumer protection and financial stability. Self-regulation and international coordination will be important for consistent standards, along with adjustments to transparency and reporting requirements.\nIn summary, institutional investments like ETHZilla's are altering the DeFi landscape. Both opportunities and challenges are on the horizon for SMEs, and strategic approaches coupled with adaptable regulatory frameworks will be critical for navigating this evolving landscape."

This move marks one of the largest stock buybacks in the digital asset space. The company\u2019s decision comes after its board approved a substantial increase from the initial $1 million allocation, signaling confidence in its strategy. The program will be executed under the guidelines of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nDeFi Development Expands Its Treasury Strategy\nDeFi Development\u2019s decision to boost its stock buyback to $100 million highlights its growing financial strength. The company\u2019s stock repurchase initiative is part of a broader plan to build shareholder value while advancing its Solana-focused treasury strategy. \u201cThis expansion reflects the confidence we have in our long-term vision and our strong balance sheet,\u201d a company spokesperson stated.\nhttps://x.com/defidevcorp/status/1970837949010083958\nIn the past few months, DeFi Development has made significant investments in Solana (SOL), accumulating over 2 million SOL tokens. As of September 17, the company had disclosed a total of 2,095,748 SOL, valued at approximately $499 million at the time. These tokens are staked across several validators, including its own, allowing the company to generate yield.\nDespite regulatory challenges earlier in the year, DeFi Development is committed to growing its treasury. In June, it withdrew a $1 billion filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) but continued with capital-raising efforts. In July, the company raised $100 million through a private offering, partially funding further Solana acquisitions and stock repurchases.\nStrategic Stock Buyback Signals Confidence in Market Conditions\nThe timing of DeFi Development\u2019s expanded buyback program comes as the company adjusts to the evolving market conditions. According to the company\u2019s filing, the repurchases will be executed based on market factors and regulatory considerations. This flexibility allows management to make decisions in real-time, responding to both market volatility and growth opportunities.\nDeFi Development emphasized that the stock buyback does not obligate it to repurchase a fixed number of shares. The program can be suspended or altered at any time, reflecting a cautious approach despite its aggressive strategy. The company\u2019s commitment to repurchasing shares signals a clear intent to enhance shareholder value while navigating the complexities of the digital asset market.\nThis decision further solidifies DeFi Development\u2019s position as a leading institutional holder of Solana. The company\u2019s focus on Solana\u2019s long-term potential underscores its broader strategy to dominate the space as a significant blockchain player. It continues to accumulate Solana, further increasing its exposure to the cryptocurrency as part of its treasury-building strategy.\nInternational Expansion and Institutional Growth Follow Buyback Announcement\nDeFi Development\u2019s growth trajectory also includes international expansion. Recently, the company signed a letter of intent to establish DeFi Development Corp. Korea, a Solana Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), in collaboration with Fragmetric. This international move aligns with DeFi Development\u2019s strategy to scale its operations and diversify its presence in key markets g"

While users never directly hold Chintai\u2019s tokenized securities, S-Tokens act as a \u201cmirror\u201d through a loan structure backed by the underlying assets.\nS-Tokens are designed to broaden access to RWA yields beyond institutional investors. Today, most institutional RWA products operate as \u201cwalled gardens\u201d with strict capital requirements and compliance hurdles, limiting retail participation, the companies told Cointelegraph.\nThe S-Token model aims to bridge this gap, offering retail users access to institutional-grade yields while allowing issuers to remain compliant.\nWith Splyce, users can engage with these assets directly through their existing Web3 wallets, maintaining the permissionless experience that typically defines DeFi.\n\u201cThere are no jurisdictional restrictions on where S\u2011Tokens can be offered \u2014 they\u2019re as permissionless as USDC or USDT,\u201d Ross Blyth, Splyce\u2019s chief marketing officer, told Cointelegraph. \u201cThat said, deposits are still subject to standard KYC/AML monitoring to ensure compliance with Anti-Money Laundering requirements.\u201d\nThe first iteration of S-Tokens will involve the Kin Fund, a tokenized real estate fund launched by Kin Capital on the Chintai network.\n\u201cDistribution and liquidity have always been the biggest hurdles for RWAs,\u201d Chintai managing director Josh Gordon told Cointelegraph. \u201cSoon, institutional-grade assets will be tradable across Solana decentralized exchanges with the same ease as tokens today.\u201d\nRelated: VC Roundup: VCs fuel energy tokenization, AI datachains, programmable credit\nA potential boost to Solana\u2019s RWA momentum\nSolana, known for its high throughput, low fees and strong developer ecosystem, has been gaining notable traction in the real-world asset space.\nAccording to industry data, tokenized assets on Solana are now valued at more than $656 million. Only four other networks \u2014 Ethereum, ZKsync Era, Polygon and Aptos \u2014 currently support higher levels of tokenized assets.\nSince the start of the year, the value of tokenized assets on Solana has grown by more than 260%. The network\u2019s largest non-stablecoin tokenized products include the Ondo US Dollar Yield and the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund, which provide tokenized access to yield-bearing products such as short-term US Treasurys.\nIn addition, BlackRock launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on Solana earlier this year. While BUIDL has quickly become the dominant tokenized US Treasury product across blockchains, its presence on Solana further underscores the network\u2019s growing role in institutional RWA adoption.\nAlthough the largest RWA products on Solana are still geared mainly toward qualified institutional buyers or accredited investors, limiting retail access, alternatives are emerging. Ondo Finance has also announced plans to extend retail access on Solana through its partnership with Alchemy Pay.\nMeanwhile, Ondo\u2019s YieldCoin (USDY) is available to retail users on Stellar, according to MEXC.\nThese developments come as Solana emerges as a platform for tokenized equities, with Forward Industries \u2014 a Nasdaq-listed company and Solana treasury holder \u2014 planning to tokenize its stock on the blockchain through a partnership with Superstate, a regulated issuance platform.\nRelated: $400T TradFi market is a huge runway for tokenized RWAs: Animoca"

But the Dow's impressive performance was built on a mixed bag of specific stock performances.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) lagged behind, with August drops of 4% or more. Meanwhile, health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) outweighed those underperformers with an index-leading 24.2% price gain.\nLet's check out the rest of the top-performing Dow Jones stocks last month.\n1. UnitedHealth Group (up 24.2%)\nUnitedHealth took a tumble with a weak earnings report at the end of July, but bounced back in August. The stock soared on Aug. 15, as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a brand-new position of 5 million shares in the stock. The $3.3 billion merger with home health specialist Amedisys was completed on the same day, adding fuel to the fires. All told, UnitedHealth's stock moved 0.7% lower across the two-month span of July and August.\n2. Apple (up 11.8%)\niPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) surged 12% in the first week of August. The company addressed tariff concerns by expanding its domestic manufacturing commitments. The four-year commitment of an additional $100 billion includes partnerships with Texas Instruments and Corning.\nAdvertisement\n3. American Express (up 10.7%)\nCredit services giant American Express (NYSE: AXP) sprinted higher by landing several valuable sporting sponsorships in the Miami area. The deals include the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Dolphins football team.\n4. Home Depot (up 10.7%)\nHome improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE: HD) reported modest Q2 results last month. The stock still rose; management said that consumers are just delaying their big-ticket home improvement projects. The financial results should improve over time.\n5. Sherwin-Williams (up 10.6%)\nPaint retailer Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) followed the same themes as Home Depot. Instead of an earnings report, the global company refinanced its credit facilities with better terms in Canada and Europe.\nShould you invest $1,000 in UnitedHealth Group right now?\nBefore you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UnitedHealth Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

A Bank of England official signaled that interest rate cuts could come slower than markets expect, adding more pressure on sectors sensitive to borrowing costs. Medical equipment stocks dipped after the US launched new national security reviews of imported health products, sending Convatec down over 6%. Construction stocks followed their European peers lower, and Mitchells & Butlers fell as sales growth slowed. On the flip side, Petershill Partners soared more than 33% after announcing plans to delist from London due to lackluster valuations. The day\u2019s winners were industrial miners like Rio Tinto and Anglo American, which rallied as copper prices hit a 15-month high \u2013 a bullish sign for global demand. Investors are now looking ahead to updates from at least seven US Federal Reserve officials, hoping for direction on future interest rate moves.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Inflation\u2019s shadow keeps risk appetite in check.\nSticky inflation and uncertainty around interest rates are making investors more cautious, especially in the UK and across Europe. Sectors like healthcare and construction are under strain, while Petershill's decision to leave the London Stock Exchange highlights ongoing challenges for local capital markets. But it\u2019s not all bleak \u2013 commodity-driven sectors are outperforming as global demand props up prices, with mining stocks enjoying strong gains thanks to copper\u2019s surge.\nThe bigger picture: Central banks hold the keys to recovery.\nThe UK\u2019s persistent inflation is setting it apart from other major economies and forcing the Bank of England to move slowly on rate cuts. Meanwhile, upcoming signals from US Federal Reserve officials could influence expectations for monetary policy worldwide. Whether rates come down or stay higher for longer could have lasting effects on investment decisions, sector performance, and the overall path to economic recovery.\nProspero.ai\u2019s high-tech signals and plays are helping investors make smarter decisions.\nNow, you can benefit as they do: Prospero\u2019s crowdfunder is open.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\nNo wonder the platform was named the Best AI Fintech by the Global Financial Market Review, while winning the award for the Most Influential CEO 2025 Financial Technology from CEO Monthly.\nIf you want to invest in an investor favorite, check out Prospero.ai's crowdfunder here.\nInvesting in private securities is risky, speculative, and illiquid.

                "body": "Research Solutions, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:RSSS) strong earnings report was rewarded with a positive stock price move. We did some digging and found some further encouraging factors that investors will like.\nExamining Cashflow Against Research Solutions' Earnings\nMany investors haven't heard of the accrual ratio from cashflow, but it is actually a useful measure of how well a company's profit is backed up by free cash flow (FCF) during a given period. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\nFor the year to June 2025, Research Solutions had an accrual ratio of -1.57. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. In fact, it had free cash flow of US$7.0m in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of US$1.27m. Research Solutions shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On Research Solutions' Profit Performance\nAs we discussed above, Research Solutions' accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is a positive for the company. Because of this, we think Research Solutions' underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem! And it's also positive that the company showed enough improvement to book a profit this year, after losing money last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. Ultimately, this article has formed an opinion based on historical data. However, it can also be great to think about what analysts are forecasting for the future. Luckily, you can check out what analysts are forecasting by clicking here."

                "body": "U.S. Stock Market News Roundup for September 25, 2025\n- Stocks Mixed After Early Selloff: Major U.S. indexes struggled for direction on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed roughly flat after paring early losses, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite extended its decline for a third straight session amid renewed weakness in heavyweight tech shares [1] [2]. Volatility remained contained \u2013 the \u201cfear index\u201d (VIX) ticked down to around 16, signaling no panic despite the pullback [3].\n- Red-Hot Economic Data Surprises: Fresh data showed the U.S. economy firing on all cylinders. Second-quarter GDP growth was revised up to 3.8% annualized \u2013 the fastest pace in nearly two years \u2013 beating forecasts of 3.3% [4] [5]. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims fell to 218,000, a new low since mid-July, indicating a still-tight labor market [6]. A 20.5% surge in new home sales to 800,000 units (annualized) \u2013 the highest since early 2022 \u2013 further underscored economic strength [7]. The robust reports fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve may delay or reduce the scope of future interest-rate cuts, lifting Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar [8] [9].\n- Fed Sends Mixed Signals: Federal Reserve officials offered contrasting commentary that kept investors on edge. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned this week that asset prices \u201care fairly highly valued,\u201d a cautionary note that tempered hopes for aggressive rate relief [10]. He described a \u201cchallenging\u201d policy road ahead, balancing still-elevated inflation against a cooling jobs market. In contrast, Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued Thursday that the Fed risks harming the economy by not cutting rates more rapidly [11]. Traders have accordingly dialed back expectations \u2013 futures markets, which once priced in steady rate cuts, now show uncertainty about another Fed rate reduction this year [12].\n- Tech Stocks Tumble on Valuation Jitters: High-flying tech and AI stocks led the market\u2019s weakness. The elite \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d mega-cap tech companies fell nearly 2% as a group amid profit-taking and rising bond yields [13]. Market darlings like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft \u2013 which fueled 2025\u2019s rally \u2013 extended their slide as investors questioned stretched valuations [14]. These interest-rate sensitive growth shares have been hardest hit by the uptick in yields, which makes future earnings less attractive.\n- Intel Soars on Apple Investment Buzz: Not every tech stock struggled. Intel shares surged ~6% after reports that the embattled chipmaker approached Apple about a potential strategic investment [15]. The talks are preliminary, but they come on the heels of Nvidia\u2019s $5 billion stake in Intel (for a 4% holding) announced days ago [16], plus a recent $2 billion infusion from SoftBank [17]. Intel\u2019s stock has now climbed over 40% since mid-August on hopes that big partnerships \u2013 and a $10 billion U.S. government stake to expand chip factories \u2013 will turbocharge its turnaround [18] [19].\n- Energy & Commodities in Focus: The energy sector outperformed as oil prices hovered near one-year highs. U.S. crude futures, which spiked over 2% on Wednesday after a surprise inventory drawdown, held close to ~$95 a barrel [20]. Oil majors and refiners rallied on the supply-tightening trend, helping the S&P 500\u2019s energy sector jump about 1% [21]. In contrast, gold prices pulled back from recent record levels as rising real yields dulled the appeal of the safe-haven metal [22]. The U.S. Dollar Index hit its highest level in months around the mid-98 range [23], bolstered by the strong U.S. data and interest-rate outlook.\n- Macro Risks Mount \u2013 Shutdown and Geopolitics: Washington brinksmanship is creeping into market calculations. With Congress locked in a budget stalemate, a federal government shutdown looms on October 1 if a funding deal isn\u2019t reached, injecting uncertainty into the economic outlook [24]. The White House has even directed agencies to draft contingency plans for potential furloughs and s"

Kennedy Jr. or the acting CDC director could create new recommendations without a vote from the panel, giving the health secretary broad authority over the childhood vaccine schedule. But there's little precedent for such a move.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Sept. 22, 2025, in Washington, as HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. listens. | Mark Schiefelbein/AP\nDecision time is looming for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually approves changes to the vaccine schedule teed up by its external advisory panel. But there may now be some daylight between Kennedy and the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which last week made decisions that \u2014 at least on the surface \u2014 appeared surprising for a group whose members Kennedy handpicked.\nKennedy, himself or through his acting CDC director, Jim O\u2019Neill, has the power to accept or reject ACIP\u2019s recommendations \u2014 which, if approved, wouldn\u2019t alter the vaccine schedule as much as many public health advocates expected. The panel tabled a proposal to delay vaccinating certain newborns for hepatitis B; did not recommend that states and localities require prescriptions for the Covid-19 vaccine; and endorsed allowing anyone 6 months and older to get a Covid shot.\nKennedy could create new recommendations without a vote from the panel, giving the health secretary broad authority over the childhood vaccine schedule, though there\u2019s little precedent for such a move.\nPresident Donald Trump appears to have further complicated Kennedy\u2019s decisionmaking by pushing dramatic changes to the vaccine schedule at a White House event Monday to address a supposed connection between Tylenol use by pregnant women and autism.\nTrump linked childhood vaccines and the timeline in which they\u2019re administered to autism diagnoses \u2014 a theory discredited by numerous scientific studies \u2014 and suggested that the schedule needed to be overhauled. He also said he thought hepatitis B vaccination should be pushed back from an infant\u2019s first day of life to age 12.\nIt\u2019s unclear when the CDC\u2019s decision will be announced, though it could come any day now, or which way Kennedy is leaning. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon noted that the recommendations become \u201cpart of the CDC immunization schedule if it is adopted by the CDC director,\u201d but declined to comment on Kennedy\u2019s timing.\nStill, many public health advocates are worried.\n\u201cI think [Kennedy] has ultimate power in terms of these sorts of things,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a former ACIP member. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it all so frightening, because he\u2019s a man on a mission, and his mission is to make vaccines less available, less affordable.\u201d\nThere\u2019s precedent for HHS ignoring its vaccine advisers. Then-CDC Director Rochelle Walensky overruled the committee in 2021 to more broadly recommend third doses of Covid vaccines than the panel recommended.\nBut Dr. Richard Besser, CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting CDC director under President Barack Obama, said Walensky\u2019s decision was understandable. The Covid pandemic was still raging, and ACIP\u2019s advice to limit booster doses to older people and those with preexisting medical conditions came after a divided vote.\n\u201cDr. Walensky\u2019s decision expanded eligibility for potentially life-saving vaccines,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cSecretary Kennedy, on the other hand, seems determined to restrict access as much as he can.\u201d\nKennedy has deviated from the normal process before. In May, he changed the Covid vaccine guidance without an ACIP vote, removing the recommendation that pregnant women get vaccinated and advising that healthy children \u201cmay\u201d get the shot after conferring with their doctors.\nKennedy fired all 17 members of the advisory panel in June, citing conflicts of interest, and has repla"

                "body": "Marvin Harrison Jr.'s struggles continue with a huge drop, but he rebounds with a TD\nLast week Marvin Harrison Jr. had a bad drop. He was wide open downfield, Kyler Murray delivered a good pass and Harrison simply had it go through his arms.\nAt least that one hit the ground and was incomplete.\nHarrison's struggles early in his second season were on full display for a big audience that turned in for Thursday night's game, and a big mistake became a turnover. The Arizona Cardinals receiver had a perfect pass hit him right in the hands over the middle of the field, but it bounced off his hands and when he tried to gather it, the ball caromed in the air and right to Seattle Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV for an interception.\nThe Seahawks went on to win 23-20 on a field goal as time expired.\nHarrison was supposed to be a transcendent player coming out of Ohio State. He was viewed as one of the top receiver prospects in a long time, and was taken fourth in the NFL Draft after three quarterbacks went off the board. It has not worked out anywhere close to how he or the Cardinals had hoped.\nHarrison did bounce back for a really nice touchdown in the fourth quarter. He caught it over Pro Bowl cornerback Devon Witherspoon in the end zone for the Cardinals' first touchdown of the night.\nHarrison needed a play like that.\n[Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7]\nHarrison had an uneven rookie season, but was still good enough that bigger things were expected his second season. He had a solid opener but then had just 71 yards in Arizona's next two games, everyone saw his embarrassing drop against the 49ers, and then he had the drop on Thursday night that led to an interception. Before that, Harrison and Murray had a big miscommunication that led to Murray throwing to nobody on the right side as Harrison continued to run upfield.\nHarrison's struggles are becoming such an issue that on the Amazon Prime Video pregame show, former NFL tight end Tony Gonzalez said he talked to Harrison about his own issues with drops his second season.\nHarrison's touchdown didn't completely erase the massive drop that led to the interception. But it was a needed reprieve from his struggles."

Hopes for a near-term Bank of Japan rate hike added momentum for banks, after the central bank hinted at tighter policy and trimmed bond-buying by 400 billion yen.

Western Therapeutics soared 46.3% after its new pain patch secured US FDA approval, paving the way for American sales by 2026.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Currency swings shape investor sentiment.\nA weaker yen usually spells good news for Japanese exporters by making their products more competitive abroad, and that trend was seen in the Nikkei\u2019s recent climb.
