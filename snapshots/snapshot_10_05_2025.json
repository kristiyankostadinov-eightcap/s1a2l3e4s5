September\u2019s private payrolls dropped by 32,000, stoking fears of a cooling labor market and pushing up expectations for interest rate cuts. According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders are nearly unanimous the Federal Reserve will trim rates by 0.25 percentage points this month. Political wrangling around a potential government shutdown has only fueled the flight to safety, while a declining dollar has made gold even more attractive. The SPDR Gold Trust, the world\u2019s largest gold ETF, saw holdings jump to a two-year high, up 0.59%. Goldman Sachs just bumped up its short-term gold target to $4,000 per ounce, citing strong ETF inflows and speculative momentum from Western investors.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: When uncertainty mounts gold glitters.\nInvestors are rotating into gold and other precious metals, with silver, platinum, and palladium also posting gains, as nerves around market volatility set in.

                "body": "Inflation, Debt, and Gold: Daniel Lacalle on the Fed's Slow-Motion Crisis\nIn a recent episode of the Money Metals podcast, host Michael Maharrey sat down with Spanish economist Dr. Daniel Lacalle.\nThe two explored the Federal Reserve\u2019s role in driving inflation, the global sovereign debt bubble, and the implications for gold and silver investors.\n(Interview Starts Around 6:30 Mark)\nWho Is Dr. Daniel Lacalle?\nDaniel Lacalle is widely recognized as one of Europe\u2019s most prominent free-market economists.\nHe is the Chief Economist at Tressis, a fund manager with decades of experience in international capital markets, and a professor of global economics at IE Business School in Madrid.\nDaniel Lacalle is the author of several books, including Life in the Financial Markets, Freedom or Equality, and Escape from the Central Bank Trap. His writings frequently appear in global outlets such as CNBC, The Wall Street Journal, and The Financial Times.\nHis background in energy markets, sovereign debt, and monetary policy gives him a unique vantage point on the forces shaping today\u2019s economy.\nKnown for his Austrian-school approach, Lacalle has consistently warned about the dangers of central bank intervention, government overspending, and the long-term consequences of sovereign debt.\nWith a global audience that follows his commentary across X, YouTube, LinkedIn, and his website, he has become a leading voice on monetary policy, inflation, and precious metals as safe-haven assets.\nThe Fed\u2019s Role in Inflation\nLacalle argued that the inflation crisis of 2021 through 2023 was not the result of tariffs or supply chain disruptions, as many policymakers claimed.\nInstead, it was the direct outcome of the Federal Reserve monetizing extraordinary levels of government spending.\nHe pointed out that the Biden administration increased spending by two trillion dollars beyond the already unprecedented COVID programs.\nThe Fed facilitated this excess through aggressive money supply expansion. Combined with the surge in money velocity during lockdowns, the result was a wave of inflation that continues to linger.\nAlthough the Fed initially dismissed inflation as transitory, it later blamed global supply chains and the war in Ukraine. Lacalle insisted that the central bank itself was the primary culprit.\nInterest Rate Manipulation and Credit Squeeze\nThe discussion turned to interest rates, where Lacalle emphasized that the Federal Reserve should not manipulate them at all.\nHe noted that when rates are set by policy rather than markets, distortions inevitably follow.\nSmall and medium enterprises are finding it almost impossible to obtain credit, not just at higher prices but at all, as banks prefer to hoard treasuries.\nWith the ten-year Treasury yielding around 4.10 percent, the incentive to lend to productive businesses is crushed.\nThe result is crowding out of the private sector and weaker job creation. Lacalle argued these consequences could be avoided if interest rates were allowed to float freely.\nGold, Silver, and Central Bank Policy\nFor investors in precious metals, Lacalle painted a picture of strong tailwinds ahead.\nCentral banks around the world continue to inject liquidity to sustain the sovereign debt bubble, whether in Japan, the UK, or the Eurozone.\nIn this environment, he noted, gold is essentially free money.\nToday, central banks hold less than 17 percent of their assets in gold. If they were forced to double that allocation, the price of gold would inevitably rise.\nSilver, closely tied to gold, would move higher as well. Both metals, he argued, reflect the ongoing destruction of currency purchasing power.\nThe Hidden Costs of Government Debt\nLacalle explained that government debt is not some abstract issue with little bearing on everyday life.\nHigh levels of debt translate directly into slower productivity growth and weaker real wage gains.\nPrivate borrowers are crowded out as banks favor lending to governments, while ordinary citizens struggle with "

                "body": "Measured in dollars, the US economy is 25 times bigger than it was in 1971. But measured in gold, which remained the basis of the dollar\u2019s foreign-exchange value until that year, the American economy peaked at the turn of the millennium. It\u2019s been declining ever since, and is today less than half the size it was when Richard Nixon abandoned the greenback\u2019s convertibility to gold.\nSome economists would suggest that this proves why a gold standard is a bad idea. When the supply of money is fixed, it makes it hard for an economy to emerge from recession, since central banks can\u2019t ease spending and investment by printing money. Libertarian economists who call for a return to the gold standard can retort that once it has the power to print money at will, there will be nothing stopping a government or central bank from doing so endlessly. Today, for instance, despite the fact that economies aren\u2019t in recession, inflation is rising and asset prices are skyrocketing, the world\u2019s major central banks are still overseeing a rapid expansion in the supply of money.\nThis is worth noting following the news that gold prices finished this week close to all-time highs, having surged almost 50% this year. Investment banks have begun advising clients to stock up on gold to protect against currency debasement. They can read the runes, because what makes the engineered degradation of money\u2019s value so appealing to governments is the sheer level of debt that has been accumulated in Western countries by both the public and private sectors. Among the G7 economies, only Germany has a public debt burden smaller than the economy. Add in private debt, and G7 countries all have total debt burdens that range from two to four times the size of annual output.\nWith annual economic growth seldom much above 1%, and with a growing share of output allocated to paying interest, it looks like these debts might never get paid. So the temptation of allowing inflation to run hot for several years in order to inflate away the debts becomes irresistible. Not only are central banks easing monetary policy, but the Trump administration is expressly pushing for low interest rates in order to make the burden manageable.\nThat will be good for debtors but bad for creditors, including pension funds such as the US Social Security system. But currency debasement can run out of control. The last time gold prices surged as they are doing now was in the Seventies. That decade ended with double-digit inflation, mortgage rates in the high teens or more, and ultimately a deep recession.\nIt\u2019s not surprising, therefore, that investment banks are advising their clients to run for cover. Central banks are themselves allocating a rising share of their reserves to gold, dumping fiat currencies in the process. As a result, the price of an ounce of gold looks set to crash through the $4,000 mark. But another way of looking at it is that the value of the dollar, or of the euro or pound, is collapsing. It\u2019s less easy to convince people they\u2019ve never had it so good when the value of their money has never been so bad."

This is still up from a 2025 low of near $58 in April.\nOPEC+\u2019s hikes have fallen short of the pledged amounts because most members are pumping near capacity.

The country recently conducted its first intercity electric test flight using the Alia CX300, marking a milestone toward fully electrified domestic aviation. Despite generating billions from offshore oil, Norway invests heavily in decarbonizing transport, electrifying 44 airports and over 10,100 EV chargers nationwide. The move symbolizes a structural transformation that could gradually erode future oil demand in OECD markets. With 88.9% of new vehicles sold in 2024 being electric, Norway\u2019s long-term reduction in petroleum dependence sends a clear signal: developed economies are embedding energy transition even as producers fight to monetize remaining hydrocarbon cycles.\nGasoline Market Stabilizes at $3.15 per Gallon but Refinery Maintenance May Shift Dynamics\nDownstream markets echoed crude\u2019s softness, with U.S. gasoline prices stabilizing at $3.15 per gallon, unchanged from last week. According to EIA data, U.S. gasoline demand dropped from 8.95 million bpd to 8.51 million bpd, while inventories rose from 216.6 million to 220.7 million barrels. The oversupply, coupled with lower travel activity post-summer, is keeping pump prices steady despite the crude downturn. However, analysts warn that seasonal refinery maintenance could temporarily squeeze supply mid-October, possibly lifting gasoline prices by 5\u20137 cents. For small businesses reliant on transportation, this equilibrium provides short-term relief, though volatility could resurface if refineries extend downtime or if geopolitical events disrupt supply chains.\nTechnical Picture and Market Sentiment for CL=F and BZ=F\nFrom a technical standpoint, WTI (CL=F) faces firm resistance near $62.50\u2013$63.00, with support forming around $59.70 \u2014 a level not tested since early June. The 200-day moving average now slopes downward at $65.40, indicating structural bearish pressure. Brent (BZ=F) mirrors this trend with resistance at $65.80 and downside risk toward $61.50. RSI readings near 34 reflect oversold conditions, yet traders remain cautious ahead of Sunday\u2019s OPEC+ meeting. Volume metrics show a 22% surge in open interest for short contracts, confirming institutional positioning for further weakness. A failure to maintain WTI above $60 could trigger algorithmic selling toward $58, while any coordinated OPEC+ output restraint could drive a corrective rebound back toward $67\u2013$69.\nOutlook and Strategic Stance\nAs of early October 2025, the oil complex remains dominated by excess supply, weak demand momentum, and political signaling rather than fundamentals. The resumption of Iraq\u2019s 200,000 bpd exports, coupled with the prospect of up to 1 million bpd additional OPEC+ output, creates a structural overhang likely to cap prices through November. At the same time, the U.S. crude inventory build, muted refinery utilization, and steady gasoline stockpiles reinforce the case for short-term downside. However, with RSI levels entering oversold territory and speculative shorts heavily concentrated, a technical rebound toward WTI $65 and Brent $68 cannot be ruled out if OPEC+ moderates its production stance.\nVerdict: HOLD with Bearish Bias \u2014 Oil\u2019s fundamentals remain under strain, but prices have already corrected over 8% in one week. Near-term recovery potential hinges entirely on OPEC+\u2019s Sunday decision and the pace of Iraq\u2019s pipeline ramp-up. A confirmed output hike above 500,000 bpd would likely send WTI (CL=F) below $59, while a pause or symbolic cut could stabilize prices near $66. Long-term, the interplay between fiscal necessity, geopolitics, and energy transition continues to define the crude market\u2019s next directional phase."

However, analysts warn that seasonal refinery maintenance could temporarily squeeze supply mid-October, possibly lifting gasoline prices by 5\u20137 cents. For small businesses reliant on transportation, this equilibrium provides short-term relief, though volatility could resurface if refineries extend downtime or if geopolitical events disrupt supply chains.\nTechnical Picture and Market Sentiment for CL=F and BZ=F\nFrom a technical standpoint, WTI (CL=F) faces firm resistance near $62.50\u2013$63.00, with support forming around $59.70 \u2014 a level not tested since early June. The 200-day moving average now slopes downward at $65.40, indicating structural bearish pressure. Brent (BZ=F) mirrors this trend with resistance at $65.80 and downside risk toward $61.50. RSI readings near 34 reflect oversold conditions, yet traders remain cautious ahead of Sunday\u2019s OPEC+ meeting. Volume metrics show a 22% surge in open interest for short contracts, confirming institutional positioning for further weakness. A failure to maintain WTI above $60 could trigger algorithmic selling toward $58, while any coordinated OPEC+ output restraint could drive a corrective rebound back toward $67\u2013$69.\nOutlook and Strategic Stance\nAs of early October 2025, the oil complex remains dominated by excess supply, weak demand momentum, and political signaling rather than fundamentals. The resumption of Iraq\u2019s 200,000 bpd exports, coupled with the prospect of up to 1 million bpd additional OPEC+ output, creates a structural overhang likely to cap prices through November. At the same time, the U.S. crude inventory build, muted refinery utilization, and steady gasoline stockpiles reinforce the case for short-term downside. However, with RSI levels entering oversold territory and speculative shorts heavily concentrated, a technical rebound toward WTI $65 and Brent $68 cannot be ruled out if OPEC+ moderates its production stance.\nVerdict: HOLD with Bearish Bias \u2014 Oil\u2019s fundamentals remain under strain, but prices have already corrected over 8% in one week. Near-term recovery potential hinges entirely on OPEC+\u2019s Sunday decision and the pace of Iraq\u2019s pipeline ramp-up. A confirmed output hike above 500,000 bpd would likely send WTI (CL=F) below $59, while a pause or symbolic cut could stabilize prices near $66. Long-term, the interplay between fiscal necessity, geopolitics, and energy transition continues to define the crude market\u2019s next directional phase."

                "body": "Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other key members of the OPEC+ alliance are likely to agree to raise crude output when they meet virtually on Sunday, with analysts divided over the size of the expected hike.\nThe meeting by the group of eight oil-producing countries known as the \"Voluntary Eight\" (V8) comes as oil prices head for weekly losses and rumours of a possible output increase of up to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) swirl.\nAngered by what it dismissed as \"wholly inaccurate and misleading\" media reports, the 12-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) urged news outlets in a statement on Tuesday to \"exercise accuracy... in order to avoid fuelling\" market speculation.\nExperts had initially expected a production hike of 137,000 bpd from November, which would mirror the October increase.\nBut Commerzbank analyst Barbara Lambrecht cautioned that uncertainty remained, as \"the group has frequently surprised markets with swift production hikes in the recent past\".\nSince April, the V8 group -- comprising Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman -- has boosted production by 2.5 million bpd (mbpd) in total.\nThe group has sped up output increases at a pace very few had predicted at the beginning of the year, following a long period of producers seeking to combat price erosion by implementing production cuts to make oil scarcer.\n- Prices in decline -\nBut in recent months, OPEC+ has shifted its strategy in a bid to regain market share in the face of competition from other countries, and \"with output from the United States, Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Argentina at or near all-time highs\", the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its latest monthly oil report.\nBut the IEA stressed that global demand outlook for crude \"remains largely unchanged\", with growth of around 700,000 bpd expected for both 2025 and 2026.\nThe OPEC cartel was more optimistic in its latest projections for oil demand worldwide, forecasting increases of 1.3 mbpd in 2025 and 1.4 mbpd in 2026.\nAccording to Tamas Varga of PVM, signs of a \"long-awaited glut\" are now \"loudly knocking on the doors of our market\".\nAgainst this backdrop, the possibility of a larger increase in the grouping's quotas has sent the price of Brent crude -- the global benchmark for crude oil -- plummeting below $65 a barrel, a loss of around eight percent in a week.\n- Russia in uncomfortable position -\nRussia, the second-largest producer in OPEC+ behind Saudi Arabia, could oppose a sizeable increase in quotas from next month, amid fears it could cause crude oil prices to fall further.\nFollowing last month's decision, Rystad Energy analyst Jorge Leon explained that \"Russia depends on high prices to fund its war machine\" and unlike Riyadh, the Kremlin has limited potential to increase production due to Western sanctions.\nRussia, which currently produces around 9.25 mbpd, has a \"maximum production capacity of 9.45 mbpd\" compared to around 10 mbpd before the war, Homayoun Falakshahi at Kpler told AFP.\nMoreover, Ukrainian strikes on Russian refineries have intensified since August, translating into \"rising crude exports from Russia, as the oil cannot be used domestically\", and making Moscow even more dependent on selling its crude abroad, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen of Global Risk Management.\nBy Pol-malo Le Bris"

With the U.S. government shutdown entering its third day and major releases such as Nonfarm Payrolls postponed, liquidity in the FX market remained thin. The euro\u2019s stability reflected both temporary dollar weakness and cautious positioning ahead of the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on October 29, where markets are pricing in a 96% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut, according to Prime Market Terminal data. The absence of fresh U.S. economic figures has amplified sensitivity to Fed rhetoric, with policymakers showing clear division on the path forward for monetary easing.\nFed Rhetoric Exposes Deep Policy Divide\nThe week\u2019s trading was dominated by contradictory remarks from key Fed officials. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan warned that \u201cnon-housing services inflation remains elevated,\u201d expressing concern that tariff effects on imported goods could prolong inflationary pressures. Her tone contrasted sharply with Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who argued that \u201cpolicy has become too restrictive\u201d and that the central bank has \u201cample room to cut rates.\u201d Meanwhile, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson attempted to balance the narrative, saying the absence of jobs data was \u201cnot ideal\u201d but that the Fed had \u201csufficient information\u201d to guide its decisions. This rhetorical tug-of-war added to uncertainty over the U.S. dollar\u2019s short-term trajectory, as investors debated whether the Fed\u2019s forward guidance would lean dovish enough to justify further euro strength.\nMacroeconomic Data Show Loss of U.S. Momentum\nEconomic indicators reinforced the narrative of a softening U.S. economy. The ISM Services PMI for September dropped sharply from 52.0 to 50.0, exactly at the neutral expansion threshold, missing consensus expectations of 51.7. Respondents described business conditions as \u201cmoderate or weak,\u201d while the employment component barely improved to 47.2 from 46.5, signaling persistent hiring reluctance. In contrast, the S&P Global Services PMI showed resilience at 54.2, only slightly below August\u2019s 54.5, suggesting that parts of the services sector are still expanding despite softer domestic demand. Together, these mixed readings depict an economy losing steam but not yet contracting \u2014 a backdrop that strengthens the case for the Fed to deliver a measured, rather than aggressive, easing cycle.\nMarket Repricing Accelerates as Yields Fall\nBond markets reflected growing conviction in imminent policy easing. The 2-year Treasury yield eased toward 4.12%, while the 10-year slipped below 4.00% for the first time since June. Swap markets now price roughly 50 basis points of total cuts by year-end, up from 30 basis points two weeks ago. This repricing has pressured the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which fell to 97.72, hovering just above its three-month low of 97.46. The euro, benefiting from these shifts, gained for a fifth consecutive day, underscoring a clear sentiment rotation from defensive dollar holdings to selective euro buying. Still, European traders remain cautious given the bloc\u2019s uneven growth recovery and persistent inflation "

This figure reflects the changing dynamics within the oil industry.\nThe EUR/USD steadied in response to broader economic factors, including discussions within the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 250 points, driven by expectations of rate cuts.\nGold And Bitcoin Market Dynamics\nGold prices increased, reaching nearly $3,890 per troy ounce, amid concerns about a potential US shutdown. Bitcoin saw a marginal drop to $120,000, maintaining its position following a recent high.\nFXStreet has introduced a new design to enhance user experience and editorial strategies. This is part of ongoing efforts to support and guide traders effectively.\nPump.fun continues to perform well in cryptocurrency markets, trading above the $0.0070 mark. The token shows positive signs due to robust technical indicators.\nWe are seeing significant uncertainty driven by the US government shutdown, which is putting heavy pressure on the Dollar. As traders, we should consider that historical shutdowns, like the 35-day event we saw back in 2018-2019, can lead to prolonged periods of volatility. This environment makes trading currency derivatives that bet against the dollar, such as buying puts on the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP), a strategy to consider.\nFed Uncertainty And Interest Rates\nThere is a clear divide at the Fed, with some officials pushing for more cuts while others warn of persistent inflation. This uncertainty about the future path of interest rates is creating a perfect setup for volatility, which historically spikes around conflicted FOMC meetings. We should consider using options strategies like straddles or strangles on interest rate-sensitive instruments, such as Treasury bond ETFs (TLT), to profit from a large move in either direction.\nThe continued drop in the US oil rig count, now at 422, signals a potential tightening of future supply. This comes as recent Energy Information Administration data from September 2025 showed a larger-than-expected draw on crude inventories, reinforcing the bullish outlook. We should look at buying call options on WTI crude futures or on energy sector ETFs like XLE for the coming months.\nWith the shutdown fueling a flight to safety, gold is acting as a classic haven asset, now pushing near $3,890 an ounce. We saw a similar dynamic when gold broke its previous records back in 2024 during a period of geopolitical tension and rate uncertainty. Traders should consider long positions through gold futures (GC) or call options on gold ETFs (GLD) to ride this momentum.\nThe stock market seems to be ignoring the shutdown risks, with the Dow climbing based on hopes for more Fed rate cuts. Historically, market performance during shutdowns is mixed; the S&P 500 actually gained during the long 2018-2019 shutdown, showing this optimism is not without precedent. However, we should consider hedging long equity positions by buying put options on major indices like the SPX as insurance against a sudden reversal."

The latest CME FedWatch Tool shows the probability of that cut now standing at 96%, as soft economic data and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown reinforce expectations that the Fed will have little choice but to ease further. The ISM Services PMI printed 50.0, its weakest reading since November 2023, while ADP employment data posted the sharpest monthly decline in over two years, underscoring deteriorating labor conditions. Treasury yields mirrored the slowdown \u2014 the 10-year yield fell to 3.68%, its lowest since May, while the 2-year yield slid under 3.95%, removing a key pillar of dollar strength and giving sterling space to rally.\nFED DOVISH SHIFT WEAKENS THE DOLLAR, LIFTING GBP/USD\nThe greenback remains under pressure as investors digest a growing divide within the Federal Reserve. Vice Chair Philip Jefferson signaled caution about further tightening, while Adriana Kugler pointed to the risk of \u201coversteering\u201d the economy into stagnation. In contrast, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan warned that inflationary forces remain sticky, though her comments failed to reverse the dollar\u2019s decline. For GBP/USD, the effect has been pronounced \u2014 the pair has risen nearly 1.2% this week, outperforming the EUR/USD, which stalled near 1.1750. With U.S. data fading and political volatility rising as the shutdown continues, investors are trimming long-dollar positions, allowing the pound to test the 1.35 zone for the first time since mid-August.\nTECHNICAL STRUCTURE: POUND BUILDS HIGHER LOWS ABOVE 1.3322 AS BUYERS TARGET 1.3725\nTechnically, GBP/USD remains constructive. The pair continues to hold above its 76.4% and 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels from the 2021\u20132022 decline, confirming the presence of strong support around 1.3320\u20131.3340. The market\u2019s inability to close below that zone signals accumulation by institutional traders, who view it as a key pivot before a potential breakout toward 1.3535 and 1.3725. A decisive daily close above 1.3535 could unleash a momentum-driven rally targeting 1.3780, where price previously rejected in early spring. Conversely, a breakdown below 1.3320 would reintroduce bearish momentum, potentially sending the pair back to 1.3166, aligning with the 55-week exponential moving average, which has acted as medium-term dynamic support since May. The bullish bias remains intact as long as GBP/USD trades above 1.33 and the dollar remains on the defensive.\nUK FISCAL POSITION REMAINS A HEADWIND AS INVESTORS WATCH SUNAK\u2019S NEXT BUDGET\nWhile short-term momentum favors sterling, domestic fundamentals present headwinds. The UK\u2019s public borrowing widened more than expected to \u00a312.2 billion in August, raising questions about fiscal sustainability just weeks ahead of the autumn statement. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faces increasing pressure to maintain credibility after gilt yields briefly spiked above 4.15% earlier this week. The Bank of England, meanwhile, is stuck between stubborn inflation and weakening growth. CPI remains elevated at 3.4% year-over-year, and core inflation is still at 3.1%, while consumer confidence has slipped to a four-month low. Retail sales fell 0.3% in August, following a modest 0.1% gain "

                "body": "Macro Divergence: Yen Benefiting from Fed-BoJ Policy Gap Narrowing\nThe broader macro divergence narrative remains the dominant driver. For nearly two years, the Fed\u2019s rapid tightening cycle left Japan\u2019s near-zero rates far behind, propelling USD/JPY from 115 in early 2022 to above 150 in 2024. That differential, now narrowing for the first time in the cycle, is reshaping currency flows. Analysts at Nomura and Goldman Sachs note that each 25-basis-point narrowing in yield spread historically results in a 1.2\u20131.5% drop in USD/JPY, implying that the current trajectory could drag the pair toward 145.00 by November if Fed easing continues. However, Japan\u2019s current account surplus of \u00a52.9 trillion and robust export growth in semiconductors and autos continue to provide underlying yen demand even amid short-term volatility.\nEnergy and Commodity Impacts: Crude and LNG Pricing Feed Into FX\nJapan\u2019s heavy dependence on imported energy remains a persistent drag on the yen\u2019s fundamentals. Brent crude (BZ=F) trading near $64.50/barrel and LNG contracts above $14/MMBtu raise Japan\u2019s import bill, historically leading to yen outflows during energy price spikes. Yet, the recent drop in both oil and natural gas prices has eased this burden, reducing monthly import costs by an estimated \u00a51.1 trillion compared to Q1 2025 levels. This shift partially offsets trade balance risks and supports the yen\u2019s recovery, particularly as Japan\u2019s exporters repatriate profits ahead of fiscal year-end settlements in March 2026.\nMarket Sentiment: Hedge Funds Trim Long Dollar Positions\nCurrency funds are reducing their exposure to the dollar after months of dominance. According to IMM positioning, net dollar longs against the yen have fallen by 36,000 contracts, the sharpest three-week drop since mid-2023. The market\u2019s sentiment tilt is increasingly cautious, as investors hedge against a potential BoJ policy surprise. Tokyo\u2019s Ministry of Finance has also been actively monitoring currency fluctuations, with Vice Minister Masato Kanda reiterating readiness to \u201crespond decisively\u201d to speculative moves if volatility threatens financial stability. Verbal interventions alone have been sufficient to slow yen depreciation since last quarter, reinforcing 150.00 as a psychological ceiling.\nForward Outlook: Election Risk, Fed Pivot, and Technical Compression\nHeading into Q4, USD/JPY faces a three-dimensional risk set: (1) Fed easing trajectory versus inflation persistence, (2) BoJ\u2019s policy recalibration window ahead of 2026, and (3) Japan\u2019s domestic political reshuffle. The cross is likely to remain range-bound between 145.00 and 149.50 in October unless a decisive macro catalyst breaks the current volatility compression. Traders continue to watch Friday\u2019s U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls and next week\u2019s FOMC minutes, both pivotal for confirming the Fed\u2019s dovish tilt.\nVerdict: Neutral-to-Bearish Bias \u2014 Hold Below 149.00\nWith structural forces beginning to favor yen strength, the short-term tone on USD/JPY (USDJPY=X) remains neutral to bearish. The pair is likely to test 146.00\u2013145.00 before finding stabilization. A sustained rebound is unlikely until the Fed signals a pause in its rate-cut rhetoric or the BoJ reaffirms dovish commitment. For now, the trade setup supports Hold below 149.00, with downside risk toward 145.20 if macro divergence continues to tighten into November."

                "body": "USD/JPY dropped below the crucial 147.5 support level. The US government shutdown on September 30 led to a weaker US dollar amid rising bets on multiple Fed rate cuts in the fourth quarter.\nUSD/JPY slid 1.35% to close at 147.460 in the week ending October 3. A bearish start to the week sent the pair to a low of 146.585 before recovering above 147.\nThe US government shutdown and US labor market data raised bets on October and December Fed rate cuts, weighing on the US dollar.\nThis week, Sanae Takaichi\u2019s victory in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) election is expected to kick-start a volatile week for the yen. Takaichi\u2019s stance on fiscal and monetary policy would likely pressure the Japanese yen. James E. Thorne, Chief Market Strategist at Wellington-Altus, commented on the potential impact of Takaichi\u2019s win on the BoJ\u2019s policy stance, stating:\n\u201cTakaichi has repeatedly criticized Bank of Japan interest rate increases, favoring fiscal expansion and sustained monetary accommodation instead. She believes aggressive easing is essential for boosting growth and has stressed the need for pro-growth policies to address rising living costs. Her election has been seen by local bond strategists as a signal that the BoJ is less likely to raise rates in the near term.\u201d\nWhile markets will react to the election result, crucial economic data will also influence USD/JPY trends. Household spending, wage growth, and producer prices would likely affect demand for the yen.\nHowever, traders should also closely monitor the Bank of Japan\u2019s views on the election result and its monetary policy stance.\nOn Tuesday, October 7, household spending could influence the BoJ\u2019s rate path and appetite for the yen. Economists forecast household spending to increase 0.1% month-on-month in August after soaring 1.7% in July.\nA higher-than-expected print could fuel demand-driven inflation, lifting expectations of a fourth-quarter BoJ rate hike. A more hawkish BoJ policy stance would boost demand for the yen, weighing on the USD/JPY pair.\nConversely, an unexpected fall in household spending may signal a softer inflation outlook, easing yen demand.\nWhile inflation remains the focus, household spending will also affect fourth-quarter GDP trends. Private consumption accounts for over 50% of Japan\u2019s GDP, giving household spending a larger weighting as policymakers focus on the effect of US tariffs on the economy.\nOn Wednesday, October 8, wage growth will face scrutiny after BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s recent warning about US tariffs forcing firms to cut wages. Economists expect average hourly wages to rise 4.3% year-on-year in August, up from 3.4% in July.\nHigher wages would likely boost private consumption, fueling inflationary pressures and bolstering the economy. A sharper rise in wages may raise expectations of an October BoJ rate hike, lifting demand for the yen.\nOn the other hand, softer wage growth could potentially delay monetary policy tightening until 2026, given Governor Ueda\u2019s concerns about US tariffs impacting wage growth. He stated:\n\u201cIf uncertainty regarding overseas economies and trade policies remains high, firms may place stronger emphasis on cost-cutting and may weaken their efforts to reflect price increases in wages.\u201d\nOn Friday, October 10, economists expect producer prices to increase 0.1% month-on-month in September, after falling 0.2% in August.\nA larger-than-expected rise in producer prices could signal a pickup in demand and higher consumer prices. Producers typically increase prices when demand improves, passing higher costs on to customers. Rising prices may support a more hawkish BoJ rate path as economists view producer prices as a leading indicator of inflation.\nNotably, the US dropped tariffs on Japanese goods to 15% in August, easing price pressures on Japanese manufacturers.\nHowever, an unexpected drop in prices may signal a softer inflation outlook and a less hawkish BoJ policy stance. Some economists have speculated that manufacturers may "

Traders are now pricing in around 15 basis points of tightening by October\u2019s end, a jump from just 6 basis points a month ago. Still, the BoJ\u2019s Deputy Governor struck a cautious tone, emphasizing that any moves depend on Japan\u2019s economic outlook. A softer US dollar has helped the yen strengthen, nudging the usd/jpy pair closer to 147. All eyes now turn to Governor Ueda\u2019s upcoming speech and the Liberal Democratic Party leadership election \u2013 both could set the direction for BoJ strategy into the new year.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Monetary policy and politics drive yen momentum.\nWith BoJ policy signals and domestic politics taking center stage, volatility in the yen has picked up. Investors are holding back until after the LDP leadership vote, with the next prime minister \u2013 widely tipped to be Shinjiro Koizumi \u2013 set to shape the outlook. If markets sniff out tighter policy or fresh government direction, the yen could gain even more ground. Its 2% rise this week against the dollar shows just how reactive currency markets are to even small signals from Japanese officials.\nThe bigger picture: Japan\u2019s policy choices send ripples far beyond its borders.\nJapan\u2019s mix of steady business confidence and growing inflation pressure puts the nation\u2019s politics and central bank decisions under the global spotlight. Any clear moves from the BoJ or a shift at the government\u2019s helm could have lasting effects on exchange rates, trade flows, and where investors park their cash. Ultimately, Japan\u2019s next steps could play a major role in shaping worldwide economic currents over the coming months.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nWeekly Brief\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 7 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

The index closed above lateral resistance this week at the 1.382% extension of the January decline at 6665 and keeps the uptrend intact into the start of October trade. Note that weekly momentum is at the highest levels of the year with RSI breaking above 70 this week for the first time since July of 2024.\nS&P 500 Price Chart \u2013 SPX500 Daily\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; S&P 500 on TradingView\nIn my last equity forecast we noted that the S&P 500 was consolidating below uptrend resistance into the close of August and that, \u201cFrom a trading standpoint, a good zone to reduce portions of long-exposure / raise protective stops- losses should be limited to consolidation support IF price is heading higher on this stretch with a close above the 75% parallel needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance.\u201d A topside breach on September 11 has extended more than 6% off the September low with the six-day advance hitting a fresh record high on Friday.\nInitial support now rests with the August trendline near ~6606 and a break below this slope would be needed to suggest a more sigfniicant high is in place / a lager reversal is underway. Subsequent support seen at 6500 and the July high-day close (HDC) / August open at 6342. Broader bullish invalidation rests at 6130/40- a region defined by the 100% extension of the 2020 advance, the 2025 yearly opening-range highs, and the February high-day close.\nInitial resistance is eyed with the upper parallel, currently near 6790s- a breach of channel resistance would be needed to fuel the next major leg of the advance towards subsequent objectives at 6911/98- a region defined by the 2.618% extension of the April advance and the 1.618% extension of the yearly range. Look for a larger reaction there IF reached.\nBottom line: The S&P 500 is trading just below uptrend resistance into the start of the month with daily divergence suggesting the immediate rally may vulnerable near-term. Keep in mind that October is seasonally the third highest performing month for the S&P 500. From a trading standpoint, losses should be limited to 6605 IF the index is heading higher on this stretch with a pivot above channel resistance needed to mark uptrend resumption.\nNasdaq Price Chart \u2013 NDX Weekly\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; NDX on TradingView\nTechnical Outlook: Nasdaq registered a fresh all-time high on Friday but closed lower on the session with NDX ending the week up more than 1.2%. The rally takes the index into a critical resistance zone we\u2019ve been tracking for months now at 24,640-25,041- a region defined by the 2.618% extension of the April rally and the 200% extension of the broader 2022 advance. Note that the upper parallel of an ascending pitchfork extending off the August 2024 low converges on this threshold into the start of the month and further highlights the technical significance of this zone in the days ahead. Looking for a reaction off this level for guidance.\nWeekly support rests with the August high-week close (HWC) at 23,712 and a close below this threshold would be needed to suggest a more significant high is in pla"

The rise triggered $153 million in short liquidations in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high of $124,128, according to CoinGlass data.\nUS investors are largely responsible for the recent price growth, as evidenced by the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium GAP, which climbed $113 more than in other exchanges. This indicates that US investors are paying a higher price for Bitcoin on Coinbase compared to other exchanges, said crypto analyst Maartun in a Friday X post.\nInstitutional demand has also contributed to BTC's current momentum, with US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experiencing inflows throughout the week. The products have seen $2.2 billion in net inflows since Monday, marking a shift in investor sentiment from the outflows of last week.\nThe rise in investor sentiment comes after the delay of the US September jobs report due to the government shutdown. The delay has sparked increased interest in crypto assets, leading to a rise in prices.\nTraders have also shown increased appetite for leveraged risk, with BTC's open interest hitting an all-time high of $89 billion, according to CoinGlass data.\nBitcoin's open interest saw a reset following last week's options expiry, \"clearing the board\" of hedging activity and setting the stage for Q4, Glassnode stated in an X post on Friday.\nThe recovery in open interest now reflects more deliberate positioning on market direction and volatility.\nDespite Bitcoin's regained momentum, the top crypto asset still lags gold and silver in year-to-date performance, Maartun added.

                "body": "GBP/JPY remains around the 198.00 mark after recovering from a previous low of 197.50. The Yen\u2019s weakness is attributed to Japan\u2019s August Unemployment Rate increasing to 2.6%, surpassing the expected 2.4% and rising from 2.3% in July.\nThe British Pound has difficulty gaining momentum as the UK Composite PMI fell to 50.1, a five-month low, while the Services PMI dropped to 50.8. GBP/JPY halts a four-day decline, stabilising near 198.00, after reaching its lowest point since August 7.\nTechnical Analysis\nTechnical analysis shows GBP/JPY attempting to maintain levels above 198.00. A breakdown below this may target the previous low of 197.50, while resistance around 198.50 aligns with the 21-period Simple Moving Average.\nThe Japanese Yen\u2019s value is affected by various factors, including Japan\u2019s economic performance, the Bank of Japan\u2019s policies, and differences in bond yields between Japan and the US. The Yen is often viewed as a safe-haven asset, gaining strength during market stress.\nForex trading involves numerous risks, and individuals should engage in personal research before making financial decisions. Data provided is for informational purposes and does not imply trading recommendations.\nWe see the GBP/JPY cross currently stuck, with both currencies showing signs of weakness. The UK\u2019s slowing economy, reflected in the September 2025 composite PMI dropping to a five-month low of 50.1, is weighing on the Pound. This suggests that option traders could consider selling call spreads above the 199.00 resistance level to bet on limited upside potential.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe Bank of England\u2019s last meeting in September 2025 held rates at 4.75%, but the minutes revealed growing concern over the economic slowdown. This dovish tilt means any rallies in the Pound may be short-lived and present selling opportunities. For traders, this reinforces the idea that the path of least resistance for the pair is to the downside over the next few weeks.\nOn the other side, the Yen is not showing much strength either, given Japan\u2019s unemployment rate just rose to 2.6%. We also note that Japan\u2019s core CPI for August 2025 came in at 2.7%, which, while still above the Bank of Japan\u2019s target, is cooling from the highs seen earlier in the year. This gives the BoJ room to be very gradual in unwinding its loose monetary policies, capping the Yen\u2019s strength for now.\nThe main wildcard is the ongoing US government shutdown, which is increasing demand for safe-haven assets. We remember the 35-day shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019, which boosted the Yen significantly against other currencies. A break below the 197.50 support level could trigger a sharp move down, making protective put options an attractive strategy to hedge against a sudden rush into the Yen."

The new filing reinforces Wall Street\u2019s growing appetite for crypto-based products, with total Bitcoin ETF holdings now near $150 billion, equal to 6.62% of Bitcoin\u2019s entire market cap.\nThis momentum is igniting rotation across the market, particularly into Ethereum, ADA, and emerging altcoins that could benefit from a broadening investor base.\nEthereum (ETH) Whales Buy the Dip\nEthereum continues to attract attention after co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke transferred 1,500 ETH (~$6M) to Kraken, sparking speculation about a potential selloff. However, large Ethereum whales are scooping up ETH, with more than 406,000 ETH ($1.6B) purchased in just two days.\nDespite short-term volatility, long-term confidence in Ethereum remains strong, supported by its role in DeFi, staking yields, and growing institutional interest. For investors seeking stability beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum price prediction models remain bullish, making ETH one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.\nCardano (ADA) Prepares for Scalability Upgrades\nCardano recently flashed a \u201cdeath cross\u201d on its four-hour chart, pushing ADA from $0.93 down to $0.75. Yet, long-term investors remain optimistic due to Ouroboros Leios, a major scalability upgrade set to boost throughput by up to 55x. Founder Charles Hoskinson has called the upgrade a critical step toward Cardano ADA\u2019s forecasted growth and long-term scalability.\nWith its roadmap for Ouroboros Omega and new interoperability features like Midnight, Cardano continues to solidify its reputation as a serious Ethereum competitor in the smart contract arena.\nMAGACOIN FINANCE \u2014 The Altcoin Investors Are Watching\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs and blue-chip cryptos dominate headlines, a new project is quietly stealing the spotlight. MAGACOIN FINANCE crypto has become one of the most hyped altcoins of 2025, as it raised over $14 million with nearly 18,000 holders in just weeks.\nKey reasons investors are rushing into MAGACOIN FINANCE:\n- Robust Security: Along with exhaustive KYC for the development team, an independent security audit by HashEx offers an additional level of trust that is typically hard to find in new crypto projects.\n- Investor Rewards: The PATRIOTS100X promotion gives a 50% token bonus for the first investors, which can ignite very fast demand for the project in the early phase.\n- Massive Community Support: With rapid sellouts of multiple early-stage phases, the project has quickly gained momentum as one of the best cryptos to buy now before launch on major exchanges.\nAccording to the projections of analysts, the current purchasing stage of MAGACOIN FINANCE might be sold out earlier than expected because it includes the combination of rarity, bonus and solid security. This has already resulted in a robust surge for MAGACOIN FINANCE price. For those investors looking for the next big altcoin after the Bitcoin ETF buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE is "

                "body": "Bitcoin Price To $160k By Early 2026? Analyst Identifies 2 Conditions For Uptrend\nThe price of Bitcoin made a dreamy start to the last quarter of the year, beginning the historically bullish month of October with a reclaim of the $120,000 level. After over a month of choppy price action, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency seems to be resuming its bullish uptrend.\nWith the price closing in on its all-time high price above $124,000, investors will be looking to see how far and long the premier cryptocurrency can go in the latest leg up. According to an on-chain analyst on social media platform X, the price of BTC could rise as high as $160,000 in the current run.\nWhy A Break Above $128k Is Critical To BTC\u2019s Bull Run\nIn an October 3 post on X, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. put forward a $160,000 target for the Bitcoin price at the start of next year. According to the online pundit, the sustained progression of BTC\u2019s price action to this unprecedented high hinges on two primary conditions, or two price levels.\nThis bullish analysis revolves around the historical price performance of Bitcoin following the halving event. Typically, the halving event is viewed as a catalytic event that triggers long-term price rallies for BTC, as it involves slashing by half the volume of the premier cryptocurrency created at a time.\nAs observed in the chart above, the scenario-based model shows through a trend-based forecast that each halving cycle produces an exponentially higher peak for the Bitcoin price. According to this model, the price of BTC printed a post-halving peak around $57,000 following the 2020 event, beating the previous high of $4,250.\nAdler Jr. revealed that the Bitcoin price could head for $160,000 after the 2024 halving event, which saw miner rewards fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. However, for this rally to be confirmed, the first condition is that the flagship cryptocurrency will need to break above the $128,000 and hold above this \u201cbase\u201d level on multiple weekly closes.\nIn the second condition, the on-chain analyst shared that Bitcoin\u2019s upward movement toward the $160,000 mark could be at risk of invalidation should the price fall below the $102,000 level. According to Adler Jr., a breakdown beneath this level could lead to a quick scenario reset, potentially changing the target or overall trend for the Bitcoin price.\nUltimately, the price action of BTC in the short term is one to look out for, as the market leader looks to reclaim its current all-time high. Moreover, a break above the record-high price could clear the path for Bitcoin to reach the \u2018base\u201d level of $128,000.\nBitcoin Price At A Glance\nAs of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $122,710, reflecting a 2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the top cryptocurrency is up by more than 12% in the last seven days."

                "body": "Government Shutdown and Capital Migration Effects\nBeyond rate policy, the U.S. government shutdown beginning Oct 1 has introduced a new macro catalyst. Prediction markets assign a 60 percent probability that it lasts beyond ten days, while Kalshi\u2019s forecast average points to 11.1 days. The lack of fiscal resolution has already pressured the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) down 1.4 percent this week and driven Treasury yields toward 4.45 percent on the 10-year. As faith in political stability wavers, investors are redistributing cash toward Bitcoin, viewing it as both a hedge against policy paralysis and a non-correlated collateral asset.\nThe correlation matrix supports this shift: BTC\u2019s 30-day rolling correlation with gold climbed to 0.64, the highest since April 2023, while its link to the Nasdaq 100 fell to 0.28, signaling decoupling from tech-equity risk and stronger alignment with macro hedges.\nLiquidity, Mining, and Halving Undercurrents\nOn-chain data reveal ETF custodians withdrawing coins from exchange wallets at the fastest pace since March 2024. Roughly 37,000 BTC left centralized exchanges during the week of heavy ETF inflows, reducing liquid supply to levels last seen before the January ETF approvals. With the next halving scheduled for April 2026, projected daily issuance will drop from 900 BTC to 450 BTC, amplifying the impact of each billion-dollar inflow on supply-demand equilibrium.\nMeanwhile, hash-rate efficiency continues to rise: the global network reached 718 EH/s, with major U.S. miners like Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT)** expanding operations by 15\u201320 percent QoQ**. These miners increasingly hold BTC on balance sheets, adding another layer of supply constriction.\nGlobal Adoption and ETF Spillover to Europe and Asia\nThe ETF success story is spreading beyond U.S. borders. European ETPs added $500 million AUM in September, led by 21Shares and CoinShares, while Hong Kong\u2019s CSOP Bitcoin ETF posted $43 million in weekly inflows, its best since launch. This cross-regional flow pattern confirms a coordinated institutional accumulation phase rather than an isolated U.S. phenomenon.\nAsian markets are particularly sensitive to the upcoming U.S. rate cycle; a dovish Fed improves liquidity for regional funds, enabling broader crypto allocations. If the Fed\u2019s next cut lands in November, as futures now price at 78 percent probability, these global ETFs could extend the rally across Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.\nMarket Psychology and Derivatives Data\nCME Bitcoin futures open interest surged to $8.6 billion, the highest since the 2021 peak, while perpetual funding rates remain neutral, implying the rally is spot-driven rather than purely leveraged. Options data from Deribit show skew collapsing to -3.1%, indicating traders are paying more for calls than puts\u2014an explicit bet on upside continuation. The $125,000 and $135,000 strike calls dominate open interest for October 25 expiry, reinforcing the market\u2019s short-term bullish bias.\nAnalyst Consensus and Forward Outlook\nThe institutional narrative has converged: ETF inflows have transformed Bitcoin\u2019s demand elasticity. Deutsche Bank recently reaffirmed its $150,000 year-end target, citing the asset\u2019s growing role in diversified reserve portfolios. JPMorgan and Citi echoed similar views, describing the ongoing phase as \u201cpre-parabolic.\u201d\nThe combination of ETF accumulation, supply compression, dovish policy expectations, and favorable seasonality leaves BTC-USD structurally bullish into Q4 2025. Volatility will remain elevated\u201414-day realized vol just crossed 48% \u2014but every corrective dip toward $118,000 appears met with institutional demand.\nVerdict: BUY \u2014 Structural Bull Market Intact\nAfter processing the full data landscape\u2014record ETF inflows ($3.24 billion), shrinking exchange supply (-37,000 BTC weekly), CME open interest ($8.6 billion), and rate-cut probability (78%)\u2014the signal remains unmistakably bullish. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is consolidating above $120,00"

This automated tool spreads large transactions over time to prevent sudden market disruptions.\nSponsoredEthereum Foundation\u2019s 17th ETH Sale This Year Renews Market Debate\nBy using TWAP, the Foundation aims to reduce price volatility, minimize slippage, and secure more balanced execution prices.\nInstitutional investors and crypto treasuries often rely on similar strategies to offload large holdings without triggering sharp price swings.\nAs a result, the proceeds will be converted into stablecoins to fund ongoing operations such as ecosystem research, developer grants, and community donations.\nAccording to the Foundation, this sale aligns with its broader strategy of managing its treasury more efficiently while leveraging DeFi tools.\nMeanwhile, according to data from the Strategic ETH Reserve, this marks the Foundation\u2019s 17th ETH sale in 2025.

                "source": "FinancialContent",
                "url": "https://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/article/marketminute-2025-10-4-crypto-market-roars-xrp-solana-and-ethereum-lead-a-bullish-charge-amidst-regulatory-clarity-and-institutional-inflows",
                "body": "The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a robust uptrend, with key digital assets XRP, Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) demonstrating significant bullish momentum as October 2025 unfolds. This resurgence is largely attributed to a confluence of factors, including newfound regulatory clarity in the United States and a palpable surge in institutional adoption, signaling a maturation of the digital asset landscape. Investors are witnessing a pivotal moment where traditional finance is increasingly intertwining with the decentralized world, propelling these major cryptocurrencies to new performance benchmarks and reshaping market expectations.\nThis positive sentiment has translated into impressive gains across the board. XRP has achieved a historic quarterly close, Solana continues its rapid expansion in decentralized finance, and Ethereum has broken key psychological barriers, showcasing its enduring dominance as a foundational blockchain. The collective performance of these assets indicates a broader market shift, moving past previous uncertainties and embracing a future where cryptocurrencies play a more integrated role in global financial systems. The immediate implications point towards sustained growth and increased mainstream acceptance, setting the stage for an exciting period in the digital economy.\nA Deep Dive into the Crypto Triumvirate: XRP, Solana, and Ethereum's Q3-Q4 2025 Surge\nThe third quarter of 2025 laid a strong foundation for the current bullish run, with early October continuing the momentum. XRP (XRP) concluded Q3 with its highest-ever quarterly close, hovering around $2.90, marking an impressive 28% gain for the quarter. This performance has been largely underpinned by a monumental shift in its regulatory standing. In August 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached a settlement with Ripple Labs (RPL), definitively reclassifying XRP as a utility token rather than a security. This landmark decision, further solidified by the SEC reportedly withdrawing its appeal, has removed a significant overhang that had plagued XRP for years, unleashing its growth potential. Adding to the fervor, the market is now eagerly anticipating SEC decisions on multiple spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) applications from major asset managers like Grayscale (GRYC), 21Shares (21S), WisdomTree (WT), Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton (FT), expected between October 18 and 25, 2025. Prediction markets are indicating a near-certainty of approval, which could unlock billions in institutional capital. Ripple's strategic moves, including the acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, further underscore its ambition to integrate deeply into institutional finance.\nSolana (SOL) has also been a standout performer, demonstrating robust bullish momentum with prices trading around $230-$235 in early October. The network saw its decentralized exchange (DEX) volume reach an astounding $326 billion in Q3 2025, a 21% increase quarter-over-quarter, consistently outperforming other major blockchains. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in Solana's DeFi ecosystem surged to $8.6 billion, reflecting its growing utility and adoption. A major catalyst for Solana's recent rally is the imminent launch of 24/7 Solana futures and options trading by the CME Group (CME) on October 13, 2025, which is set to significantly broaden global derivatives access for traditional investors. Furthermore, an SEC ruling on spot Solana ETFs is also anticipated this month, following the success of REX-Osprey's Solana Staking ETF ($SSK), which has already surpassed $500 million in assets under management (AUM). Technologically, Solana is preparing for key upgrades like Alpenglow Consensus and SIMD-0286, promising enhanced transaction finality and increased block capacity, further solidifying its position as a high-throughput blockchain.\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has equally commande"

                "body": "The U.S. financial markets are currently presenting a perplexing paradox. As of October 4, 2025, both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) have surged to unprecedented record highs, exhibiting remarkable resilience. This bullish momentum, however, unfolds against a backdrop of significant political turmoil: the federal government is in the midst of its fourth day of a shutdown, the first in seven years, due to protracted budget disagreements between Congress and the White House. This striking divergence underscores a market increasingly driven by robust corporate fundamentals and strategic optimism, seemingly impervious to the immediate political instability emanating from Washington D.C., though underlying concerns continue to simmer beneath the surface.\nThis unusual market behavior highlights a growing disconnect between political machinations and investor sentiment, suggesting that market participants are either confident in a swift resolution to the government shutdown or are prioritizing other economic indicators. The record-setting performance of major indices points to a deeply rooted strength in specific sectors and an overarching belief in the long-term trajectory of the American economy, even as the gears of government grind to a halt.\nUnpacking the Market's Unfazed Ascent Amidst Washington's Impasse\nAs of October 3, 2025, the S&P 500 closed at an impressive 6,715.79, having touched an all-time high of 6,754.26 earlier in the month, and marking a fresh intraday record just two days prior. This robust performance contributed to a 3.5% gain for the index in September\u2014its best September since 2010\u2014and a 1.1% advance for the week ending October 3, culminating in a remarkable 14% year-to-date increase. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 46,758.28 on October 3, also reaching a new all-time high alongside the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The DJIA posted a 0.5% gain on October 3 and a 1% increase for the week, pushing its year-to-date growth to 10%.\nThis market exuberance is occurring precisely as the U.S. federal government entered its fourth day of a shutdown on October 4, 2025. The shutdown, which began on October 1, is the first in seven years and the third under President Donald Trump's administration. It stems from an intractable budget dispute where Senate Democrats rejected a House funding bill that notably omitted extensions for Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which are slated to expire at the end of 2025. Reports indicate that President Trump\u2019s administration has frozen funds for Democratic-led states, a move that some Republicans fear could prolong the stalemate. Consequently, non-essential government services have ceased, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees are either furloughed or working without pay. A significant immediate concern for the financial community is the delay in the release of crucial economic data, such as the September jobs report and the consumer price index, creating an \"economic data blackout\" that complicates decision-making for both investors and the Federal Reserve. Despite these disruptions, the market's initial reaction has been largely one of resilience, with investors seemingly compartmentalizing the political drama from their investment decisions, at least in the short term.\nCorporate Fortunes: Winners and Losers in a Divided Landscape\nThe current market environment, characterized by record highs amidst political uncertainty, creates a distinct landscape of winners and losers among public companies. Companies with strong fundamentals, particularly those in sectors less directly reliant on immediate government spending or regulatory clarity, are poised to benefit. Technology giants, for instance, continue to be significant drivers of market growth. Companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are often seen as resilient due to their global revenue streams and robust innovation pipeli"

That move not only provided tariff relief for Pfizer but stoked optimism for the whole sector, especially as hints emerged about similar deals possibly being struck by other pharmaceutical giants. Merck KGaA climbed over 10%, and Bayer rose nearly 5%, showing just how much investors liked the news. Meanwhile, new Eurostat data showed eurozone annual inflation ticked up to 2.2% in September, mainly due to higher energy prices \u2013 though ING expects those pressures to ease soon. On the flip side, Germany\u2019s manufacturing PMI slipped to 49.5, signaling continued weakness and fading demand in a key sector.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Healthcare delivers a dose of optimism.\nThe upbeat momentum from Pfizer\u2019s deal has given healthcare stocks a much-needed boost, pushing the DAX higher even as concerns linger about inflation and a sluggish manufacturing sector. Big moves for Merck KGaA and Bayer suggest investors see more opportunities for pharma firms to benefit from public partnerships and tariff relief. But with inflation stubborn and Germany\u2019s factories still struggling, the European Central Bank is likely to stay cautious on rate hikes \u2013 which could keep steady, defensive sectors like healthcare in the spotlight.\nThe bigger picture: Markets balance growth and caution.\nGermany\u2019s latest data paints a picture of an economy pulled in two directions \u2013 solid gains for healthcare, ongoing softness in manufacturing. Rising energy prices have lifted headline inflation, but core inflation isn\u2019t running wild, which supports the case for the ECB to pause on rate increases.

                "body": "Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) jumps 5.0% this week, though earnings growth is still tracking behind five-year shareholder returns\nIf you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the Bentley Systems, Incorporated (NASDAQ:BSY) share price is 81% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. It's also good to see that the stock is up 13% in a year.\nSince it's been a strong week for Bentley Systems shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nOver half a decade, Bentley Systems managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 13%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nWe know that Bentley Systems has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Bentley Systems' financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.\nWhat About Dividends?\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Bentley Systems the TSR over the last 5 years was 85%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nA Different Perspective\nBentley Systems provided a TSR of 13% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 13% per year over five year. It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Bentley Systems better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with Bentley Systems , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."

(NASDAQ:MVIS) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 28% in the last month. But that is small recompense for the exasperating returns over three years. Tragically, the share price declined 58% in that time. So it's good to see it climbing back up. After all, could be that the fall was overdone.\nWhile the last three years has been tough for MicroVision shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns.\nBecause MicroVision made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one would hope for good top-line growth to make up for the lack of earnings.\nIn the last three years, MicroVision saw its revenue grow by 43% per year, compound. That is faster than most pre-profit companies. The share price has moved in quite the opposite direction, down 16% over that time, a bad result. It seems likely that the market is worried about the continual losses. When we see revenue growth, paired with a falling share price, we can't help wonder if there is an opportunity for those who are willing to dig deeper.\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIf you are thinking of buying or selling MicroVision stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.\nA Different Perspective\nMicroVision's TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 18%.

Applied Materials, a heavyweight in chip equipment, warned of a $600 million hit to 2026 revenue, spooking the broader semiconductor space and putting pressure on tech shares. Tesla\u2019s 1.4% share drop helped push the Nasdaq lower, while elsewhere, USA Rare Earth soared more than 14% after its CEO highlighted close ties to the White House, hinting at possible government support. Still, optimism was checked by uncertainty as a US government shutdown stretched into its third day, delaying key jobs reports and clouding the economic picture. Recent soft labor data and a falling ISM services employment index have intensified debate over whether the Federal Reserve will cut rates, especially as inflation stays stubbornly above target.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Investors find hope in defensive stocks.\nUtilities led the charge as investors sought safe ground, while tech\u2019s stumble brought a cautious mood despite record-setting main indexes. Higher-than-normal trading activity and more winners than losers on both the NYSE and Nasdaq suggest confidence is holding up\u2014for now. But with the government shutdown stalling key economic updates, markets are navigating without a compass until the data landscape clears up.\nThe bigger picture: Economic uncertainty clouds the rally.\nMomentum still favors bulls as the S&P 500 and Dow press higher, but political gridlock threatens to derail economic transparency and policymaking. Delayed labor data and wait-and-see Fed attitudes complicate economic projections and strategy. While investors are celebrating new highs, unsettled risks could easily shape where the market heads next.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nWeekly Brief\nSt\u00e9phane Renevier, CFA \u2022 about 7 hours ago\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

                "body": "TORONTO -- Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s playoff career before Saturday was not befitting a $500 million franchise cornerstone. The Toronto Blue Jays first baseman managed just three hits in 25 plate appearances and didn't hit a ball over the fence across six games. More important, the six games, split into two-game slices over three postseasons, were all Blue Jays losses.\nThat all flipped in a 10-1 win over the Yankees, the franchise he has long openly despised, in Game 1 of the American League Division Series on Saturday.\nStarring in front of a raucous Rogers Centre crowd hungry for playoff baseball, Guerrero delivered an all-around clinic in the Blue Jays' first playoff win since Game 4 of the 2016 AL Championship Series with a diving catch and three hits to fuel an offensive explosion.\n\"He's the face of our franchise and a big reason why we go, a big part of why we're here,\" Blue Jays starter Kevin Gausman said. \"So it's been nice to see him have the night that he had.\"\nAt the plate, Guerrero swatted his first career postseason home run and finished 3-for-4 with two RBIs and a run scored to fuel an offense that pounded 14 hits, including three home runs and three doubles. Defensively, his diving catch of Ryan McMahon's lineout at first base -- while a bat shard whizzed by him -- initiated an inning-ending double play in the second.\nBlue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk complemented Guerrero's effort with his first two career postseason home runs. Right fielder Nathan Lukes contributed two hits, including a two-run double, with three RBIs and a diving catch down the right-field line. Shortstop Andres Gimenez went 2-for-4 as the Blue Jays chased Luis Gil after 2\u2154 innings and forced the Yankees to use six pitchers.\n\"I think having him get the scoring going, the double play at first with McMahon, it's nice,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said of Guerrero. \"It gives you a little bit of a jolt because it's Vlad and what he means to this team.\"\nGuerrero did not waste time in providing that energy, swatting a 90 mph changeup from Gil in the first inning to give the Blue Jays a lead they wouldn't relinquish. He added singles in the second and eighth innings and a sacrifice fly in the Blue Jays' game-busting four-run seventh, igniting the sellout crowd on a gorgeous day in Ontario with the building's roof open.\nThat it happened against the Yankees was fitting. Guerrero's dislike of the Yankees, he has said, dates back to two incidents over two decades ago: the Yankees pulling a contract offer for his father, a Hall of Fame outfielder, in 2003 and Yankee Stadium security telling his father to take him off the field when he was a boy.\n\"For me, I bring the same energy every game regardless who I'm playing, especially now in the playoffs,\" Guerrero said. \"That's all I've got on my mind is to go out there and play hard.\"\nWhatever his motivation, the five-time All-Star has enjoyed facing the Yankees during his seven-year career. Entering Saturday's matchup -- the first ever between the two clubs in the postseason -- Guerrero was batting .302 with 22 home runs and an 0.918 OPS in 102 career games opposite the Yankees.\nHe improved those gaudy numbers Saturday, adding another highlight reel to a year that began with him committing to Toronto with a 14-year, $500 million contract extension in April and that he hopes ends with the franchise's first championship since 1993 later this month.\n\"For me, my goal always is to win a World Series, to bring the World Series here,\" Guerrero said. \"My father, he never had the chance to win a World Series. That's one of my goals, always been one of my goals, to do that for me, for him.\""

                "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/04/health/hhs-vaccine-safety-research-grant",
                "body": "About 90 seconds into his presentation on Covid-19 vaccine safety at a closely watched meeting of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month, Dr. Bruce Carleton made a startling revelation: The government grant supporting his research had been abruptly terminated.\nThe statement was surprising for a few reasons. Carleton had been asked to share his findings with a group entirely put in place by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after Kennedy summarily dismissed all 17 previous experts on the committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP, in June. In its first two meetings, the newly composed committee has shown an outsized interest in vaccine safety, in line with Kennedy\u2019s frequent protest that he\u2019s \u201cnot anti-vaccine; I am pro-safety.\u201d\nYet Kennedy\u2019s HHS canceled a major CDC grant focused on the subject in March, curtailing Carleton\u2019s work to understand genetic drivers of rare vaccine safety risks.\n\u201cThey canceled [a grant to study] vaccine safety, and yet now we\u2019re talking about vaccine safety,\u201d Carleton later told CNN.\nCarleton\u2019s statement in the meeting was also surprising because, almost immediately, an HHS spokesperson denied that it was true.\n\u201cFYI \u2013 as you see below, we did not cancel the grant,\u201d HHS Director of Communications Andrew Nixon said in an email to reporters during the ACIP meeting, providing a link to the grant information on the agency\u2019s website.\nNixon noted that the grant\u2019s \u201cperiod of performance\u201d ended March 25. The website, though, shows a negative subtotal of more than $2 million, suggesting money allocated to the grant that was unspent. Paperwork ending the grant shared with CNN states that \u201cthe purpose of this amendment is to terminate this award.\u201d And it\u2019s included on an HHS list of terminated grants.\n\u201cThe grant was canceled,\u201d said Dr. Steven Black, the primary investigator of the project and co-director of the Global Vaccine Data Network, which received the award and supported Carleton\u2019s work. It \u201cwas supposed to run for more than a year after that.\u201d\nNixon didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.\nStudying rare vaccine risks\nThe idea of harnessing data from multiple countries to assess rare vaccine safety risks came about long before the Covid-19 pandemic; the playbook was established more than a decade earlier, for vaccines targeting the 2009 H1N1 flu, said Dr. Frank DeStefano, who was head of the CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office from 2009 to 2021.\nFinland, and then several other European countries, detected an increased risk of narcolepsy, or excessive daytime sleepiness, after the rollout of 2009 flu vaccines, and the CDC funded a multinational study to look at the issue, DeStefano told CNN. The connection was never detected in the US, and an association remained only in Sweden in the CDC\u2019s study; DeStefano noted it still remains somewhat of a mystery.\n\u201cWe learned a lot from that project,\u201d DeStefano said. \u201cWe developed some of the methodology to be able to align data systems for different countries, establish standardized case definitions and how to gather the data so it could be analyzed comparably from different countries.\u201d\nSo as billions of people were being vaccinated against Covid-19 in 2021, DeStefano and others reached for that playbook again; the CDC awarded $5.6 million to the Global Vaccine Data Network in April 2021 and an additional $4.5 million in 2022, for a total of a planned $10.1 million through April 2026, according to Black.\n\u201cWe wanted a big database, covering the different vaccines and different populations,\u201d DeStefano said. \u201cOne that would be able to detect these rare adverse events sooner.\u201d\nMyocarditis, or heart inflammation, emerged as a rare risk of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines as they were rolled out broadly, with the risk most pronounced in teenage boys and young men. It also was found to be a risk of infection with the coronavirus itself. People who experienced it after vaccination typical"

The sector came under pressure starting in May when demand from traditional investors dried up, support from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) faded, and fears of growing fiscal deficits started to emerge.\nFollowing Ishiba\u2019s declaration that he would resign, the 30-year JGB yield soared to a staggering 3.285% on September 8, and has since lingered around those highs.\nThey also expect, for now, a growing resistance to higher policy rates, although investors are more wary that any of Takaichi\u2019s policies may weigh down on already heavy government debt.\nThe fiscal outlook worsened as Ishiba\u2019s coalition lost its majority in both houses of parliament, creating opportunities for opposition parties to propose tax cuts and higher spending, two measures that risk reinforcing fiscal slippage.\nYen faces conflicting pressures\nThe Japanese currency finished Friday at 147.44 per dollar, marking its biggest weekly rally since mid-May.\nBut analysts see renewed weakness in the dollar if investors sense that Takaichi\u2019s administration will either slow the pace of further rate hikes or try to exert pressure on the BOJ\u2019s course of tightening.\nTakaichi, after winning her LDP post, said the government and Bank of Japan must \u201ccoordinate closely\u201d to create inflation supported by wage increases and corporate profits.\nJapan is already in the process of years of long-awaited normalisation under BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, incrementally tightening interest rates and reducing the central bank balance sheet after a chronically ultra-loose policy stretching decad"
